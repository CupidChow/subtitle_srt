00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,280
(EXchange 4)

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,020
(Episode 14: X's X)

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,320
It's my first time traveling to Tokyo.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,750
It's your first time?

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,760
You can barely be seen.

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,990
- Your face can barely be seen.
- It's okay if it doesn't.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,730
I should go higher.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,970
(In-flight announcement)

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,270
What did he say?

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,110
He wants us to put seatbelts on.

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,279
- Really?
- Really.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Is that so?

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,549
Did you turn it on airplane mode?

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,580
Oh, right.

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,310
You're not a flight attendant, are you?

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,690
It's fascinating.

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,990
What's your real job?

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,089
- This wasn't available.
- The phone here is expensive.

30
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,299
I've had many flights before,

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,930
but to sit with him on the plane...

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,870
means we have to stay close to each other.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,070
It felt really different from my usual flight.

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,080
I was really happy that I could...

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,010
travel with her.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,020
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik, pick-a-date to Japan)

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,889
- Go ahead.
- What?

38
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,960
You should go ahead.

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,390
Be careful.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,040
- It didn't hit your hand, right?
- No.

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,810
I was going to ask you to show me your passport photo.

42
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,309
- Show me yours.
- Me? Why? I can't.

43
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,149
Why not? You don't have it?

44
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,579
- I do.
- Let me see.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,079
No. Show me yours first.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,550
No, seriously. Show me yours first.

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,019
(Yoo Sik took out his passport first.)

48
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,860
- Your passport is new.
- Yes.

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,499
Recently... No, not recently. I renewed it 3 or 4 years ago.

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,060
- Come on.
- I got it renewed. Why?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
- Then it should look fine.
- No.

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,000
It doesn't look good.

53
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,959
Why not? You can see mine, but I can't?

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,730
- Your photo looks really good.
- No, it doesn't.

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,269
It doesn't look good.

56
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,200
You look really good in it.

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,440
Aren't you hungry?

58
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,870
A little.

59
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,180
Why do I feel so hungry when I'm with you?

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,880
I didn't feel hungry when I was at home.

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,580
Me too.

62
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,949
No, I eat too much.

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,350
- Me?
- No, I eat a lot...

64
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,790
when I'm with you.

65
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,760
It's okay. You should eat whatever you want to eat.

66
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,390
What is that?

67
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,130
Isn't that a Ferris wheel?

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Is it a theme park?

69
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,299
It really is a theme park.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,300
I know.

71
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,370
(Yokohama)

72
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,950
- Shall we?
- I can't wait to get on it.

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,250
I'll look forward to it.

74
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,430
Why?

75
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,630
Go straight?

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
I don't know.

77
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,699
You don't have fear of heights, do you?

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Not at all.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,830
Not at all?

80
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,740
- I'm not scared of heights at all.
- Seriously.

81
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,740
I'd never wanted to get on a Ferris wheel.

82
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,480
Because Hyeon Ji said she wanted to get on it,

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
I wanted to get on it too.

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,180
Gosh, seriously!

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,049
(Getting on the Ferris wheel they were looking forward to)

86
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,419
- I'll sit here.
- I really...

87
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,960
Here? Sit here.

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Does it move backward?

89
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,569
(They sat next to each other on a shaking Ferris wheel.)

90
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,970
- Did it shake because of me?
- I don't know.

91
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,250
It goes up really high.

92
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,649
Doesn't it feel like it's tilted toward you?

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,450
- Should I sit there?
- No.

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
What is it?

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,590
- You want to see?
- Yes.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,460
(Sitting close)

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,930
Are you scared?

98
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,110
I looked outside for no reason.

99
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,910
It wasn't awkward on the plane,

100
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,650
but that space felt somewhat awkward.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,750
I can't really remember what we talked about.

102
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,520
The Ferris wheel shook when I moved even a little.

103
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,730
We sat next to each other very carefully.

104
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,530
I was really happy. Really.

105
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,239
- Really? That much?
- What was that?

106
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,969
- He looked the brightest...
- He gave me chills.

107
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,409
- out of all his interview footage.
- For the first time.

108
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,439
His heart must be fluttering.

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,980
They look good together too.

110
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,380
Gosh, I'll stay still for real.

111
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,920
It's tilting toward me too much. It's shaking too much.

112
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,620
Say hello.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,629
Why does going down feel so fast?

114
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,670
I know.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,769
Going down feels way too fast.

116
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,470
I know. Slow down.

117
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,620
They have wine too.

118
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,389
- I'm hungry.
- Are you?

119
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,789
- What?
- It's such a fancy restaurant.

120
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,860
(They came to eat at a restaurant floating on the sea.)

121
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,499
It'd have been really beautiful if it was a little clearer.

122
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
For real.

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,750
- Can I take a photo?
- A photo? Yes, please.

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,590
You want me to take a photo of you?

125
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,990
No, a photo of the food. This one.

126
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,260
Why are you so taken aback?

127
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,190
(They left a photo of the first dish they had together in Yokohama.)

128
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,229
- Did you take it?
- Yes.

129
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,230
That's a good one.

130
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,330
- I think it's sea urchin.
- Sea urchin corn pudding?

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,030
It's good.

132
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,900
It's a good thing I didn't eat a lot on the plane.

133
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,140
I almost scraped it clean.

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,809
I thought you didn't like desserts.

135
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,810
- Me?
- Yes.

136
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,610
My lies will be revealed 1 by 1.

137
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,250
When I call you,

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,690
I keep saying Ms. Hyeon Ji.

139
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,320
Jae Hyeong calls me really casually.

140
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,220
- Really?
- "You, Hyeon Ji..."

141
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,260
I was going to ask you how I should address you.

142
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,240
Jae Hyeong calls you casually?

143
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,370
Calling me "you" is a little...

144
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,880
I'll just call you by your first name.

145
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,949
Why are you laughing so brightly?

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,850
- I laughed brightly?
- Yes.

147
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,420
I found him cute.

148
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,660
Do you want to drink?

149
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,210
Shall we go?

150
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,409
- They've definitely gotten close.
- Yes.

151
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,779
- They've gotten close.
- Totally.

152
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,379
They're more comfortable around each other.

153
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,379
- They have their own energy.
- Yes.

154
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,679
And heart-fluttering moments.

155
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,989
- They're lovey-dovey.
- The looks in their eyes...

156
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,289
- have definitely changed.
- Right.

157
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,889
The way they look at each other.

158
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,389
Everyone's excitement doubled in Japan.

159
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,259
Traveling abroad certainly gives you a boost.

160
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,899
- It really does.
- It did.

161
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,730
I should go to Kamakura too.

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
I feel so reassured.

163
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm moved that I can travel with two guys.

164
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,369
It'll be more fun to travel with a group.

165
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,410
That's right.

166
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,540
I hope a lot of fun things happen.

167
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,240
I think this is just the beginning.

168
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,880
- That's true.
- Totally.

169
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,620
A date in Japan?

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,880
I think it'll be really exciting.

171
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,649
- It leaves stronger impressions.
- That's right.

172
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,650
I think so.

173
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,790
- I think it'll be intense.
- Really?

174
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,519
I can't wait to have delicious food.

175
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,630
I know. I want to get there already.

176
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,259
- I really like Japanese dango.
- Tell me about it.

177
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,529
When I arrive in Japan,

178
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,529
- I'll make sure to have dango.
- What's dango?

179
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,530
- Dango is...
- Something sweet.

180
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,299
- No, I meant dango.
- Dango?

181
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,969
Not something sweet, but dango?

182
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,999
What is dango?

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,140
- I've never heard of it.
- It looks like rice cake.

184
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,739
The ones sold in convenience stores are delicious too.

185
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,179
The ones from street stalls are good too.

186
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,649
Then I should have the ones that Min Kyung recommends.

187
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,149
- I know.
- I'll recommend them all.

188
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,049
There's this ramyeon I like.

189
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,819
- I want to have that ramyeon too.
- Okay.

190
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,649
And we should have beer too.

191
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,389
I want to go to an izakaya and have skewers also.

192
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,719
I'm suddenly feeling happy.

193
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,090
- I think it'll be really nice.
- I was happy before,

194
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,890
- Seriously.
- but I'm happier now.

195
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,259
I think this is the brightest smile I've seen on you.

196
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,399
Yes, I'm really happy...

197
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,100
because I've sorted out my thoughts.

198
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,669
- You have?
- Yes.

199
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,870
- That's good.
- That's good.

200
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,640
So I decided to leave all those feelings in Seoul.

201
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,140
Leave them all in Seoul...

202
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,910
- and have a new mindset in Japan.
- Yes, totally.

203
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,780
(Letting go of old feelings and traveling with a fresh mindset)

204
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,220
Let's go.

205
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,720
Let's go. Yes!

206
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,159
It has a selfie mode too.

207
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,289
(While Jae Hyeong is away for a second)

208
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,330
That's it.

209
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

210
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,370
- You must be going on a trip.
- Yes, I'm going to Japan.

211
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
How do you feel?

212
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,039
The person I considered until the end was Woo Jin,

213
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,839
and I thought...

214
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,039
we'd be able to talk about the things...

215
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,080
we couldn't before in more detail if we were alone.

216
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,780
It was a little disappointing.

217
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,120
While Jae Hyeong was away for a second,

218
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,120
I told this to Woo Jin first.

219
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,689
I'm regretting it a little.

220
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,959
- Oh, really?
- I should've said my pick was you.

221
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,300
- You regret not picking me?
- Yes.

222
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,499
I thought it'd be nice...

223
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
- to have dates with you more.
- Really?

224
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,969
If female participants get a chance to pick again,

225
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,610
- let's have fun together.
- Sounds good.

226
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,110
Jae Hyeong is here. Let's film us, Jae Hyeong.

227
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,409
The three of us are being filmed.

228
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,050
(Trying to make memories among themselves, promising another date)

229
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,880
- Let's take photos in the booth.
- I'd love that.

230
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,620
Should I do something like this? Linking arms.

231
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,950
Your arm.

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,930
How shall we pose?

233
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,159
(When Min Kyung poses,)

234
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,069
(the two men follow.)

235
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,970
I couldn't hold still because it was funny.

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,870
- I like it.
- It turned out well. I love it.

237
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,640
In a hurry!

238
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,140
We're off to Japan.

239
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,540
How do you feel?

240
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,409
- Our first trip.
- I'm happy...

241
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,810
that my first trip to Japan is with you.

242
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,450
Thank you.

243
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,620
Two, three.

244
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,849
It must be fun to travel in a group like that.

245
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,419
- Of course.
- It's like a trip with friends.

246
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,890
It's only fun.

247
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,329
- Right.
- Who knows?

248
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,699
They could fall for each other while traveling.

249
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,730
That's true.

250
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,740
Isn't the station really cute?

251
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,740
That's Kamakura Station?

252
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,139
I want to take a photo of it.

253
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,410
I should take one with my phone.

254
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,280
So this is Kamakura.

255
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,490
It's really cute.

256
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,920
It's so cute.

257
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,790
I thought the station would be...

258
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,590
- I thought it'd be really big.
- kind of big.

259
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,470
- We're really in Japan.
- Seriously.

260
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,530
We're in Japan.

261
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,140
Is that a yakiniku place? Or not?

262
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,569
It could look like that...

263
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,940
- because you want barbecue.
- I know.

264
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,210
It's so pretty.

265
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,980
It's so cozy and charming.

266
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,550
I know. It's so nice.

267
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,020
I love the sound of water.

268
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,450
- They're serving our beer.
- Gosh.

269
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,720
Nice.

270
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,760
- Shall we clink our mugs?
- Cheers.

271
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,870
- Our 1st beer in Japan. Drink it.
- Our 1st beer in Japan.

272
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,680
- I only had the foam.
- Me too.

273
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,210
- Did you have the foam too?
- He had the foam only.

274
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,080
- No.
- You had the foam? You drank a lot.

275
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,249
This is beef.

276
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,520
(Okonomiyaki batter is served.)

277
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,660
Here.

278
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,430
Oh, they make it for us.

279
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,139
Wait for seven minutes.

280
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,640
- Seven minutes?
- Oh, okay.

281
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,410
What do you suppose the others are doing?

282
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,679
The others?

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,810
They must be having fun.

284
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,079
I guess. Everyone must be in Japan now.

285
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,450
Yes, they must be here.

286
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,449
We're probably the ones who eat the best.

287
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,520
- I know. I'm eating so well.
- For real.

288
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,960
Yesterday,

289
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,860
you said you sorted out your thoughts.

290
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,860
Whether you want to meet your ex again or see a new person.

291
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,469
Does it mean you've made up your mind on one side?

292
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,429
That's right. When I talked with my ex,

293
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,699
there was a part where we couldn't understand each other.

294
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,010
- With your ex?
- Yes.

295
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,679
I thought nothing would move forward...

296
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,750
if we kept this up.

297
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,409
And it'd be better if I could...

298
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,819
talk to others more comfortably.

299
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,019
That's the thought I had.

300
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,249
I wanted to be more open...

301
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,359
and behave in that direction.

302
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,060
I felt sure about that.

303
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,830
- Let's clink our mugs.
- Cheers.

304
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,930
What about you, Woo Jin? How do you feel now?

305
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,030
I also feel like how Min Kyung does.

306
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,310
My mixed feelings became clearer.

307
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,079
So, whatever it is, I'm thinking of going...

308
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,850
in the direction I want, even if it doesn't work out.

309
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,119
- Doesn't now seem like that period?
- That's right.

310
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,320
You two must feel the same way.

311
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,449
You're not sure yet, but it's somewhat decided.

312
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,720
I've figured out what my heart wants. That's about it.

313
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,890
What about you, Jae Hyeong? You didn't have much time.

314
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,660
I've settled on my direction.

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,029
Is there a woman...

316
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,070
you're leaning toward, even just a little?

317
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,200
Yes, there is.

318
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,110
You two should talk.

319
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,010
Yes, I should.

320
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,949
- Gosh, it's hot.
- Are you okay?

321
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,519
- Eat the meat first.
- Yes.

322
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,119
- I think we can eat.
- I don't think this is cooked yet.

323
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
- You can have this one here.
- Really?

324
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,420
Thank you for the food.

325
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,190
You keep making sure that we eat.

326
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,020
That's because I'm holding the tongs.

327
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,130
You can eat it now.

328
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,769
It's more delicious than the one I had in Korea.

329
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,040
Really? I guess you can't beat the taste of the local.

330
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,079
It's good, right?

331
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,150
- Eat your fill.
- Okay.

332
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,889
Min Kyung, is there anyone you're curious about...

333
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,020
or interested in?

334
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Yes.

335
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,820
- There is.
- That's good.

336
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,200
It'd be nice to have more dates with him.

337
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,660
I do have someone in mind whom I could talk more to.

338
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,969
Are you thinking of going to him directly...

339
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,439
and say you want to have a date and more talks with him?

340
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,500
I did tell him.

341
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,000
- Really?
- Yes.

342
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,180
What kind of date do you want to have in Japan?

343
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,589
(Jae Hyeong realized where Min Kyung's heart is at.)

344
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,159
- I want to go shopping.
- What is it?

345
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,630
- Nothing.
- Or look around.

346
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,059
- Right.
- Don't you think...

347
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,029
it'd be nice even if you do something trivial here?

348
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,200
- That's right.
- Seriously.

349
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,169
- You're really good, though.
- Me?

350
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,269
He's definitely different because...

351
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,770
- It's not that I'm good.
- he's in the restaurant business.

352
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,010
- You're awesome.
- I'm not.

353
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,970
This is why he's liked.

354
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,440
- By whom?
- Me.

355
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,679
- I know.
- Right.

356
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,380
(Min Kyung felt guilty for no reason.)

357
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,779
We did order so much.

358
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,420
- You're right. I didn't know.
- Right?

359
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,660
You're good.

360
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,390
- You two have a good time.
- Goodness.

361
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,829
What?

362
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,329
- Restroom?
- I'm going to use the restroom.

363
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,529
(Jae Hyeong leaves them for a while.)

364
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,900
- Talk to each other a lot.
- I should mix this.

365
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,800
Are you the type...

366
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,370
who talks more...

367
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,980
than your partner?

368
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,080
I think so.

369
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,349
What about you?

370
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,710
I'm the type who listens.

371
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,650
I'm like that.

372
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,090
- That's so like you.
- I... Yes.

373
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,720
I like indulging their whining.

374
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,960
I think I like someone I can lean on.

375
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,000
Someone you can lean on?

376
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,070
When I meet a woman, I'm the type...

377
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,639
to be a little cutesy.

378
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,669
- I thought so.
- Really?

379
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,670
- Totally.
- Why did you think so?

380
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:03,940
You just felt like that.

381
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,349
You give off that playful vibe...

382
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,409
when you're uplifted.

383
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,650
- I do?
- Yes.

384
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,349
Why does he keep smiling?

385
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,489
What? Because you two are having a good time.

386
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,090
(Jae Hyeong is pleased.)

387
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,060
- What was that?
- I laughed at you guys.

388
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,730
This is hilarious. Goodness.

389
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,130
I'm usually this bright.

390
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,870
For 2 to 3 days, I've been very depressed.

391
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,510
Everyone saw me and immediately went, "Are you okay?"

392
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,539
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- "Are you okay?"

393
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,610
- Really? I'm sorry. Oh, no.
- From what I've observed,

394
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,809
Min Kyung is fine during the day.

395
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,680
But in the evening, her facial expression is different.

396
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,089
Her eyes are always closed.

397
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,589
- That's right.
- She seems pensive.

398
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,690
You're the same.

399
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,859
- Min Kyung isn't the only one.
- Woo Jin,

400
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,089
people go,

401
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,630
- "Woo Jin has lost so much weight." - I mean...

402
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,730
I've lost so much weight.

403
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,969
- I can see that.
- Seriously.

404
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,000
Eat.

405
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,299
Eat up. Eat 100 dangos.

406
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,310
Seriously.

407
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,040
I had so much fun today.

408
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,510
Seriously. I kept having a therapeutic experience.

409
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,220
You look better in Japan...

410
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,620
- than you did in the house.
- That's right.

411
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,220
You're much more charming when you're cheerful.

412
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,020
Those are some kind words.

413
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,159
- Seriously.
- Shall we finish our drinks?

414
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,830
- Okay. Cheers.
- Cheers.

415
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,800
Nice to meet you.

416
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,069
- Let's take a selfie together.
- A selfie?

417
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,240
I'll go to the middle.

418
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,079
- Shall we go?
- Thank you for the food.

419
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Thank you for the food.

420
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,449
It took a different approach.

421
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,679
- There was more than friendship.
- I know.

422
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,419
- We saw it as a friendship trip, - That's right.

423
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,049
but there was something between Min Kyung...

424
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,050
- and Woo Jin.
- My heart fluttered.

425
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,649
Perhaps she feels okay...

426
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,219
because Yoo Sik is out of her sight.

427
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,059
- That's right.
- Min Kyung said...

428
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,830
that she made up her mind to leave things behind...

429
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,730
in Seoul.

430
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,800
I hope she'll get better.

431
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,600
I think it depends on how Min Kyung changes.

432
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,369
I think we should give our best...

433
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,639
- Right.
- to the current situation.

434
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,779
Don't get your feelings hurt.

435
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,080
- Okay.
- Good luck. I'm serious.

436
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,080
Spending the whole day with you guys made me feel comfortable.

437
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,179
I wonder how the day went for other people.

438
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,850
I bet they didn't become comfortable.

439
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,490
- Really?
- Maybe.

440
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,320
This place is very pretty.

441
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,260
- The location of the lodging...
- It's insane.

442
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,200
Look over there. It must be right in front of the sea.

443
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,999
- You're right.
- It's the sea.

444
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,070
It's my first time seeing the sea in Japan.

445
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,100
The lodging is right in front of the sea.

446
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,069
- You're right.
- It's so nice.

447
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,940
Love is bound to blossom here.

448
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,140
- Seriously.
- I'll fall in love here.

449
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,610
I'll root for you.

450
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,979
I'm excited.

451
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,780
(Woo Jin, Jae Hyeong, and Min Kyung arrive at the lodging.)

452
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,950
We're here.

453
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,560
Thank you.

454
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,460
- This must be the place.
- Go right.

455
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,059
- Which way?
- This is incredible.

456
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,030
- What?
- What? The view is amazing.

457
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,899
This is incredible.

458
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,770
(Malibu Hotel)

459
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,290
It's so nice.

460
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,729
It's right in front of the sea.

461
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,889
The lodging is insane.

462
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,499
I thought the Pyeongchang-dong House was nice,

463
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,999
but they rented out the entire hotel.

464
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,099
- The entire hotel?
- Really?

465
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,640
They rented out the entire hotel.

466
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,869
That means they will be many more hidden spots.

467
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,370
Those benches caught my eyes.

468
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,909
I saw many spots that were suitable...

469
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,239
- for the nighttime arguments.
- That's right.

470
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,110
- "Come on out." - Seriously.

471
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
You noticed those spots first.

472
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,280
Things will go insane here.

473
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,990
It's the best.

474
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,059
I think this is the shared kitchen and living room.

475
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,120
Right?

476
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,529
(The shared space of the Kamakura House...)

477
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,530
(where the residents will gather around)

478
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,530
It's nice.

479
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
It's really nice.

480
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,009
This place is so nice.

481
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,740
I know. I can't believe we'll live here.

482
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,480
Gosh, today is the day.

483
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,680
Will a new person come today?

484
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,550
(He immediately checks the number of the forks.)

485
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,090
How many are there? You're counting, right?

486
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,219
- There are 14.
- Really?

487
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,959
Why would there be 14 forks?

488
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,120
Will three people come?

489
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,060
- Maybe not.
- Isn't it too late?

490
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,060
Why do I feel nervous?

491
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I'm excited.

492
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,500
- Are you excited?
- Yes.

493
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,640
(Another van pulls up.)

494
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,110
Someone is coming.

495
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,609
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik arrive second.)

496
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,680
Hi.

497
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
- Hi.
- Hi.

498
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,950
- It's good to see you guys.
- Welcome, Yoo Sik.

499
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,480
- Hi.
- Hi, Hyeon Ji.

500
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,690
Everyone looks tired.

501
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,530
When I saw the two of them enter together,

502
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,160
I really felt...

503
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,830
a bit dejected.

504
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,240
I thought, "It was Hyeon Ji as I had guessed."

505
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,110
I thought, "Coming to Japan together..."

506
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,080
"might have a significant meaning."

507
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,210
- We're here.
- I'll sit here.

508
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,189
(Yoo Sik sits far from Min Kyung.)

509
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,520
Do my eyes look bad?

510
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,990
- They look fine like this, right?
- No, they look a bit bad.

511
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,730
- Gosh.
- Really? Oh, no.

512
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,830
Hold on. When...

513
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,769
you look at someone, don't do this.

514
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,570
Do this instead.

515
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,440
Show the left side of your face.

516
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,780
Look to the left in a coy way.

517
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,039
- Then it won't be obvious.
- I see.

518
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,250
I thought, "They must've had a fun date."

519
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,680
It looked like they had gotten a bit closer.

520
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,549
- I think it's edible.
- It's fake.

521
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,620
- I think it's fake.
- It's edible.

522
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,089
Don't eat it. No.

523
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,290
No. It's fake.

524
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,990
- It's real.
- It's real.

525
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,500
- I think I'll die if I eat it.
- Really?

526
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Seriously.

527
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
When will everyone come?

528
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,810
- Why is this place so nice?
- They're here.

529
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,170
- It's nice, right?
- Hello.

530
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:18,340
- Welcome.
- Hello.

531
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,079
- Hello.
- Hello, guys.

532
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,410
- Hello.
- It has been a while.

533
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,179
Hello. This is incredible.

534
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,620
This place is so nice. I can't believe it.

535
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,949
It has been a while.

536
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,590
- Put the suitcase here.
- Okay.

537
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Oh, my goodness.

538
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,300
All right.

539
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,730
- It's been a while.
- This place is so nice.

540
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,440
You guys are wearing similar jackets.

541
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,800
Aren't they the same?

542
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,410
They're the same.

543
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,010
Did you guys buy them?

544
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,709
- Yes.
- In Japan?

545
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,740
We made them.

546
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,979
I get that he has no lingering feelings.

547
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,190
I get that he's interested in someone else.

548
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,850
But when I see his behaviors,

549
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,519
I don't know why he keeps trying...

550
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,460
to ruin my feelings.

551
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,600
The two of them came in wearing the same jackets.

552
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,200
She was someone I liked a lot in the past.

553
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,140
Seeing her do that with someone else...

554
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,070
I felt...

555
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,440
a bit strange then.

556
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,550
(It's hard to see the ex make a precious memory with someone new.)

557
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,849
I can't believe they're seeing that.

558
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,349
That's intense.

559
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,219
Hey, Pyeongchang-dong was nothing.

560
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,889
- The real deal begins now.
- Yes.

561
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,289
- Seriously.
- It begins now.

562
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,959
EXchange always gets real during the trip.

563
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,290
- That's right.
- That's right.

564
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,359
(Ji Yeon and Won Kyu arrive.)

565
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,370
I'll open it for you.

566
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
It's so nice.

567
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,980
It's so nice.

568
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,179
Hello.

569
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,810
- I think it's Won Kyu.
- Who is it?

570
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,210
It's him. It's Kyu.

571
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,549
- Ji Yeon.
- Hello. Have you been well?

572
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,290
I missed you, Ji Yeon.

573
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,920
I missed you so much.

574
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,790
- Really?
- Yes.

575
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,630
This place is so nice.

576
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
Hello.

577
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,340
This place is incredible.

578
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,940
It's seriously insane.

579
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,439
- Won Kyu.
- Do you want me to come closer?

580
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Come here.

581
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
- Why?
- Stay by my side.

582
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,180
This seat...

583
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,320
- I'll scoot over.
- I mean...

584
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,030
You guys are wearing similar clothes.

585
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,059
- It wasn't intentional.
- It wasn't intentional.

586
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,260
Did you guys just happen to wear similar clothes?

587
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Yes.

588
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,030
How uncanny.

589
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,010
In any case, she had come with another man.

590
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,639
It wasn't the first time for the both of us.

591
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,279
To me, the trip abroad...

592
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,050
and the promises I made with my ex...

593
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,950
were the most meaningful.

594
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,120
So it was a bit upsetting.

595
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,830
Look at this.

596
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,100
I was surprised to see Yoo Sik there.

597
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,699
I knew that my ex would come with someone.

598
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,200
I thought, "Then it must be Seung Yong."

599
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,140
They would've gotten much closer.

600
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,010
It was the same for me.

601
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,810
- Seung Yong.
- What?

602
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,140
Isn't that a haunted house?

603
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,750
- Maybe someone will knock.
- It's so scary.

604
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,720
Knock, knock.

605
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,490
Is my face still red?

606
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,120
Your face returned to normal.

607
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Thank goodness.

608
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,060
People won't figure out how our date went.

609
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,530
Let's go.

610
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Hello.

611
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,799
- What? Hello.
- Hello.

612
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,870
Hello.

613
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,309
(Ji Hyeon and Seung Yong arrive last.)

614
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,409
- Hello.
- Hello.

615
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,080
- Hello.
- It's so pretty.

616
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,020
I had expected it, so I wasn't very surprised.

617
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,690
Did you have fun?

618
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,999
I wanted to ask Seung Yong...

619
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,499
how they ended up coming together.

620
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,240
Have they had a conversation? When did they have it?

621
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,940
I was curious about such things.

622
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,510
What did you do today?

623
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,480
Today, we went to an amusement park.

624
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,180
- In Japan?
- Yes.

625
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,319
- We rode a pirate ship...
- It must've been fun.

626
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,480
and a Ferris wheel.

627
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,190
We also rode a carousel.

628
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,760
I think it was my first carousel ride since kindergarten.

629
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,630
After 25 years...

630
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,330
Seriously. Not even my mom gave me a carousel ride.

631
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,800
I had so much fun today.

632
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,070
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, everyone is here.

633
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,440
- Something big will happen now.
- What's this?

634
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,710
I think the exes will be revealed.

635
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,380
- Really?
- Yes.

636
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,450
- Seriously, I want to leave.
- Hold on.

637
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,520
- Don't do this.
- What's this?

638
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,550
Hold on.

639
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,799
Once it gets revealed that there are two of my exes,

640
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,430
Yoo Sik...

641
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,369
might find it hard to show his interest in me.

642
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,870
Because of that thought, I became worried.

643
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,610
Because my ex and I have dated for many years,

644
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,510
I worried about what other people would think...

645
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,210
about us.

646
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,380
On one hand, I felt sad.

647
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,150
On the other hand, I thought,

648
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,960
"I'll be able to talk to my ex after this."

649
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,300
I thought it'd be nice to reveal everything at this point.

650
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,640
I thought it'd be better for avoiding awkward relationships.

651
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,770
The time has come.

652
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,880
The exes will finally be revealed.

653
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
Back then, she was...

654
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,249
the only one in my life.

655
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,749
I dedicated all of my time to her.

656
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,919
It's Baek Hyun's voice.

657
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,190
- It's Baek Hyun.
- Baek Hyun.

658
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,820
- Who is it?
- It's Baek Hyun's voice.

659
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,460
I feel sad already.

660
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,799
I couldn't believe we had talked so much in a cafe...

661
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,400
that we were seeing the sunrise.

662
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,200
My heart beat fast.

663
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,210
We talked to each other all night long.

664
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,780
I felt like the world was mine.

665
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,779
We spend 360 out of 365 days together.

666
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,820
As time went on,

667
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,849
I felt like everything came before me...

668
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,320
in his life.

669
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,489
I kept thinking, "But I have my own life..."

670
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,530
"to live."

671
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,430
I had a bad feeling about it.

672
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,060
"Okay. Let's break up."

673
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,199
That was how it ended.

674
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,529
(In the end, our time ended.)

675
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,629
Had things gone on,

676
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,870
I wouldn't have been able to plan my future.

677
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,269
"What should I do if things repeat themselves?"

678
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,410
That's one thought.

679
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,979
I'm someone who thinks...

680
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,850
there's no going back after a breakup.

681
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,580
(The couples spent time separately.)

682
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,890
(We'll reveal the reunited couples.)

683
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,160
Seriously.

684
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,590
It's so nice.

685
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,590
Min Kyung.

686
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,590
You shouldn't be crying already, Min Kyung.

687
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,030
Ji Hyeon is crying already.

688
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,770
It's so sad.

689
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,680
Don't cry.

690
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
(The first ex will be revealed.)

691
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,820
I wonder who'll come first.

692
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,889
(The first ex will be revealed.)

693
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,860
(Yun Nyeong)

694
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,830
What should I do? Seriously, what should I do?

695
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,629
Seung Yong doesn't know.

696
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,160
He can't make a guess.

697
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,230
Seriously, who is it?

698
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,110
I already know who he is.

699
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,370
Who is it?

700
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:38,739
- It's obvious.
- Can't you tell?

701
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,279
- I don't know.
- Anyone can tell.

702
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
- I have no idea.
- I really don't know.

703
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,420
(Yun Nyeong's ex, Jae Hyeong)

704
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,560
I had no idea.

705
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,290
This is incredible.

706
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,790
It has been a while.

707
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,200
- It's awkward.
- It's so funny.

708
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,500
It has been a while. It has been six years.

709
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,840
Six years?

710
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,469
Have you ever imagined being on the show with me?

711
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,340
I turned down the offer at first.

712
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,410
But... I don't know. It just happened that way.

713
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,649
(From March 14, 2018 to April 7, 2019)

714
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,450
(Their first love blossomed as a high school senior and junior.)

715
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,520
- How cute.
- They were babies.

716
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,190
First love.

717
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,030
It was my first time seeing Yun Nyeong with long hair.

718
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,700
She looked cute.

719
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,270
It was meaningful. Everything was a first.

720
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,379
From what I've seen, Yun Nyeong didn't seem to have...

721
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,539
any lingering feelings.

722
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,480
The breakup happened a long time ago.

723
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,350
I became certain...

724
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,520
that Jae Hyeong and Yun Nyeong simply rooted for each other.

725
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,290
I couldn't help but think about that.

726
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,000
I changed a lot when I dated you.

727
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,130
My ideal type became clearer.

728
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,040
My dating style did too.

729
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,800
I learned a lot.

730
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,270
You became stronger.

731
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,740
Of course.

732
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,940
- See you soon.
- Okay.

733
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,320
It was as I had guessed.

734
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,550
A long time passed since their breakup,

735
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,820
and they entered the show together.

736
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,359
It was a relationship in the early 20s.

737
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
I had the same experience.

738
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,290
I thought that they perhaps had...

739
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,730
an immature relationship with the clumsy emotions.

740
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,700
Really?

741
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,640
That was why you advised me to wear denim.

742
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,539
(Jae Hyeong advised Seung Yong to wear denim for a date.)

743
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,670
I knew what she liked.

744
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,010
My goodness.

745
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,410
Here comes the second couple.

746
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,450
- I'm curious.
- Maybe it's me.

747
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,750
(The second ex will be revealed. JI Hyeon)

748
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,420
I have no idea.

749
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,819
Who is Ji Hyeon's ex?

750
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,790
- Guess who?
- Who is it?

751
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,500
- Those shoes!
- Whose shoes are those?

752
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,399
Those shoes!

753
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,530
- Those shoes are so...
- Who has those shoes and the shirt?

754
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,640
- Who is it?
- Who's her ex?

755
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,840
- Who is it?
- I can tell from the shoes.

756
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,080
I had absolutely no idea.

757
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,880
Who is it?

758
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,120
- He's handsome.
- He's handsome.

759
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,950
I seriously thought it was someone else.

760
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,120
I really hadn't guessed it.

761
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,460
I was certain that Ji Hyeon and Woo Jin were a couple.

762
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,960
I guess I don't have a good hunch.

763
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,130
I thought I had quick wits.

764
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,339
Ji Hyeon said that she liked handsome boys...

765
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,410
with a fair complexion.

766
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,310
I was surprised that her ex was Won Kyu, not Woo Jin.

767
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,079
I guess it isn't obvious...

768
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,679
- to everyone.
- I guess so.

769
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,519
We can see it clearly since we watch every moment thanks to the cameras.

770
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,989
- That's right.
- But in the house,

771
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,619
- they don't watch everything.
- That's right.

772
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,189
- Maybe it isn't obvious.
- Maybe it isn't obvious.

773
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,219
They only watch people...

774
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,359
- they're interested in.
- You're right.

775
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,430
They focus on their own situation.

776
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,030
- Maybe it isn't obvious.
- I know.

777
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,200
You guys are right.

778
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,030
Why are you so nervous?

779
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
It's nerve-racking. We hadn't met in a while.

780
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,370
I don't know what your feelings are.

781
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,140
Why is Kyu so nervous?

782
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,980
(Ji Hyeon and Won Kyu, From August 2023 to June 2024)

783
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,320
Oh, my.

784
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,259
Kyu is so handsome.

785
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,890
- He looks good with short hair.
- He is so handsome.

786
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,330
We won't know about their ages and professions.

787
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,060
We might become interested in someone in that environment.

788
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,700
I guess you've steeled your heart.

789
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,070
I did too.

790
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,470
- You steeled your heart?
- Yes.

791
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,040
Good. You should do that.

792
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,010
When I watched the video...

793
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,450
and listened to the conversation they had...

794
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,680
I already knew that they still had feelings for each other.

795
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,250
Now, I can't even ignore it.

796
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,220
I'll try not to think about it, and do what I want.

797
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,060
But I just felt strange.

798
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,360
How old are you now?

799
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,530
- Are you for real?
- I mean...

800
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,470
- "Are you for real?" - That's so funny.

801
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,010
You're 28.

802
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,850
You'll be 30 soon.

803
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,510
So what?

804
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,450
You're 33.

805
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,620
I'm so...

806
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,590
- I'm so old.
- I bet you'll be the oldest.

807
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
What?

808
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,130
- Oh, no.
- I wasn't the oldest.

809
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,700
Look at Seung Yong's hair.

810
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,299
It's comedy.

811
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,699
- Seriously.
- I had no idea.

812
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,610
Has it been ten months since you guys broke up?

813
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,369
- A year?
- It has been a year.

814
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,579
It's getting close to a year.

815
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,449
- I had no idea.
- Seriously.

816
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,780
I had no idea despite being her roommate.

817
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,879
I really thought it was Woo Jin.

818
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,949
- We have the worst hunch.
- Seriously.

819
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,189
- My goodness.
- I didn't say anything.

820
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,650
- I really thought it was Woo Jin.
- I have no hunch.

821
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,689
Who is it?

822
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,989
(The third ex will be revealed.)

823
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,330
It's Hyeon Ji.

824
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,910
How cool.

825
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,240
Who is it?

826
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,760
(Hyeon Ji's ex, Baek Hyun)

827
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,540
I had no idea.

828
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,000
Is it Baek Hyun?

829
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,439
When I dated my ex, I already knew...

830
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,080
Baek Hyun.

831
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,220
I was looking for something at Hyeon Ji's place...

832
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,550
when I stumbled upon a bundle of letters.

833
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,389
They were the letters Baek Hyun had written...

834
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,720
when they were dating.

835
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,290
So I knew about...

836
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,000
Baek Hyun.

837
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,299
I said earlier...

838
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,639
that the past lover might not know about the future lover.

839
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,799
- Right. It goes the other way.
- But the future lover...

840
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,269
- can know the past lover easily.
- That's right.

841
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,069
I said that there was a high chance of Seung Yong knowing him.

842
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,139
That's right.

843
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,479
That was why his questions were directed at Baek Hyun.

844
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,009
"Will you get back together with your ex?"

845
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,349
He didn't even look at Jae Hyeong.

846
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,079
- From his seat, - He asked since he knew.

847
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,450
his body was turned toward Baek Hyun.

848
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,220
(He faced Hyeon Ji's another ex, Baek Hyun.)

849
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,159
I had a hunch...

850
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,790
since she was my roommate.

851
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,329
- Did it show?
- What?

852
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,530
Did it show?

853
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,269
What's up with that look?

854
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,870
- What?
- What's up with that look?

855
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
You look pretty.

856
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,880
- Come on.
- My goodness.

857
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,150
You look pretty.

858
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,680
- Come on.
- My goodness.

859
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,609
(Hyeon Ji and Baek Hyun)

860
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,069
(From December, 2018 to December, 2020)

861
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,610
- Two years.
- They've dated for two years.

862
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,350
Do you want to eat? You ordered fruits.

863
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,150
Go ahead. I'm sure you want a snack.

864
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,160
How does it feel to see me after all these years?

865
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,060
You aren't excited, right?

866
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,030
Sure. I'm excited.

867
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:24,970
My heart is fluttering.

868
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,310
Seriously.

869
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,180
Judging from the video,

870
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,610
I feel like...

871
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,680
she's more comfortable when she's...

872
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,150
Baek Hyun.

873
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,740
I'm a bit jealous. I feel...

874
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,980
a bit sad.

875
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,860
I'm glad.

876
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,160
You look pretty.

877
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,900
You're wearing a pretty outfit too.

878
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,640
Really?

879
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,410
How do you think it'll be in the house?

880
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,750
I think you'll be very popular.

881
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,250
I'm serious.

882
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,850
Maybe I'll get jealous.

883
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,750
- You?
- Yes.

884
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,590
Maybe I'll get jealous.

885
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,900
They didn't look at each other like strangers.

886
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,830
It looked like...

887
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,770
they had a relationship they'd remember for a long time.

888
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,479
"Baek Hyun must've liked Hyeon Ji a lot."

889
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,279
I had that thought.

890
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,220
Baek Hyun seemed more hung up than her.

891
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,920
But I actually thought...

892
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,559
that Baek Hyun might change.

893
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,319
There's no reason for it.

894
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,930
But people can have a change of heart.

895
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,370
When I watched the video, I saw for the first time...

896
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,400
how I looked at Hyeon Ji.

897
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,309
It had been a long time, but that's the thing with emotions.

898
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,080
It was impossible to get rid of them completely.

899
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,550
I thought I had completely moved on from Hyeon Ji.

900
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,250
When I first saw Hyeon Ji, I was shy and started to blush.

901
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,550
I could see that in my behavior.

902
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,930
I could see that my heart fluttered at that moment.

903
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,370
(The moment he faced the feelings he had been avoiding)

904
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,350
How did you two meet?

905
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,980
Hyeon Ji got a job at Korean Air.

906
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,580
She had a party to celebrate her new job.

907
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,650
I asked for her number at the party.

908
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,960
Then we started to text. But Hyeon Ji told me...

909
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,560
she wasn't interested.

910
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,500
I was in the military back then, so there was nothing I could do.

911
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,900
I told her I'd write her a letter every day.

912
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,039
I wrote letters every day while I was in the military.

913
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,499
- Gosh.
- He wrote one every day.

914
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,840
- My gosh.
- Every day?

915
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,440
Hyeon Ji had a hard time too.

916
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,280
The atmosphere got heavy.

917
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,850
That's impressive.

918
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,319
Seung Yong was restless and anxious.

919
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,460
He kept touching his hair.

920
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,390
He kept avoiding eye contact with me on purpose.

921
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,630
That must bother him a lot.

922
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:21,839
He said he found a stack of letters at Hyeon Ji's house.

923
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,709
So this might bother him a little more.

924
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,479
He's facing the man behind all these letters.

925
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,449
It must have felt so weird for him.

926
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,209
I bet he was angry and jealous.

927
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,619
He must mostly be jealous,

928
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,980
- to be honest.
- Right.

929
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,150
(The fourth ex will be revealed.)

930
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,159
What are those shoes?

931
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,630
Those heels are 6cm high.

932
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,930
(The fourth ex will be Min Kyung's.)

933
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,530
- How pretty.
- She looks so pretty.

934
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,140
Why is he so tall?

935
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,940
- Why is he so tall?
- He's so tall.

936
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,869
Who's that?

937
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,980
Who's that?

938
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,039
(Min Kyung's ex, Yoo Sik)

939
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,580
- No way.
- Gosh.

940
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,979
How cute.

941
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,579
Gosh, he's so handsome.

942
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,750
Why is he so handsome?

943
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,089
As we all live in the same house,

944
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,020
there are moments when it's obvious who used to date whom.

945
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,730
To be honest, I was expecting it to be her.

946
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:21,230
Once I became certain that his ex was Min Kyung,

947
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,230
I was more curious about their story.

948
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,070
Seeing how much Min Kyung is struggling,

949
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,740
I was a bit concerned.

950
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,609
- Are you nervous?
- I don't know what to do.

951
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,740
Really?

952
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,480
I'll see how you fit in and then help you.

953
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,450
Why would you help me?

954
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,080
- I should help you.
- Gosh.

955
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,749
I helped you pick out your outfits for eight years.

956
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,890
- It's nine years.
- You...

957
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,720
What?

958
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,659
- What?
- You dated for nine years?

959
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,499
- You dated for 9 years?
- You dated for 9 years?

960
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,800
Then when did you break up?

961
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,360
You broke up recently.

962
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,499
(Min Kyung and Yoo Sik)

963
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,670
(From July 29, 2017 to January 8, 2025)

964
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,380
That's crazy.

965
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:11,510
Yoo Sik dated her for nine years.

966
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,090
Hyeon Ji might have seen that as a positive thing.

967
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,630
She might have thought, "Yoo Sik must be a catch."

968
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:30,329
Actually, I find it difficult to get to know someone...

969
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,499
who had a long-term relationship.

970
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,070
It makes me wonder...

971
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,710
if he has completely moved on before dating someone new...

972
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,549
and if I would be able to erase their memories with new ones.

973
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,250
I have some concerns like this.

974
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,619
I thought he might be having trouble letting go.

975
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,219
Since they had been together for nine years,

976
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,859
he could have a change of heart.

977
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,160
That crossed my mind.

978
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,390
I did become more cautious.

979
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,300
(A new concern springs up before a new start.)

980
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,370
Did your friends ask you about us?

981
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,970
They do. But...

982
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,380
Oh, no.

983
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,420
Well, we dated for a very long time.

984
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,789
We had never been broken up before.

985
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,360
I was quite proud of that.

986
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,930
But...

987
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,840
the moment I say it out loud, it's really over.

988
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,540
Telling people that we weren't dating anymore...

989
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,180
was just so sad.

990
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,280
- Yoo Sik, don't cry.
- Don't cry.

991
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,290
At first, I didn't want to talk about it.

992
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,629
So I told people that we were doing well.

993
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,690
I see.

994
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,840
In the video, Yoo Sik seemed sad...

995
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,639
and teared up too. The guy I saw in the video...

996
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,639
was different from the guy he had become.

997
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,310
So that broke my heart a bit.

998
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,990
(Everyone processes breakups at different paces.)

999
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,700
Then are you each other's first love?

1000
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,170
She is my first love.

1001
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,439
That's cool.

1002
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,710
We dated for a long time, didn't we?

1003
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,210
Nine years. That's cool.

1004
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,880
Min Kyung was the accommodating one in our relationship.

1005
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,150
I had never been bored while we dated.

1006
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,390
So it doesn't feel like we dated for nine years.

1007
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:43,830
Right.

1008
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:45,690
I realized we had been together that long after we broke up.

1009
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,200
(The fifth ex will be revealed.)

1010
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,310
Ji Yeon.

1011
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,170
Hey, Ji Yeon.

1012
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,050
(Ji Yeon's ex, Woo Jin)

1013
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,180
He looks so handsome.

1014
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,049
He's already the prince of Seongsu.

1015
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,520
Gosh, totally.

1016
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,660
They look alike.

1017
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,930
It's been a while.

1018
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,500
Have you been well?

1019
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,670
I didn't know we'd meet again like this.

1020
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,009
- It's surreal.
- I thought...

1021
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,610
I'd never get to see you again.

1022
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,750
Same here.

1023
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,679
(Ji Yeon and Woo Jin)

1024
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,020
(From March 3, 2024 to March 17, 2025)

1025
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,979
My gosh, you had such long hair.

1026
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,650
- It was so long.
- You had long hair.

1027
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,260
- You recently broke up.
- Three months ago?

1028
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,590
They recently broke up.

1029
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,629
Since it's only been three months,

1030
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,130
they couldn't have moved on completely.

1031
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,870
It shows just how much she likes...

1032
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,770
my ex, right?

1033
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,310
I think there still might be lingering feelings from the breakup.

1034
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,239
It also made me wonder if that was why...

1035
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,510
Ji Yeon was pushing her ex away even more adamantly.

1036
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,320
It's very recent.

1037
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,950
You haven't seen me in a while.

1038
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,250
Did you have any questions?

1039
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,190
Well...

1040
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,859
What did he ask?

1041
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,100
He asked if she had any questions. She said no.

1042
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,210
- None?
- No.

1043
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,980
I don't know. My feelings from our breakup...

1044
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,110
- had been suppressed.
- Okay.

1045
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:45,950
So...

1046
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,420
I don't have any strong feelings left now.

1047
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,420
I just think of it as a good memory.

1048
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,630
I pretended to have sorted out everything when we met.

1049
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,959
Listening to what I told her before the filming...

1050
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,060
and realizing how I behaved in the house...

1051
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:05,230
made me understand why Ji Yeon could be confused.

1052
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,600
Let's follow our heart.

1053
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,410
- I'm going to follow my heart.
- Yes.

1054
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,540
I won't worry about you.

1055
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,880
Me neither.

1056
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,880
It seemed Ji Yeon said that...

1057
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,390
because she genuinely wanted to do that.

1058
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,860
Actually, I wasn't 100 percent honest.

1059
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,390
So that made me regret it a bit.

1060
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,730
Had I told her how I felt honestly,

1061
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,269
would we have been in a different place...

1062
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,870
when we started? That crossed my mind too.

1063
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,740
(He regrets how he behaved in the preliminary meeting.)

1064
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,150
Your breakup is really recent.

1065
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,220
Has it been 3 months? Or 4 months?

1066
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,480
- Three months?
- Three months since our breakup?

1067
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,090
- Three months.
- Three months.

1068
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,690
This must be hard on Woo Jin.

1069
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,760
Which couple is last to go?

1070
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,630
Seung Yong.

1071
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,070
Are you okay?

1072
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,300
I'm fine.

1073
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,609
This is driving me crazy now that it's my turn.

1074
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,640
Why?

1075
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,020
(The sixth ex will be revealed.)

1076
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,989
- It's time.
- My gosh. This is crazy.

1077
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,389
My heart is pounding like crazy.

1078
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,830
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- My heart is racing like crazy.

1079
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,589
Oh, no.

1080
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,330
I can't even imagine how it's going to feel for them.

1081
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,530
Oh, my.

1082
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,600
This is driving me crazy.

1083
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,340
(The sixth ex will be revealed.)

1084
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,380
Wait. He's waiting for her?

1085
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,909
How come he's coming in first this time?

1086
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,149
That's because his ex isn't here.

1087
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,720
- His ex isn't here.
- I see.

1088
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:03,590
I wonder who it is.

1089
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,130
My gosh, I just got goosebumps.

1090
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,770
Can you see them?

1091
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,370
No, I can't.

1092
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,180
What? What's this?

1093
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,950
She has a beautiful silhouette.

1094
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,550
Who is it?

1095
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,900
Will she rip the screen and enter?

1096
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:05,880
What?

1097
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,980
- For real?
- What?

1098
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,620
- For real?
- What?

1099
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,360
- Hold on.
- Is this for real?

1100
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,530
It's a lie, right?

1101
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,500
It looks real.

1102
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,640
(Seung Yong's ex, Hyeon Ji)

1103
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,080
Goodness.

1104
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,680
Oh, my gosh.

1105
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,050
I was shocked. Genuinely shocked.

1106
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,150
I looked at Baek Hyun right away.

1107
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,760
It was to check if he was okay.

1108
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,929
EXchange's cross edit.

1109
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,460
I thought it was that at first.

1110
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,470
What's going on?

1111
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,440
No way.

1112
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,770
I'm so glad it isn't me.

1113
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,740
Really. Truly.

1114
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,040
(What if it was me?)

1115
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,350
I would've left the house.

1116
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,650
She's someone shy and timid.

1117
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,120
It must have really bothered her and stressed her out.

1118
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,360
She must've had so much on her mind from the start.

1119
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,659
It's such a tough environment.

1120
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,329
I thought, "Adjusting to this place..."

1121
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:30,000
"must have been difficult."

1122
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,400
We talked about how the exes might be revealed today,

1123
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:37,910
and she seemed reluctant to go back home.

1124
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,939
I wonder who had the longest relationship.

1125
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,640
(The two talked about the ex reveal during their date.)

1126
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,979
Are you curious about that?

1127
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,310
I want to know everyone's story.

1128
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,519
Please, no.

1129
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,789
(Hyeon Ji grows more worried...)

1130
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,049
(as Yoo Sik shows interest in the stories.)

1131
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,120
Seriously.

1132
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,760
You hate it that much?

1133
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,069
I'd have to reveal my ex too,

1134
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:07,269
but she seemed even more upset than before.

1135
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,970
So I did think our stories...

1136
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,040
must be different.

1137
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,510
I was worried about her.

1138
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,080
But thinking it would be best...

1139
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,320
not to look at her,

1140
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,920
I avoided Hyeon Ji.

1141
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,230
I believed I just needed to do what I had to do.

1142
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,500
It didn't bother me much.

1143
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,370
- Wait, give me a second.
- For real?

1144
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,680
I already knew about it.

1145
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,449
I thought I'd be fine,

1146
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,550
like it wouldn't affect me at all.

1147
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,350
But it made me feel strange.

1148
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:00,190
(When did you find out?)

1149
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,390
I looked at Hyeon Ji when he joined.

1150
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,800
That expression was a first.

1151
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,760
A flustered expression.

1152
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,070
She kept her eyes on him.

1153
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,940
She even spoke to him first, which wasn't like her.

1154
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,810
That's when I realized he must be Hyeon Ji's ex.

1155
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,780
(Baek Hyun figured out Hyeon Ji's other ex through his intuition.)

1156
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:35,759
Either way, Hyeon Ji, Baek Hyun, and Seung Yong...

1157
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,029
all agreed to be on the show.

1158
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,159
- Yes.
- Of course.

1159
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,229
The three simply didn't know...

1160
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,299
- who it was.
- No.

1161
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,269
- Exactly.
- But they joined...

1162
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,229
knowing each other's exes could exist.

1163
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,469
That's why Baek Hyun sort of realized who it was...

1164
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,399
- when Seung Yong moved in.
- Yes..

1165
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,669
- "It's him." - "That's the guy."

1166
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,079
Can Seung Yong and Baek Hyun become friends?

1167
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,239
No way.

1168
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,179
- Can't they?
- Can they become friends?

1169
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,349
I don't think I could if I were them.

1170
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:00,820
- For real.
- In a way,

1171
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,079
I see a possibility of Baek Hyun...

1172
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,189
- just shrugging it off.
- Right.

1173
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,119
He's currently all-in...

1174
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,059
- on Yun Nyeong.
- True.

1175
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,429
Things are going well between the two.

1176
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,900
If that happens, things might work out smoothly...

1177
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:18,129
- for Hyeon Ji and Seung Yong.
- Somehow...

1178
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,799
Both exes are on the show...

1179
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,969
because Baek Hyun said...

1180
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,169
- he had no intention...
- Yes.

1181
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,410
- of getting back together.
- Yes.

1182
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:29,950
(In Seongsu-dong, a week before moving in)

1183
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,630
(Seung Yong is waiting for Hyeon Ji.)

1184
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:20,730
(Hyeon Ji's other ex, Seung Yong)

1185
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,230
Have you been well?

1186
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,270
Is it your day off today?

1187
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,009
No, I had work today.

1188
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,010
In the morning?

1189
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:34,940
You probably didn't get much rest.

1190
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,780
Are you nervous?

1191
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:40,920
Yes.

1192
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,750
Have you lost weight?

1193
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,920
Me? Do you think I've lost a lot?

1194
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,730
Your look has changed a bit.

1195
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,730
Why? How so?

1196
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,030
You've become slimmer.

1197
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,670
It's like you've become slim.

1198
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,910
I worked hard to lose the weight I gained...

1199
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,710
while we were dating from all the good food we ate.

1200
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,180
- But those were some good meals.
- Yes.

1201
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:22,420
(Our days when we were happy)

1202
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:26,259
We started dating in January 2023.

1203
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:29,230
Our relationship ended in September 2024.

1204
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,270
It lasted about 1.5 years.

1205
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,469
When we first met, we were simply friends of a friend.

1206
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:39,040
My friends and I went on an overseas trip.

1207
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,450
Coincidentally, my ex traveled to the same place.

1208
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,449
We had drinks together,

1209
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,950
which was when we first met.

1210
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:54,320
We met by coincidence at a vacation spot.

1211
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,990
The atmosphere itself made my heart flutter.

1212
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,030
I thought...

1213
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:06,029
she had a beautiful face.

1214
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,840
I'm someone who gets really shy,

1215
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,010
so I glanced at her every now and then.

1216
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,479
He seemed taciturn...

1217
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,409
but still spoke up when he had to,

1218
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:20,520
which drew me to him when we first met.

1219
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,120
After coming back to Korea, I hesitated.

1220
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,889
But I found her Instagram account and followed her.

1221
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,820
I had gone on the trip with a close friend,

1222
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,860
and he had only followed my account.

1223
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,230
My ex uploaded many stories.

1224
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,100
But he didn't get in touch with me.

1225
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,570
It was my way of flirting.

1226
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,309
I wanted to grab her attention...

1227
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:51,880
but didn't have the courage to do it aggressively.

1228
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,880
That was why I uploaded so many stories.

1229
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,890
I replied to his stories first.

1230
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:02,590
I thought my plan had worked.

1231
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,760
There seems to be this trend among youngsters.

1232
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,729
Say you upload five stories in a row.

1233
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:12,270
If your crush sees all five, he's interested in you.

1234
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,469
If he only sees 2 or 3...

1235
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,299
- and skips the rest, - If he skips them.

1236
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,839
that means he's not interested.

1237
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,939
Really?

1238
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,879
- The first...
- I'm guessing that was his tactic.

1239
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,679
It's upsetting if he doesn't see the rest.

1240
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,209
- You wish he'd see it.
- Yes, he should see all of it.

1241
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,579
But if he didn't see any of them,

1242
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,849
"I guess he's not interested in the next one..."

1243
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,720
- Exactly, that right there.'.
- is what you'd think.

1244
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,919
Our first date...

1245
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,089
was near Gyeongnidan-gil.

1246
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:40,300
Either way, I wanted to look smart.

1247
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,770
So I took a classical literature book with me and acted as...

1248
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,699
if I was reading it.

1249
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,370
Honestly, I was just on my phone.

1250
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,910
My ex was already there, reading a book.

1251
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:56,080
It made him look earnest.

1252
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,449
He seemed cool to me.

1253
01:06:58,450 --> 01:06:59,450
(Seung Yong's tactic worked again.)

1254
01:06:59,451 --> 01:07:02,849
It didn't feel like we clicked very well.

1255
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,849
But...

1256
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,790
I didn't want to go home and such.

1257
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:12,260
I wondered why I liked him so much.

1258
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,559
(Attracted by Seung Yong's shy yet clear flirting,)

1259
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,970
(they started dating.)

1260
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,029
I'm quite calm...

1261
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:23,709
and the so-called boring type,

1262
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,309
but my ex is lively and cute.

1263
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,439
When we were together, I had fun.

1264
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,820
Even I could tell I laughed a lot more.

1265
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,650
"Being with you is so much fun."

1266
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,159
"This is why I like you." He kept saying things like that.

1267
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,660
How do I get to Hongdae?

1268
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:48,060
(Their relationship made the calm Seung Yong even dance.)

1269
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,559
- This is so embarrassing.
- You have to say...

1270
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,599
"Hype Boy" by NewJeans.

1271
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,300
Oh, "Hype Boy" by NewJeans.

1272
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,010
I laughed like crazy when we were together.

1273
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,340
(Singing)

1274
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,090
(The two made each other laugh.)

1275
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,990
We traveled a lot together.

1276
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,790
The trips we went on are what I remember the most.

1277
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:22,630
(The trip to Kyoto in November 2023)

1278
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:28,400
(The trip to Turkiye in February 2024)

1279
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:32,810
During our trips, we copied simple challenges.

1280
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,909
We often did it,

1281
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,980
and I found that really cute.

1282
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,580
(Seung Yong)

1283
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:49,059
Back then was when I laughed the most.

1284
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,460
During our 1.5-year relationship.

1285
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:57,070
(The two had fun whenever they were together, no matter where.)

1286
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,099
They look good together.

1287
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,439
- The two look steady.
- Yes.

1288
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,399
The relationship was more mature.

1289
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,409
They have a different vibe,

1290
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,439
- like an adult relationship.
- Right.

1291
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,439
Especially since it was later in the years.

1292
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,479
That one was stable and comfortable,

1293
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,249
while the other was unstable, passionate,

1294
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,579
- Totally.
- heartrending,

1295
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,149
and painful.

1296
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:17,090
The two relationships were complete opposites.

1297
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,360
Did you not date anyone after me?

1298
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,920
- No.
- How come?

1299
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,890
I tried.

1300
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,830
But?

1301
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,270
It was hard.

1302
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,570
Why?

1303
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,670
Nobody really interested me.

1304
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:39,910
What about you?

1305
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,340
I was busy with work.

1306
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,880
I didn't have time to date anyone.

1307
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,320
- I see.
- I didn't have time to see anyone.

1308
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,020
- Because you were busy?
- Yes.

1309
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,490
I wonder what you'll be like on the show.

1310
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,360
What do you think I'll be like?

1311
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,630
You were always unpredictable to me.

1312
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,200
I thought you were unpredictable.

1313
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,510
Me? How come?

1314
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,280
Either way,

1315
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,250
the way we think is different.

1316
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,580
You acted in ways I never expected,

1317
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,350
which made you unpredictable.

1318
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,359
For example, "Why is she suddenly getting angry at this moment?"

1319
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,030
That's what I often felt.

1320
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,459
- I had to read the mood.
- I...

1321
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,529
felt that way about you a lot when we were dating.

1322
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,530
Really?

1323
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:43,069
It's just that...

1324
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,339
Should I say I couldn't tell...

1325
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,610
what you were thinking?

1326
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,080
I told you everything I was thinking.

1327
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,549
He was the type...

1328
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:59,790
I'd never dated before.

1329
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,289
I'm easygoing...

1330
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,589
and pretty indifferent.

1331
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:09,999
Meanwhile, my ex is delicate and meticulous.

1332
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,630
We got hurt...

1333
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,369
and upset at each other quite often. That led to arguments.

1334
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:18,140
(The easygoing nature and the delicateness began to clash.)

1335
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:21,440
When I was abroad,

1336
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,210
I wanted to call him or have a videocall.

1337
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:28,119
Don't you want to hear the person's voice...

1338
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,120
when you like the person?

1339
01:11:29,121 --> 01:11:31,550
But he didn't call me after work.

1340
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,119
I did express my feelings,

1341
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,659
but it didn't come out so naturally.

1342
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,799
There were times when she was pretty and lovely,

1343
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,169
but I just thought about it in my mind...

1344
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,570
and just moved on.

1345
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,570
I think my ex didn't like that.

1346
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:54,240
At first, you have to go meet the person when you miss them.

1347
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,339
But he always came to pick me...

1348
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,180
when I asked him to come meet me after work.

1349
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:02,820
He didn't seem to have a clue if I didn't tell him.

1350
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:06,349
She wanted me to pick her up even if she didn't tell me to.

1351
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:09,760
But I thought she'd do things on her own.

1352
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,760
After a year,

1353
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,530
he started saying, "Why should I?"

1354
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:19,330
Our standards of putting in an effort were different.

1355
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,700
I thought, "I'm putting in an effort."

1356
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,699
"Why doesn't she realize that?"

1357
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,810
Ever since I had such thoughts, we started having conflicts.

1358
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,079
It wasn't so often,

1359
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,410
but when we did, it became a big fight.

1360
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,050
That hurt me so much,

1361
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,520
so I started throwing a tantrum.

1362
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:43,119
I wondered why she was being so emotional...

1363
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,229
when we could settle things nicely.

1364
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,300
That thought kept piling up.

1365
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:51,270
This small aspect grew so much.

1366
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,730
Our biggest fight...

1367
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,070
I think our biggest fight was right before we broke up.

1368
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:00,510
(The day their time ended)

1369
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,310
It wasn't about something serious.

1370
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,150
I was thinking about getting plastic surgery back then.

1371
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,849
We were talking about celebrities.

1372
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,789
I asked, "What do you think about this person?"

1373
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:16,619
"Are you fine with people who had plastic surgery?"

1374
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,060
We talked about things like that.

1375
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,800
That topic kept repeating,

1376
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,360
and my ex said,

1377
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,030
"Do you want me to write it out on a paper?"

1378
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,999
"Why is she so angry when it's not something to be angry about?"

1379
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,770
That's what I thought.

1380
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,839
I thought it was unfair,

1381
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,080
so I also spoke a bit aggressively.

1382
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,280
I was so frustrated.

1383
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:41,819
"I said it's not true."

1384
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,290
"Why do you keep thinking it's true?"

1385
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,589
"Do I have to..."

1386
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,790
"keep explaining this to you?"

1387
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,490
That became the root of the problem,

1388
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,759
and we had a huge fight on the street.

1389
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,730
I couldn't stop crying.

1390
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,529
He said,

1391
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:02,299
"Are you crying because you feel wronged?"

1392
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,710
"Are you crying because you feel wronged when you didn't do..."

1393
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:07,039
"anything wrong?"

1394
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,410
I was so hurt by that.

1395
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:14,650
So I told him I'd go home and took a taxi home.

1396
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,020
When things escalated like that,

1397
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,590
I wondered if it was time to stop.

1398
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,230
"I guess things really aren't working out for us."

1399
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,960
I thought we weren't compatible,

1400
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,430
and that led to our breakup.

1401
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:37,610
(They broke up after a quarrel, born from hurt and resentment.)

1402
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,470
How was it?

1403
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,210
How was what?

1404
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,010
After breaking up.

1405
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,620
I...

1406
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:52,320
I felt relieved...

1407
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,090
and struggled as well.

1408
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,630
You felt relieved?

1409
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,429
There were times when I felt relieved.

1410
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,670
There's a time you feel a sense of liberation...

1411
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,700
after you break up.

1412
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,610
I felt a sense of liberation for a brief time.

1413
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,710
Then I felt miserable and sad.

1414
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,909
Did you feel restricted when you were with me?

1415
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,050
Not really.

1416
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,820
We fought a lot.

1417
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,850
I had nothing to fight about,

1418
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,260
so I did feel a bit liberated.

1419
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:30,990
For a brief time.

1420
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,400
How was it for you?

1421
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,240
For me...

1422
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,440
(Sighing)

1423
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:54,080
You may have felt liberated...

1424
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,980
after breaking with me.

1425
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,990
I thought we hadn't fully sorted out our emotions...

1426
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,060
when we broke up.

1427
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,160
Yes.

1428
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,200
So, actually,

1429
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,269
I hated you quite a lot...

1430
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,900
even after some time had passed.

1431
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,380
I see.

1432
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,780
Why are you smiling?

1433
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:26,550
Keep talking.

1434
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,280
I do hate you.

1435
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,890
In the end,

1436
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,490
you did hurt me.

1437
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,360
I don't know.

1438
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:44,930
That's why it's annoying.

1439
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:47,870
I don't know. It's just...

1440
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,240
(Sighing)

1441
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:05,220
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1442
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:06,990
I don't either.

1443
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,020
Let's do our best.

1444
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,790
It's like you're declaring war.

1445
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,230
I'll go there after going on a strict diet.

1446
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,070
Who are you trying to impress?

1447
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,170
Who knows?

1448
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,750
Seriously.

1449
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:34,850
Good luck.

1450
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,790
I'll get going.

1451
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,790
Bye.

1452
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,030
Send me off with a smile.

1453
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,669
She looked thrilled to see Baek Hyun before,

1454
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,809
but she looks very comfortable here.

1455
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,239
- Right. It feels different.
- Right?

1456
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,369
- It feels different.
- She looks very relaxed.

1457
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,709
It feels different.

1458
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,939
I think Hyeon Ji's younger side comes out...

1459
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,349
when she is with Baek Hyun.

1460
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,579
She's pure.

1461
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,550
That's how Hyeon Ji is now.

1462
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,049
She's very honest.

1463
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:12,090
This is how she is now.

1464
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:14,159
- She's very rational.
- Right. She's rational.

1465
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,820
- Very rational.
- She's rational.

1466
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:21,029
(The time when they express their true feelings...)

1467
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,960
(before moving in)

1468
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,769
A lot of time has passed.

1469
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,270
I think I grew over time,

1470
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:34,070
and she would have also grown.

1471
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:47,620
(Seung Yong leans more toward getting back together.)

1472
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,620
He was someone...

1473
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:54,729
I wanted to meet again.

1474
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,330
I thought I hadn't sorted out my feelings about him,

1475
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:04,470
but you never know how your heart changes.

1476
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,369
How did I feel after breaking up with him?

1477
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,940
I had a really hard time,

1478
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,880
but the first thing he said was feeling relieved.

1479
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,980
I was so disappointed.

1480
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,690
(Hyeon Ji leans more toward meeting someone new.)

1481
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:31,300
(Seung Yong: 4:30, Hyeon Ji: 9:00)

1482
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:36,200
(Their time started flowing in opposite directions.)

1483
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:39,239
Do you think you left no regrets?

1484
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,240
There are things I do regret.

1485
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,579
Of course, there are things I regret when I look back.

1486
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,250
Right. I also have regrets.

1487
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:50,280
But I still wouldn't have known what to do...

1488
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,520
even if I went back to that time.

1489
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:58,560
(Hyeon Ji and Seung Yong, January 2023 to September 2024)

1490
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,300
(The day Hyeon Ji moved in)

1491
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,400
Come this way.

1492
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,000
The stairs are steep.

1493
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,700
(Seung Yong wasn't here.)

1494
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:14,610
(Whenever the doorbell rang,)

1495
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,380
This is crazy.

1496
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,680
(Hyeon Ji was surprised, thinking it could be Seung Yong.)

1497
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,590
Every time the doorbell rings, my heart...

1498
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,460
feels like dropping...

1499
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,760
because there's someone else to come.

1500
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:35,030
She was always afraid that Seung Yong would come.

1501
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,659
Hyeon Ji would have had a hard time.

1502
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,330
- Seriously.
- We wouldn't know.

1503
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:43,240
(Seung Yong finally moved in.)

1504
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:45,340
Hello.

1505
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,440
I thought it was time he came.

1506
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,510
I was so nervous.

1507
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:53,210
I thought I would just smile...

1508
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:56,920
when I looked at my ex.

1509
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,889
So I thought I should avoid looking at my ex...

1510
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,120
as much as possible.

1511
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,630
It felt awkward...

1512
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,700
that he was going to enter this space.

1513
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,370
(I want to talk to you in person.)

1514
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:16,070
(Your ex picked you.)

1515
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:19,109
(Seung Yong requested to talk to her.)

1516
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,080
At the preliminary meeting,

1517
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,179
I wanted to tell her...

1518
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,410
that I still had longing feelings.

1519
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,480
But since I was nervous, I said the wrong thing.

1520
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,790
I couldn't explain everything.

1521
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,659
I just said I felt relieved.

1522
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,720
Something like that.

1523
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:40,589
I thought that could make her...

1524
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:41,659
feel upset.

1525
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:46,329
So I thought I should talk to her about that.

1526
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:48,069
(Seung Yong wants to correct the misunderstanding.)

1527
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,099
Seung Yong seems quiet...

1528
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,369
and uses expressions that might come across as indifferent.

1529
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,370
- Yes.
- Yes.

1530
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:55,910
Hyeon Ji tends to focus on that.

1531
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:57,779
They have different styles of talking.

1532
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,449
He wouldn't have had any bad intentions...

1533
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:02,779
when he said a sense of liberation.

1534
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,489
- That's right.
- He wanted to say...

1535
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:06,549
he felt that briefly,

1536
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,789
- but he had a hard time.
- That's right.

1537
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,589
Hyeon Ji did put a lot of weight into it.

1538
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,360
Before they broke up, he said, "Are you crying..."

1539
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,829
"because you feel wronged when you didn't do anything wrong?"

1540
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,659
I think she fixes on such words.

1541
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,469
"Feel wronged" or "sense of liberation."

1542
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,900
She fixes on some words more than what follows.

1543
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,939
Hyeon Ji had more intentions of getting back...

1544
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,910
with Seung Yong than Baek Hyun.

1545
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:29,110
But after the preliminary meeting,

1546
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,279
things changed.

1547
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,909
During the preliminary meeting with Baek Hyun,

1548
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:35,519
she was reminded...

1549
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,519
of his sweetness.

1550
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,989
- It was very...
- Her heart fluttered again.

1551
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:41,759
- She was very excited.
- But at the preliminary meeting...

1552
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,029
with Seung Yong, she was hurt by the word "sense of liberation."

1553
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:47,629
If you want to get back with people like Hyeon Ji,

1554
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,629
you should say, "I had a very hard time after breaking up with you."

1555
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:52,369
"I missed you so much." "You're all I have."

1556
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:54,069
You have to express it...

1557
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,869
- You have to express it.
- very straightforwardly.

1558
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:57,499
But she should meet someone who means it.

1559
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,769
Right. That shouldn't be fake.

1560
01:22:58,770 --> 01:22:59,909
- Right.
- It should be genuine.

1561
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,640
Such a person would match well with Hyeon Ji.

1562
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:10,080
(And now...)

1563
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,650
It feels like I'm dreaming. I didn't think...

1564
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,160
I'd be meeting you again here.

1565
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,730
I often felt like you didn't respect me.

1566
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,299
I thought it was a problem that would stop me...

1567
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,670
from getting back with you.

1568
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,570
I saw them talk to each other.

1569
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,970
I couldn't control my expressions. It felt so weird.

1570
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:38,480
It was a feeling I had never felt before.

1571
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:41,050
"Is this jealousy?"

1572
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,190
"I don't think so. Am I angry?"

1573
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,850
"I'm not angry."

1574
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,519
"I'm not annoyed either."

1575
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,190
"What is this feeling?"

1576
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,999
That's what I thought.

1577
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,230
(Strange feelings burst out.)

1578
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,540
Seriously...

1579
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,870
What were the 14 forks?

1580
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,280
I don't know what to say.

1581
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:10,910
Goodness.

1582
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:14,380
Now I know why you wanted to go home.

1583
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,879
- You would have wanted to go home.
- I would have also...

1584
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,450
wanted to go home.

1585
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:18,890
You had no idea, right?

1586
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:21,390
I had not.

1587
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,689
Really?

1588
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,020
Neither of you knew?

1589
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,560
Did you find it out just now?

1590
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,390
Yes.

1591
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:29,760
Hold on.

1592
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,500
This is too EXchange.

1593
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:36,270
But I'm curious.

1594
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:38,270
Didn't you know?

1595
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,680
- Really?
- I guess he did.

1596
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,950
You just didn't know who the other ex was, did you?

1597
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,590
I didn't know who he was.

1598
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:55,860
Why are you curious about that?

1599
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,330
You said you didn't know.

1600
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:02,500
- Then how can I say that?
- What?

1601
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,900
Shall I get something to eat sitting over there?

1602
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,500
Move over!

1603
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,599
How can I say that?

1604
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,670
I'm hungry.

1605
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:12,570
Are you telling me that you couldn't say that?

1606
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,080
Sit here.

1607
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,280
Seriously.

1608
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,080
You decided to be on this show without knowing it?

1609
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,390
- Yes.
- So two of you didn't know?

1610
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,590
And I'm the only one who knew it before joining the show?

1611
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,970
It was revealed that there were two of her exes.

1612
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,939
Honestly,

1613
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,110
Baek Hyun and I knew it.

1614
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:48,210
But while everyone was talking,

1615
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,410
we said that we didn't know.

1616
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,620
I thought I had to keep it secret to the end.

1617
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,850
I didn't know where to start or where to stop about that.

1618
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:00,650
So I said, "I didn't know."

1619
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,490
How can you say here that you didn't know?

1620
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,660
Then am I the one who brought two exes here, knowing it?

1621
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:13,729
It's nonsense that you came on the show without knowing it.

1622
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,670
Why on earth are you saying that you didn't know?

1623
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,570
I thought I wasn't supposed to say that up to now.

1624
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:19,910
Is that a problem?

1625
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,270
Then I'll say that I knew it.

1626
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,510
What do you mean?

1627
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,910
I'll say that I knew there would be two exes. Okay?

1628
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:30,679
You knew there would be two exes.

1629
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,689
- You just didn't know who he was.
- I knew it, but...

1630
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:34,490
How could I say that?

1631
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,290
Let's go outside and talk, three of us.

1632
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,760
Let's go outside and talk.

1633
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:42,299
- What's the problem here?
- Hold on.

1634
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,229
- I don't understand.
- Hold on.

1635
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,329
Why are you talking like that?

1636
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:47,400
Let's go outside for a minute and talk.

1637
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:48,970
- Okay. Let's go outside.
- Let's go outside and talk.

1638
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,079
Why did both of them say they didn't know?

1639
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,879
I guess they got it wrong.

1640
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,449
- They stuck to the rule strictly.
- They thought they shouldn't say.

1641
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:06,320
It seems they thought they shouldn't say it right away.

1642
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:08,889
It's funny that Seung Yong is mediating them.

1643
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,119
- I know.
- So, let's sort things out again.

1644
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,029
All three of them agreed that they'd all be on the show.

1645
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,030
- They agreed.
- Right.

1646
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:15,599
The two male residents...

1647
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,199
- didn't know who the other ex was.
- They didn't.

1648
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,899
But they knew there were two of them.

1649
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,930
- Right.
- Yes.

1650
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,170
- Why I pretended I didn't know?
- Yes.

1651
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:30,480
At that moment, I thought I wasn't supposed to say it.

1652
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:31,649
I mean, why?

1653
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:33,949
He said he didn't know, so I said the same thing.

1654
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,779
- I can't believe this.
- Anyway, we can go there...

1655
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,520
and correct what we said.

1656
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,890
- That's not what matters.
- Go ahead.

1657
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:43,059
When you were asked whether you knew...

1658
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,059
there would be one more ex of mine on the show,

1659
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,299
you said you didn't know. I don't understand why you said so.

1660
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,229
- Well, that's...
- You might have been confused...

1661
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:51,499
and said that you didn't know.

1662
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,999
"I knew there would be one more ex."

1663
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,439
"But I didn't know who he was."

1664
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,969
"I found out who he was today."

1665
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:01,039
It would have been fine if you said so.

1666
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,379
But you went, "I didn't know. I found it out just now."

1667
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,909
You said that,

1668
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:07,450
and Seung Yong, you also went, "I didn't know."

1669
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:08,979
I understand how you feel.

1670
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,849
What becomes of me, then?

1671
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:13,090
I had two preliminary meetings. Why did I do that?

1672
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,990
Then am I the only one who knew it?

1673
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,230
About that, we can go inside and correct it.

1674
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:23,430
I understand. We can go inside and correct it.

1675
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,070
- You're right about that.
- Yes.

1676
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,370
Is everything all right?

1677
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:31,640
Let's cheer up.

1678
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:34,939
(Trying to lighten the mood with a joke)

1679
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,810
Let's cheer up. Let's do it.

1680
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:41,479
Seriously, what am I doing here?

1681
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,520
Why?

1682
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,920
This is driving me crazy.

1683
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:46,920
Am I in the US or what?

1684
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:48,959
How can this possibly happen?

1685
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,789
But it wasn't upsetting.

1686
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:53,530
Seung Yong actually came to mediate, and he...

1687
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:55,300
kind of felt assuring.

1688
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,270
Let's cheer up.

1689
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:02,800
Since Seung Yong acted in that manner,

1690
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,240
the atmosphere wasn't too heavy,

1691
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,339
and we could talk smoothly together.

1692
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,710
Honestly, I appreciated it very much.

1693
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:13,810
I tried to settle the issue pleasantly.

1694
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,050
Two of them...

1695
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,950
argued a lot.

1696
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,860
It looked rather nice.

1697
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:24,660
I felt...

1698
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:27,290
that they're closer to each other than I was to her.

1699
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,560
I felt a little jealous.

1700
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:44,210
(EXchange 4)

1701
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,749
- I will read it now.
- Okay.

1702
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,580
(The first envelope to Japan)

1703
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:49,580
"Male residents,"

1704
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,090
"please recommend a date partner for your ex."

1705
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:54,320
"But you can't recommend yourself."

1706
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,720
Then, should we agree on someone?

1707
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:00,430
If you're going to choose my date partner, I hope it's Won Kyu.

1708
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,000
You never know. It's up to me.

1709
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,760
It irritates me to see that you came here with him.

1710
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,300
I'm personally curious. Are you feeling excited right now?

1711
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,039
Can't you let me know?

1712
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,070
What do you mean?

1713
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:13,810
Can't you tell me how you feel? My feelings are wavering too.

1714
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,480
She hinted that she wants to get back together with me.

1715
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,780
Now I have to, I guess. There's no other option.

1716
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,280
I'm sorry.

1717
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,780
I can see that he has feelings for Hyeon Ji.

1718
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:28,090
The only thought I had was that it felt so cruel.
