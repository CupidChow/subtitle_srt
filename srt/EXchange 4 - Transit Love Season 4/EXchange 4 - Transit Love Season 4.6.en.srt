1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,749
All right. Let us introduce today's guests...

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,949
who will join our discussion.

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,580
- It's Singer DAWN.
- Yes.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,589
Hello. I'm a musician. My name is DAWN.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,619
- Of course, we know.
- Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,019
So this is the first show you're appearing on...

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,589
after your military service.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,859
This is my first TV show after my service.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,860
- I see.
- Really?

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,459
Actually, our staff tried to get you...

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,469
to appear on our show in the previous season too.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,830
During the third season,

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,440
I wasn't in an ideal situation to appear on the show.

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,169
- I see.
- Right.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,739
- You're already mentioning that.
- Yes.

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,040
- You're being so honest.
- That's what I remember.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,309
What about now? Are you doing...

19
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,779
- How are you?
- better emotionally?

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,879
- Well, it's always been the same.
- Right.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,819
Otherwise, he wouldn't be on our show for the fourth season.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,479
Given the nature of our program,

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,149
the participants could decide to meet someone new...

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,489
- or reunite with their ex.
- Right.

25
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,220
Which aspect are you more focused on?

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,660
I've never contacted my exes after breakups.

27
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,489
- I see.
- Even when they reached out,

28
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,500
I've never responded to their text messages.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,700
Personally, I don't understand why people get back together.

30
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,169
- I mean, they broke up.
- It's over then for you.

31
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,569
- It's completely over.
- It's over.

32
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,769
Reuniting with an ex doesn't make sense.

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,969
We've already given up...

34
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,970
- on our relationship once.
- That's right.

35
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,309
Even if we get back together, we might want to break up again.

36
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,739
While we watch the clips today, I hope you can be honest...

37
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,909
- and tell us what you think.
- Gosh, of course.

38
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,049
- That sounds good.
- If you suddenly start crying...

39
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,150
when it's not even a sad clip,

40
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,079
we might kick you out.

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,619
- We might kick him out?
- So...

42
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,950
That might happen, actually.

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

44
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,999
I'm kind of torn. Well...

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes?

46
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,900
- I went on a date yesterday.
- Yes.

47
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,809
I'd like to go on one more date...

48
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,140
with Yoo Sik.

49
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,450
- I see. Really?
- But...

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,779
I've never gone on a date with other people yet.

51
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,920
Right.

52
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,419
I wonder if a date with another guy would be better for me.

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,650
That's on my mind too.

54
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,890
If I were you, I would choose...

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,759
to go on a date with everyone...

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,430
because we could only do that here.

57
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,139
Where would we have the chance...

58
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,170
to go on a date with a different guy every day?

59
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,980
Well, that's just my opinion.

60
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,410
Well,

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,819
there aren't a lot of guys left in the house now.

62
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,720
(Baek Hyun, Woo Jin, and Yoo Sik remain in the house.)

63
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll ask Woo Jin.

64
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,230
I've never gone on a date with Woo Jin.

65
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,789
You haven't?

66
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,500
I see. All right then.

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,999
Does that narrow down your choices?

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,930
- Yes.
- Right? Let's do that.

69
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,570
It seemed she was torn about what to do next.

70
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,240
But...

71
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,070
I had somewhat of an idea...

72
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,980
that Hyeon Ji was interested in my ex.

73
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,850
After my decision, her only options were...

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,550
Yoo Sik and Baek Hyun.

75
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,059
If my guess is right,

76
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,590
Baek Hyun is her ex.

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,790
With that, I thought everyone would be happy if I put up with it.

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,859
That's why I told her...

79
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,360
what I was going to do without much hesitation.

80
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,669
So she let Hyeon Ji go on a date with him.

81
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,869
- Right?
- She did?

82
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,199
- She knew Hyeon Ji's ex...
- Yes, she did.

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,369
- and made her choose Yoo Sik.
- Right.

84
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,799
She knew Hyeon Ji's ex was Baek Hyun?

85
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,139
- Right. So she'd choose Yoo Sik.
- So she'd pick Yoo Sik?

86
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,239
- She let that happen. But why?
- Yes.

87
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,309
Is she trying to sort out her feelings?

88
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,849
Hold on. This might be a huge butterfly effect.

89
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,910
- Exactly.
- Right?

90
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,019
- Who's here?
- Pardon?

91
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,250
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

92
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,589
- Do you want to go to a cafe?
- Shall we?

93
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,759
- Yes.
- I was actually going to ask you.

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,359
- Really? Sounds good.
- When should we go?

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
How much time do you need to get ready?

96
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,159
Me? About 40 minutes?

97
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,500
- Or 30 minutes?
- That's great.

98
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,630
- How about 2:30pm?
- Yes, sounds good.

99
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,700
You should go.

100
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,670
He's downstairs, right?

101
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,210
I don't know who it is.

102
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,940
But someone's downstairs.

103
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,280
This is crazy.

104
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,490
(Hyeon Ji is nervous to ask him out on a date.)

105
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,330
(At that time, Yoo Sik is all alone in the living room.)

106
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,239
Why did you pretend you didn't see me just now?

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,840
- What? You were so far away.
- Why did you...

108
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,310
I couldn't call you over.

109
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,610
What were you doing?

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,809
I was just resting upstairs.

111
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,950
Did you have breakfast?

112
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,380
I did. I had curry.

113
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,150
Did you get a chance to talk to other people?

114
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,520
- Did you?
- I talked to Min Kyung.

115
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,860
This is crazy.

116
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,990
Why?

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,700
It just is.

118
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,970
I love how peaceful it is.

119
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,040
Do you want to go out?

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,510
- Well...
- Would you like to go out?

121
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,979
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes. How about going to a cafe?

122
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,050
Shall we? Okay.

123
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,749
Pick the time.

124
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,080
Okay. I will.

125
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,890
I was so nervous and didn't know what to do when I asked him.

126
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,929
He said something like he didn't want to disrupt...

127
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,730
this peaceful moment.

128
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,240
I wondered what he meant by that and if he didn't want to go out.

129
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,180
It made me wonder if I had disturbed his moment.

130
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,410
But he said in the end that we should go out on a date.

131
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
Yes?

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,460
Well, Hyeon Ji...

133
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,859
(Yoo Sik came to see Hyeon Ji.)

134
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,990
Hyeon Ji.

135
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,860
Yoo Sik is outside.

136
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,770
Yes?

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,939
- Gosh.
- Why now of all times?

138
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,800
That's some crazy timing.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,209
- The timing was crazy.
- Why now?

140
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,809
There must've been a lot on Min Kyung's mind...

141
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,209
that morning.

142
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,249
- Totally.
- Her anger meter is going up now.

143
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,379
It's slowly rising up.

144
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,449
But what if this actually pushes her...

145
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,579
to move on?

146
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,249
- Right.
- There might come a moment...

147
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,590
when she gives up.

148
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,249
- If that continues, - I think that's what she might do.

149
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,989
- she might be able to move on...
- Right?

150
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,389
- quite quickly.
- Right.

151
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,859
It's a bit unexpected that she encouraged Hyeon Ji...

152
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,429
to go on a date with Yoo Sik.

153
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,430
I wonder why she did that.

154
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,299
It'd feel weird to see...

155
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,830
my ex getting popular.

156
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,829
To make it worse, two of her roommates...

157
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,969
are interested in Yoo Sik.

158
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,170
- Right.
- Right.

159
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,870
My gosh. Thinking about that just makes me angry.

160
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,010
(He comes down to the 3rd floor to avoid Min Kyung.)

161
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,810
Did everyone eat?

162
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,450
- I didn't.
- Why not?

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,019
- I'm...
- Hello.

164
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,619
- just not hungry.
- Where did you go?

165
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,520
- You were still in the house?
- Yes.

166
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,920
Aren't you hungry?

167
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,259
- Me? I'm not hungry. Did you eat?
- Yes.

168
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,629
No. I didn't. I'm hungry, though.

169
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,630
- You didn't have breakfast?
- Did you eat?

170
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:11,399
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I had breakfast.

171
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,699
- Really?
- Someone made curry.

172
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,169
- Wait. Yoo Sik.
- Yes?

173
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,199
- What did you say?
- Me?

174
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,570
Yes. You're not going to eat?

175
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,670
- What did I say?
- Yes.

176
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,540
I asked if you had breakfast.

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,270
- I didn't.
- What?

178
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,110
I was busy.

179
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,410
- I see.
- You're not going to eat?

180
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,679
I don't know. Should I?

181
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,319
- Yes. Let's eat together.
- Then...

182
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,820
I should eat then.

183
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,550
(Signaling 3:10pm)

184
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,620
(What are you going to wear?)

185
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
What are you going to wear?

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,730
(What about you?)

187
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,660
That's your outfit?

188
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,330
My goodness.

189
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,100
(Stumbling)

190
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,639
(Baek Hyun stepped out has come back.)

191
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
What? I see.

192
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,070
What?

193
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,910
- Gosh, that's some crazy timing.
- Seriously.

194
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,349
She was startled,

195
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,649
- so her shoes came off.
- Right.

196
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,710
How did that happen?

197
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,720
Yoo Sik, do you want to eat then?

198
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,550
(Getting a chance to talk in private is challenging in the house.)

199
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,559
(He ends up having a meal with her.)

200
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,330
I don't know when we'll get to eat next.

201
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,130
(2pm: Min Kyung leaves.)

202
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,740
(He left the house earlier to check his appearance.)

203
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,380
(When he hears her coming down, he pretends to be doing nothing.)

204
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

205
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,860
- Let's leave in a few minutes.
- Okay.

206
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,290
- The GPS isn't working.
- Yes?

207
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm good with directions.

208
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll be your GPS.

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,500
- You're good with directions?
- Yes.

210
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,530
I'm really good with directions.

211
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,239
- Let's go then.
- Okay.

212
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
(Min Kyung and Woo Jin's casual date)

213
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,839
You have to guide me like the GPS.

214
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,010
Okay. I'm so good at that.

215
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,610
Go straight. Or turn left?

216
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,550
- Or turn right? Is it a left turn?
- A left turn?

217
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,179
Gosh, the weather is amazing.

218
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,280
(The GPS seems a bit sloppy.)

219
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,290
Go straight.

220
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,429
- Isn't it nice to come out?
- I love it.

221
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,460
- This is a lot more relaxing...
- Right.

222
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,960
- than staying inside.
- Yes.

223
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,459
When we're inside, we have a lot more people to think about.

224
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,030
- Right.
- So because of that, I couldn't...

225
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,600
help but pay attention to them.

226
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,069
I'm not the type to make the first approach or anything.

227
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,309
- I see.
- I'm not.

228
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,009
I tend to take more interest in women...

229
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,949
- who express their interest to me.
- You...

230
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,349
My feelings grow stronger as my relationship progresses.

231
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,450
I tend to date one person for a long time without much drama.

232
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,819
Then have you had long-term relationships...

233
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,220
Wait. I was supposed to turn right.

234
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,760
- It's okay. I can turn over there.
- We can turn at the next block.

235
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,189
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,500
- It's okay.
- I was focused on our conversation.

237
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,630
I don't mind going around again.

238
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,699
- Actually, I was going...
- Yes.

239
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,740
to ask you to have a cup of coffee with me.

240
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,210
- Really?
- Yes. I didn't know.

241
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,109
This is so touching. I love it.

242
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,480
I've been meaning to ask you too.

243
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,950
- Shall we go inside?
- Yes.

244
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,319
Do you like doing activities on dates?

245
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,420
Yes, I do. I've never had one of those dates.

246
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,119
We can shoot paint guns here.

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,220
(Paint Rabbit)

248
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,530
Let's do this.

249
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,000
- That's cute.
- I love it.

250
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,770
The pants are too short.

251
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
You look cute, though.

252
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
You're tall.

253
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,079
Are you a good shot?

254
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,249
- I'm a great shot.
- Really? You are?

255
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,179
- Are you a good shot?
- Well, I'm as good as...

256
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
a Marine.

257
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,350
Really?

258
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,959
- I've won dolls at shooting booths.
- Really?

259
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
That's not an easy feat.

260
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,820
Well, I win dolls at the booths all the time.

261
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,160
- Yes.
- Really?

262
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,400
(Shooting)

263
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,670
(But for some reason, that doesn't seem to be the case.)

264
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,210
I think you're hitting everything but the rabbit.

265
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,710
(Woo Jin is very serious about this.)

266
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,020
It looks like a rabbit that's been in the rain for hours.

267
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,689
(It's time for Min Kyung to show her skills.)

268
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,760
(Focused)

269
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,830
- What do you think? It looks great.
- That's great.

270
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,470
- You have good aim.
- Totally.

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,439
What if it turns out that you're in the special forces?

272
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,539
- That'd be a surprise.
- That sounds cool.

273
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,380
- It looks like an art piece.
- Seriously.

274
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,050
(Their artworks are complete now.)

275
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,490
You're not going to write, "dummy," right?

276
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,059
(Min Kyung scribbles on his back.)

277
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,520
All done. That's cute.

278
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,789
(Woo Jin, the rabbit from the underworld)

279
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,930
I'll write down my mood today.

280
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,129
I wrote about your rabbit.

281
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,330
- About my rabbit?
- Yes.

282
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,069
- Don't laugh.
- Okay.

283
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,900
(The best, Min Kyung)

284
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,240
(Woo Jin's mood today is the best.)

285
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,950
- Is your bracelet okay?
- Yes.

286
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,050
I can wash it off later.

287
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
My gosh.

288
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,459
- I'm practically...
- What?

289
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,130
- I'm practically washing you.
- Right.

290
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,030
Hold on.

291
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,699
- That's cute.
- Let's go.

292
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,709
Let's go.

293
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,710
(Min Kyung, Woo Jin)

294
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:55,969
They make a good-looking couple.

295
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,339
- Right. They look good together.
- Yes.

296
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,479
After this date, Min Kyung has gone on a date...

297
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,579
with everyone.

298
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,609
- Right.
- With all the guys.

299
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,809
- She's a go-getter.
- Right.

300
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,049
DAWN, what do you prefer?

301
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,519
Do you prefer women who make the first approach to you?

302
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,319
Or do you prefer to make the first move?

303
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,049
Me? I prefer women who make the first move.

304
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,059
- Really?
- So go-getter types?

305
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,719
It's because I'm not good...

306
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,989
- at making the first move.
- I don't think you're that type.

307
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,759
- Right. I can't do that either.
- That's your personality.

308
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,659
Here's how I flirt. When a woman talks to me,

309
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,769
I try to be very responsive. That's how I flirt.

310
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,900
- Being responsive?
- Yes.

311
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,969
- I see.
- When I'm not interested,

312
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,369
- I can't carry on a conversation.
- You don't talk to them.

313
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,400
- Right, I don't.
- I see.

314
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,839
In my mind, I flirted with them.

315
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,740
But they didn't catch that.

316
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,280
Right. That's possible.

317
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,909
Let's go inside.

318
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,980
(Ulu Ulu)

319
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,150
- The vibe here is amazing. Yes.
- Right?

320
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,320
- Here you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

321
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,190
Great.

322
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,089
Cheers.

323
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm curious about how the sangria tastes.

324
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,270
- Do you want to have a sip?
- Yes.

325
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,329
- Do you want mine?
- Yes.

326
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,439
I like citrusy drinks.

327
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,170
(They switch their drinks and have a sip.)

328
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,939
Your drink is super strong.

329
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,840
- Mine is like soda.
- That's like soda. Mine is strong.

330
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,210
Yours is strong, and mine is sweet.

331
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,710
This is good.

332
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,980
- This looks good.
- It looks really good.

333
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,090
Gosh, can you help me?

334
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Thanks.

335
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,020
- Is it good?
- Yes.

336
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Isn't it good?

337
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,829
This is so good.

338
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,130
- Did you know? Yun Nyeong, - Yes?

339
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,499
- Baek Hyun, and Yoo Sik...
- And Yoo Sik?

340
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,399
- They stayed up until 6am.
- wanted to see the sunrise.

341
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,410
Right.

342
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,240
I was a bit surprised.

343
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,740
I stayed with them until 5:30am. But I was tired, so I went upstairs.

344
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,110
My gosh, that's crazy.

345
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,920
They stayed up that late.

346
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,659
When you have a lot on your mind, do you...

347
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,059
- I'm like that.
- So you just go to sleep?

348
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,760
No. I have trouble sleeping.

349
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,729
So I thought that I should get to know them a little better...

350
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,059
and spend more time with them. So I went downstairs.

351
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,100
Everyone was in the same boat. They couldn't fall asleep.

352
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,340
I was tired,

353
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,569
- but there were people...
- Right.

354
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,770
I wanted to talk to.

355
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,310
As for me,

356
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,709
my feelings might show on my face.

357
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,780
- Yes.
- So I try to avoid him.

358
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,979
But I could see that...

359
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,950
those who stayed up together became closer.

360
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,920
- Because they stayed up late. Yes.
- After staying up late together...

361
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,189
I wonder...

362
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,320
- if I should stay up today.
- You'll stay up?

363
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,990
What kind of woman are you drawn to appearance-wise?

364
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,130
I'm really into women who have fair skin.

365
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,170
I often say a fair-skinned woman with a small face is my type.

366
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,140
- This is crazy.
- What do you mean?

367
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,679
When I'm in a relationship, I often tease my girlfriend.

368
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
That sounds fun.

369
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,419
I like keeping it casual as well as dressing up for dates.

370
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,850
I'm really into both dates.

371
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,120
So it's a relationship built on friendship.

372
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,160
I prefer relationships like that to uncomfortable ones.

373
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,130
I was romantically drawn to her.

374
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,069
The most important aspect of relationships for me...

375
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,600
is having fun with my partner.

376
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,670
I had most fun with her.

377
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,180
I could feel that we had grown closer.

378
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,349
I became more curious about her and wanted to spend...

379
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,750
more time with her.

380
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,719
I don't know the whole story here.

381
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,119
But this is based on my observations about Min Kyung.

382
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,849
She went on a date with every guy in the house other than her ex.

383
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,289
- She did.
- Then...

384
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,129
she will come to a decision. She will make up her mind.

385
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,389
But I don't think she can move on...

386
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,660
- from Yoo Sik.
- I see.

387
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,229
In my opinion, she might be more confused about her feelings.

388
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,899
But I think if Woo Jin or another guy were...

389
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,510
to pursue her more boldly,

390
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,739
it would be enough for Min Kyung to change her mind.

391
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,079
That's true.

392
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,749
If the male version of Ji Yeon made a move on Min Kyung...

393
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,049
like she did on Won Kyu,

394
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,249
it might be enough...

395
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,549
- to change Min Kyung's mind.
- Right.

396
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,990
We need to give them more time to see where this is going.

397
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,460
This is so tasty.

398
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,490
It's like my mom made this for me.

399
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,530
This curry?

400
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,600
I love curry too.

401
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,629
Do you like curry udon?

402
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,630
Curry udon sounds good.

403
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,470
Do you prefer curry udon or curry rice?

404
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,170
I prefer to have curry with rice.

405
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,140
- Same here.
- Do you like udon?

406
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,240
Well, that's the thing with me and noodles.

407
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,849
I don't go out and have kalguksu, udon, and naengmyeon...

408
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,150
unless I have to.

409
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,420
- You said you liked tomato pasta.
- Pasta.

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Are you going somewhere?

411
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,719
- Yes.
- Where...

412
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,050
- I see. Have fun.
- I...

413
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,559
I'll leave in a bit.

414
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,589
- Really?
- Yes.

415
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,959
Do you want to join us then?

416
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,860
- Sounds good.
- Come here.

417
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,599
- There are so many stairs here.
- There are, right?

418
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,799
- There are so many stairs.
- Right?

419
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
(His ex joins when he's talking to another woman.)

420
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:47,970
It's a good workout.

421
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,210
I should try it.

422
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,780
(Inhaling sharply)

423
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,380
What were you talking about?

424
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,020
Where did you go?

425
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,249
Me? I had to go out for a personal matter.

426
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,250
(Baek Hyun suddenly leaves the table.)

427
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,760
I look horrible.

428
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
Right.

429
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,799
(He joins them after putting on his glasses.)

430
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,270
How did you sleep?

431
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,070
The bed is uncomfortable.

432
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,670
- It's uncomfortable, right?
- Really?

433
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,340
I'm not a sensitive sleeper.

434
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,179
I sleep well even on the floor.

435
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,509
- Really?
- Yes. I sleep so well here.

436
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,049
- You're so blessed.
- Really?

437
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,349
Yes. Maybe,

438
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,620
that's why you couldn't get a good night's sleep.

439
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,789
- I doubt that.
- Is that so?

440
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,790
It's just...

441
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,360
(Meanwhile, Yoo Sik is done preparing for the date.)

442
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
Yoo Sik.

443
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,990
Is it you, Yoo Sik?

444
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,330
You're wearing my favorite shirt.

445
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,099
I'm really casual with him.

446
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,429
- What if he's older than me?
- That's their bromance.

447
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,570
- I'd be in trouble.
- I think he's older than you.

448
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,210
Yoo Sik. Do you think we have a big age gap or not?

449
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,080
Even if you're older, it would be only two years.

450
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,350
You think I'm two years older than you?

451
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,150
You're not older than me?

452
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,580
- I'm two years older than you?
- No?

453
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,820
- No.
- Everyone looks so young.

454
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,490
You look younger than me.

455
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,820
- Me?
- Yes.

456
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,859
But how come you think I'm two years older than you?

457
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,130
Listen.

458
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,599
- I'm joking.
- You seem to be at ease...

459
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,529
like you've been through a lot in life.

460
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,800
Right. She looks experienced.

461
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,070
(He naturally leaves the house.)

462
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,310
He's so funny.

463
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,379
(Hyeon Ji leaves when Yoo Sik leaves.)

464
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,840
She's so tall.

465
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,080
See you later.

466
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,350
- She's leaving?
- Yes.

467
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Already?

468
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,520
She's leaving when she just got here.

469
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,490
I guess she needs to attend a personal matter.

470
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,990
On her first day?

471
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,070
It looks so windy outside. Will there be a storm ?

472
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,040
What's going on?

473
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,769
- That looks like my heart.
- Your heart?

474
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,039
- That's what's happening inside.
- Why?

475
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,780
It's making me weak.

476
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,309
- It looks like his heart?
- Wait.

477
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,179
- I was going to say that.
- I knew he'd something like that.

478
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,850
"Is that what's happening in his heart?"

479
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,789
Baek Hyun can't stop paying attention to her.

480
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,789
But the thing is, they left one after another.

481
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,119
- Right. One after another.
- It was so obvious.

482
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,490
Right.

483
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,740
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

484
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,710
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

485
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,710
(Park Ji Hyeon)

486
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,580
(Kim Woo Jin)

487
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,379
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

488
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,250
(Jung Won Kyu)

489
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,980
(Hong Ji Yeon)

490
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,930
(EXchange 4)

491
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,840
(Episode 6, The Speed of Breakup Depends on the Person)

492
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,909
(Seongsu-dong...)

493
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,170
(on a sunny day)

494
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,579
- It's really nice weather.
- Yes.

495
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,850
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik on a casual date)

496
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,120
(Pantone Classic, Seongsu)

497
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,169
I didn't get to talk to others a lot.

498
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,539
- Okay.
- When I woke up this morning,

499
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,070
I didn't see that many people.

500
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,310
Still, I got to talk to Min Kyung. She's nice.

501
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,819
I told Min Kyung...

502
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,949
that we met yesterday.

503
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,290
- Did you?
- Yes.

504
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,560
Earlier...

505
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,589
Oh, I told her while eating.

506
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,590
Oh, why did you...

507
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,859
We're going to say it anyway,

508
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,530
but I asked Min Kyung to keep it a secret.

509
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,710
I don't know anything right now.

510
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,639
You must've grasped each other by now.

511
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,250
I don't know what you're like...

512
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,580
or what you like.

513
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,020
What do you want to know?

514
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,259
Ask me your top three questions.

515
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,990
- I'm talking about you.
- Me?

516
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,330
You don't know what I like?

517
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,829
The type of person you like.

518
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,330
(Hyeon Ji has many questions about Yoo Sik.)

519
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,629
I prefer someone...

520
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,200
who's innocent.

521
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,410
And...

522
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,710
just talk a lot.

523
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,380
What?

524
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,749
That's all you said yesterday too.

525
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,850
To be honest, I don't remember what I said yesterday.

526
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,979
- Gosh.
- It's driving me crazy.

527
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
(It's not easy to grasp Yoo Sik's taste.)

528
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,090
I kept shrinking and expanding yesterday.

529
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,090
Someone easy to communicate with.

530
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,360
But you never know just by meeting once.

531
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,290
- I'd never know.
- Then how many times?

532
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,400
How many times?

533
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,730
At least...

534
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,640
At least 3 or 4 times of a deep conversation.

535
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,669
Just by meeting 3 or 4 times...

536
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,380
I still wouldn't know.

537
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,880
But once I'm certain,

538
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,280
it's not a fling anymore.

539
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,480
When I'm certain.

540
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,050
What about you?

541
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,550
Before going out?

542
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,460
It doesn't really matter to me.

543
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,490
Go by your guts?

544
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,030
Is it okay to ask this?

545
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,040
If your ex dates someone else, will you be able to root for him?

546
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,010
I'm not exactly that cool.

547
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,670
No?

548
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,610
Are you...

549
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,120
okay with this situation?

550
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,490
I try not to mind.

551
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,760
- But you do?
- I keep...

552
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,059
But I have a feeling...

553
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,560
whom she talked to the most.

554
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
Is it okay to say this?

555
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,130
My ex is...

556
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,970
If I'm guessing correctly,

557
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,940
it's 100 percent Baek Hyun.

558
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,340
- I see.
- What?

559
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,309
- I like this.
- Gosh.

560
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,579
- They are...
- They are...

561
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,749
- They're making it crazy.
- They are...

562
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,150
- This is crazy.
- They are both...

563
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,990
He's the type my ex likes.

564
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,860
I think I know who that is.

565
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,360
What?

566
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,060
- You think so?
- Maybe not?

567
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,959
I'm worried...

568
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,830
about making a mistake while talking.

569
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,330
But I told Baek Hyun about this already.

570
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,239
That he's your ex's ideal type?

571
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,970
If my ex were going to choose anyone,

572
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,540
it'd be him.

573
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,210
- And he said...
- What did he say?

574
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,779
if his ex were going to choose anyone, it'd be me.

575
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,020
I see.

576
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,219
So I told him he has my support.

577
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,890
If it's Baek Hyun, it'd only make sense.

578
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,130
Are you both that type?

579
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,960
Love over friendship?

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,330
It's not love over friendship.

581
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,470
I must get what I want.

582
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,109
Yoo Sik and Baek Hyun...

583
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,640
wouldn't fight over me.

584
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,340
I thought...

585
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,410
something like that wouldn't happen.

586
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,050
I just thought they'd even talk about that.

587
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,890
Who knows?

588
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,490
- What?
- Today...

589
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,699
- Never mind.
- What?

590
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,230
I'm getting a lot on my mind here.

591
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,170
Okay.

592
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,639
Earlier, Yoo Sik said...

593
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,740
he didn't want to break the peace.

594
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,909
Judging by the situation...

595
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,809
- It'd break tonight.
- Yes, it'd break.

596
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,579
Yoo Sik might as well go to bed early tonight.

597
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,810
(As Min Kyung requested)

598
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,820
He should go straight to bed when he gets home.

599
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,379
- He should go to bed at 7pm.
- Yes.

600
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,389
Do you think he'd go to bed?

601
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,350
I'm the opposite. If she told me to sleep early,

602
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,919
I wouldn't sleep on purpose.

603
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,119
I wouldn't sleep either.

604
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,589
- Really?
- You shouldn't.

605
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,459
While he was on a date,

606
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,229
he said he doesn't flirt once he's firm.

607
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,929
It's ironic.

608
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,529
Think about it. In a way,

609
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,639
he's only dated Min Kyung.

610
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,069
That means he has only one data.

611
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,539
- I was thinking the same.
- Right?

612
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,069
He was trying...

613
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,609
to appeal to Hyeon Ji.

614
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,779
- Right.
- Or it's a notice.

615
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,449
Yes, it's a notice that if he's certain,

616
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,720
- He'd go straight to her.
- he'd go straight to her.

617
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,990
What do you want for dinner?

618
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,760
Japanese...

619
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,190
Futomaki or something like that.

620
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,260
I'm okay with anything. I'm not a picky eater.

621
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,930
(Yoichi, Seongsu)

622
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

623
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,640
(The futomaki Hyeon Ji wanted is served.)

624
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,750
- Try this.
- Yes.

625
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,280
- Eat.
- Yes.

626
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,189
Eat. These are clean chopsticks.

627
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,160
Oh, thank you.

628
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,769
(Hesitant)

629
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,139
Is this shrimp cooked?

630
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,140
(Fried shrimp in the futomaki)

631
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,670
- I...
- Why?

632
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,309
- You can't eat raw shrimp?
- No.

633
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,910
I could probably eat raw shrimp,

634
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,009
but I don't eat cooked shrimp.

635
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,279
(Yoo Sik can't have shrimp due to the crustacean allergy.)

636
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,050
- I can just remove it.
- Why?

637
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,290
I can't eat the crustacean.

638
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,420
- Really?
- But it's okay.

639
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,430
It's fine.

640
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,330
- You can give it to me.
- The shrimp?

641
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,829
- Do you like shrimp?
- Yes.

642
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,970
Fried shrimp is tasty.

643
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,900
Thank you.

644
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

645
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,710
I didn't know.

646
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,210
Because I didn't tell you.

647
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,480
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

648
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,590
- This is good.
- Yes.

649
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,059
- What?
- I'm never...

650
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,160
- picky about food.
- Okay.

651
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,130
I don't like what I'm doing right now.

652
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,110
(He gives the shrimp again.)

653
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,210
Thank you.

654
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,380
I'm never picky about anything.

655
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,050
Earlier you said you could eat everything.

656
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,280
I didn't think I'd get caught.

657
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,490
What?

658
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,320
It's funny.

659
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,130
This is good though.

660
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,670
Do you care...

661
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,470
about the age?

662
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,870
As long as not too young or not too old.

663
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,840
About a short relationship...

664
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,879
Was it you who mentioned...

665
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,980
the short relationship and the long relationship?

666
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,720
Was it someone else?

667
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,550
Someone who had ten short relationships...

668
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,420
or one long relationship.

669
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,790
By long, how long?

670
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,790
Ten years?

671
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,029
If it's 10 years versus 10 relationships,

672
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,400
I'd choose ten relationships.

673
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,170
I see.

674
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,140
Ten relationships? Then how about one hundred?

675
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,740
- "One hundred." - He doesn't like that answer.

676
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,240
The answer is fixed.

677
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,650
Then how about one hundred?

678
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,079
Ten years versus one hundred relationships.

679
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,120
(Changing the question)

680
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,850
It should be the same period.

681
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,750
Fifty relationships in ten years.

682
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,260
- Fifty relationships in ten years.
- The same person for ten years?

683
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
Even if he dated 50 people in 10 years,

684
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,300
as long as he spends the rest of his life with me.

685
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,000
Then you can be in a long relationship together?

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,770
That also makes sense.

687
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,740
Isn't that better?

688
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,039
- Or...
- It doesn't matter to me.

689
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,580
- No?
- No.

690
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,950
Then a realistic...

691
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,179
A date who's too realistic...

692
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,319
versus a date who's too sentimental. Is that right?

693
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,760
Didn't you pick the sentimental one?

694
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,160
- No, the realistic one.
- The realistic one?

695
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,660
Realistic?

696
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,510
Don't people often think those who had a long relationship...

697
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,010
are guaranteed?

698
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,950
No? I don't know.

699
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,550
You're not paying attention, are you?

700
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,550
- Me? Why?
- Yes.

701
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,780
What did I say?

702
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,350
A long relationship...

703
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,119
- Why?
- You...

704
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,320
(The man with a long relationship experience can't get out of it.)

705
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,690
What?

706
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,460
I wasn't paying attention? Why?

707
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,130
We were talking about a date who's too realistic...

708
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,569
versus a date who's too sentimental...

709
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,699
- Were we talking about that?
- Yes.

710
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,840
Okay.

711
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
- Exactly. That was out of nowhere.
- Exactly.

712
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,409
He can't get it out of his head.

713
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,540
He didn't get the answer he wanted.

714
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,110
We were talking about a date who's too realistic...

715
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,379
versus a date who's too sentimental...

716
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,479
- Were we talking about that?
- Yes.

717
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,650
Okay.

718
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,520
Being too realistic...

719
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,390
is helpful.

720
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,729
- This is crazy.
- Why did you suddenly mention...

721
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,160
the long relationship?

722
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,900
This is crazy.

723
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,770
You say crazy often.

724
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,010
Me? Because it is crazy.

725
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,510
I got the feeling that he still finds me uneasy.

726
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,650
I don't know what he thought about that date.

727
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,049
Even though she joined the latest,

728
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,289
I went on a date with her the most,

729
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,060
and I spent the most time with her.

730
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,430
I feel comfortable.

731
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,699
That was Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik's second date.

732
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,459
I think Yoo Sik...

733
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,199
has feelings for Hyeon Ji.

734
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,399
- I think he's nervous.
- He's nervous.

735
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,969
The fact that he's nervous...

736
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,009
and sloppy shows that he likes her.

737
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,139
I think that was more shameful...

738
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,209
that the first date.

739
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,179
After seeing how Yoo Sik acted,

740
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,549
she might want to...

741
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,790
see someone else.

742
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,320
I see.

743
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,559
Do you prefer many short relationships...

744
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,989
- or one long relationship?
- Gosh.

745
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,759
- One long relationship is better.
- One long relationship?

746
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,829
- For me, it is.
- Yes.

747
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,799
I think dating ten people might be better.

748
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,329
- Because...
- For diversity?

749
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,839
It's not about...

750
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,569
meeting diverse people.

751
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,069
If you date the same person...

752
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,910
for a long time,

753
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,939
you can't get rid of the trace.

754
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,010
The ex's trace?

755
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,950
It's many relationships for me.

756
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,449
For sure.

757
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,779
But don't you get the thought,

758
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,849
"This person dated 20 people in that short period of time..."

759
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,589
"but none of them lasted more than a month?"

760
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,949
- Is there a problem?
- "This person can't date..."

761
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,219
- Right. You'd get that thought.
- "for more than a month."

762
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,659
Of course, it'd give you a lot of experience...

763
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,529
You never know until you meet that person.

764
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,660
- Right.
- Yes.

765
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,599
I want desserts.

766
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
- Desserts?
- Yes, desserts.

767
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:55,200
Do you want me to make something with chocolate?

768
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,329
- There's cheesecake.
- Let's have cheesecake.

769
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,339
(Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong got to date in the house.)

770
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,369
Shall we melt chocolate and cover it?

771
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,440
That sounds delicious.

772
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,840
(They decide to make chocolate cheesecake.)

773
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,650
Is everyone else out on a date?

774
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,410
I don't know.

775
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,350
Don't you want to go on a date?

776
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,790
Me? Well, I don't know.

777
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,190
Do you want to go out?

778
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,260
- Why?
- Do you want to?

779
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,030
- Go on a date?
- Yes.

780
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,870
Do you want to go somewhere after making this?

781
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,430
I haven't showered yet.

782
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,940
Really? Go shower.

783
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,140
- Why?
- Then...

784
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,580
do you want to go on a carpentry date tomorrow?

785
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,779
- A carpentry date?
- Yes.

786
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,150
- I'd love that.
- Me too.

787
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,480
It's a bummer.

788
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,490
While talking to Baek Hyun,

789
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,959
I thought I wanted to...

790
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,559
go on a date with him...

791
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,700
and have a serious conversation with him.

792
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,999
When I asked him to go on a date,

793
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,200
he said yes.

794
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,240
So I was happy.

795
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,870
(Yun Nyeong's request made their date tomorrow possible.)

796
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,810
Is it any good?

797
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,650
Put it in the freezer?

798
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,219
We can enjoy it.

799
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,720
(Putting the chocolate cheesecake in the fridge)

800
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,320
I have a question.

801
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,890
What's your ideal type again?

802
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,690
- My ideal type?
- Yes.

803
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,390
Someone with big eyes.

804
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,730
Big eyes? Really?

805
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,870
I said I like someone calm.

806
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,740
I like someone calm because...

807
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,869
I'm easily influenced by others.

808
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,640
So if my girlfriend is calm,

809
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,179
I become very calm.

810
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,310
Really?

811
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,910
What if it's someone cheerful?

812
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,919
- I become cheerful too.
- Really?

813
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,290
That means you play along.

814
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,989
I think I change.

815
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,320
It happens naturally.

816
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,629
But you know I...

817
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,700
Know what?

818
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,160
- What?
- What do I know?

819
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,500
I sent all three texts.

820
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,870
- Is it okay to say that?
- No?

821
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,270
But it's obvious.

822
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,240
(The first day)

823
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,080
(Yun Nyeong)

824
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,910
(It's nice to see how bright you are.)

825
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,820
(Baek Hyun texted Yun Nyeong on the first day.)

826
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,619
(Second day)

827
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,820
(Yun Nyeong)

828
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,419
(Thank you for the cereal.)

829
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,790
(And we also got to talk a lot for the first time today.)

830
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,699
(Third day)

831
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,200
(Yun Nyeong)

832
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,400
(Jean-Michel Basquiat)

833
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,070
(He texted Yun Nyeong every single day.)

834
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,280
I didn't know on the first day.

835
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,050
I thought it was strange...

836
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,779
because I didn't think we talked much.

837
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,980
Because I didn't talk much.

838
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,479
Exactly.

839
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,260
Everyone went on a date,

840
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,060
so I was expecting everyone to send it to their dates.

841
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,900
It depends on the person.

842
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,430
Your personality...

843
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,640
is rare. There are many bright people,

844
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,680
but being bright is different...

845
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,250
from making others happy.

846
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,550
Really?

847
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,350
That's a nice compliment.

848
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,519
- Do you want the dessert?
- Now?

849
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,690
- I think it's hardened by now.
- Shall we?

850
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,060
(He checks on the chocolate cheesecake in the fridge.)

851
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,930
It looks pretty good.

852
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,600
Can you believe it?

853
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,870
(He likes how it looks.)

854
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,140
Nice plating.

855
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,210
It looks pretty good, right?

856
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,950
- It's nicely covered.
- Look at the texture.

857
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,950
We don't have to go out for the dessert.

858
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,590
- It's good.
- Is it?

859
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,259
(Exclaiming)

860
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,690
It's good. The chocolate tastes awesome.

861
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,130
I need some sugar.

862
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,900
I can't believe how good it is.

863
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,230
This is good.

864
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,639
It feels like we live here alone.

865
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,000
(A private dessert time in their private house)

866
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,209
It might be better to talk inside than going out.

867
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,779
They're dating at home.

868
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,039
- Yes.
- Totally.

869
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,509
- They're alone in the house.
- Yes.

870
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,309
Baek Hyun texted Yun Nyeong...

871
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,679
even after the date...

872
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,549
- with Min Kyung.
- Yes.

873
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,919
He must've received so much energy...

874
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,689
from Yun Nyeong.

875
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,560
- They have the same taste.
- Right.

876
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,530
(Fosaro)

877
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,400
(Ji Yeon and Won Kyu's casual date)

878
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,470
- How about a toast?
- Sure.

879
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,770
Cheers.

880
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,980
- Today, - Yes?

881
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,480
I plan to...

882
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,650
drink more without restraining myself.

883
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,420
Why?

884
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,719
Then it'll be easier for me to talk.

885
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,760
- Really?
- Yes.

886
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,829
Then I'll catch up with you.

887
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,930
- No, don't do that.
- Why not?

888
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,000
You'll struggle later.

889
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,770
We might be drinking more tonight.

890
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,840
Last night at home,

891
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,070
I had a serious conversation with Ji Hyeon...

892
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,180
for the first time.

893
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,610
- At night?
- Yes, Ji Hyeon said...

894
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,279
I looked older than her.

895
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,180
She said I looked 2 or 3 years older.

896
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,319
Like you,

897
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,459
- Are you the oldest among women?
- I became the oldest.

898
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,920
How does it feel?

899
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,289
It feels...

900
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,600
- Not good, right?
- Yes.

901
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,969
- Here's your sashimi platter.
- Thank you.

902
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,970
(The food they ordered is served.)

903
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,199
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

904
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,240
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

905
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,470
- Let's try this first.
- Let's try this first.

906
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
- Is it good?
- Yes.

907
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,250
This is really good.

908
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Right?

909
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,320
You haven't got to know all men yet.

910
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,159
Who's the next guy you want to get to know?

911
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,359
If I get...

912
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,789
a chance to go on five dates,

913
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,729
I want to go on all five dates with you.

914
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,570
(I want to go on all five dates with you.)

915
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,270
At the time...

916
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,639
Should I say she was bold?

917
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,410
That made me relax. It was nice of her.

918
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,980
I like that.

919
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,420
You don't know my age or occupation yet.

920
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,320
In that case,

921
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,759
your opinion could change based on the information.

922
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,330
- Your age and occupation?
- Yes, isn't it possible?

923
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,900
Even if you're in your 40s, I'd still consider you.

924
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,570
That's how I am.

925
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't look like I'm in my 40s, right?

926
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,710
Right.

927
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,450
I don't know.

928
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,280
If my mom were watching this, she'd say, "What's wrong with her?"

929
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,150
I like being with him.

930
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Anyway, that's how I feel.

931
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,960
Despite how I feel about you,

932
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,599
I hope that you will decide...

933
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,560
based on how you feel.

934
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,230
- Okay.
- That's what this show is about.

935
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,100
We have to go to the garden.

936
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,669
I go there every morning.

937
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,870
- Really?
- Yes.

938
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,710
- Usually...
- What time do you go?

939
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,809
I think I went there around 10am today.

940
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,779
- Really?
- When I get up,

941
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,080
- Do you go there?
- I go there.

942
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,849
- Let's go there together.
- Yes.

943
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,220
I didn't know that you went there.

944
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,560
- Let's go there tomorrow morning.
- Let's go tomorrow morning.

945
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,530
How about going out secretly at night in our pajamas?

946
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,260
- I see.
- To the terrace?

947
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,569
(Spellbound by Ji Yeon's whisper)

948
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,800
She's driving me crazy.

949
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,239
She doesn't have to whisper over there.

950
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,539
- No one else is around.
- Exactly.

951
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,170
She seems like someone who makes ASMR.

952
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,510
- It keeps ringing in my ears.
- I totally agree.

953
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,779
- I really like it.
- Right? Isn't it great?

954
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,379
It's not easy for girls.

955
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,249
Girls, that's seriously good.

956
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,449
Speaking quietly in this situation...

957
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,050
won't be easy to learn.

958
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,920
How about going out secretly at night in our pajamas?

959
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,890
- I see.
- To the terrace?

960
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,630
No one can see us from outside.

961
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,199
I heard that you can see everything from outside.

962
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,630
- Really?
- Yes.

963
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,069
People asked me what I was doing there alone.

964
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,340
- Really?
- Yes.

965
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,640
Or there's a terrace on the fourth floor.

966
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,470
- Have you been there?
- No, I haven't.

967
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,739
I've been there once.

968
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,540
- If we go there...
- I don't think many go there.

969
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,180
We could go there too.

970
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,849
The last one.

971
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,120
(Now there's a secret between them.)

972
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,420
Going on dates with Won Kyu is...

973
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,230
nice and fun.

974
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,730
As of now, Ji Yeon is...

975
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,870
the one I'm interested in the most.

976
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,070
Compared to before,

977
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,970
it felt more pleasant.

978
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,550
My heart fluttered more than before.

979
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,680
(Everyone came back home to Pyeongchang-dong House.)

980
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,179
What are you eating? Pasta?

981
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,619
- Yes, do you want some?
- Can you make some for me?

982
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,449
- Go ahead and eat.
- There's just enough for two.

983
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,490
I'm so hungry.

984
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,960
Do we put trash in the laundry room?

985
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,260
- Yes.
- The laundry room?

986
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,600
- Hello.
- Did you go to work today?

987
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,939
I can't tell you.

988
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,940
Okay, but you're being so harsh.

989
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,380
What did you do today?

990
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Today?

991
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,980
This is crazy.

992
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
Today?

993
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,049
I got up later than usual.

994
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,689
- Really?
- I went to bed late last night.

995
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,259
I heard that people hung out until 6am.

996
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,160
I went to bed at 6:30am. When I got up, it was so quiet in the house.

997
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,499
- I decided to be alone and took...
- Really?

998
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,399
a long shower. When I came out, there were many people.

999
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
That's nice.

1000
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,600
You must have gotten up early this morning.

1001
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,040
Me? I did.

1002
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,840
- See you later.
- Bye.

1003
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,719
Yoo Sik becomes more playful around her.

1004
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,279
He looks very comfortable with Ji Hyeon.

1005
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,249
- He looks more at ease with her.
- Yes, definitely.

1006
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,049
Compared to "this is crazy" a moment ago,

1007
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,219
- it was different.
- They sounded different.

1008
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,589
- They don't mean the same.
- He said it with joy.

1009
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,660
"This is crazy."

1010
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,059
I bet he likes people who make him become more playful.

1011
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,130
Right, and Ji Hyeon is one of them.

1012
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,530
Where did everyone go?

1013
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,000
- What?
- Where did you go?

1014
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,900
I stayed in the house. I cleaned up.

1015
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,140
You protected the house today.

1016
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,579
Everyone took turns seeing you...

1017
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,680
- Right.
- at home.

1018
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,320
Was it while making chocolate? Did you eat it?

1019
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,750
- He made chocolate?
- I was startled.

1020
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,119
- I made it, and it was so good.
- Really?

1021
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,890
- Yes.
- Gosh, now I'm curious.

1022
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,459
- Do you want to see it?
- He's definitely a chef.

1023
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,030
Where did you make the chocolate?

1024
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,230
There was chocolate at home, so I melted it.

1025
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,730
He must be a chef at the Silla Seoul.

1026
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,600
Look, doesn't it look quite good?

1027
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,729
You're right.

1028
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,340
- Did you make it here?
- Yes.

1029
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,770
There was also cheesecake.

1030
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,670
That's amazing.

1031
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,580
When I went out, he was alone with Yun Nyeong.

1032
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,919
I thought, "While I wasn't home,"

1033
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,179
"what happened?"

1034
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,550
"What were they doing?

1035
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,089
Because of such thoughts,

1036
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,930
I found myself lost in thought.

1037
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,800
You can't say that.

1038
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
What?

1039
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:10,729
- That you're a hotel chef?
- Yes.

1040
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,770
I have a hunch.

1041
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,270
He's also a chef.

1042
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,739
- I'm only an assistant.
- Seriously...

1043
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,740
He's a head chef.

1044
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,179
All of a sudden? Wait.

1045
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,380
- Seriously...
- He's a headchef..

1046
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,080
All of a sudden? Wait.

1047
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,679
- I'm going to check it out.
- Me too.

1048
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,979
(Suddenly, the doorbell rings.)

1049
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,720
- Shall we go outside together?
- Yes.

1050
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,320
There's a mailbox over here.

1051
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,020
Really?

1052
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,190
What could it be?

1053
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,799
We have to open it with everyone.

1054
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,830
Here it is.

1055
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,599
When the doorbell rang yesterday,

1056
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,470
- there was nothing in the mailbox.
- Why did I get so nervous?

1057
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,240
We were wondering why there was no mail, but there was you instead.

1058
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,439
(While Ji Hyeon and Hyeon Ji go up with the letter)

1059
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
Do you want to look?

1060
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
A card arrived.

1061
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,619
- What?
- A card arrived.

1062
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,219
- Where is it?
- A card?

1063
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,489
- Okay.
- Come out when you're ready.

1064
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,520
Okay.

1065
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,160
(Knocking on the girls' room)

1066
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,090
- May I come in?
- Yes.

1067
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,490
A card arrived.

1068
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:11,989
(The news is spreading instantly.)

1069
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,530
- Come out when you're ready.
- Okay.

1070
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,530
We can't take a look at it without alcohol.

1071
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,630
Shall I bring some glasses?

1072
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,539
- Shall we bring them?
- Let's bring the glasses.

1073
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,540
Okay.

1074
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,639
Ji Yeon, you have to read it today.

1075
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,670
(Everyone is in the living room.)

1076
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,440
I feel nervous.

1077
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,850
- Shall we clink glasses?
- Shall we?

1078
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,880
- Do you want this?
- Cheers.

1079
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,320
- Would you like some?
- What?

1080
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,560
- He asked her if she wanted it.
- I want some water.

1081
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,060
Give me some water.

1082
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,660
You can reveal your occupation right now.

1083
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,170
However, you can't reveal any other information.

1084
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,340
- Only your occupation?
- Only your occupation.

1085
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,669
We have to reveal our occupation...

1086
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,010
- before revealing our age?
- Only your occupation.

1087
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,210
My heart is beating fast.

1088
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,680
This is fun.

1089
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,750
Since I read it out aloud, I'll reveal my occupation first.

1090
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,649
Shouldn't we guess her occupation before?

1091
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,849
- Shall we guess?
- Shall we guess now?

1092
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,890
Okay.

1093
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,390
- Ji Yeon...
- A therapist.

1094
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,290
- It suits her.
- Someone who heals others' hearts.

1095
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,200
An English teacher.

1096
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,200
Yes, a teacher suits you.

1097
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,840
Based on my feeling, she's more of a florist.

1098
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,300
You seem like someone who runs a flower shop.

1099
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,240
I bet she makes things like clothes.

1100
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,010
- A designer?
- A fashion designer.

1101
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,580
I work at an office.

1102
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,450
I'm a web designer.

1103
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,889
- A web designer?
- It suits you.

1104
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:45,890
You're intelligent.

1105
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,159
I majored in industrial design,

1106
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,329
and I currently work as a web designer...

1107
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,600
at an advertising and marketing company.

1108
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,369
Our company specializes...

1109
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,200
in advertising in the industrial complex.

1110
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,869
For each project,

1111
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:07,479
I'm responsible for overall advertising and design...

1112
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,350
including catalogs, leaflets, videos, and websites.

1113
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,120
Just in case, we'll keep the domain host.

1114
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,920
(Hong Ji Yeon, web designer)

1115
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,389
- A web designer?
- It suits you.

1116
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,430
You're intelligent.

1117
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,299
Do you use UX web design?

1118
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,900
Yes, UX and UI.

1119
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,300
It suits her well.

1120
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,539
I've been curious about people who work at an office.

1121
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,540
I thought that it was good.

1122
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,380
It's stable without big changes.

1123
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,349
- My gosh.
- That's amazing.

1124
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,479
Is your office also in Songpa?

1125
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,620
- My office is in Gangnam.
- Gangnam?

1126
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,950
- A web designer?
- It suits her.

1127
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,760
- Do you want to pick the next one?
- Shall I?

1128
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,119
- Goodness.
- Someone of the opposite sex.

1129
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,190
Someone of the opposite sex?

1130
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,790
I will pick...

1131
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,730
Won Kyu.

1132
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,359
(Ji Yeon picked Won Kyu.)

1133
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,070
- Why are you exclaiming?
- We finally find out.

1134
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,529
We finally find out.

1135
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,640
(Everyone is excited to hear about Won Kyu's occupation.)

1136
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,980
I've been curious about him the most.

1137
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,649
I'm so curious.

1138
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,410
- Shouldn't there be a drumroll?
- Could you guess mine too?

1139
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,879
Guess? Okay.

1140
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,350
An owner of a Japanese restaurant.

1141
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,790
I really think you'd work in the financial district in Yeouido.

1142
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,619
- An office worker.
- I see you...

1143
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,490
as someone who owns five gyms.

1144
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,299
- A businessman?
- A businessman.

1145
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,360
- Yes.
- A businessman.

1146
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,099
I bet he's a tax accountant...

1147
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,840
or a patent attorney. A specialized job.

1148
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,440
He'd look great in a suit.

1149
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,610
You're right.

1150
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,810
I'm so curious.

1151
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,650
I'm an oriental medical doctor.

1152
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,080
I'm an oriental medical doctor.

1153
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,820
- Really?
- Yes.

1154
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,289
- I didn't even imagine it.
- That's amazing.

1155
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,020
- You're an oriental medical doctor?
- Yes.

1156
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,389
That's unbelievable.

1157
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,389
I didn't even imagine it.

1158
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:07,360
You do look intelligent.

1159
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,599
- That's amazing.
- Now that he said it,

1160
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,869
it's not so hard to believe.

1161
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,400
It suits you.

1162
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,440
I've been an oriental medical doctor for seven years.

1163
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,279
I usually treat patients who suffer from lower back pain or neck pain.

1164
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,980
I focus mainly on musculoskeletal disorders.

1165
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,150
I correct forward head posture...

1166
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,350
and relieve muscle pain in affected areas.

1167
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,230
(Jung Won Kyu, oriental medical doctor)

1168
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,030
- Wasn't I right?
- I know.

1169
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,259
Didn't Yong Jin say that?

1170
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,669
Yes, I did.

1171
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,799
- Here's why.
- He said it before.

1172
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,799
Whenever I see Won Kyu, I feel my tension go away.

1173
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,069
- What?
- I had that feeling about him.

1174
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,199
- Your tension goes away?
- It does.

1175
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,009
Whenever Won Kyu comes onscreen, my tension goes away.

1176
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,609
I knew that he was a doctor.

1177
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,039
Right? That was right.

1178
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,079
I didn't expect it.

1179
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,450
Me neither.

1180
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,880
I didn't even imagine it.

1181
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,350
To Yoo Sik,

1182
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,089
I gave him some oriental medicine.

1183
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,719
- Really?
- I see.

1184
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,059
I wanted to give it to everyone,

1185
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,859
but I didn't in case someone finds out.

1186
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,300
I will leave it over there.

1187
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,869
You can take it when you feel tired.

1188
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,929
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

1189
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,440
Thank you.

1190
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,639
I feel attracted to people who work in different fields.

1191
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,680
Even if Won Kyu and I were in the same field,

1192
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,080
I wouldn't have minded.

1193
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,409
When I found out his occupation, I was surprised.

1194
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,720
He looks much smarter than before.

1195
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,349
He looks intelligent.

1196
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,990
Gosh, I knew it.

1197
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,459
He said that he brought oriental medicine...

1198
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,660
for everyone to share.

1199
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,429
I haven't talked to him much.

1200
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,400
I thought that it was nice of him.

1201
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,700
I could learn a lot from him.

1202
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:59,939
I thought that he could give me...

1203
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,750
good energy.

1204
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,220
I was amazed. He's an oriental medical doctor.

1205
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,720
It suits him well. He looked amazing.

1206
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,220
I knew that he specialized in something.

1207
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,030
Yes, I couldn't keep it out of my mind.

1208
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,830
- It suits him well.
- Yes.

1209
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
I will pick...

1210
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,060
(It's time for Won Kyu to pick.)

1211
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,230
Ji Hyeon.

1212
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,570
- Me?
- Yes.

1213
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,670
- An announcer.
- An announcer.

1214
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,339
- This is very...
- I bet she's an announcer.

1215
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,439
Definitely an announcer.

1216
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,279
Or she could also be a model for makeup products.

1217
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,980
I agree.

1218
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,550
A commercial model?

1219
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,780
- Flowers.
- An owner of a flower shop?

1220
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,790
A teacher?

1221
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,559
- That suits her.
- Which subject?

1222
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,819
- English.
- English?

1223
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,119
- Or ethics.
- Ethics?

1224
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,529
- An ethics teacher - Philosophy?

1225
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,889
Yes, you look like a philosophy teacher.

1226
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,260
That suits you.

1227
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,130
I am... How should I say it?

1228
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,530
Just tell us your occupation.

1229
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,969
(Won Kyu is a big thinker.)

1230
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,200
I teach...

1231
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,710
at an arts high school.

1232
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,340
I'm a teacher.

1233
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,309
- I see.
- Yes.

1234
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,080
- Which subject?
- What do you teach?

1235
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,350
I teach acting.

1236
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,189
From here, method acting was established.

1237
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,590
However, Michael Chekhov breaks away from it.

1238
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,729
I majored in acting at Korea National University of Arts.

1239
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,490
I acted for about ten years.

1240
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,799
Now I stopped being an actress.

1241
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,059
I'm an acting teacher for aspiring students...

1242
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,230
who share the same dream I had as a child.

1243
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,299
Currently, I coach acting to my juniors...

1244
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,440
at the arts high school where I graduated from.

1245
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,279
I work hard to nurture the growth and aspirations...

1246
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,150
of both my juniors and students.

1247
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,550
(Park Ji Hyeon, acting teacher)

1248
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,550
- She's an acting teacher?
- Acting?

1249
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,249
She's an acting teacher?

1250
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,789
She's a teacher.

1251
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,159
She followed an elite path.

1252
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,160
She went to an arts high school.

1253
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,289
She graduated from Korea National University of Arts.

1254
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,059
She seems very charismatic as a teacher.

1255
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,959
- She's amazing.
- Yes, she's very amazing.

1256
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,999
It's stable.

1257
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,060
There's no occupation as stable as a teacher.

1258
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,069
She's in the art field.

1259
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,639
- I see.
- That's why you have a good voice.

1260
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,070
- Your voice is...
- That must be why.

1261
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,509
- clear.
- Right.

1262
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,310
So I'm not an announcer.

1263
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,339
I pick Yoo Sik.

1264
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,080
(Ji Hyeon picked Yoo Sik.)

1265
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,820
I bet you are a commercial model.

1266
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,380
A stockbroker.

1267
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,789
A stockbroker?

1268
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,620
Maybe a basketball player.

1269
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,219
An athlete?

1270
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,420
- What?
- Yes.

1271
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,129
In my opinion, he's an office worker.

1272
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,190
An office worker.

1273
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,100
I bet you run a business.

1274
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,670
- That suits him.
- A businessman.

1275
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:38,900
I am...

1276
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,210
It makes me so nervous.

1277
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,710
I'm a dancer.

1278
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,249
I'm a contemporary dancer at a dance company.

1279
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,050
- Really?
- That's what I do.

1280
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,360
After majoring in dance at Korea National University of Arts,

1281
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,660
I'm currently a member of a contemporary dance company.

1282
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,470
I perform with my dance company.

1283
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,799
One, two, three, four.

1284
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,009
At the same time, I give private lessons...

1285
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:19,679
and teach dance...

1286
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,940
to high school students.

1287
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:26,919
As long as I can maintain my best condition as a dancer,

1288
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,720
I want to keep dancing on stage.

1289
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:36,360
(Cho Yoo Sik, dancer)

1290
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,360
- What?
- That's great.

1291
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,630
- I didn't expect someone like him.
- I thought that he was Taeyang.

1292
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,759
If he went to Korea National University of Arts,

1293
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,199
- Wait.
- he and Ji Hyeon are alumni.

1294
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,869
- They went to the same school.
- Right.

1295
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,139
If he went to Korea National University of Arts.

1296
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,939
They have something in common.

1297
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,540
- He also took an elite path.
- You're right.

1298
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,910
He danced at Korea National University of Arts.

1299
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,310
That's amazing.

1300
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,549
You might have heard of the dance company.

1301
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,449
There's a show called "Stage Fighter."

1302
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,420
The winner of that show is...

1303
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,390
- That's amazing.
- a member of the company.

1304
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,559
I also teach students.

1305
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,189
- Really?
- Yes.

1306
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,659
- Senior in high school?
- Yes.

1307
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,730
- Me too.
- Seniors in high school.

1308
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,600
Can you teach your specialty to my students?

1309
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,430
- Work at the arts high school?
- Yes.

1310
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,340
That's why I'm busy.

1311
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,769
- Because of your students?
- When my ex said his occupation,

1312
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,609
everyone seemed surprised.

1313
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,080
He's a rare case.

1314
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,180
People showed a lot of their interest in him.

1315
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,219
I thought that he was amazing because he works in a field...

1316
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,950
that I'm not familiar with.

1317
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,590
I thought, "Really? That's unbelievable."

1318
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,889
I thought that it was very cool.

1319
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:48,600
There aren't many...

1320
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,129
male dancers.

1321
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,770
I thought that it was amazing.

1322
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,310
I also thought that he must be different from me..

1323
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,170
I have to pick someone else.

1324
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,409
(Yoo Sik picked Yun Nyeong.)

1325
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,609
I look forward to hearing it.

1326
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,350
Don't look forward to it.

1327
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,749
A college student.

1328
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,880
You major in art.

1329
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,590
I thought that you were a student.

1330
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,920
- A student?
- It seems difficult.

1331
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,529
I have no idea...

1332
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,060
even though we talked a lot.

1333
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,760
I bet your occupation relates to styling like a stylist.

1334
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:26,470
Or a makeup artist.

1335
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,970
I work...

1336
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,170
for a fashion brand.

1337
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,609
I manage the store, film media contents,

1338
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,549
and run live shows.

1339
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,550
That's what I do.

1340
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,649
- It suits you.
- It really suits you.

1341
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,650
Really?

1342
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,719
I'm currently working in the LS team...

1343
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,860
at a fashion brand company.

1344
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,700
I majored in design.

1345
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,970
I've always liked to dress up and style myself.

1346
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,070
I found out that I also like to style other people.

1347
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,809
Including creating lookbooks...

1348
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,579
to overall management,

1349
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,910
I'd like to be a general director. That's my ultimate goal.

1350
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,510
(Choi Yun Nyeong, worker at a fashion brand)

1351
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,019
- It suits you.
- It suits you well.

1352
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,319
- Really? Thank you.
- She works in fashion.

1353
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,489
- Right.
- I knew it.

1354
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,490
Did you major in art?

1355
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:22,960
Yes, I studied visual design.

1356
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,630
- Yes.
- We were right.

1357
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,399
I'm also very interested in clothes.

1358
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,800
I thought that we might have a lot of interest in common.

1359
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,940
She wears a wide variety of clothes,

1360
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,039
and she seems interested in clothes.

1361
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,080
I thought that my ex and Yun Nyeong...

1362
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,510
might've had some kind of exchange.

1363
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,850
Am I analyzing too much?

1364
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,350
I will pick the next person.

1365
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,619
Me?

1366
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,029
(Yun Nyeong picked Baek Hyun.)

1367
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,190
I'm curious.

1368
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,629
Should I tell you right away?

1369
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,159
I'll take a guess first.

1370
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,230
I said that he seemed like a talk show host.

1371
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:06,799
It's because he knows everything.

1372
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,469
Yes, he has a lot of knowledge.

1373
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,139
He knows so many different things.

1374
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,940
- Do you mean home shopping host?
- That's what I said.

1375
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,949
- He knows a lot.
- He has a lot of information.

1376
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,849
What information does he have?

1377
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:19,950
Seriously.

1378
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,190
I bet he's in the restaurant business.

1379
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,489
He runs a restaurant.

1380
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,120
He could run something in entertainment.

1381
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,760
I used to work at a golf company.

1382
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,399
Now, I practice acting.

1383
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,000
Really?

1384
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,300
- Seriously?
- Gosh.

1385
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,340
While working at a typical office job...

1386
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,310
for four years at a foreign sportswear company,

1387
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,040
I unexpectedly received a casting offer from an agency.

1388
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,510
This opportunity led me to challenge myself in acting.

1389
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,579
To become an actor who moves people's hearts,

1390
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,680
I'm gaining a variety of experiences.

1391
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:59,490
(Sung Baek Hyun, actor)

1392
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,230
I didn't expect it at all.

1393
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,160
An actor?

1394
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,760
I see.

1395
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,530
It never even crossed my mind.

1396
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,739
When we were dating,

1397
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,010
he was working for a golf company.

1398
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,610
I only found out when he introduced himself.

1399
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,140
It was a surprise.

1400
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,210
- I pick...
- Okay.

1401
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,980
- Min Kyung?
- Yes.

1402
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,250
What could she be?

1403
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,819
A daycare teacher?

1404
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,760
I know.

1405
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,860
A nurse.

1406
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,960
My guess is a dental hygienist.

1407
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,300
- It suits her.
- A singer?

1408
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,830
- A singer?
- Yes.

1409
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,099
I have a feeling she does music.

1410
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,839
- Music.
- But I don't mean a singer.

1411
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,340
- She may be a violinist.
- Exactly.

1412
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,540
Well,

1413
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:54,179
currently, I'm a graduate student...

1414
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,239
majoring in arts management...

1415
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,010
at Sungkyunkwan University.

1416
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,620
My side job is being an instructor.

1417
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,819
(Sungkyunkwan University)

1418
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,660
After majoring in dance at Dankook University,

1419
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,889
I'm now studying arts management...

1420
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,890
as a graduate student at Sungkyunkwan University.

1421
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,969
The advantage is that I can choose from a wider range of careers.

1422
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:19,900
That's why I decided to attend graduate school.

1423
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,569
Ever since I was an undergraduate, I have worked...

1424
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,439
as a dance instructor at an academy.

1425
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,879
Even now, I'm teaching children's ballet...

1426
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,809
and adult Korean dance...

1427
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,750
as a dance instructor.

1428
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,180
(Kwak Min Kyung, Graduate student and dancer)

1429
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,150
- What do you teach?
- What...

1430
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,560
No comment.

1431
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,330
I'll reveal it over time.

1432
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,699
We have a lot of instructors here.

1433
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,270
- Exactly.
- What's your major?

1434
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,200
Your undergraduate major.

1435
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,539
- No comment?
- That also gets a no comment.

1436
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,240
- Really? How come?
- Yes.

1437
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,840
It's kind of...

1438
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,150
It'll be revealed over time.

1439
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,520
How many instructors do we have here?

1440
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:11,449
If you have anything you want to learn...

1441
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,360
Does anyone want to stretch?

1442
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,660
Wait, we're not done yet.

1443
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:23,060
The fact that my ex didn't mention dance...

1444
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,800
took me by surprise.

1445
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,140
There aren't that many dancers in this world.

1446
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,770
Tell everyone,

1447
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,669
and they would...

1448
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:37,010
immediately figure out my relationship with my ex.

1449
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:40,080
I kept saying it was a secret.

1450
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,819
She said she'd tell us her major later on...

1451
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,090
and kept it as "no comment" for now.

1452
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,090
I'm not sure what it is either.

1453
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,330
But a job is just a job.

1454
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:58,770
I'm fine as long as she's giving it her all.

1455
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,769
Min Kyung is being thoughtful.

1456
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,339
If word gets out that she did dance...

1457
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,269
- People would find out right away.
- The two are too similar.

1458
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,680
If she revealed it,

1459
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,839
she could have used it...

1460
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,250
to impress others more.

1461
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,809
It was really out of thoughtfulness.

1462
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,979
Both of them went to good universities...

1463
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,789
despite being a high school couple.

1464
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,549
They were each other's support.

1465
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:19,590
- Yes.
- Right?

1466
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,120
Woo Jin?

1467
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,589
Am I the only guy left? Good luck, Woo Jin.

1468
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,630
- Yes.
- Okay.

1469
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,030
A model?

1470
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,099
- A model?
- Yes.

1471
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,030
- A former idol.
- An idol?

1472
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,530
- A former idol, now a model.
- An idol trainee.

1473
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,139
A coffee shop owner in Seongsu-dong.

1474
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,170
Right.

1475
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:38,069
I'm... One of you got my job right.

1476
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,170
- Really?
- Yes.

1477
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,779
I had a different job at first.

1478
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,250
But after finding something I wanted to do, I came to Seoul.

1479
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,650
And now, I'm working in the food service business.

1480
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:52,450
I run a Spanish restaurant in Seongsu-dong.

1481
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,729
At one point, I wanted a stable job as an office worker.

1482
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,430
That's why I took the civil service exam and passed it in first place.

1483
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:03,300
But I had this burning urge to do what I wanted.

1484
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,269
That was when I moved to Seoul and started running a restaurant.

1485
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,669
Under the meat is apple puree.

1486
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,210
It helps balance the taste.

1487
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,480
My goal is to expand...

1488
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,480
into the food service industry.

1489
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,720
(Kim Woo Jin, Restaurant manager)

1490
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,820
What's the main dish?

1491
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,319
- Pulpo.
- Lasagna?

1492
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,789
Paella and such.

1493
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,260
- Pulpo and more.
- I'm a huge fan of pulpo.

1494
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,789
And of course, there's pasta.

1495
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,730
This is bad. We just made pasta earlier.

1496
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,400
It was a huge shocker.

1497
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,799
On our date today,

1498
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,839
we went to a Spanish restaurant.

1499
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,470
It was a huge twist.

1500
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,810
He's great at cooking,

1501
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,670
so the job suits him.

1502
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,050
I thought, "So that's why he kept cooking for us."

1503
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,750
Woo Jin's food is amazing.

1504
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,249
Come to my restaurant as a group. I'll serve you well.

1505
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,789
- I'm in.
- For sure.

1506
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,889
Now then, Hyeon Ji.

1507
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,490
(The last resident is Hyeon Ji.)

1508
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,529
- A flight attendant.
- A flight attendant.

1509
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:05,989
- Together?
- A flight attendant.

1510
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,900
(Everyone is shouting, "Flight attendant.")

1511
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,930
I feel like she's a pet groomer.

1512
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,700
A groomer.

1513
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,599
Since everyone already said flight attendant,

1514
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,339
mentioning it again would be lame.

1515
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,410
I see. Then I'll tell you what it is.

1516
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,180
I'm...

1517
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,009
Everyone has already guessed it.

1518
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,349
A flight attendant.

1519
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,780
- Are you a flight attendant?
- Yes, I'm a flight attendant.

1520
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,419
After majoring in air transportation,

1521
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,089
I've been working as a flight attendant...

1522
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,860
for a domestic airline for the past eight years.

1523
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,589
On average, I fly about 80 to 90 hours a month,

1524
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:42,029
covering everything from domestic routes...

1525
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,200
to long-haul international flights.

1526
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,229
Meeting different people...

1527
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,469
and experiencing new countries and cultures...

1528
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,870
still feels exciting every time.

1529
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,380
(Park Hyeon Ji, Flight attendant for a domestic airline)

1530
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,949
- She mentioned it from day one.
- I did.

1531
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,080
Since yesterday.

1532
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,079
It was interesting.

1533
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,389
I've known my ex ever since she became a flight attendant.

1534
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,119
Ever she joined the airline.

1535
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,790
It never crossed my mind,

1536
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,589
but even to others,

1537
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:14,099
my ex gave off that flight attendant vibe.

1538
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,660
That was very interesting.

1539
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,970
It was the aura she gave off.

1540
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,940
Also, she's really tall...

1541
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,609
with a small face.

1542
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,610
Her posture too.

1543
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,740
Anyone could tell she was a flight attendant.

1544
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,180
Hyeon Ji clearly has that flight attendant vibe.

1545
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,480
"Maybe? I knew it."

1546
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,120
"What do people who travel abroad often think?"

1547
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,550
That's what I wonder.

1548
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,490
I wanted to get to know her more.

1549
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,559
Compared to my ex,

1550
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,430
she seems more stable...

1551
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,030
and closer to my ideal type.

1552
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,200
It's the vibe. I wanted to play innocent.

1553
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,469
- Sorry?
- It was on your luggage.

1554
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,499
I see.

1555
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,870
- What was?
- The tag.

1556
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,509
- Cabin crew?
- My name tag?

1557
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,409
- I thought, "No way." - Really?

1558
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:05,580
- I didn't know that.
- How sharp of you.

1559
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,150
She was the only one with pink luggage.

1560
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,990
I was aware of it.

1561
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,089
When I was moving her luggage...

1562
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:21,130
(Last night, when he was moving Hyeon Ji's luggage)

1563
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,930
No, don't carry it.

1564
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,400
It had her tag on it,

1565
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,700
which gave away her job as a flight attendant.

1566
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:35,980
It suits her perfectly.

1567
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,920
Isn't that being careless?

1568
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,150
You mean Hyeon Ji?

1569
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,560
- We're done, right?
- Yes.

1570
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,590
- How about a toast?
- Yes, let's do it.

1571
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,430
- Cheers.
- Everyone is so cool.

1572
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,300
Cheers.

1573
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,700
I should take the herbal medicine from Won Kyu.

1574
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,339
I'll leave some out for real.

1575
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,699
I'm becoming weak, Won Kyu. If I could get some medicine...

1576
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,040
But honestly, I've grown weak since coming here.

1577
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,210
There's no method we can use to overcome it.

1578
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:11,950
- Since it's close.
- I'll give you some.

1579
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,919
(Day 4 since moving in)

1580
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,119
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

1581
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,650
(Text them how you feel.)

1582
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,829
(One text message...)

1583
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:28,800
(was enough to calm everyone down.)

1584
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:34,440
(Someone is thinking hard,)

1585
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,270
(while someone else's feelings run deep.)

1586
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:42,140
(After getting to know each other today, who are they interested in?)

1587
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,209
Can't you tell whose feelings have grown stronger...

1588
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:46,849
- after the job reveal?
- Yes.

1589
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,049
I sense that Ji Yeon's interest has grown.

1590
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,949
- After hearing about Won Kyu's job?
- Yes.

1591
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,559
Won Kyu has a stable job.

1592
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,159
- And since Ji Yeon is...
- Right.

1593
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,929
a web designer, the two seem to suit each other.

1594
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:01,460
For me, a job that's the complete...

1595
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,299
- Opposite?
- opposite of mine...

1596
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,369
feels novel.

1597
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,769
- I'll also find...
- The opposite?

1598
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,839
the person with an opposite job more attractive.

1599
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,239
I'm a very curious person.

1600
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,069
What kind of a life they must've led.

1601
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,509
- Right.
- That's what you wonder.

1602
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,540
The text message came immediately after.

1603
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,649
There could be a big twist.

1604
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:18,709
I agree.

1605
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,779
Did someone else graduate from an arts school?

1606
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,049
- Me.
- A designer.

1607
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,690
We have a lot of people in arts here.

1608
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,459
Sorry, Won Kyu.

1609
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,759
- That wasn't our intention.
- Us two.

1610
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,930
This is clearly the reason I become quiet.

1611
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,599
Come on. You're charming.

1612
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,460
- Exactly.
- An oriental medical doctor.

1613
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:39,670
It sounds delicious, doesn't it?

1614
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,270
(Won Kyu)

1615
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:48,040
(I had fun hanging out with you today.)

1616
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,710
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1617
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,850
(Ji Yeon)

1618
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,660
(I'll see you in a bit.)

1619
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,860
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1620
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,830
It made me happy.

1621
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,700
(Won Kyu's feelings were directed toward Ji Yeon today.)

1622
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:16,300
The date was nice too.

1623
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,270
And it was Ji Yeon who made my heart flutter the most.

1624
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,649
I'm going to continue...

1625
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,180
gently showing my feelings...

1626
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,250
that I felt today to Won Kyu.

1627
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,090
(Their feelings have connected.)

1628
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,789
That chic way of saying things is nice,

1629
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,229
- giving off a more mature vibe.
- Yes.

1630
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:41,029
- "I'll see you in a bit." - Isn't that real flirting?

1631
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,159
The two look good.

1632
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,130
- I hope things go well for them.
- Please.

1633
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,600
Meet at the fourth-floor terrace first.

1634
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,270
(Baek Hyun)

1635
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:56,210
(The pasta was great!)

1636
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,849
Enjoy.

1637
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:00,080
It was to thank him...

1638
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,350
for the delicious pasta he made and also to show my interest in him.

1639
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:15,360
(Yun Nyeong is interested in Baek Hyun.)

1640
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,799
Nobody has to send me a text message.

1641
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,040
I don't really care.

1642
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:24,170
What matters is whether Baek Hyun will send me...

1643
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,040
a message or not.

1644
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:28,379
Which country did you like best?

1645
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,880
Personally, I like Hawaii.

1646
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,209
- Hawaii is nice.
- Hawaii?

1647
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,019
Maldives was amazing too.

1648
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,450
But I don't fly there anymore.

1649
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:40,350
(The very next day after Hyeon Ji joined)

1650
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:45,990
(Where did Baek Hyun's feelings head today?)

1651
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:51,800
(Will they head toward Yun Nyeong for 4 days straight?)

1652
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,740
(Yun Nyeong)

1653
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,310
(See you tomorrow at 3 o'clock.)

1654
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,380
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1655
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:07,010
It made me really happy, and my heart fluttered.

1656
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,919
I thought, "If only things..."

1657
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,150
"would go smoothly as they are."

1658
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,430
I'm happy. The person I'm interested in...

1659
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:20,560
showing interest in me is a grateful thing.

1660
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,870
(Their feelings have connected.)

1661
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,939
Baek Hyun sent the message for four days straight.

1662
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,409
- For four days straight.
- They have a lot in common.

1663
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:34,209
Both of them like drawings and fashion.

1664
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,409
They must have a lot to talk about.

1665
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:36,609
Their tastes have to align.

1666
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,249
From now on,

1667
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,880
- it's EXchange itself.
- Right.

1668
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,450
- No, not that.
- At the destination country...

1669
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:45,950
(Yoo Sik)

1670
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,859
(Don't stay up too late, even from now on.)

1671
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,059
(Or you'll get sick.)

1672
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,029
(Thank you for the food.)

1673
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,930
(I'll treat you next time to something that's not shellfish.)

1674
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,930
I received two text messages.

1675
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,400
I wonder who one of them is from.

1676
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,570
I'm not sure.

1677
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,870
I sent mine to Yoo Sik.

1678
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:10,979
I heard Yoo Sik had been staying up late.

1679
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,650
I sent the message out of worry.

1680
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:17,550
The other person is probably Hyeon Ji.

1681
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,990
The only person I treated to food that day was Hyeon Ji.

1682
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,589
I told him I'd treat him to something...

1683
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,960
other than shellfish next time.

1684
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,300
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1685
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:35,200
(Yoo Sik has been chosen by Ji Hyeon and Hyeon Ji.)

1686
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,940
(Who did Yoo Sik send his text message to?)

1687
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:46,379
My guess is he sent it to Ji Hyeon.

1688
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,949
Did he send it to his ex? No, right?

1689
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,219
"I will go to bed early."

1690
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,390
"I will go to bed after sending this text message."

1691
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:52,590
Let's see.

1692
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:08,400
(Ji Hyeon)

1693
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,010
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1694
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,410
I didn't get a single text message.

1695
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,120
I really regretted...

1696
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,820
not sending one to Yoo Sik last night.

1697
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,490
To think that one day's change...

1698
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,490
could completely change who he's interested in.

1699
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,730
I knew I wouldn't get a reply,

1700
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,260
but I still sent my text message.

1701
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,400
I wanted to convey that I'm still interested in him.

1702
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:44,069
- What?
- It's nothing.

1703
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,140
With you?

1704
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,950
(Min Kyung)

1705
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,350
(Hyeon Ji)

1706
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,320
I sent mine to Hyeon Ji.

1707
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,560
(Yoo Sik sent his text message to Hyeon Ji.)

1708
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,630
Our date...

1709
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,830
really helped boost my feelings for her.

1710
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,470
Since we had a date that day.

1711
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,940
(How did you feel after getting the text?)

1712
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,510
It was just okay.

1713
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:24,310
"Did he reply just out of courtesy?" was what I thought.

1714
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,620
(The text Yoo Sik sent Hyeon Ji)

1715
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:37,990
(Great work today.)

1716
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:41,000
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1717
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,870
If he had liked the date with me,

1718
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,180
wouldn't he have sent a more enthusiastic text?

1719
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,940
That's what crossed my mind.

1720
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,109
What? That's the worst text message.

1721
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,209
- Right?
- For real.

1722
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,749
- There's no special meaning in it.
- It's not a good one.

1723
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,819
How ambiguous.

1724
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,889
"Let's grab something other than shellfish next time."

1725
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,089
- Something like that.
- Nice.

1726
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,859
Or I think this could've worked too.

1727
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,320
Let's take a flight...

1728
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,689
to get something good next time

1729
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:12,159
Nice, right?

1730
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,459
- Isn't it nice?
- Let's take a flight

1731
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,759
Why didn't you do that?

1732
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,030
- You fool.
- Seriously.

1733
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,870
(Min Kyung)

1734
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:27,810
They were emojis related to today's date.

1735
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,979
An octopus, a wine glass, a gun, and a thumbs-up.

1736
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,179
Those were the emojis.

1737
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,550
(They had an octopus dish and cocktails,)

1738
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,850
(and then even fired paint guns.)

1739
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,659
It made me think that he had fun...

1740
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,960
on today's date.

1741
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,059
It's true that Min Kyung is the girl...

1742
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,999
I want to get to know the most.

1743
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,229
That's why I sent emojis that reminded her...

1744
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,500
of our date.

1745
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,599
I want to get to know her more and talk to her more.

1746
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,370
I want to hang out with her more. That's what I want.

1747
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:02,210
(Woo Jin)

1748
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:06,050
(I'm looking forward to your pasta.)

1749
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,680
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1750
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,819
Since he runs a Spanish restaurant...

1751
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,890
and has pasta on the menu,

1752
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,990
I sent a text saying that I was looking forward to trying his pasta.

1753
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:28,140
(Both of them developed feelings for each other after today's date.)

1754
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,010
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1755
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,740
As I had expected,

1756
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:39,580
my ex didn't pick me.

1757
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,449
I'm used to it.

1758
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,319
But a message saying that...

1759
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,190
I wasn't chosen isn't something I want to receive.

1760
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,290
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1761
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,829
I kind of understood why he didn't pick me.

1762
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:00,269
Ever since moving in, I have never once...

1763
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,300
sent my ex a text message.

1764
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,840
That's why it didn't really bother me.

1765
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:11,150
(Day 4 since moving in, all the mixed feelings have been sent.)

1766
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,579
(Yoo Sik and Ji Hyeon are in the kitchen.)

1767
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,720
I should sleep early today.

1768
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,050
When will you go to sleep tonight?

1769
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,590
- I'm going to turn in early today.
- Really?

1770
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,890
Hold on.

1771
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,989
- Yoo Sik.
- Seriously.

1772
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,459
Will he actually do what he's told?

1773
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,460
(Will Yoo Sik do as Min Kyung said?)

1774
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:28,930
When will you go to sleep tonight?

1775
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:31,530
- I'm going to turn in early today.
- Really?

1776
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,770
To think you're a teacher.

1777
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,400
What do you think?

1778
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,009
- It's cool.
- Is that so?

1779
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,340
But you're a teacher too.

1780
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:45,879
Exactly. To have graduated from the same school and to be teaching.

1781
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,180
When did you enter school?

1782
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,180
What if we entered the same year?

1783
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,819
That'd be...

1784
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,520
What if we went to the retreat together? The orientation.

1785
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,820
I'm going to grab us something tomorrow.

1786
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,860
- Like...
- Grab us something?

1787
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,360
Like snacks and such.

1788
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:00,889
The others will?

1789
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,360
No, on my way back home tomorrow.

1790
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,060
- You're going to buy us some?
- Yes.

1791
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,530
What will you buy?

1792
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,500
Donuts or something?

1793
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,140
Do you have a favorite?

1794
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,870
I wanted to buy Greek yogurt today,

1795
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:15,539
but I didn't have time.

1796
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,740
Do you like donuts?

1797
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,310
I don't eat them that often, but still.

1798
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:24,650
(With time, their new relationships are building.)

1799
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,719
This place is really nice.

1800
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,390
(4th floor terrace)

1801
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,459
(Won Kyu and Ji Yeon keep their promise.)

1802
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,690
It's my first time here at night.

1803
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:35,330
The light makes it even prettier at night.

1804
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,500
- Yes.
- Right?

1805
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,569
It's really...

1806
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:45,209
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes, it is.

1807
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,670
(They spend some time alone.)

1808
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,079
I brought yakgwa that's close to what you like.

1809
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,749
- What is that?
- Yakgwa.

1810
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,179
- I'm asking about the type I like.
- I just...

1811
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,549
thought you'd like it.

1812
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,579
True, I like it.

1813
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,850
- You do?
- Yes.

1814
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,860
(Ji Yeon guessed Won Kyu's taste correctly.)

1815
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,060
You sure are digging in today.

1816
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,490
I must've...

1817
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,730
- gotten used to it.
- It's nice.

1818
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,600
- You must feel relaxed now.
- Yes.

1819
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:15,040
I've been drinking all day today.

1820
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,870
At home, after the date...

1821
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,310
Everyone was having pasta at home.

1822
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,480
So I had wine again.

1823
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,979
When the others returned,

1824
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,180
they also had pasta.

1825
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,780
I joined them, but only had drinks.

1826
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:33,719
I drank when I sent the text...

1827
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,760
and now I'm drinking again.

1828
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,320
It seems I'm drinking for the longest hour in my life.

1829
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:41,760
(Ji Yeon finds talkative Won Kyu funny.)

1830
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:50,670
Are you all right?

1831
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,839
I'm fine with drinking rice wine.

1832
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,479
This one creeps up on you, though.

1833
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,740
- Rice wine?
- Yes.

1834
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:57,980
It's quite strong.

1835
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,580
What's the alcohol content?

1836
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,009
Are the calories this high too?

1837
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,320
In here, I actually...

1838
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,790
am living a trash life.

1839
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,620
Here...

1840
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,990
- Today, I...
- Yes.

1841
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,529
figured I'd just take it easy and not get stressed out.

1842
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:15,460
- Did you feel it?
- Totally.

1843
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,829
- I really did that.
- Definitely.

1844
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:19,000
So that really surprised me.

1845
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:23,270
I guess that made Yoo Sik happy.

1846
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,740
- I felt he was waiting for that.
- I see.

1847
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,780
He might think I went to bed again.

1848
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,980
I decided to hang out today, definitely.

1849
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,589
- All of us went out early today.
- When they came in,

1850
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:40,819
I was sleeping.

1851
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,559
(Having fun without Won Kyu in the living room on the 2nd floor)

1852
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,360
- This is good!
- Yes, it's good.

1853
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,260
Who poured rice wine here?

1854
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:47,730
It was Won Kyu.

1855
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,669
- I find him cute, so suddenly.
- What was your MBTI again?

1856
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,600
Me? My MBTI is ESFJ.

1857
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,909
It's the same with me. I'm ESFJ too.

1858
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:03,309
You said earlier that it was your favorite type.

1859
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,010
- Right.
- Your favorite MBTI, right?

1860
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,350
- I have a competitor.
- Yes.

1861
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:09,079
What do you mean?

1862
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,080
- She likes an ESFJ type.
- It's her favorite.

1863
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,720
What's your MBTI?

1864
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,360
Me? I told you back then.

1865
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:17,929
I don't remember.

1866
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,590
- I really don't.
- I'm an INFP.

1867
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,500
- INFP?
- Yes.

1868
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,299
- Are you an I type?
- Yes. Why are you asking it?

1869
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,300
I'm sorry.

1870
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,370
What's your MBTI?

1871
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,140
- I'm an INTJ.
- I see.

1872
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:31,810
You're an introvert.

1873
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,709
- Everyone here is nice.
- Everyone has a great personality.

1874
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:38,879
They're all so sweet.

1875
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,710
- It's true.
- You never know.

1876
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:41,949
You don't know?

1877
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,650
- "You never know?" What?
- I didn't say that.

1878
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,090
What did you just say?

1879
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,420
"You don't know."

1880
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,260
- It's Won Kyu.
- Won Kyu?

1881
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,959
- He has rice wine.
- Hi.

1882
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,529
- Didn't you pour rice wine here?
- Can I join you?

1883
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,759
- Have a seat here?
- Of course.

1884
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,160
- No, I'm fine.
- I'm going to leave now.

1885
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,530
- Really?
- Mosquitoes too.

1886
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,369
- Hi.
- Hi.

1887
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,670
(Ji Yeon joins them too, a bit later.)

1888
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,209
Right, mosquitoes. They were behind us yesterday.

1889
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:08,279
- We had some yesterday too.
- Cheers!

1890
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,410
It happens every day.

1891
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:11,750
We,

1892
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,079
for Hyeon Ji,

1893
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,950
need to talk about our ideal types. What do you think?

1894
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,649
- Let's start with Baek Hyun.
- Yes.

1895
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,720
Me? I like people with big eyes.

1896
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,360
- It's that all?
- That's it?

1897
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,289
- We all have big eyes.
- I know.

1898
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:26,059
- There's no one without them.
- No one.

1899
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,460
You have the biggest eyes!

1900
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,060
He's showing off his charm.

1901
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,769
When are you going to wear denim?

1902
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:36,099
- I'll borrow one.
- You should get changed now.

1903
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,770
- Get changed now?
- Now.

1904
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:41,010
You like everyone with big eyes?

1905
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,880
I'm not sure. About looks, I don't really...

1906
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,050
- You don't care much about that.
- No.

1907
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,250
I guess my physical preference keeps changing.

1908
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,090
Now I find personality important.

1909
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:56,260
I need to have a lot of conversations.

1910
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,730
We need to be on the same page.

1911
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,460
She should be good at self-management.

1912
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,599
- How about physical appearance?
- Physical appearance?

1913
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,170
Actually, physical preference isn't a big factor.

1914
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:14,209
Not now, but in the past, I liked Lee Sung Kyoung.

1915
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,640
- I see.
- I see.

1916
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,950
- I liked her vibe.
- Her vibe.

1917
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,849
I prefer people with fair skin,

1918
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,550
- Fair skin.
- for physical appearance.

1919
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,020
Can anyone be fairer than you?

1920
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:28,119
- You have such fair skin.
- I'm a fair type too.

1921
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,920
Many people find my skin fair, but...

1922
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,589
- They're blaming you.
- Your skin is so fair.

1923
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,790
- For women.
- When you look at a woman.

1924
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,030
Your skin is really fair, though.

1925
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,129
My skin tone...

1926
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:40,869
- is quite light, - Yes, it's very light.

1927
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,300
But your skin looks lighter.

1928
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,400
- My skin is light too.
- That's true.

1929
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,239
- Your skin is so fair.
- It's fair.

1930
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,079
- What?
- It's light.

1931
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,680
- How come it's so fair?
- It's so fair.

1932
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,310
You have such a fair complexion.

1933
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,809
Oh, my.

1934
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:55,820
And,

1935
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,089
I didn't realize it before,

1936
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,249
but people I find beautiful...

1937
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,760
have large noses, I guess.

1938
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,530
- Really?
- Yes.

1939
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,359
- Then it's Ji Yeon, right?
- It's exactly Ji Yeon.

1940
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,460
- All of that applies to Ji Yeon.
- I know.

1941
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,269
That means a beautiful woman.

1942
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:15,000
- What?
- Fair skin and a high nose bridge.

1943
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,040
Raise your hand if you're into someone not beautiful.

1944
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:20,339
You're right.

1945
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,110
Won Kyu said he finds people with fair skin...

1946
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,079
and a large nose, a high nose bridge,

1947
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,179
beautiful.

1948
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,050
So I looked at my nose in the full-length mirror in the back,

1949
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,920
and I thought I had the most prominent nose there.

1950
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:39,160
I also have a large nose.

1951
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,260
I definitely have fair skin, too.

1952
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:45,100
So I thought, "What was that?"

1953
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,730
I was happy.

1954
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:52,139
What?

1955
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,469
- Hi.
- Hi.

1956
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,739
- Hi.
- Hi.

1957
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,779
Where do you want to sit?

1958
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,540
I guess you can sit here.

1959
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,180
- Shall I sit there?
- Yes.

1960
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,450
- I want to listen to music.
- Yes.

1961
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,890
I suppose you must be a great singer.

1962
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,519
I listen to music a lot.

1963
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,719
Your pronunciation is excellent.

1964
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,090
- Right.
- Yes.

1965
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,189
While I was listening to music today,

1966
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:13,929
I suddenly teared up.

1967
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:15,630
- Really?
- Goodness.

1968
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,000
Wait a minute.

1969
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:23,740
What?

1970
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,570
Really?

1971
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:28,910
Oh, my goodness.

1972
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:33,080
(Ji Hyeon looks overwhelmed and leaves in a hurry.)

1973
01:27:55,870 --> 01:28:00,540
(She finally bursts into tears, after holding it all in.)

1974
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,009
- What?
- What's wrong?

1975
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:05,479
Why?

1976
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,249
Yoo Sik didn't send her a text.

1977
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,919
I don't think that's the reason.

1978
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,749
Is it because everyone else seems to be finding a partner,

1979
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,249
but she isn't?

1980
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,359
Is she feeling left out?

1981
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,289
Her ex isn't there now.

1982
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,559
Her ex isn't there, and she didn't get any text.

1983
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,790
- She got zero text.
- Is she feeling alone now?

1984
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,460
She's troubled.

1985
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,670
(Hyeon Ji goes upstairs after Ji Hyeon.)

1986
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:31,340
(She hesitates to approach because she doesn't want to bother her.)

1987
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,379
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1988
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,280
- You can take some rest.
- I'm okay.

1989
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:49,220
(It seems she needs some alone time.)

1990
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,870
I've held some...

1991
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,140
negative feelings in, and it burst out.

1992
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:12,180
The moment after I dated Yoo Sik,

1993
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:16,050
I could feel he's such a nice person.

1994
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,880
I actually...

1995
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,820
liked the date, and my heart raced.

1996
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,919
We haven't exchanged texts...

1997
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,990
for two days now.

1998
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,400
He might not send a text to me the next day.

1999
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,200
I felt anxious about that...

2000
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,100
and had a lot on my mind.

2001
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,769
The more I get close to...

2002
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:41,410
and get acquainted with others,

2003
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,910
the more I would grow apart from my ex, I thought.

2004
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,910
It felt scary.

2005
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,620
I had no idea...

2006
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:53,720
where my heart was heading toward.

2007
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,920
Being in that space felt so hard for me.

2008
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:00,630
I felt a sense of emptiness and loss.

2009
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:04,030
I was on an emotional roller coaster that night.

2010
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,810
- Stop talking casually to me.
- What?

2011
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:22,350
- What?
- Stop talking casually to me.

2012
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,249
Did I talk casually to you?

2013
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,820
Yes, stop doing that.

2014
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,049
When did I do that?

2015
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:29,490
You kept talking casually to me sitting by my side earlier.

2016
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,290
You used casual language.

2017
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:34,930
Is she crying upstairs?

2018
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,300
Are you all right?

2019
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,430
- What do you mean?
- Do you feel uncomfortable?

2020
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:40,970
- What?
- Do you feel uncomfortable?

2021
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,109
It's not that I feel uncomfortable.

2022
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,270
- What is it?
- I just...

2023
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,410
Why? Do you feel awkward?

2024
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:57,250
Are you feeling awkward here?

2025
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:58,950
Are you?

2026
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,360
A bit, I guess.

2027
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,690
You look very comfortable here.

2028
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:07,889
What?

2029
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:09,500
You look very comfortable here.

2030
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,299
You look comfortable.

2031
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,030
- Do I?
- Yes.

2032
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,340
(Yoo Sik suddenly came up to the 34d floor.)

2033
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,569
I guess we need to soothe her.

2034
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:22,009
I think she needs some alone time.

2035
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:23,010
(Baek Hyun smoothly changes the subject.)

2036
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,310
Is she crying a lot?

2037
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:29,920
I guess girls are crying a lot here.

2038
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:31,820
Really?

2039
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,860
Maybe guys don't have a thought in their heads?

2040
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,860
I was only smiling.

2041
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:46,070
But what can I do? It's my true feelings.

2042
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,409
(Sighing)

2043
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,410
Seriously.

2044
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,690
(She goes to Ji Yeon's room again.)

2045
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,860
People downstairs really drive me crazy.

2046
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,770
Oh, my goodness.

2047
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:21,739
My gosh.

2048
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:25,509
(Her pent-up disappointment in front of her ex is busting out.)

2049
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:27,040
It's just crazy here.

2050
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:28,880
They're crazy.

2051
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,750
I'm so irritated.

2052
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,880
Why?

2053
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:41,320
Why are you irritated? Why?

2054
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,640
This is...

2055
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:01,140
I don't know why I'm crying.

2056
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:03,180
That makes it harder for you, right?

2057
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,980
The reason isn't exactly...

2058
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:09,750
considered objective, and that's hard for me.

2059
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:14,520
My face will look so swollen tomorrow. This is insane.

2060
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,630
Have you ever cried when you dated your ex?

2061
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,400
I have cried,

2062
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,900
but my ex cried even more than me.

2063
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,210
Really?

2064
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:36,039
I wasn't nice to him when I dated him.

2065
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,080
Is that so?

2066
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:48,320
(Staying together is enough to comfort each other.)

2067
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:51,160
Thank you for visiting me.

2068
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:56,200
(Ji Hyeon decides to have some alone time again.)

2069
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,799
- Shall we toast?
- Okay.

2070
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,530
All right. Cheers.

2071
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:02,839
(They pick up where they left off.)

2072
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,300
- Can you toast with water?
- I will.

2073
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,210
- What is it?
- They're funny.

2074
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:15,420
I wonder if all of us can meet again.

2075
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,479
- I know.
- I don't think we can.

2076
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,550
- We never know.
- We can't.

2077
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,420
- Why can't we?
- Now is the time...

2078
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:24,589
- we can be amicable, but...
- Some people are like this,

2079
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:26,390
but others are not in nature.

2080
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,760
- Do you think you can?
- What do you mean?

2081
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,629
Let's say your ex hits it off with me or someone else here,

2082
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:35,000
- and all of us have a get-together.
- Yes.

2083
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,000
Are you okay with that?

2084
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:41,340
Do you think you'll be okay?

2085
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,210
All of us, literally without exception?

2086
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,079
- Then I'll be there.
- Really?

2087
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,310
I'll be there, but I'll never look.

2088
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:49,219
- What?
- What do you mean you never look?

2089
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:51,990
I'll avoid eye contact.

2090
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:53,720
But is that possible?

2091
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:56,260
- Honestly, I can't stand it.
- It's tough.

2092
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,220
When everyone's there.

2093
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:00,460
You're not a thinker, are you?

2094
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:02,930
You must be a big feeler.

2095
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:06,700
(The theory of Won Kyu being a big feeler is raised again.)

2096
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:08,399
He's an extra big feeler, as I see.

2097
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,770
What's an extra big feeler?

2098
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,440
How can I put it?

2099
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:16,080
On the first day, as I see,

2100
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,579
no one looked like having lingering feelings.

2101
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:21,250
Maybe all of us were pretending.

2102
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:22,849
But everyone seemed to be in a good place mentally.

2103
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:25,419
What do you mean? People were crying on the first day.

2104
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,550
- Actually, only at that moment.
- The introduction from the ex?

2105
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:31,929
- As time goes by, one by one.
- Right.

2106
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:34,489
- I see we're troubled and sad.
- I can tell.

2107
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:35,499
- That's true.
- Really?

2108
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,800
- Really.
- I can really tell.

2109
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,399
I was most curious about my introduction from my ex.

2110
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,369
- I know.
- Aren't you going to read yours?

2111
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:42,669
I guess she will, later.

2112
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,369
- Right.
- Do we have time for that?

2113
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:47,310
- Then...
- We can read ours all over again.

2114
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,509
- That'll be nice.
- Are we reading it again?

2115
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,039
I'm going to cry.

2116
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,449
I have no introduction from my ex.

2117
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:53,450
- What?
- What?

2118
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:54,550
Where did you put it?

2119
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,050
I threw it away.

2120
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:58,920
Really?

2121
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,019
- Did you really throw it away?
- Oh, my.

2122
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:03,060
Your ex might be here now.

2123
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,830
- That's unbelievable.
- That's too much.

2124
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,899
What?

2125
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,400
- Why does he have to say that?
- Why is he getting on her nerves?

2126
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:14,129
Did he read and throw it away in the early morning?

2127
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:16,199
- He might have shed tears.
- After reading it one last time.

2128
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,269
Did he throw it away thinking it really was last time?

2129
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,570
Did he throw it away to sort out his feelings?

2130
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:22,610
I feel so sad.

2131
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:23,910
I'm going to step away and cry.

2132
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:26,210
That's a bummer.

2133
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:27,709
I'll find it.

2134
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,150
- Goodness.
- I'll go find it again.

2135
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:32,450
But it's your choice.

2136
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:35,519
It can mean you have no feelings...

2137
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,490
left for your ex.

2138
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,990
That's true, but...

2139
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,559
I have it.

2140
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,860
Right, I'm sure you do.

2141
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:54,070
It could have hurt Hyeon Ji's feelings.

2142
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,640
I actually had that in mind.

2143
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,210
But I'm really bad at multitasking.

2144
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:01,810
I wanted to focus on Yun Nyeong.

2145
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,080
I guess I did it out of mixed feelings.

2146
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,950
Did he do that intentionally?

2147
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:12,090
Did he want to show others...

2148
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,960
that he had no feelings left for his ex?

2149
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,630
I think that's understandable.

2150
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,340
He's free to do so.

2151
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,070
But I was sitting next to him,

2152
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:29,280
and he bothered to say that he threw it away.

2153
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,280
I couldn't understand that part. Why did he have to say that?

2154
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,320
I was troubled.

2155
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:42,760
I wanted to confront him right away.

2156
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:49,060
Baek Hyun isn't like how he used to be until the 2nd and the 3rd days.

2157
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,529
I don't know why he keeps overplaying his hand.

2158
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:54,299
He's like that after Hyeon Ji came.

2159
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,769
He might be doing it to remind himself...

2160
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,509
of the fact that they're over.

2161
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:01,209
He cried his eyes out reading his introduction,

2162
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,609
- but he speaks lightly...
- Right.

2163
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,409
like it means nothing to him.

2164
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:06,549
Saying that he threw it away...

2165
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:10,219
is a bit too much, I think.

2166
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,819
Isn't that also a defence mechanism?

2167
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,689
The introduction from the ex...

2168
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:16,459
felt like a very important letter.

2169
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:19,489
But he said he threw it away in front of everyone...

2170
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:22,029
and his ex will be revealed someday.

2171
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:23,800
He put his ex to shame.

2172
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,930
- Yes.
- That could enrage her.

2173
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,829
She literally would want to confront him.

2174
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:29,999
I don't think it was mature, anyway.

2175
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,300
That's right.

2176
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,769
Whatever the reason was.

2177
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:35,739
- Does he really have to do that?
- For drawing the line,

2178
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,310
there are so many ways.

2179
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,179
I feel sorry for him...

2180
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,510
because I think it was the wrong choice.

2181
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,179
- That's funny.
- I keep eating alone.

2182
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,249
I guess I'm better at drinking.

2183
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,490
I think I drank more than you.

2184
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,220
He's been drinking until now since we had dinner.

2185
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:59,000
I'm going to clean it up later.

2186
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:01,869
You look a bit tipsy. Are you okay?

2187
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:03,339
Yes, I'm fine.

2188
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:04,370
You're drunk, aren't you?

2189
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:06,309
I'm really fine.

2190
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:08,840
You're the most flushed one here. Can I look at your face?

2191
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:15,720
- I got goose bumps.
- It was for a short moment.

2192
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:21,450
(Hearing Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong, Hyeon Ji doesn't know what to do.)

2193
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,919
(She braces herself up and goes upstairs again.)

2194
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,359
Anything can be done fast and easily.

2195
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,859
- It's really nothing.
- I don't think so.

2196
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:29,959
(She doesn't have the courage to face them together.)

2197
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,300
I just need some water and...

2198
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:34,399
(Yoo Sik blocked the way, so she comes up after all.)

2199
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,400
I need to dispose of this.

2200
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:40,070
I'm going to my room.

2201
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,739
Are you going to bed now because of your work tomorrow?

2202
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,740
Yes.

2203
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:41,670
(EXchange 4)

2204
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:43,300
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2205
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:44,670
- I'm fine.
- Your eyes are not swollen.

2206
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,939
I don't know why seeing him here troubles me this much.

2207
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:49,079
It's hard to watch him in those scenes.

2208
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,109
Good morning.

2209
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:51,110
Good morning.

2210
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,749
Really? Are you going outside?

2211
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,880
Watching Baek Hyun going outside made me...

2212
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:59,420
(I was very upset.)

2213
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,250
(I was so happy.)

2214
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,819
- Are you happy?
- I'm truly happy.

2215
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:05,160
Then, shall we go back tomorrow?

2216
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:09,360
(I think I'm in love with him.)

2217
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,160
(Knocking)

2218
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:15,770
I left the letter on the head side of Yoo Sik's bed.

2219
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:17,769
(Let's go out with me!)

2220
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,640
Yoo Sik, how was your day?

2221
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:21,070
Hi.

2222
01:41:21,071 --> 01:41:22,439
Look at your bedside.

2223
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,540
Okay.

2224
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,749
Yook Sik, you brought this, right?

2225
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:26,750
Won Kyu did.

2226
01:41:26,751 --> 01:41:28,779
Yoo Sik, why are you lying?

2227
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:31,650
I was glad that she expressed her interest in me.

2228
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:37,920
(I pulled him closer to reassure him.)
