1
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,150
Back then, I poured...

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,890
all of my time into that person.

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,590
We went to the Han River for a chat,

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,820
and when we realised, the sun had come up.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,400
Time flowed really quickly while talking to that person.

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,400
Since we wanted to see each other even a little bit, we made time...

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,370
We were always together, throughout the year.

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,440
(Every single moment was precious,)

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,880
(and our time was filled with the two of us.)

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,910
It was fun even when it rained,

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,480
and fun even when it snowed.

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,320
But over time,

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,820
I felt like I was no longer...

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,660
a priority in anything.

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,930
I thought, "I still have my own life."

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,740
He wasn't just busy.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,640
He no longer had feelings for me.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,170
It ended just like that, so empty and meaningless.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,240
(Like that, our time stopped.)

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,150
All the places were just...

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,420
When I went to restaurants we went to together,

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,290
listened to songs, or went to the subway,

23
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,020
they all reminded me of him.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,120
(Some still live in the time of the person who left.)

25
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,160
I think I just thought...

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,790
there would be someone else better than this person.

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,230
(After all that time apart,)

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,030
(we're crossing paths again.)

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,140
(What kind of time will we spend now?)

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,790
(In this place where the heart's clock is set,)

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,260
(are you ready to leave the past behind...)

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,070
(and begin living a new time?)

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,940
The wish to be reunited...

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,880
The stripes part is the longing to meet someone new.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,680
(They have to turn the hands of the clock...)

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,380
(and set the time of their heart.)

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,480
(The more brown there is,)

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,020
(the stronger the desire for reunion.)

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,690
(The more stripes there are,)

40
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,420
(the stronger the wish to meet someone new.)

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,560
(The more they turn the hands,)

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,530
(the more the desire for "new" rather than "ex.")

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,800
(Ex or new. What time is your heart?)

44
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,370
It's like a percentage.

45
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,840
That wasn't in the last season.

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,170
- Right.
- It's a new one.

47
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,240
It wasn't in the last season.

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,640
This is so interesting.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,050
(Ex or new. What time is your heart?)

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,020
It has begun.

51
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,650
(They have to express their heart in the time room.)

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,220
When I faced that clock,

53
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,530
many thoughts ran through my mind.

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,830
I couldn't make up my mind even until that moment.

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,940
I was torn back and forth.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,610
If things keep going like this, I won't be able to see a future.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,910
I had a clear mindset even before entering the room.

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,720
I think my ex...

59
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,850
will want to meet someone new.

60
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,990
He's someone who thinks...

61
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,830
you can't meet someone again once you've broken up.

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,030
I really hate him.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
I really hate him.

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,600
If I were asked to go through a relationship that painful,

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,410
not even a fortune could make me do it.

66
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,080
(Their time...)

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,640
(starts to drift apart once again.)

68
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,590
(Ex or new, everyone's time was set.)

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,660
(They returned to EXchange 4 after a while.)

70
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,090
Has it been a year and four months?

71
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,890
It's been a year and four months.

72
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,360
- I've been waiting for this.
- It's been quite a long time.

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,060
We finally came to season four.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,070
I know.

75
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,770
- Isn't this a long-running show?
- It is a long-running show.

76
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,940
- It's a very long-running show.
- It is a long-running show.

77
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,500
- Right.
- The curtain has risen.

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm glad we reached season four without any issues.

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,470
- Right.
- Yes.

80
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,540
I've also been waiting so long for this dopamine rush,

81
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,480
- unlike anything else.
- That's right.

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Over 1 year and 4 months, I filled my tears that were missing.

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,550
(He charged the tears that were missing over the time.)

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,350
We'll introduce him first.

85
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,690
The guest who will brightly open...

86
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,220
the 1st episode of EXchange 4...

87
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,990
with a refreshing smile.

88
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,560
Hello, I'm actor Nam Yoon Su.

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
(Nam Yoon Su, Actor)

90
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,900
- Nice to meet you.
- He's so handsome.

91
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,730
We heard that he's a hardcore fan of this show.

92
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,570
Yes. I tend to like dating shows,

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,870
so I watch them.

94
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,680
This is a time room. What did you think?

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,210
- The time room?
- Yes.

96
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,080
I think they'd think once again in that space.

97
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,480
- Right.
- I think they'd have many thoughts.

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,550
I think there's no better way...

99
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,950
- to express a complicated heart.
- Right.

100
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,120
- Right.
- That's right.

101
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,590
- It could really be 49 to 51.
- Right.

102
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,690
It doesn't just lean on one side,

103
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,030
so we would be able to get a more accurate picture.

104
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,360
That's the percentage of their heart.

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,500
Are you good at guessing people who will end up as a couple?

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,630
- I don't think I'm bad at it.
- Really?

107
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,700
I could notice people...

108
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,870
with similar styles from the way they dress and all.

109
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,770
We've been doing this for four seasons.

110
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,510
We'd know just by looking at them.

111
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,340
- Now, we should show our skills.
- Yes.

112
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,550
- Okay.
- I'll look forward to it.

113
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,110
We have experience now.

114
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,020
- Watch me in action today.
- All right.

115
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,480
- I'll do it.
- Watch if he guesses correctly.

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,020
You'd think, "Who are these people?"

117
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,150
I'll show you.

118
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,790
- I'll look forward to it.
- I'm so excited.

119
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,190
- It's driving me crazy.
- It's amazing.

120
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,290
The dopamine of my life.

121
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,130
(On a late spring day, just as summer begins)

122
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,970
(The people who broke up for their own reasons...)

123
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,400
(have come together in one place.)

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,610
(The ex-couples meet before they move in.)

125
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,830
It's been a while.

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Hi.

127
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,480
You lost a lot of weight.

128
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,920
You look more handsome.

129
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,390
Do you feel awkward or uncomfortable?

130
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,860
No. It's been a while since we last talked like this.

131
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,030
Then I won't look at your eyes.

132
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,100
I'll look at your forehead.

133
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,740
How is it now?

134
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,540
Seriously.

135
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,980
It's really nice to see you.

136
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,610
How have you been?

137
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,780
I think...

138
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,620
it was a good time to personally grow.

139
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,860
It seemed like you would have had a harder time.

140
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,090
At first,

141
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,260
I couldn't realise it so much.

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,870
So it wasn't even hard.

143
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,070
But it was really sad...

144
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,170
that you weren't next to me.

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,810
Yes. You should suffer a little.

146
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,390
I thought...

147
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,530
I wouldn't see you again.

148
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
Right.

149
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,000
What made you decide to do this?

150
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,270
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

151
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,610
It's a secret.

152
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,110
I don't know how you feel.

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,690
You look nice.

154
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,820
- Me?
- Yes.

155
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,990
You seem to be doing really well.

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,990
Really?

157
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm sure you're doing well. You have many friends too.

158
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,960
You hang out with women too.

159
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,880
At first,

160
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,080
I had bad feelings toward you.

161
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,550
You were an emotional person by my standards.

162
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,220
You shouldn't say it was my fault.

163
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,860
Why do you keep making me mad?

164
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,990
But we...

165
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,160
can't reveal to others that we are exes.

166
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,570
We have to act that.

167
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,670
Right.

168
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,400
I think it's going to be fun.

169
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,740
We could drink every evening.

170
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,170
Don't drink so much.

171
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,710
No. I'm going to drink a lot.

172
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,780
You're going to cry again when you drink.

173
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,320
You shouldn't cry yourself.

174
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,020
You always cry whenever you drink.

175
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,290
You're annoying.

176
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,460
I'll take care of myself.

177
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,330
After all,

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,960
we're already broken up.

179
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,840
You would feel the same as I do.

180
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,440
We wouldn't care about each other.

181
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,340
Right. I'll...

182
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,670
do my thing, and you can also have fun.

183
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,150
It would be fun, don't you think?

184
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,510
I'm suddenly excited.

185
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,080
Let's each...

186
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,650
Still, don't have so much fun.

187
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,190
I'm going to do really well there.

188
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
Do what you want to do.

189
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,900
I should.

190
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,300
I can't get along with people well at first.

191
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,900
No. You can do well.

192
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,040
Let's do well.

193
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,940
We should.

194
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
Let's get along well.

195
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,990
(EXchange 4 begins now.)

196
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,290
- It's starting.
- This...

197
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,260
- It looks really fun this time.
- Right.

198
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,760
Personally, I think the cast of this season...

199
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,430
- have the greatest chemistry...
- Yes.

200
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,800
in looks.

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,100
I'm also looking forward to the energy.

202
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
No one was depressed.

203
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,610
- Right.
- Normally, when they meet before...

204
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,340
- They cry.
- Right.

205
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,740
They ask, "How have you been?" They hesitate and get choked up.

206
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,780
But we saw none of that.

207
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,080
I think we'll see something different this time.

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,650
- Right.
- Among the female casts,

209
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,150
the person who said, "You hang out with women well."

210
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,250
- That person.
- "You hang out with women well."

211
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,620
That person seems...

212
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,790
like a strong character...

213
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,930
- who gets very jealous.
- Yes.

214
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,330
It won't be easy.

215
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,300
I think the age range...

216
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,360
- got a bit younger.
- Right?

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,600
- That's right.
- I had a hunch.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,070
The person wearing black clothes...

219
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,870
and the man wearing bold-frame glasses.

220
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,910
- Yes.
- I think they would be exes.

221
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,340
- Already?
- Do you have any guesses...

222
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
after seeing the preliminary meeting?

223
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,410
- I think it makes you confused.
- Right.

224
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,010
It was like a con game.

225
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,610
- Con game.
- Con game.

226
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,920
- On purpose.
- You can't tell, right?

227
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,090
(One day in June, filled with freshness)

228
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,830
(Pyeongchang-dong, Jongno-gu)

229
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,500
(The first resident, Sung Baek Hyun)

230
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,650
(Baek Hyun chose to sit on the single sofa at the end.)

231
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,520
- He looks handsome.
- What?

232
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
His shoulders are broad.

233
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,690
Is he an athlete?

234
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,490
- I think he's an athlete.
- Like a swimmer.

235
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,460
He really looks like he did sports.

236
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,530
There are men who look cool...

237
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,800
even to other men.

238
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
- That's him.
- He looks very solid.

239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,200
He seems like he'd have a very dependable personality.

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,310
- Right.
- Yes.

241
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:47,150
(The second resident, Choi Yun Nyeong)

242
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,820
Hello.

243
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,280
Hello. - Hello.

244
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,020
Where do I sit?

245
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,730
(She sat a bit far away from Baek Hyun.)

246
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,170
You came the earliest.

247
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,500
I was the first to arrive.

248
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,780
(Glancing)

249
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,360
(Baek Hyun goes somewhere.)

250
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,540
Thank you.

251
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,670
I didn't know it was there.

252
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,230
I hope everyone gets here quickly.

253
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,030
Right.

254
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,720
- He looks a little like Jae Joong.
- Right.

255
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,990
- He looks a little like Jae Joong.
- He does have that image.

256
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,760
(The third resident, Kim Woo Jin)

257
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Hello.

258
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,870
I'm sorry,

260
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,680
but could you help me put a bandage?

261
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,780
I'm bleeding.

262
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,210
Could you help me put it?

263
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,420
- As soon as you came...
- It's all right.

264
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,850
You got a deep cut.

265
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,490
How did that happen?

266
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,820
- I was getting things from my bag.
- Goodness.

267
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,790
Press that for a bit.

268
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,900
Thank you.

269
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,870
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,830
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

271
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,440
You're still bleeding.

272
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,540
It's not that bad. I'm all right.

273
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,210
What's your name?

274
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,450
- I'm Sung Baek Hyun.
- Sung Baek Hyun?

275
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,050
- Yes.
- I'm Choi Yun Nyeong.

276
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,980
- Yun Yeong.
- Nyeong.

277
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,220
Yeon?

278
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,350
Yun Nyeong.

279
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,620
- Yun Nyeong.
- Yes.

280
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,590
Yun Nyeon would be weird.

281
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,500
- It's "Nyeong" in "annyeong." - Yes.

282
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,860
She knows everyone is going to ask.

283
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,400
- So she explains it like this.
- She does this.

284
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,500
She draws "n."

285
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,170
Yun Nyeong's smile is refreshing.

286
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,370
Yes. It's very cheerful.

287
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,440
You'd feel good when you're next to her.

288
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,570
- Right.
- That's right.

289
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,710
Also, you wouldn't easily see her make a blank expression.

290
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,010
She seems like someone who always has a smile.

291
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,580
Woo Jin and Yun Nyeong's chemistry in looks...

292
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,750
- seems good.
- He also asked, "Yun Nyeon?"

293
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,050
Doesn't that sound like jokes you make when you date?

294
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,990
You don't say that to someone new.

295
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,130
- Saying "Nyeon." - You don't say that.

296
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,060
- Was it because they're ex-couples?
- Right.

297
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,200
Something like that.

298
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,800
It feels like a playful joke...

299
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,500
- On purpose?
- to make to someone close.

300
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,470
I'm Kim Woo Jin.

301
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,640
- Kim Woo Jin.
- Yes.

302
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,840
I think I'll be able to remember both of your names.

303
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,740
The place is really nice.

304
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,550
Right? It looks really pretty.

305
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,880
I want to look around later.

306
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,810
(The fourth resident, Kwak Min Kyung)

307
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,240
Hello.

308
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,010
- She's cute.
- She's so cute.

309
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,410
She looks a bit like Cho Yi Hyun.

310
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,710
- Right.
- Right.

311
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,150
She also looks like a girl group member.

312
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,720
Hello.

313
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

314
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

315
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,200
They look awkward.

316
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,340
They look awkward.

317
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,510
- Pausing.
- Pausing.

318
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,040
(Pausing)

319
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,380
Hello.

320
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,720
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

321
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,630
Hello.

322
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,470
- Did you all say your names?
- Yes.

323
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,970
He came here first.

324
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,970
I was the first.

325
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,670
I'm Sung Baek Hyun.

326
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,080
Baek Hyun. Okay.

327
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,910
I'm Kwak Min Kyung.

328
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,610
- Kwak Min Kyung.
- Yes.

329
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,050
It's Kwak with a k.

330
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,290
Kwak. All right.

331
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,270
What's your MBTI type?

332
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,900
- Did you talk about it?
- Not yet.

333
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,070
Shall we say it later?

334
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,640
It doesn't matter.

335
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,940
What's yours?

336
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,010
I'm ESTP.

337
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,710
I think I'm half introvert and half extrovert.

338
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,080
- I see.
- ESTP.

339
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,020
I'm ESFJ.

340
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,720
Except for J, the scores were all half and half.

341
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,660
So I can adjust depending on the person.

342
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,260
- Really?
- Yes, I can.

343
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,230
I'm ENFP.

344
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,760
- I can tell.
- Really?

345
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,100
- Yes.
- That's interesting.

346
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,730
- It felt that way.
- Can you tell?

347
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,440
- I don't know.
- Can you feel it?

348
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,800
- Yes, she looked bright.
- What? Really?

349
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,640
Since I walked in.

350
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,740
My goodness. I was staying quietly.

351
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,850
- You looked cheerful.
- Really?

352
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,490
I'm INTJ.

353
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,890
You're mostly extroverts.

354
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,920
You're right.

355
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,330
This is going to be fun.

356
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,330
(Baek Hyun the only introvert is sitting far away.)

357
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,930
Of course, it's nice to be an introvert as well.

358
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,860
Because I'm both.

359
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,740
After Min Kyung joined,

360
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,940
it felt like there were petals in the air.

361
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,910
The room suddenly looked bright.

362
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,310
In the end, we're rivals.

363
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,010
I thought we should have different charms.

364
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,720
Are you all good at cooking?

365
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,090
- Only if I have the recipe.
- If you have the recipe?

366
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,590
Yes. Then I can cook, but I can't guarantee the taste.

367
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,260
I can still do it.

368
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,030
You look like you'd be good at it.

369
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,800
- Me?
- Yes.

370
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,500
I do like cooking,

371
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,030
but it only suits my taste.

372
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,570
I see. Then it must be tasty.

373
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,610
Since I live on my own,

374
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,740
I can only cook something light.

375
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,780
I'll be your assistant.

376
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,750
- I'm good at washing the dishes.
- Me too.

377
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,020
- Me too.
- I'm good at washing the dishes.

378
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,150
Let me wash the dishes.

379
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,790
I can't cook either.

380
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,120
- That's not good.
- I can only wash the dishes.

381
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,230
- We're in trouble.
- I know.

382
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,960
I think Baek Hyun and Min Kyung...

383
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,730
- The way Baek Hyun's smiling.
- Yes.

384
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,330
I'm not sure whether he's smiling...

385
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,370
because he's interested in her...

386
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,200
or because he's glad to see her again.

387
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
I think I know why he's smiling.

388
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,940
Baek Hyun began smiling as soon as Min Kyung appeared.

389
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,910
She's his ex, so he's going, "Look at you."

390
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,110
"You'd dress up that much?" You know what I mean?

391
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,750
- "You'd dress up that much?" - Right.

392
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,080
- "You're in a dress?" - Yes.

393
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,590
I have a feeling that's what his smile means.

394
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,410
- I think someone's here.
- Yes.

395
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,890
(The fifth resident is Hong Ji Yeon.)

396
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,160
Hello.

397
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

398
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

399
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

400
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,940
(Ji Yeon walks straight to her seat without hesitation.)

401
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,170
Shall we sit down?

402
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,410
She reminds me of Yeon Jin from "The Glory."

403
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,180
Oh, yes. Ji Yeon.

404
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,680
- Lim Ji Yeon, right?
- Yes, Lim Ji Yeon. Ji Yeon.

405
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,790
- She looks charismatic.
- Seriously,

406
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,320
everyone's good-looking.

407
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,790
Oh, I'm Hong Ji Yeon.

408
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,130
- Hong Ji Yeon?
- Yes.

409
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,270
We talked about our MBTIs.

410
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,710
- I'm ENFP.
- Me too.

411
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,840
- Really?
- Yes.

412
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,340
Everyone could be extroverts.

413
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,150
An introvert would have a hard time here.

414
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,600
(Where's he going instead of the gate on the left?)

415
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,540
(Failing to open the gate)

416
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,900
(Failing to open the gate again)

417
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,910
- Where's he going?
- Ring the bell.

418
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,480
Isn't that the gate for cars?

419
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,340
He must've been a lord in his past life.

420
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,750
(Showing how clumsy he is from the beginning)

421
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,240
(The sixth resident is Jung Won Kyu.)

422
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

424
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

425
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

426
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,050
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

427
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,120
- Hello.
- Hi.

428
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
There are slippers...

429
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,160
- by the entrance.
- Are there slippers?

430
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,600
I saw a pair by the entrance.

431
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,370
We made the same mistake.

432
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,940
(Won Kyu's still adjusting.)

433
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
(Won Kyu returns after putting on the slippers.)

434
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,050
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

435
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,320
What's your name?

436
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,690
I'm Jung Won Kyu.

437
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,630
- Jung Won Kyu?
- Yes.

438
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,700
Won Kyu.

439
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,900
What were you talking about?

440
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,800
We were just sitting here.

441
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,240
- We talked about our MBTIs.
- I see.

442
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,810
I'm ISTP.

443
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
ISTP.

444
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,350
- What about you?
- I'm INTJ.

445
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,580
You're most similar.

446
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,850
- Us?
- Yes.

447
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,820
We have two different elements.

448
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
- Oh, do you?
- Yes.

449
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,560
Only half.

450
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,990
He's a thinker.

451
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,230
- He's a real thinker.
- He's definitely a thinker.

452
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,430
From the start, Won Kyu stands out.

453
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

454
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,070
Are you good at cooking?

455
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,940
Maybe egg rice?

456
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,710
- It's the best food.
- Yes.

457
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,680
- It's the best food.
- That's the most delicious.

458
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,050
- I'll look forward to it.
- Me?

459
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,890
Is he determined to be a good cook already?

460
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
Oh, my gosh.

461
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,990
I'll try my best.

462
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,240
Oh, she's pretty.

463
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,150
- Everyone's so pretty.
- Everyone's...

464
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,610
- She's here.
- A go-getter woman.

465
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,250
- A go-getter woman.
- She's charismatic.

466
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,220
Everyone has a different style.

467
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,350
- Right.
- They're all different.

468
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,750
- This is getting interesting.
- Their characteristics...

469
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,880
(The seventh resident is Park Ji Hyeon.)

470
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,450
Hello.

471
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,090
Hello.

472
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

473
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,790
Hello.

474
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,630
- Hello.
- Hello.

475
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,070
- Have a seat.
- Anywhere you like.

476
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,070
Do you want to sit here?

477
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,940
Hello.

478
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
What's your name?

479
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,540
I'm Park Ji Hyeon.

480
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,050
You have similar names.

481
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,850
I'm Yeon. Hong Ji Yeon.

482
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,250
- Really?
- Yes.

483
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,020
- It must be confusing.
- Hong Ji Yeon.

484
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,560
Who was here first?

485
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Me.

486
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,430
Oh, hello.

487
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,400
When did you get here?

488
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,170
An hour ago.

489
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,400
An hour ago?

490
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,640
What did you do?

491
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,140
I was spacing out. Then I looked outside.

492
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,910
Then I greeted everyone one by one.

493
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,010
Did you say hi?

494
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,050
Yes.

495
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,030
Ji Hyeon was the standard example...

496
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,260
of femininity.

497
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,300
She has everything men like.

498
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,110
She's bright and down to earth.

499
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,210
I think she'll be very popular.

500
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,480
Ji Hyeon looks haughty,

501
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,080
but she'd talk to others first.

502
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,420
She'd be very popular.

503
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,940
He's like a Golden Retriever.

504
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,080
He's handsome.

505
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,650
These men are very tall.

506
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,320
- It's unreal.
- It's unreal.

507
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,490
I mean, they give me a sense of deprivation.

508
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,420
There will be high tension between men.

509
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,250
(The eighth resident is Cho Yoo Sik.)

510
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

511
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

512
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

513
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

514
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

515
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,060
Can I sit here?

516
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,840
Nice to meet you.

517
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,310
- Your name...
- What's your name?

518
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,450
I'm Cho Yoo Sik.

519
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,150
- Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

520
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,720
That's a cool name. Yoo Sik.

521
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,260
What are your names?

522
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,590
I'm Jung Won Kyu.

523
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,260
I'm Kim Woo Jin.

524
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,060
I'm Kwak Min Kyung.

525
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,330
I'm Park Ji Hyeon.

526
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,600
I'm Choi Yun Nyeong.

527
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm Hong Ji Yeon.

528
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,010
I'm Sung Baek Hyun.

529
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,310
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

530
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,080
Nice to meet you.

531
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,250
I won't be able to memorize everyone's name. What do I do?

532
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,620
He's handsome.

533
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,520
He's tall. He looks like a model.

534
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,290
My ex would like his appearance the most.

535
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,760
He has a strong first impression.

536
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,660
"He's good-looking."

537
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
That's the feeling I had.

538
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,200
"I shouldn't be next to him." That's what I thought.

539
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,410
Among everyone...

540
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,510
(Who left the strongest first impression?)

541
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,010
Baek Hyun.

542
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,780
He was just cool.

543
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,550
He's the type my ex would like.

544
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,020
My ex likes someone reliable.

545
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,850
Someone like a big dog.

546
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,490
But I wasn't on alert.

547
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,570
Is everyone here?

548
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,640
Are we expecting more?

549
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,070
But there's no seat.

550
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,510
Judging by no more slippers...

551
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,210
- That's sharp.
- Amazing.

552
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,650
- Yoo Sik. You're knowledgeable.
- Yes.

553
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,850
I'm sorry.

554
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,880
The envelope.

555
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,490
Shall we open it since everyone's here?

556
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,120
Allow me to open it.

557
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,630
I can't wait.

558
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,240
This is the residency notice.

559
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,740
Do you want me to put it here?

560
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,210
You can read it for us.

561
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,710
Although I'm nervous...

562
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,050
(Residency Notice)

563
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,110
(You cannot reveal or mention your ex.)

564
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,150
(Until the final decision, you can't go out with anyone.)

565
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,180
(You cannot reveal your personal information aside from your name.)

566
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,250
(You cannot share your social media or contact number.)

567
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,480
(You cannot keep in touch via phones.)

568
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,720
(You cannot share even if you find out about someone else's ex.)

569
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,730
(Kwak Min Kyung)

570
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,630
(Sung Baek Hyun)

571
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,600
(Park Ji Hyeon)

572
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,630
(Cho Yoo Sik)

573
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,570
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

574
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,440
(Kim Woo Jin)

575
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,270
(Hong Ji Yeon)

576
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,170
(Jung Won Kyu)

577
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,890
(EXchange 4)

578
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,700
(Episode 1, Please take good care of him.)

579
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,330
- Finally.
- It's starting.

580
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,400
- It's finally starting.
- It's been a while.

581
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,070
- By the way, their looks...
- It's crazy.

582
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,100
- Yes.
- Why are they so...

583
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,900
- They're all good-looking.
- I know. That's new.

584
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,640
It's already so thrilling...

585
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,040
to think about the epic they're going to make.

586
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,310
- I can't wait.
- Me neither.

587
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,450
So far, it's not easy to predict who is whose ex.

588
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,610
Rather than predicting,

589
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,550
I'm more surprised...

590
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,550
by their appearances.

591
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,820
Everyone is...

592
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,720
unique in their ways.

593
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,460
They're all very charming.

594
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,130
To be honest, I couldn't think of guessing their exes.

595
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,860
Gosh, it's so confusing.

596
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,800
Now that everyone's here,

597
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,200
- we could take a look at the house.
- Sounds good.

598
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,370
- Let's take a look at the house.
- I'm curious.

599
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,140
- Yes. Sounds good to me.
- Is that okay with you?

600
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,770
We've been sitting down for too long.

601
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,940
- Let's go together.
- Sure.

602
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
I thought you wanted to go to the restroom.

603
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,580
- Oh, yes.
- You should go first.

604
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,380
This is a really nice house.

605
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,280
(The Pyeongchang-dong house the 8 people will live from today)

606
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,160
(Levels 1, 2, 3, 4)

607
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,290
(If you take the stairs next to the living room on the 3rd floor...)

608
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,500
Let's go upstairs.

609
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,430
This is crazy.

610
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,440
This is so nice.

611
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,110
(Women's room on the 4th floor)

612
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:37,850
(Women's room on the 4th floor)

613
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,320
This is so nice.

614
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,480
The closet is really spacious.

615
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,120
Is this all a closet?

616
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,390
- Are they closets?
- Yes, they're all closets.

617
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,160
- Awesome.
- I brought a lot of clothes.

618
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,860
- This is the men's room.
- Really?

619
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,900
- Can I see?
- Sure.

620
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,970
There's a terrace in front.

621
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,770
- This is such a nice house.
- Yes.

622
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,570
(Ji Hyeon heads to the terrace, and Yoo Sik heads to the room.)

623
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:09,810
(The terrace on the 4th floor)

624
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,420
(The night in the terrace is long.)

625
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,050
The lock should be here.

626
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,790
Why on earth is it on the other side?

627
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,960
(Next to it...)

628
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,030
I should use this room.

629
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,260
I know.

630
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,500
(Men's room on the 4th floor)

631
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,600
I think we should play a game...

632
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,340
- to decide who'll use this room.
- Yes.

633
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,110
Nice.

634
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,840
It's a nice house.

635
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,980
That's so cool.

636
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,950
It almost looks like a gallery.

637
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,810
- Everyone.
- Yes?

638
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,680
Have you seen the restroom yet?

639
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,150
- Is it nice?
- It's so nice.

640
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,720
- Nice.
- There's a bathtub. Come here.

641
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,190
- There's a bathtub?
- Check this out.

642
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,230
Let me see.

643
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,590
- Isn't this nice?
- What?

644
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,660
It's as big as a pool.

645
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,830
What should we do?

646
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,700
Should we play rock-paper-scissors...

647
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,830
and decide two winners to use this room?

648
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,600
- I'm down.
- Or...

649
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,070
This is so exciting.

650
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,100
I think this is the nicest house.

651
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,940
This is so nice.

652
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,810
(Dining room)

653
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,980
It'll be fun to cook here.

654
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,080
I can't wait to see the food.

655
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,620
(Kitchen)

656
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,460
(Sometimes it becomes a space for two people.)

657
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,830
(Peeping)

658
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,470
There's downstairs.

659
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,870
- Downstairs?
- Yes.

660
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,800
(The stairs to the 2nd floor)

661
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,710
There's another floor below.

662
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,110
- Awesome.
- How many floors are there?

663
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,440
What is this place?

664
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,110
This is so interesting.

665
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,720
- A common living room?
- I'd get lost.

666
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,750
That's what I mean.

667
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,150
(If you take the stairs down next to the kitchen,)

668
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,190
(you'll see a cosy space.)

669
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,630
(The mini living room on the 2nd floor)

670
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,860
This is so pretty.

671
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,330
- It's so pretty.
- That's what I mean.

672
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,830
This place is so much fun.

673
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,700
There are stairs?

674
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,200
There's another living room on the second floor.

675
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,840
There are so many spaces.

676
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,210
- People will cry a lot there.
- I know.

677
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,310
All those spaces are perfect for a secret conversation.

678
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,880
- What is this place?
- So nice.

679
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,950
(They reached the 1st floor after the mini living room.)

680
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,450
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

681
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,620
It's a room.

682
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,090
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

683
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,260
It's a room.

684
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,560
- It's a women's room.
- Oh, my gosh.

685
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,660
This is so pretty.

686
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,860
- The bed.
- Nice.

687
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,430
- I love it.
- Here's the restroom.

688
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,130
- Awesome.
- This is so nice.

689
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,900
This is awesome.

690
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,200
(Women's room on the 1st floor)

691
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,270
This is so pretty.

692
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,840
Right? It's so pretty.

693
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,140
This is really nice.

694
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,080
- Right?
- This is the vanity table.

695
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,980
I love it. This must be for two people.

696
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,510
There's also a closet.

697
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,420
This is so pretty.

698
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,590
The winner gets to choose first.

699
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,220
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

700
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,490
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

701
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,690
Second floor?

702
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,600
Wait.

703
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,730
- I like both.
- Me too.

704
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,470
- I choose the second floor.
- Okay.

705
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,240
- Thank you.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

706
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,710
(The next winner is Min Kyung.)

707
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,640
This matches my dress.

708
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,680
Right?

709
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,750
My roommate?

710
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,450
- Shall we? Then the second floor?
- That leaves us two.

711
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,750
- Yes, we can share the room.
- Perfect.

712
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,920
Good. The second floor...

713
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,320
(Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon's room)

714
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,590
(Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon's room)

715
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,700
- Is this the men's room?
- Yes, it's the men's room.

716
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,430
The women's room is right next to the men's.

717
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,170
What? Really?

718
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,840
It's right across the door.

719
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,340
(Outside the women's room faces...)

720
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:04,050
(Men's room on the 1st floor)

721
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,980
It was close enough for our noses to touch...

722
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,150
if we got out of our rooms at the same time.

723
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
"Wait a minute."

724
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,290
"This could lead to a fling."

725
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,760
The common living room is also upstairs.

726
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,760
That's a good idea.

727
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,970
That's nice. Yes.

728
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,270
They'll keep running into each other.

729
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,540
- Can I check out the men's room?
- Sure.

730
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,440
- It's small.
- There's nothing much.

731
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,380
Oh, I see.

732
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,240
There is...

733
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,750
no powder room in the men's room.

734
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,450
Thank you.

735
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,890
- Do you want me to close it?
- I'll do it.

736
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,040
How do we decide it? Rock-paper-scissors?

737
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,140
- How tall are you?
- I'm 188cm.

738
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,380
- I knew you were tall. I'm 183cm.
- And...

739
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,680
- You're 183cm?
- I'm around 182 to 183cm.

740
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,180
- Everyone is tall.
- I know.

741
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,220
He's out.

742
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,750
We're thinking about choosing the room.

743
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

744
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,490
How should we decide it?

745
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,420
What's your favourite game?

746
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,060
- How about rock-paper-scissors?
- Rock-paper-scissors?

747
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,060
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

748
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,270
Rock-paper-scissors.

749
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,630
(Baek Hyun and Woo Jin won.)

750
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,700
It's okay.

751
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,940
Are you going to use this room? Me too.

752
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,640
- Are you two...
- Yes.

753
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,740
Congratulations.

754
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,610
(Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

755
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,150
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

756
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,050
The fourth floor looked nice.

757
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,490
The restroom is only on the fourth floor.

758
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,660
- That'll be inconvenient.
- Yes.

759
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,030
Is there no restroom downstairs aside from the women's?

760
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,800
I don't think I saw one.

761
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,100
Do you want to check again?

762
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,300
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik, the 1st floor roommates, form...)

763
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,000
(the fellowship of the restroom.)

764
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,370
- There isn't one here.
- No.

765
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,680
- Do we have to shower here?
- This probably isn't one.

766
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,610
(Peeking)

767
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,910
(Laundry room on the 1.5th floor)

768
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,210
- Is it there?
- It isn't in here.

769
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,020
Have you guys decided on your rooms?

770
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,220
- Yes, we have.
- How so?

771
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,890
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I mean, who uses this room?

772
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,360
Baek Hyun and I use the room upstairs.

773
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,890
Yoo Sik and I use the room downstairs.

774
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:31,930
I see.

775
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,530
The rooms are so nice.

776
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,540
Which men would use the room across from mine...

777
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,910
was the most important.

778
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,240
Since the rooms are so close, we'll see each other often.

779
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,680
If we see each other often...

780
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,580
and become closer,

781
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,380
our relationship could evolve in an unexpected way.

782
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,020
I won't run into the men who use the room upstairs much.

783
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,020
So, I wanted to run into men often downstairs.

784
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,060
They probably want to be on the same floor, right?

785
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,830
- That's right.
- Using the same floor is important.

786
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,460
- That's right. That's important.
- That's the most important.

787
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,430
Then there's a chance of having your ex on the same floor.

788
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,540
Would it nice to have your ex on the same floor?

789
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,640
People who want their exes back...

790
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,370
- would prefer that.
- They would love that.

791
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,440
It depends on what they want.

792
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,670
People who don't want their exes back would prefer...

793
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,040
the separate floors.

794
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,650
Seeing as how Min Kyung keeps asking that question...

795
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,480
- She's curious.
- She must be hoping to...

796
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,180
either run into her ex...

797
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,680
or avoid her ex.

798
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,950
- It must be 1 of the 2.
- That's right.

799
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,450
I think it's the former.

800
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,290
(Searching for a restroom, he comes back...)

801
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,530
(to the men's room on the 1st floor.)

802
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,260
- It isn't here.
- This room...

803
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,960
Is it here? It's here.

804
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,800
(He finds the restroom behind the door.)

805
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,930
- Every room has it.
- Every room has it.

806
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,970
There's a restroom.

807
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,040
This room is nice too.

808
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,170
Do you want to switch?

809
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,940
- Do you want to switch?
- No.

810
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,540
- It's nice.
- It's good.

811
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,250
(People in the 1st floor room are happy to find the restroom.)

812
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,950
How is the yard outside? I haven't been there.

813
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,480
- Shall we go outside?
- Yes.

814
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,320
Have you been there?

815
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,320
- Where?
- The yard outside.

816
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,590
- No.
- Shall we go outside?

817
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,620
That sounds good.

818
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,700
We could lay out a mat on the grass in the evening...

819
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,760
and hang out, right?

820
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,830
We could do that.

821
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:21,400
(Yard on the 3rd floor)

822
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,540
(Yard on the 3rd floor)

823
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,340
- It's big.
- It's really big.

824
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,740
The yard is really big.

825
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,780
You could play soccer there.

826
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,810
I want to set up a tent outside and observe them.

827
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,690
The view is really pretty here.

828
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,750
- Right?
- Yes.

829
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,160
The yard is nice.

830
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,360
(Yoo Sik waited for Ji Hyeon and Ji Yeon.)

831
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,530
It's so nice.

832
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,500
- Isn't it so nice?
- Yes, it's so nice.

833
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,570
I want to say 500 million times that this place is so nice.

834
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,280
I think people will fight a lot at a place like that later.

835
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,780
- That place...
- That place.

836
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,950
or the second-floor terrace.

837
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,230
Baek Hyun, let's go inside.

838
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,730
Okay.

839
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,540
EXchange 4 has the best...

840
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,780
- house.
- It's the best.

841
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,780
- Seriously.
- Hands down.

842
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,980
For the 4th season, they prepared a 4-story house.

843
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,650
The previous houses were very pretty as well,

844
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,880
but this one is on another level.

845
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,920
I think the rooms are really pretty.

846
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,720
The house is like a showroom.

847
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,720
- That's right.
- And...

848
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,730
apparently, the decorations are artworks by professionals.

849
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:50,790
The paintings too.

850
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,930
- Yes.
- Since the place is huge,

851
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,930
I can already imagine the things that will take place...

852
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,500
in the nooks and crannies.

853
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,230
I think many things will happen.

854
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,970
- People will flirt.
- They'll flirt.

855
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,040
- And...
- They'll also argue.

856
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,010
- they'll fight and cry.
- They'll fight.

857
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,180
- That's right.
- I shouldn't be like this,

858
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,640
but I can't wait to watch them fight.

859
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,820
Shall we eat doenjang stew since it's our first day?

860
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,820
- Let's do that.
- That sounds good.

861
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,250
- Meat too.
- Shall we grill meat and eat it...

862
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,490
with doenjang stew?

863
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,590
Okay.

864
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,590
(Woo Jin is in charge of doenjang stew.)

865
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,060
(He begins to prepare the vegetables.)

866
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,540
(His roommate, Baek Hyun, joins him upon hearing the cutting sound.)

867
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,070
All right.

868
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,440
(Ji Hyeon from the same floor comes down.)

869
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,810
I'm here.

870
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,340
- You'll make kimchi fried rice.
- That's right.

871
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,380
(Ji Hyeon is in charge of kimchi fried rice today.)

872
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,180
No way. Did you prepare those ingredients?

873
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,650
Yes.

874
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,980
- You have incredible skills.
- You're too kind.

875
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,720
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

876
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,890
I came too late.

877
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,120
Before we grill meat...

878
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,330
Green onion salad.

879
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,760
I'll make the sauce for the green onion salad.

880
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,740
I want to follow my mom's recipe.

881
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,740
(Min Kyung wants to recreate the taste of her mom's dish.)

882
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,610
I think I'll ruin it.

883
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,580
- Shall I do it?
- Yes.

884
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,650
One. Two.

885
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,260
- Do you need these green onions?
- No.

886
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,240
(Baek Hyun rinses the green onions Ji Hyeon leaves behind.)

887
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,310
(He begins to help Min Kyung by julienning the green onions.)

888
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,050
It didn't look like this.

889
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,950
Soy sauce.

890
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,860
(The julienned green onions are ready.)

891
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,570
(She hasn't noticed the julienned green onions yet.)

892
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,350
(He goes back.)

893
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,220
(He picks up the bowl of julienned green onions.)

894
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,590
It's tasty.

895
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,250
- Have you tried it?
- It's tasty.

896
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,560
I'm curious.

897
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,660
I haven't done anything.

898
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,190
Shall I put it together?

899
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,330
Ta-da.

900
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,370
Baek Hyun keeps circling around Min Kyung.

901
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,070
He keeps trying to help her.

902
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,940
I feel like Baek Hyun and Min Kyung...

903
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,740
Are they interested in each other? Are they exes?

904
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,910
Isn't it interest?

905
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,650
The first person you fall for is important.

906
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,620
- It lasts a long time.
- Yes.

907
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,820
Where are the gloves?

908
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,990
Over here.

909
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,760
- Please go ahead. Yes.
- Mix them with my hands?

910
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,160
- Does it need more?
- What?

911
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,500
Does it need more sauce?

912
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,670
I don't think so.

913
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,810
- It's too long.
- What?

914
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:26,840
Give me a shorter piece.

915
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,420
It's tasty, right?

916
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,590
(Satisfied)

917
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,590
It's tasty!

918
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:41,990
He fed her!

919
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,230
He actually fed her!

920
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,790
Nice.

921
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,960
He's guilty.

922
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,230
- Baek Hyun is guilty.
- He's guilty.

923
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,830
He flirted with her just now, right?

924
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,940
It's tasty, right?

925
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,070
It's tasty!

926
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,680
You put in so much effort.

927
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,280
Please enjoy it.

928
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,720
Oh, no.

929
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,020
Something smells delicious.

930
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,350
Do you need help?

931
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,320
We're done.

932
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,960
(Doenjang stew is nearly done.)

933
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,060
I'm sorry.

934
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,400
- How is it? You tried it.
- It's really nice.

935
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,400
I think we should boil it further.

936
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,670
- The stew is done, right?
- Yes, the stew is done.

937
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,770
Do you need help with anything?

938
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,370
No. Right now...

939
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,210
- We need to chop up some kimchi.
- Kimchi.

940
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,980
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

941
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,750
(Yoo Sik becomes an assistant for the kimchi fried rice.)

942
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,950
How finely should I chop it?

943
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,180
I think...

944
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,350
- A bit more finely.
- A bit more finely?

945
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,050
I think kimchi fried rice will be tasty.

946
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,360
- Seriously.
- Looking forward to it?

947
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,920
Please don't look forward to it.

948
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,300
Shall I scoop out some rice?

949
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,370
Yes, please.

950
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,570
How much should I scoop out?

951
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,040
For now, that much is good.

952
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,280
It looks tasty.

953
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,340
It's nice.

954
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,950
It looks like kimchi fried rice.

955
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,020
Good.

956
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,990
Using aged kimchi would've made it savourer.

957
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,920
(Min Kyung is attempting to make fried eggs.)

958
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,230
Help me.

959
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
(Assistant Baek Hyun accompanies her from the very start.)

960
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,700
Thank you.

961
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,480
Baek Hyun keeps following her.

962
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,440
He stays by her side like the rings of Saturn.

963
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,450
I think he's interested in her.

964
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,910
I think he wants to look after her.

965
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,750
I think Baek Hyun's ex isn't there.

966
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,420
He doesn't seem to worry about what other people will think.

967
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,350
- He doesn't do that.
- I think it's his personality.

968
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,990
You could express your interest openly...

969
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,290
even if your ex is there.

970
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,330
- I think it's his personality.
- If he's there to meet someone,

971
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,660
he could look after Min Kyung...

972
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,930
even if his ex is there.

973
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,500
- That's right.
- That might be the case.

974
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,470
Watch.

975
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,340
(The yolk burst already.)

976
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,210
The oil is splattering too much.

977
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,580
It looks funny.

978
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,450
I think it'll be impossible to make over-easy eggs.

979
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,490
I'll make over-easy eggs a bit later.

980
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,490
Okay.

981
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,230
I think it'll be impossible.

982
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,430
- Over-easy eggs?
- The heat is pretty high.

983
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,730
Can you make them now?

984
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,710
(Assistant Yoo Sik transfers to the fried egg department.)

985
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,110
Be careful.

986
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,350
The heat is really high.

987
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,980
(He adds the eggs amidst Min Kyung's worry.)

988
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,320
It bursts right away.

989
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,160
(Careful)

990
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,000
The yolk can burst at any moment.

991
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

992
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,840
Shall we cook the meat?

993
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,040
It's a meat party.

994
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,880
(The multi-talented Yoo Sik cooks meat as well.)

995
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,910
Everyone is good at cooking.

996
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,110
It looks delicious. What is it?

997
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,520
It's pork neck.

998
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,120
It looks so delicious.

999
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,790
Kimchi fried rice and fried eggs.

1000
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:31,950
Let's enjoy them.

1001
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,720
It smells good.

1002
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,990
It was my first time cooking for so many people.

1003
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,460
(The empty table gets filled with warmth.)

1004
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,830
Hurry up and take a seat. The meat will go cold.

1005
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,560
It looks delicious.

1006
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,000
Which seats are empty?

1007
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,940
- The unoccupied ones.
- These ones.

1008
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,570
(Ji Hyeon points to the seats that are close to hers.)

1009
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,810
Sit here.

1010
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,550
- Sit here.
- I'll sit there.

1011
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,680
I want red wine too.

1012
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,890
Why did Min Kyung tell him which seat to take?

1013
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,160
Isn't it better to sit across from than to sit next to someone?

1014
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,830
- Sitting across from is the best.
- I know.

1015
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,360
- You can make eye contact.
- Talking like this isn't...

1016
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,430
- as good as this.
- I know.

1017
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,030
Can I sit here?

1018
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,200
- Yes.
- Is someone sitting here?

1019
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,400
- Well...
- No, the seat is empty.

1020
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,770
It's my seat.

1021
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,280
Shall we clink our glasses?

1022
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,450
- Shall we clink our glasses?
- That sounds good.

1023
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,250
Nice to meet you.

1024
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,180
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1025
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,050
Nice to meet you.

1026
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,240
This wine is really tasty.

1027
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,870
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1028
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,240
Thank you for the food.

1029
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,910
It really looks like a dish my mom made.

1030
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,980
- Woo Jin, you worked so hard.
- No, everyone worked hard.

1031
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,510
- Well done, everyone.
- The best.

1032
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,620
Oh, my! The soup is amazing.

1033
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,660
It's tasty.

1034
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,260
Kimchi fried rice is tasty too.

1035
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,930
I'm not confident about my kimchi fried rice,

1036
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,930
but please enjoy it.

1037
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,640
(Impressed)

1038
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,370
- It's really tasty.
- Is it okay?

1039
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,340
It came out well.

1040
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,410
Oh, my! It's tasty.

1041
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,020
- Really?
- Yes. Seriously.

1042
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,150
It's tasty.

1043
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,790
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1044
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,860
The green onion salad is good too.

1045
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,460
- What?
- The green onion salad is good too.

1046
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,460
- Is it good? I'll try it.
- It's tasty.

1047
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,330
Isn't it a bit spicy?

1048
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,170
The green onions are spicy, but the sauce is tasty.

1049
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,870
Really? Thank you.

1050
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,710
- It'll be tasty with beer.
- I want beer.

1051
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:09,980
Who wants beer?

1052
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,580
- Do you want beer?
- Yes. I...

1053
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,550
Will you drink it?

1054
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,320
- I'll bring it.
- Let's bring it together.

1055
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
Okay.

1056
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,760
Shall we clink our glasses?

1057
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,030
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1058
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,270
Cheers.

1059
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,250
Time passed so quickly today.

1060
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,190
- I know.
- Suddenly, we're here.

1061
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:54,090
We decided to name the house as well.

1062
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,390
- What do you think? Isn't it cute?
- That sounds good.

1063
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,390
- It won't change daily, right?
- It can be an ordinary name.

1064
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,430
No.

1065
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,960
Can you go first?

1066
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,530
Mountain Gym.

1067
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:08,770
Shouldn't we gather around and do exercises?

1068
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,270
- Together?
- We can do it at the front.

1069
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,510
It'll be a workout to walk outside.

1070
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,210
- I know.
- It's an uphill road.

1071
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,210
Yes.

1072
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,920
Shall we talk about our ideal types?

1073
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,350
- Our ideal types?
- It'll be fun.

1074
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,350
Our ideal types?

1075
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,460
It's so hard.

1076
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,290
Doesn't your ex become your ideal type?

1077
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,830
That happens at times.

1078
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,470
- The person you like becomes one.
- That's right.

1079
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,500
- Right?
- That's right.

1080
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,770
I think...

1081
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,070
I like someone who looks like a fennec fox.

1082
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,510
- A fennec fox?
- Yes.

1083
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:49,950
I really like someone who looks good in denim.

1084
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,250
- Denim?
- Yes, denim.

1085
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,320
If he looks good in denim, I become interested.

1086
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,250
It's important to dress in your own style.

1087
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,920
- That's right. Seriously.
- The fashion sense is important.

1088
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,920
As for me...

1089
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,160
I like someone who doesn't dress up in an overly fancy way.

1090
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,570
I like someone who is naturally beautiful.

1091
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,300
- You like the natural type.
- Yes.

1092
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,470
I don't want her to dress up in an overly fancy way.

1093
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,040
- Why don't you like fancy clothes?
- Fancy clothes?

1094
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,880
I brought many fancy clothes.

1095
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,180
- Well...
- Same here.

1096
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,050
- I bought fancy clothes.
- My clothes are...

1097
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,090
- fancy too.
- I'll dress up as much as I can.

1098
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,190
I'm in trouble.

1099
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,590
- I don't mean it like that.
- I'll be like a peacock.

1100
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,460
I can't wait.

1101
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,330
I like someone who dresses well...

1102
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,500
within her boundaries.

1103
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,630
Someone who knows...

1104
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,070
- which style suits her.
- Yes.

1105
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,670
I'm the opposite. I like someone with a bad style.

1106
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,170
- Really?
- Someone you can fix.

1107
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:50,240
A little bit.

1108
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:56,410
When I see a cute side like that, I become more interested.

1109
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,680
- I know what you mean.
- An imperfection.

1110
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,750
A clumsy side.

1111
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,750
If I like someone,

1112
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:05,320
he needs to have a clumsy side like that...

1113
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,590
for me to really fall for him.

1114
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,190
What?

1115
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,660
Someone like Hwi Hyun?

1116
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,390
She doesn't like perfect men.

1117
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,200
Someone she wants to look after.

1118
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,730
Someone who looks good in a hoodie.

1119
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,700
- That's right. A tracksuit.
- Yes.

1120
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,240
I like people who look good in a tracksuit.

1121
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,500
What if someone you don't like has a clumsy side?

1122
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,840
Wouldn't she ignore him then?

1123
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,340
- She wouldn't even look at him.
- Seriously.

1124
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
- I'm sorry.
- She'd have no reason to look.

1125
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,880
That's right.

1126
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,850
Even if a man has a bad style,

1127
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,980
I become interested if he looks good in denim.

1128
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,690
- She really likes denim.
- What is that?

1129
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:38,890
- I look good in denim.
- What is that?

1130
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,090
- Earlier...
- Why don't we switch rooms?

1131
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,460
Seriously.

1132
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,330
- Did you say denim?
- What? Is it the doorbell?

1133
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,230
- Hold on. Something is here.
- Shall I go?

1134
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,570
- I'll go.
- The time has come.

1135
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,900
I'm scared. Seriously.

1136
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,240
I'm excited. What is it?

1137
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,480
It was our first time hearing the doorbell.

1138
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,350
I became nervous because I knew that there'd be something.

1139
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,420
The time has come.

1140
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,420
What's at the door? What is it?

1141
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,220
It must be something about the ex.

1142
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,530
(Yoo Sik goes to check the door.)

1143
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,640
(He doesn't see anything.)

1144
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,740
(At the bottom of the staircase, you see...)

1145
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,580
(a white mailbox.)

1146
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,320
(There's an envelope inside.)

1147
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:49,490
(He carefully takes out the mysterious envelope.)

1148
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,470
There's a mailbox...

1149
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:00,370
- about 20 stairs down.
- Really?

1150
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,370
- I saw it on my way here.
- Really?

1151
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,070
- I was so surprised.
- Really?

1152
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,570
- That's why it's taking so long.
- He's finally here.

1153
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,710
He had to go down 20 stairs and come back up.

1154
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,380
- Well done.
- It's far down the staircase.

1155
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,250
- Right?
- Well done.

1156
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,550
What are we going to do?

1157
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,820
I'm scared.

1158
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,550
- I'll open it.
- Okay.

1159
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,060
I'm excited.

1160
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,390
- Are you excited?
- Yes.

1161
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,260
- Do you want to read it?
- What? No!

1162
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,290
Read it.

1163
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,240
What? What is it?

1164
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,970
"This is the Ex Introduction from your ex."

1165
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,610
"Please take turns and read your introduction."

1166
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,350
(Please take turns and read your introduction.)

1167
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,150
- That's right.
- It's a must.

1168
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,420
- It's what I like the most.
- The time has come.

1169
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,520
This is when I become overly invested.

1170
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,020
- You never get tired of it.
- No.

1171
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,920
- You never get tired of it.
- The Ex Introduction is a must.

1172
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,930
Never.

1173
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,060
My heart is suddenly racing.

1174
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,400
Maybe it's like that.

1175
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,100
We read all of our Ex Introductions.

1176
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,670
- Really?
- If you read yours...

1177
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,970
We're sorry.

1178
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,740
We all had our turns.

1179
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,770
- I can't believe these people.
- They're too much.

1180
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,380
- I'll read it first.
- Okay.

1181
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,780
Oh, no. I think I'm going to cry.

1182
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,990
(First, Min Kyung's introduction from her ex)

1183
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:26,620
It's so long. What am I going to do?

1184
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,720
What am I going to do?

1185
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,600
I'll do my best.

1186
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,900
You can do it.

1187
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,700
Okay.

1188
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,070
Here I go.

1189
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,750
"Among people I've seen, my ex..."

1190
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,580
"lives her life the most diligently and passionately."

1191
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:01,260
"And she was like a rest area for me."

1192
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:07,860
"When I was tired, struggling, sad, or happy,"

1193
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,900
"she sympathized with me and brought me joy."

1194
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,570
"Even on the days I felt like I couldn't breathe,"

1195
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,070
"she made me feel like I was resting..."

1196
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,010
"when we were together."

1197
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,580
"My time with my ex..."

1198
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,480
"was never boring."

1199
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:35,990
"My ex knows how to make someone happy."

1200
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,630
"I want her to be the happiest."

1201
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,630
"She made me wonder..."

1202
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:50,310
"if I'll love another person as much as I loved her."

1203
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:59,610
"My ex can't lie at all."

1204
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:00,950
"She's very honest."

1205
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,590
"I don't think she has a talent in acting."

1206
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,060
"She becomes more charming the more you look at her."

1207
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,490
That's the end.

1208
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,170
So, you won't act.

1209
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:19,430
No, I won't act.

1210
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,000
- You held back your tears well.
- Yes.

1211
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,940
I thought he'd have zero interest in me,

1212
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,580
but I felt a bit of longing.

1213
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:35,220
It made me sad.

1214
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,190
I felt like he wrote the introduction...

1215
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,190
with hopes...

1216
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,760
that I'll leave a good impression on the people I'll get to know.

1217
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,660
It felt like he was sending me off to someone else.

1218
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,810
"The more time you spend with her, the more charming she becomes..."

1219
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,810
- showed that they were in love.
- Yes.

1220
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:09,150
She must be someone who loves with her whole heart.

1221
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,490
I think her ex...

1222
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:11,920
still has lingering feelings...

1223
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,950
- for her.
- Really?

1224
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:15,390
He must have written his desire...

1225
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:18,590
to get back together in that letter.

1226
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,560
Then Min Kyung must have misunderstood.

1227
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,160
She thought the introduction...

1228
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,070
was him trying to send her off...

1229
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,900
- To someone else.
- Exactly.

1230
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,040
There's a misunderstanding.

1231
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,070
But he was putting it across in a subtle way.

1232
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,740
(Second, Ji Hyeon's introduction from her ex)

1233
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,480
- I'll read it out loud.
- Okay.

1234
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,450
"My ex..."

1235
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,890
"may seem like an aloof ice queen at first glance."

1236
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,300
"But once you get to know her, she's the clumsiest person on Earth."

1237
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,370
"She's always dropping things..."

1238
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,440
"or getting food on herself,"

1239
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,540
"which makes her quite a handful."

1240
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:09,610
"But looking back, those are her lovely charms."

1241
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,780
"My ex's favourite food..."

1242
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,690
"is fried chicken."

1243
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,220
"If she ever looks upset,"

1244
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,820
"just give her some fried chicken."

1245
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,230
"She'll be happy in seconds."

1246
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:28,130
"In that way, my ex,"

1247
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,530
"who easily brightens up with good food,"

1248
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,070
"is cheerful and loves people."

1249
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,970
"That's why she may seem like just a bubbly person."

1250
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,840
"But of everyone I've dated,"

1251
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,180
"she's the most thoughtful."

1252
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,850
"Even her smallest actions and words carry meaning."

1253
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,520
"She's very considerate and upright,"

1254
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,860
"only doing things she can take responsibility for."

1255
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,590
"If she meets someone in EXchange,"

1256
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,700
"I hope it will be a kind guy."

1257
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,880
I often hear that I'm quite different...

1258
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,940
from people's first impression of me.

1259
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:19,250
I think he wrote it to let those...

1260
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,880
who might have their guard up against me know...

1261
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,720
that I'm easygoing and candid.

1262
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,060
Being remembered as a nice person made me sad.

1263
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,590
Him saying that I was a great person.

1264
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,970
He thinks about and remembers the sides of me...

1265
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,230
that others don't see,

1266
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,210
in a positive way,

1267
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,810
and that reminded me of the past, making me feel upset.

1268
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,250
Ji Hyeon's introduction from her ex...

1269
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,720
felt like there were no lingering attachments.

1270
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,820
At the end, he wrote that he hoped she'd meet a kind person,

1271
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,190
which made that a little clearer.

1272
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,520
Keeping track of how much...

1273
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,890
fried chicken Ji Hyeon eats during the show...

1274
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,100
might be something to watch for.

1275
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,860
I bet she's a very lovely person,

1276
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,160
- She...
- unlike her first impression.

1277
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,870
Exactly. Once you get to know her,

1278
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,670
- she must be really genuine.
- Yes.

1279
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,740
Totally.

1280
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,470
I don't think it's right to judge her as cold...

1281
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,140
just by her appearance.

1282
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,540
There are things...

1283
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,610
you can never know just by looking at someone.

1284
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,650
Can we take a five-second break?

1285
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,350
- Okay.
- Take a deep breath.

1286
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,060
Don't we have a lot of feelers here?

1287
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,960
- I'm a feeler.
- Same here.

1288
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,190
- Me too.
- It's so sad.

1289
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:39,560
I'm sad. You're a feeler too, right?

1290
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,170
Did we just have the same thought?

1291
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,670
What is it? Are you a thinker?

1292
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

1293
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,040
- Are you tired?
- No.

1294
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,440
You're not tired, are you?

1295
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:52,840
No, thinkers have feelings too.

1296
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,780
She's right. We're thinkers with feelings.

1297
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,150
Maybe Woo Jin will cry the most while reading it aloud.

1298
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,650
It's possible.

1299
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,920
Go ahead.

1300
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,160
(Third, Yoo Sik's introduction from his ex)

1301
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:17,770
"My ex was always by my side."

1302
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,840
"He taught me what love really is."

1303
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,700
"I'm grateful to him for showing me..."

1304
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,710
"how giving love can be such a happy feeling."

1305
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,680
"Just like his good looks,"

1306
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,920
"he's even a good person on the inside."

1307
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:37,450
"He's perfect no matter where he is, leaving no reason to worry."

1308
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,290
"Seeing how diligent he is in everything..."

1309
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:41,560
"and how he achieves what he wants..."

1310
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,390
"made me want to become like him."

1311
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,760
"He was always my pride."

1312
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,570
"His first impression may seem cold."

1313
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:56,200
"But once you warm up to him, he's the warmest person."

1314
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,970
"And his occasional clumsiness amidst his perfection is cute."

1315
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:08,620
"He's so busy taking care of the people around him..."

1316
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,350
"that he hardly looks after himself."

1317
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,490
"That broke my heart."

1318
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:18,690
"Now, I hope he finds a great person he can rely on..."

1319
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,630
"and stops suffering."

1320
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,870
"I sincerely hope my ex becomes happy."

1321
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,500
"Please look after him."

1322
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,800
How sad.

1323
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,580
It made clear that...

1324
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,940
she had no feelings for me.

1325
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,720
It felt like she was introducing me so that...

1326
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,690
the others would treat me well, since she had...

1327
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,060
no lingering attachments,

1328
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,660
which wasn't exactly pleasant.

1329
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,600
She can make whatever decisions she wants,

1330
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,470
and I'd root for her if it made her happy.

1331
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,040
I didn't want to let go of her first.

1332
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,940
But I was...

1333
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,440
already like a player without a team...

1334
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,640
in the transfer market.

1335
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,780
It was frustrating.

1336
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,350
Had I cried there,

1337
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,790
it would have felt like trying to break a rock with an egg,

1338
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,150
so I held it in.

1339
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,440
Yoo Sik is still attached to her.

1340
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,870
- Yes.
- Totally.

1341
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,370
He has lingering feelings...

1342
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,380
- He does.
- Yes.

1343
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,710
He wants to meet her.

1344
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,750
He really seems to want to see her.

1345
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,150
Yoo Sik cried during the preliminary meeting.

1346
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,150
- He was the only one...
- Yes.

1347
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,150
- who cried.
- Exactly.

1348
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,720
He clearly still has...

1349
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,250
- feelings for her.
- Right.

1350
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,320
But why does my gut suddenly tell me...

1351
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,990
she's Ji Hyeon?

1352
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,390
- I feel like it's Yun Nyeong.
- Right?

1353
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:57,860
- I...
- I imagined it...

1354
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,060
as he read the letter.

1355
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,830
It felt like Yun Nyeong would have...

1356
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,630
written the words that way in the letter.

1357
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,970
(Yoo Sik's introduction sounds like Yun Nyeong?)

1358
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:08,240
Thinking from their perspective,

1359
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,540
the only female resident who could have written...

1360
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,340
"He was always my pride" was...

1361
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,040
- Yun Nyeong or Min Kyung.
- Right.

1362
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,080
(Fourth, Yun Nyeong's introduction from her ex)

1363
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:22,480
"The ex I knew was always cheerful."

1364
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:24,720
"She was the one who taught me,"

1365
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,320
"someone clueless about romantic relationships,"

1366
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,790
"what dating really is."

1367
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:32,530
"Even if I were incompetent and couldn't love her,"

1368
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,460
"she gave off a look and acted like,"

1369
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,800
"'How can you not love someone like me?'"

1370
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,270
"She's a cool person who isn't afraid to love."

1371
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:44,240
"She loves talking, so she's a chatterbox..."

1372
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,740
"and reacts really well."

1373
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,980
"You'll know as soon as you become friends with her."

1374
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,950
"Being with her makes you happy and at ease."

1375
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,920
"Kind and gentle,"

1376
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,080
"she gets hurt easily..."

1377
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,320
"and spends a lot of energy..."

1378
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,690
"cutting ties with people."

1379
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,360
"That's why I hope she meets someone..."

1380
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,830
"who can understand and protect her feelings."

1381
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,900
"By now, she could have used the pain..."

1382
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,470
"to become emotionally stronger."

1383
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,640
"She's more than capable of doing so,"

1384
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,070
"so I really hope she becomes happy."

1385
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,810
Are you laughing or crying?

1386
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:27,310
You can't cry and laugh at the same time.

1387
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,050
He wrote down...

1388
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,990
what I was upset about.

1389
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,790
It shows that he's aware of it.

1390
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:43,600
I thought, "You've grown quite a lot."

1391
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,870
"You've matured."

1392
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,100
I felt bad.

1393
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:55,540
"I only remembered him as a bad guy."

1394
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,810
"There must have been a lot of good memories."

1395
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:01,550
"And he knew me quite well."

1396
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,650
I had no idea he was...

1397
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,690
rooting for me and knew me that much.

1398
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,500
I felt grateful that he was sincerely wishing for me...

1399
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,870
to be happy.

1400
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:24,210
(Yun Nyeong, who only seemed bright, is crying.)

1401
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:35,020
Gosh, she's smiling even while crying.

1402
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,650
Right. She's always smiling, you know?

1403
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,890
Did she have a bad breakup?

1404
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,190
She gives off the feeling of a typical relationship...

1405
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,630
with a good beginning but the worst breakup.

1406
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:48,400
Yoo Sik looked like he felt bad.

1407
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,900
Me too. I can't help but wonder. Are Yun Nyeong and Yoo Sik...

1408
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,670
- exes?
- Maybe.

1409
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:56,670
When she read the letter, the line,

1410
01:17:56,670 --> 01:18:00,170
"Even if I couldn't love her," made him seem like someone chic...

1411
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,180
who was bad at expressing himself.

1412
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,840
Yoo Sik and Baek Hyun are the ones...

1413
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,950
- Baek Hyun - who come to mind.

1414
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,780
Am I not on the right track? Why do I think it's Woo Jin?

1415
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,820
- Woo Jin?
- While she was reading it,

1416
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,390
Woo Jin looked embarrassed,

1417
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,190
like he'd written it.

1418
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,060
Is it hard because we haven't been here for a while?

1419
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,390
Or is this season particularly tough?

1420
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:21,730
They're good at keeping poker faces.

1421
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,260
Isn't it hard? This season is challenging.

1422
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,670
They keep a straight face.

1423
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:30,300
(Fifth, Won Kyu's introduction from his ex)

1424
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,980
"Pale skin, an indifferent expression."

1425
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,490
Isn't this a web novel?

1426
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,090
I thought it was song lyrics.

1427
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,730
- "A web novel?" - I thought it was lyrics.

1428
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,930
"And in a flat tone."

1429
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,270
- A song?
- Pale skin

1430
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,470
An indifferent expression

1431
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,740
(A fresh twist that even brought back Simon Dominic)

1432
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:07,210
"The first time I met him, approaching him felt intimidating."

1433
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,640
"He seemed so rational and cold."

1434
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:13,250
"As you might have noticed,"

1435
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,780
"he's a big thinker."

1436
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:20,090
"He's rational and strong-willed."

1437
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:23,960
"But the more I got to know him, the more I realised..."

1438
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:27,030
"he is warm-hearted and even has a cute side."

1439
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,030
"Though he did not show it openly,"

1440
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,470
"he was always around me,"

1441
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,500
"like a clingy cat."

1442
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,740
"Surprisingly, he loves cute and lovely things,"

1443
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,980
"especially animals."

1444
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,480
"He gave me a sense of stability, like a calm, peaceful lake,"

1445
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,950
"and taught me that even doing the smallest things together..."

1446
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,280
"can bring happiness."

1447
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:53,720
"That is why I even thought of marrying him."

1448
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:58,260
"Finally, I hope my ex, who always tried to live life to the fullest,"

1449
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,930
"meets someone even more mature..."

1450
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:04,300
"and wonderful than me."

1451
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,440
Tissue, please.

1452
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,180
Aren't you a big thinker?

1453
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,780
To think you'd cry.

1454
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,840
Saying that she hopes I meet someone even more mature than her.

1455
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:51,080
That made me emotional.

1456
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:53,610
That has really stuck in my mind.

1457
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,080
Did she think...

1458
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,320
she wasn't mature because of me?

1459
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,890
Was I the one who made her feel that way?

1460
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,320
I couldn't help but wonder.

1461
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,430
I felt bad.

1462
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,030
Those words were heartbreaking.

1463
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,900
I also felt a sense of guilt.

1464
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:15,300
(Did you actually think your ex was immature?)

1465
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,040
Yes, some parts of her felt immature.

1466
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:22,610
There was a time when she needed to try harder.

1467
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,150
But from my perspective,

1468
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:29,450
I felt she wasn't doing enough.

1469
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,150
He is not a big thinker.

1470
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,460
- He cried for the first time.
- Exactly.

1471
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,730
But don't thinkers also cry easily?

1472
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,490
But they hardly ever cry in moments like that.

1473
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:42,060
It must have really affected him.

1474
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,860
- Maybe.
- Big thinkers...

1475
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,500
don't really cry.

1476
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,100
And even if they're about to, they always hold it in.

1477
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,670
- But Ji Yeon's expression...
- Right?

1478
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:52,910
It's like when you see your ex's new side.

1479
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:55,980
Her face was like, "You're actually crying?"

1480
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,380
Couldn't he be her ideal type?

1481
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,880
Someone who looks good when they cry.

1482
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,950
Like...

1483
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,120
Like she's staring at him because he looks attractive?

1484
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,190
- Staring at him since he's pretty?
- "He looks good when he cries."

1485
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,960
That's what I like.

1486
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,760
I like women who look pretty even when they cry.

1487
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,830
You must've made many people cry.

1488
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:13,530
Just to see them cry.

1489
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,630
- Either way, Ji Yeon was...
- I know, right?

1490
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,270
I think something is going on between Won Kyu and Ji Yeon.

1491
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:22,700
You don't just stare at someone like her.

1492
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,280
- It's sad.
- For real.

1493
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,050
(Sixth, Ji Yeon's introduction from her ex)

1494
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,130
- This is tough.
- Oh, dear.

1495
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,860
I can't help but cry as well.

1496
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,800
From the start, right?

1497
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,510
She hasn't even read a word.

1498
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,180
This is bad. She hasn't even started reading it.

1499
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:08,180
"My ex-girlfriend was warm-hearted,"

1500
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,320
"cute, and lovely."

1501
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:14,420
"On the inside..."

1502
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:16,960
My nose is running.

1503
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,360
Going later actually makes it worse.

1504
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,700
Right? Your tears just keep piling up.

1505
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,070
"She was very mature,"

1506
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:27,800
"and I had a lot to learn from her."

1507
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:33,910
"Innocent to the point that she was grateful..."

1508
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,180
"for even the smallest things and got touched easily,"

1509
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:41,350
"she always thanked me, despite my not doing much for her."

1510
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,120
"She was a truly nice person."

1511
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:53,660
"I always made her wait and feel lonely,"

1512
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,800
"using my busy schedule as an excuse."

1513
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:00,270
"If someone were to date my ex,"

1514
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,600
"I hope it would be someone..."

1515
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,810
"warm, kind, and who never makes her feel lonely."

1516
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:18,090
I could feel that he was sincere...

1517
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:21,420
in every word he wrote.

1518
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,830
Should I call it special or sad?

1519
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:29,630
It was sad, but reading it...

1520
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:33,800
didn't change my heart or anything.

1521
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,470
It was simply, "Yes, we had..."

1522
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:38,570
"our good times."

1523
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,220
Since everyone's introduction was heartbreaking,

1524
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,880
I'll make mine plain.

1525
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,550
I look forward to it.

1526
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:55,820
- What if you end up crying?
- No.

1527
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,590
(Seventh, Woo Jin's introduction from his ex)

1528
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,430
"My ex is friendly."

1529
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:08,940
"Although he may seem like a proud city boy,"

1530
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,670
"he's actually..."

1531
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,440
"a polite young man from Jeonju,"

1532
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:19,410
"kind-hearted and more affectionate than anyone else."

1533
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:25,790
"He taught me that someone could love me this much,"

1534
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:29,590
"and I could love someone back..."

1535
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,530
"just as much."

1536
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,060
"The relationship I had with him..."

1537
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,800
"was the happiest one of my life."

1538
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,330
"Even on days when he was so tired his eyes were half-closed,"

1539
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:42,670
"he would come with groceries and cook for me..."

1540
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,370
"the moment I said I was hungry."

1541
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,270
"He always did his best to show his love..."

1542
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:49,310
"and loved me..."

1543
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:52,550
"with everything he had."

1544
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,250
"I hope he doesn't get hurt in EXchange..."

1545
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,920
"and spends every day laughing..."

1546
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,790
"and making good memories."

1547
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,260
"And I hope he meets..."

1548
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,160
"someone warm and lovely..."

1549
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,900
"who can share sincere love with him."

1550
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,430
That's it.

1551
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,310
She had written,

1552
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,310
"Meeting my ex taught me..."

1553
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,210
"I could love someone back just as much as..."

1554
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,050
"I was loved by him."

1555
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,750
She did the same for me,

1556
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,820
so that line lingered in my mind.

1557
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,960
Rather a change of heart,

1558
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,330
it reminded me of the memories...

1559
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:42,300
I spent hanging out with her...

1560
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,930
and loving her.

1561
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:48,100
His introduction overlapped with Min Kyung's.

1562
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,370
Right? But I need to watch from the start to make the right guesses.

1563
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:51,570
I'm getting confused.

1564
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,510
Who was it that gave a lot of love again?

1565
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:54,740
Was it Min Kyung?

1566
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,840
You have to focus.

1567
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,540
If you had said you'd leave if you couldn't guess correctly,

1568
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:58,810
would you have guessed wrong?

1569
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,280
- You would have focused.
- I won't risk my position...

1570
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,350
like he did.

1571
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,550
(Got ambushed out of nowhere)

1572
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:04,950
Based on that letter alone,

1573
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,190
my guess is that Min Kyung...

1574
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,760
is Woo Jin's ex.

1575
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,460
We must consider the possibility that she might not be there.

1576
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,690
- The possibility?
- She might not be there.

1577
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:15,030
- Baek Hyun.
- Is it my turn?

1578
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:16,030
Yes.

1579
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:19,430
You caught me off guard.

1580
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:22,970
(Lastly, Baek Hyun's introduction from his ex)

1581
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,710
It's quite long.

1582
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:34,920
"When my ex-boyfriend falls in love,"

1583
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:39,490
"he gives everything he can without being calculative."

1584
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,120
"While dating him,"

1585
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,560
"he always made me feel like..."

1586
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,830
"the most precious and special person in the world."

1587
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,330
"He looks cold on the outside,"

1588
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,470
"but he's soft and warm-hearted, taking care of his beloved..."

1589
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:00,570
"more than himself."

1590
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:06,650
"On days we fought, he was always the first to say..."

1591
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:09,480
"he loved me, even when he was hurt himself."

1592
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,590
"Being a family man,"

1593
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:15,990
"my ex always said he wanted to become a good dad and husband."

1594
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,360
"He loved cooking for me."

1595
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:20,930
"And he was good at it."

1596
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:22,530
"Especially pasta."

1597
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,500
"Even though he's huge,"

1598
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,000
"he enjoys praise like a child."

1599
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,510
"He's pure to the point of..."

1600
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:34,040
"being touched by and appreciating even the smallest things."

1601
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,810
"Lastly, I hope my ex,"

1602
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:41,350
"who is full of love and values relationships and memories,"

1603
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,080
"doesn't get hurt..."

1604
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:46,090
"and only creates wonderful memories in EXchange."

1605
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:55,460
When I imagined marrying my ex,

1606
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,930
I thought...

1607
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:01,670
I would be able to live happily with my family.

1608
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:05,040
But the me back then is quite different from who I am now.

1609
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,010
After breaking up with my ex,

1610
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,550
I couldn't date for a long time,

1611
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,650
let alone think about marriage.

1612
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,890
I couldn't even protect...

1613
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,460
the one I loved.

1614
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:25,730
I kept wondering...

1615
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:27,830
whether I could date...

1616
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,060
the next person properly.

1617
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:33,070
"I shouldn't get married."

1618
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,970
That was what I thought.

1619
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,510
Through the introduction, I realised the person I was...

1620
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,310
and wondered if I could ever become like that again.

1621
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,080
- He even thought of marrying her.
- Goodness.

1622
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,550
I wonder who she is.

1623
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:54,150
But after breaking up,

1624
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:55,360
- he hasn't dated...
- For a while.

1625
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,260
That's quite surprising.

1626
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:00,360
He must have gone through that phase...

1627
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:03,660
because he was deeply in love with her.

1628
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,900
- I agree.
- I think...

1629
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,700
Baek Hyun has another goal.

1630
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,840
"I'll show you how much I've changed."

1631
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,840
- He's different from back then.
- Yes.

1632
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,910
Since he's different, he might want to show his ex...

1633
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,910
that he has moved on...

1634
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,240
and is dating someone new.

1635
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,580
Is that why he's being caring...

1636
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,650
- to Min Kyung on purpose?
- I guess that's possible.

1637
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,150
- I'm curious about the ex...
- Right.

1638
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:25,090
and what happened in the past.

1639
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,530
- We suppressed our feelings well.
- Yes.

1640
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:37,460
You must be a real T type.

1641
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:40,100
- You alone did not cry.
- Why? Baek Hyun didn't cry?

1642
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,570
Gosh, it felt so sad.

1643
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:44,470
You were the only one.

1644
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,740
We all held back tears well.

1645
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:51,950
The mood is getting heavy. Let's clean up for the second round.

1646
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,680
- All right.
- Shall we clean up for that?

1647
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,420
- I think it's a good idea.
- Let's do so.

1648
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,390
Shall we put the introduction in the room?

1649
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:59,550
Shall we clean this up?

1650
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:00,690
(They begin to realise they're in the same space with their exes.)

1651
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:05,030
(The first night is deepening with complicated feelings.)

1652
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:13,100
(Baek Hyun reads the introduction again.)

1653
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,410
Is this real?

1654
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,410
I know. It feels so sad.

1655
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,080
(Sighing)

1656
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:32,820
(His sigh echoes.)

1657
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,530
(Woo Jin reads his introduction from his ex again.)

1658
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,710
(Glancing)

1659
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,380
This is fun.

1660
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:03,880
(They both put their introductions in the closet.)

1661
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:08,960
(Woo Jin looks like he has a lot on his mind.)

1662
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,690
I thought I'd never shed tears.

1663
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,760
- It felt so sad, didn't it?
- It did.

1664
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:20,200
I thought I'd never cry. I'm amazed.

1665
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:21,740
(Knocking)

1666
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:23,670
- Who is it?
- It's me.

1667
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:24,970
- Hi.
- May I come in?

1668
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:26,510
- Yes, sure.
- Of course.

1669
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:27,640
Come in quickly.

1670
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,610
- I need to organise my clothes.
- I see.

1671
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:32,580
Go ahead. We'll clean up.

1672
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,410
- Can I?
- You can tidy up your suitcase.

1673
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:36,620
- The guys now...
- You can leave it.

1674
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,520
We'll do it quickly and join you.

1675
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,090
Okay. I feel so happy...

1676
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:42,220
that I'd like to see it.

1677
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:45,760
- I'll stay for a minute.
- You can stay with us.

1678
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,460
I wasn't crying,

1679
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:50,960
but when Ji Yeon cried,

1680
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,100
- I began to cry.
- Right.

1681
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,630
- She said it so sadly, - Exactly.

1682
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:58,070
and I could relate to her a lot, so it felt sad.

1683
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:02,280
But I think we can ask them if they...

1684
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,080
have got over their exes or not. I think we can.

1685
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,580
I think we can ask only that.

1686
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:11,450
- I have no lingering attachment.
- I see.

1687
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:14,020
How about you, Yun Nyeong?

1688
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,060
Honestly, before I came here,

1689
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:19,930
I had minus feelings left, even less than zero.

1690
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:22,530
I know what you mean. I was like that too.

1691
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,630
It was even less than zero.

1692
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:28,800
But now that I'm here, it really feels different.

1693
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:31,000
I definitely had no feelings left,

1694
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,840
but reading my introduction from my ex...

1695
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,610
- Exactly.
- Right.

1696
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:37,940
I totally thought I'd never cry. This is crazy.

1697
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,730
(Sighing)

1698
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:06,840
(Ji Hyeon takes out her introduction in the drawer.)

1699
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:17,350
(She reads it alone slowly once again.)

1700
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:19,350
I feel tired.

1701
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:22,790
Hi.

1702
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,430
Here. Hi.

1703
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:29,800
- You should unpack your suitcase.
- Okay. I will.

1704
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,500
I came here late because I've been chatting.

1705
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,330
- It's okay.
- You should stop this.

1706
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,800
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

1707
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,770
- What's that?
- Why is she holding it?

1708
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,840
I came here late because I've been chatting.

1709
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,780
- It's okay.
- You should stop this.

1710
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,580
Let's go.

1711
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,550
- I'll just finish this.
- Okay.

1712
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:56,220
- Oh, my. Please let me do it.
- No, it's okay.

1713
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,530
- Please. I'm begging you.
- I just got this job.

1714
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:00,790
- Oh, my.
- You just got that job?

1715
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,630
Then I'll get the job after 30 seconds.

1716
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,730
What are you saying?

1717
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:11,100
- You want to get a job, don't you?
- I do.

1718
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,070
I managed to get one.

1719
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,580
I'll do this and give it to you. What do you think?

1720
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,650
I get it.

1721
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,280
I had my job taken.

1722
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,460
- Are you doing all right?
- Yes.

1723
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:34,060
But in the initial stage, this was...

1724
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,260
- I didn't work on this yet.
- I see.

1725
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,400
- Wait a second.
- It's heavy.

1726
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,030
- I can put this here.
- It's very heavy.

1727
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,500
You don't do the dishes often, I guess.

1728
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,370
No, it's not like that.

1729
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:49,310
You take my sponge and say I don't do the dishes often.

1730
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,950
- What?
- They're joking comfortably.

1731
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:54,380
They look comfortable. They have good chemistry.

1732
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,580
- They look familiar with the joke.
- Yes.

1733
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:59,320
Joking around like that means they feel comfortable.

1734
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,350
- They feel comfortable.
- I can tell from the tone.

1735
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,330
You should put something on your hands.

1736
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,900
I feel more comfortable with nothing on my hands.

1737
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,370
I guess we cooked too much food.

1738
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:22,710
- People didn't eat a lot.
- It's the first day.

1739
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:28,850
Are these all done?

1740
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,690
Tell me if I'm not doing it all right.

1741
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:38,630
- Okay.
- I can wash it more thoroughly.

1742
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:41,530
What do you mean, you're not doing it all right?

1743
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:44,460
I think I'm not doing the dishes all right.

1744
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:49,100
- I'll do it with you.
- Wait a minute.

1745
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,600
We can do the dishes together, three of us.

1746
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:52,940
That's so inefficient.

1747
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,810
We put too much manpower here.

1748
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:05,620
You're doing it with your bare hands. I'll wash the dishes.

1749
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:07,920
It's not good when the detergent gets on your hands.

1750
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:10,790
No, it's fine.

1751
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:12,760
Please, give it to me.

1752
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:15,160
- Why, all of a sudden?
- What's that?

1753
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,730
- Wait. I guess he's bothered.
- What's that?

1754
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,930
It might be something we didn't expect at all.

1755
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:21,300
Won Kyu and Yoo Sik might be exes.

1756
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,170
I mean it. It could be a plot twist.

1757
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,070
Why does he have to join them like that?

1758
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:26,210
If he's not the ex,

1759
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:27,770
- is that even possible?
- You're right.

1760
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,280
There's no reason he should join like that.

1761
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,440
- That doesn't make sense.
- And he's physically pushing.

1762
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,910
I don't think it's easy to do so if he's not the ex.

1763
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:36,080
Then Yoo Sik and Ji Yeon were a couple?

1764
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,650
We seriously can expect...

1765
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:39,720
that Yoo Sik and Ji Yeon were a couple.

1766
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,960
With Yoo Sik next to her, Ji Yeon is using half-honorifics.

1767
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,420
- To whom?
- To whom?

1768
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,030
- Ji Yeon and Yoo Sik...
- Right.

1769
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:48,430
are talking casually to each other.

1770
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:49,460
To Yoo Sik?

1771
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:52,630
If she feels awkward,

1772
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:54,200
- she'd use honorifics.
- She's overdoing it.

1773
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,770
That's too much.

1774
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:57,540
- Please, give it to me.
- Please.

1775
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,440
She should use honorifics.

1776
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,740
She wouldn't say that casually to someone she met for the first time.

1777
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:02,840
- Don't you think so?
- That's strange.

1778
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:06,180
Ji Yeon looks like she wants to see another guy.

1779
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,650
- Yoo Sik wants to see her again...
- I agree.

1780
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:10,450
- that he's staying close.
- I think you're right.

1781
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:12,920
And that would make her happy. She shouldn't sigh.

1782
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,220
Usually, a woman wouldn't sigh in that situation.

1783
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,690
- Her sigh revealed it.
- If a stranger helps her,

1784
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,290
- that would make her flutter.
- She was caught.

1785
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:18,320
We'd never sigh.

1786
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,030
We'd say, "It's fine."

1787
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:21,660
But she went, "Goodness."

1788
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,370
It feels she's saying, "Come on. You're making it obvious."

1789
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:26,370
She couldn't hide it.

1790
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:28,670
- I guess she couldn't hide it.
- She couldn't hide it. We got her.

1791
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:30,470
- We got her.
- Yes.

1792
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:32,170
Half-honorifics. You detected it nicely.

1793
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,970
They look good together, Yoo Sik and Ji Yeon.

1794
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:38,480
You're doing it with your bare hands. I'll wash the dishes.

1795
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:40,650
It's not good when the detergent gets on your hands.

1796
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,520
No, it's fine.

1797
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,550
Please, give it to me.

1798
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,520
We were all unemployed.

1799
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:50,560
- I didn't do any work today.
- We managed to get a job.

1800
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:54,390
(Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon's room on the 4th floor)

1801
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:56,530
- This is fun, isn't it?
- What?

1802
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:57,900
Don't you think this is kind of fun?

1803
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:02,840
Before we read our introductions, it just felt fun.

1804
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,540
Right. That's why I was surprised.

1805
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:11,680
You kept shedding tears from the beginning.

1806
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:14,150
But as I listened to them reading the introductions,

1807
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,250
since we all met for the first time today,

1808
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:21,490
I thought, "I didn't realise that aspect."

1809
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:24,290
"That's how their relationship was."

1810
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:26,090
I felt that a lot.

1811
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,790
Many people had aspects I didn't expect.

1812
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:30,260
That's right. When I met them in person,

1813
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,200
- they looked very rigid and all.
- Yes.

1814
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,300
But after listening to their introductions...

1815
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,670
- They looked so lovely.
- They looked cute.

1816
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,440
That's why I was surprised.

1817
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,340
After listening to their introductions from their exes,

1818
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,310
- I changed my mind.
- Really?

1819
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:49,820
(Living room on the 3rd floor)

1820
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,420
They all sound sweet,

1821
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,420
the exes who wrote the introductions.

1822
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,860
I actually cried after every introduction.

1823
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:03,300
You might cry again alone.

1824
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,770
When you get up tomorrow morning, your eyes would be so swollen.

1825
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:08,970
- I don't think I'd cry again.
- You might.

1826
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,670
I wonder why I cried earlier.

1827
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:15,940
- However, this is really...
- Every introduction made me cry.

1828
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:18,080
- Yes. That's true.
- They all wrote them so sincerely.

1829
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:24,250
Anyway, here, my ex...

1830
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:28,690
might hang out with another girl, and I can't help watching it.

1831
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,390
What do you think about that?

1832
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:34,790
I came here acknowledging it, though.

1833
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:36,800
- What is it again?
- No!

1834
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,530
What is it?

1835
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:41,830
I think there's nothing left for today.

1836
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:43,270
I came here acknowledging it, though.

1837
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:46,010
(The doorbell rings again.)

1838
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:47,610
- What?
- What is it?

1839
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:51,040
Already?

1840
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,710
What is it?

1841
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:54,110
(Won Kyu moves faster than anyone else.)

1842
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,180
What is it?

1843
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:56,480
Everyone!

1844
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,380
I think you should come down.

1845
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:08,260
(A letter arrived in the mailbox.)

1846
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,800
What?

1847
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:20,840
(Something like this keeps happening to Won Kyu only.)

1848
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:23,610
Has someone come here?

1849
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:29,220
- Did we get something again?
- Yes.

1850
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,550
Really?

1851
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:35,290
Wait a minute. My heart is racing.

1852
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,530
Everyone, the bell rang.

1853
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,830
I haven't unpacked my suitcase yet.

1854
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:45,930
But we got something new here.

1855
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:48,170
- Would you like to eat something?
- What's this?

1856
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:50,070
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you all right?

1857
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,700
- I'll drink something later.
- Okay.

1858
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,140
Now that everyone is here...

1859
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,710
- Shall I read this?
- Yes.

1860
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:07,950
"Female residents,"

1861
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,890
"without getting noticed by anyone,"

1862
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:11,620
"in 30 minutes,"

1863
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:13,760
"ask someone you want to have a date out."

1864
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,200
"Male residents selected by multiple female residents..."

1865
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,870
"should text the name of the person you want to date in ten minutes."

1866
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:25,570
"The matching results will be notified via texts."

1867
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:28,840
- What?
- What?

1868
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:31,080
- Right away?
- That means first impressions.

1869
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,310
From the first day.

1870
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:34,250
For the first time in this show, they're going to select someone...

1871
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,220
they want to ask out openly like this.

1872
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:38,120
Usually, they picked out a card or something, I remember.

1873
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,190
They used to do something like that.

1874
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,720
I think this fits the current atmosphere.

1875
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:44,190
Compared to the past seasons, we need more dopamine...

1876
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:46,790
- You're right.
- surge.

1877
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:49,960
Then we can obviously see whom the women...

1878
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,500
have favourable feelings in the beginning.

1879
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,130
- We can see which guy is popular.
- That's right.

1880
01:42:55,130 --> 01:42:58,700
For now, Baek Hyun and Yoo Sik look popular, I guess.

1881
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:01,310
How can they do it without getting noticed, with everyone together?

1882
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,710
(Screaming)

1883
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,080
What should I do, seriously?

1884
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,320
"Already?" That was what I thought.

1885
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:11,980
It was too...

1886
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,650
difficult. It was so tough. That was what I thought.

1887
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:16,360
However,

1888
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,690
that's what this place is about.

1889
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,530
It made me realise that.

1890
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:26,700
- On the 1st day?
- Right, on the 1st day.

1891
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:29,300
I never imagined this.

1892
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:34,270
My ex has such a nice personality,

1893
01:43:34,970 --> 01:43:39,250
and he's considerate of others.

1894
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,050
I thought everyone would like him,

1895
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:44,120
so that bothered me.

1896
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,020
Then after we listen,

1897
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:50,060
we don't say anything, and text the name.

1898
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,860
You text the name of someone you want to go out with.

1899
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:59,730
I never made a move...

1900
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:01,730
to female residents.

1901
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:04,070
I never initiated a conversation, either.

1902
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:06,810
So,

1903
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:11,040
honestly, I thought, "No one would come to me."

1904
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,110
What should I do?

1905
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:16,650
I want to read it.

1906
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,820
- Okay.
- I need to read this.

1907
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,760
Without getting noticed by anyone.

1908
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:26,460
You need to ask someone out without getting noticed?

1909
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,630
- Right.
- Yes.

1910
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:29,060
I read it myself, but I didn't know that.

1911
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:33,430
How can I do that without getting noticed?

1912
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,700
In secret, then...

1913
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,770
- Then...
- Everyone should stay apart.

1914
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,000
You can go to your room...

1915
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,910
- and stay there.
- That sounds good.

1916
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,710
Each of us should be in a different place, alone?

1917
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:44,810
In different places, then.

1918
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:46,780
If you guys leave first,

1919
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,710
we'll go find you.

1920
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,820
May I stay in the room?

1921
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:52,550
- I need to tidy up the room.
- Sure. I'll be somewhere else.

1922
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,820
I'll clean up the room.

1923
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:54,890
I'll be somewhere else.

1924
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,190
You can use the female residents' rooms.

1925
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:01,230
(Baek Hyun leaves first.)

1926
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,360
I'll be like, "When is someone coming for me?"

1927
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,200
(Sighing)

1928
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,840
- Shall I go first?
- All right.

1929
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,470
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

1930
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,780
- I'll go next.
- All right.

1931
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,040
This is fun.

1932
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:19,380
- I'll be on the second floor.
- I'll go outside.

1933
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,410
Okay.

1934
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,480
(They try to stay apart as much as they can.)

1935
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:23,950
How about telling them to stay on the second floor?

1936
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:26,120
I think two of them went downstairs.

1937
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:28,320
- I didn't see it on purpose.
- Didn't someone go outside?

1938
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,160
I didn't see it either. I couldn't see anything.

1939
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:36,000
- I'll clean up the room.
- Okay.

1940
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,230
(Baek Hyun took the room on the 4th floor first.)

1941
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:39,570
- I'll close the door for you.
- Thank you.

1942
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:51,840
(Yoo Sik chooses to be in the terrace on the 4th floor.)

1943
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:03,160
(Which one do you think your ex would be interested in?)

1944
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:05,360
I think she chose Baek Hyun.

1945
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:10,730
He fits her ideal type the most.

1946
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:12,900
Baek Hyun, I guess.

1947
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,400
I think she likes someone who looks sincere and reliable.

1948
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,340
So I think my ex would be curious about him.

1949
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:25,640
(Won Kyu is outside, in the yard.)

1950
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:30,980
(Woo Jin is in the small living room on the 2nd floor.)

1951
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,650
Their heart would flutter while they're waiting.

1952
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,690
They will be sad if no one comes.

1953
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,160
I'll see you.

1954
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,460
Okay. See you.

1955
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:43,600
(Min Kyung goes first.)

1956
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:52,570
(Which one do you think your ex would be interested in?)

1957
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:54,410
Min Kyung...

1958
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:56,810
is the closest...

1959
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:00,680
to my ex's ideal type, in appearance.

1960
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,210
Min Kyung.

1961
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:05,380
I guess my ex...

1962
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:09,260
would like her since she's attractive...

1963
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:12,560
being petite, cute, and having a lively personality.

1964
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:15,690
Shall we turn our backs?

1965
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,160
(They can't see it as they're bothered.)

1966
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,130
- Then we don't know where she went.
- That's good.

1967
01:47:20,230 --> 01:47:21,800
Like this, three of us.

1968
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,270
Seriously.

1969
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,290
Is she going outside?

1970
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:41,550
- Won Kyu.
- Won Kyu.

1971
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:42,590
Yes, in the yard.

1972
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:59,070
(Min Kyung didn't go outside.)

1973
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:01,040
I'm sure he heard the sound of the door.

1974
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,710
Oh, my goodness!

1975
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,340
He'd hear it, definitely.

1976
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:05,740
She checked him out and closed the door.

1977
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,410
That's so cruel.

1978
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:09,480
Jung Won Kyu in the yard was...

1979
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,380
- not the one, so she closed it.
- Oh, my gosh!

1980
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:13,920
- In the yard, of all places.
- Yes, he was even in the yard.

1981
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,950
Jung Won Kyu.

1982
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:17,390
- Jung Won Kyu was in the yard.
- Jung Won Kyu.

1983
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,660
He could hear that sound.

1984
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,830
She could have said where she went, at least.

1985
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:23,030
Min Kyung made up her mind about someone she wants...

1986
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,130
and she's looking for him now.

1987
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,200
(Going to the 4th floor)

1988
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:36,210
(Yoo Sik...)

1989
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:39,610
(and Baek Hyun are on the 4th floor.)

1990
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,320
Would you like to go out with me?

1991
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,830
- What?
- Oh, my.

1992
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:56,030
Oh, my.

1993
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,860
"Would you like to go out with me?"

1994
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:00,970
- That's crazy.
- She's really awesome.

1995
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:03,070
- Yes.
- Rather than "I wonder if..."

1996
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:05,000
- Would you like to go out with me?
- It feels like a strike.

1997
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,070
It feels so refreshing.

1998
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:09,840
Seeing her saying, "Would you like to go out with me?" makes...

1999
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,940
- That was...
- my heart flutter so much.

2000
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,850
My hands are sweating as I'm watching it now...

2001
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:16,320
since I haven't experienced it so far.

2002
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,420
It feels like a movie.

2003
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,190
Even if he wasn't interested in her at all before,

2004
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,320
- He can get interested.
- when she approaches so boldly,

2005
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,790
he can become interested.

2006
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:24,720
That can spark his curiosity.

2007
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,430
Surprisingly, men like moments like that.

2008
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:28,790
- It's sort of...
- Yes.

2009
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:30,360
This is giving me a dopamine rush.

2010
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,630
Min Kyung, surprisingly, expresses...

2011
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:34,670
- her feelings straightforward.
- I know.

2012
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:37,500
Making female residents choose the date on the first day...

2013
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,840
was truly a brilliant idea.

2014
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,110
- That's right.
- Yes.

2015
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,440
But if another female resident...

2016
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:45,010
chooses Baek Hyun...

2017
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:46,450
Right. Then Min Kyung needs to be selected by him.

2018
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:48,180
Min Kyung needs to be chosen.

2019
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:50,450
Right. Then Baek Hyun has the choice again.

2020
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:51,980
I like that. This is fun.

2021
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,660
Would you like to go out with me?

2022
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,690
- What?
- I want you to go out with me.

2023
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:03,760
Now...

2024
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,260
I asked you out.

2025
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:07,270
She caught me off guard.

2026
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:11,000
I was flustered...

2027
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,170
that I stammered,

2028
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:14,910
and Min Kyung said,

2029
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:18,740
"Anyway, I asked you out."

2030
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:21,050
She was so daring.

2031
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:24,080
I was curious...

2032
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,190
that what about me made her...

2033
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:28,720
to ask me out.

2034
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,690
He was the most silent one.

2035
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:35,060
He was quiet and stayed still.

2036
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,630
But in his introduction from his ex,

2037
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:40,700
he was described as a sweet and caring person.

2038
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,330
That made me feel...

2039
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:44,670
that he's sort of similar...

2040
01:50:44,670 --> 01:50:47,210
to my ex.

2041
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:49,680
Baek Hyun was the one I was curious about.

2042
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:52,910
I asked you out.

2043
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:56,750
- I see.
- Bye.

2044
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,890
But he responded...

2045
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:03,920
in a shy manner.

2046
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:05,920
So I thought he could have reacted so...

2047
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:09,430
because he didn't like me.

2048
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:10,660
I thought, "I'm in big trouble."

2049
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,730
I thought I was in big trouble,

2050
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:17,070
and kept worrying about it.

2051
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:20,140
I thought I might not have a date.

2052
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,280
- I'm done.
- Are you done?

2053
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,340
- Yes.
- Okay.

2054
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:25,940
- I'm going.
- See you.

2055
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:28,380
(Sighing)

2056
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:37,160
(EXchange 4)

2057
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,930
Let's say someone likes your ex,

2058
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:41,390
- and they actually date.
- Yes.

2059
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:43,060
Do you think you can support that?

2060
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,100
If my ex likes him.

2061
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:48,000
I admire your mindset.

2062
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:51,140
If he's someone good for her, I can support that.

2063
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:52,540
But what if he's not?

2064
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:53,970
That's just her luck, I'll say.

2065
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:55,440
You're awesome.

2066
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,110
I need to go my own way.

2067
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:58,640
What's going on here?

2068
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,950
I really felt upset.

2069
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:02,450
This is annoying.

2070
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:06,990
(Confusing feelings fill the night.)

2071
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:09,120
I have a feeling that I'd feel tormented.

2072
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:12,020
I wish it wouldn't get stormy.

2073
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:17,960
(Female residents chat online with their dates' exes.)

2074
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:20,000
(When is Yoo Sik the happiest, other than when he's working?)

2075
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,200
(I don't know.)

2076
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:23,800
Does she not want to give me the answer?

2077
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:26,670
She sounded like she had lingering feelings.

2078
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:29,680
It felt that she was stiff and overly polite.

2079
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:31,880
(Subtle psychological warfare by women)

2080
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,150
(I guess you were in a relationship for a long time.)

2081
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:35,480
(Is she very fond of him?)

2082
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:37,150
(Is she interested in him a lot?)
