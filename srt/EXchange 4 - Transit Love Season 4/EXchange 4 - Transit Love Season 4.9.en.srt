1
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,849
I'll introduce today's guest of EXchange 4,

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,179
the hottest show right now.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,049
It's rapper pH-1.

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,090
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,189
I heard you're a big fan.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,389
I'm a devoted fan.

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,929
Since the last season, I've been contacting Simon Dominic.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,429
"I really want to join the show."

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,599
- I kept begging him.
- He keeps asking me...

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,769
about the results.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,839
- "What happened?" - I asked him.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,369
- He kept asking.
- He never told me.

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,939
I was invited this time,

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,410
so I came with so much excitement.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,779
(As the sun set,)

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,320
(the Talking Room ended.)

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,289
- Hello.
- You're back.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,490
Hello.

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,190
You're back.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,190
Is it time to eat?

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,760
What did you all eat?

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,060
- We had ramyeon.
- Ramyeon?

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,159
That's why I'm smelling this.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,269
There's some spicy ramyeon sauce on you.

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,170
I think we have almost used it up.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,770
What are you going to eat?

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,110
Curry.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
What happened here?

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,179
Did I get hurt again?

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
It's red.

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,980
- Right.
- Right?

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,790
- Did I get scratched?
- Why do you keep getting hurt?

34
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,789
I know, right? I guess I was scratched.

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,790
What's wrong with you?

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,129
- What's the matter with you?
- Why do you have so many scars?

37
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,399
What's wrong with this person?

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
What happened to your face?

39
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,600
- I know, right?
- I don't know. I was scratched.

40
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,670
- When Yoo Sik was sleeping...
- I guess that must be it.

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,069
Maybe you were scratched because he was annoyed.

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,110
I guess so.

43
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,339
- I like their atmosphere.
- Me too.

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,839
- They know what they did.
- Yes.

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,950
- But they're hiding it.
- This is really interesting.

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,019
- You can't stay sober there.
- Right.

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,719
- You have to drink.
- Yes.

48
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,519
- His face is smiling.
- Right.

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,090
- But he's crying inside.
- That's right.

50
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,160
(Yoo Sik came to the living room.)

51
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,990
(Looking around)

52
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,800
(He writes a reply to Ji Hyeon's note.)

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,979
- What were you doing?
- I was just here. Why?

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,379
- Just because.
- Do you have something to say?

55
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,949
- Are you going to scold me?
- Yes.

56
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,950
Why?

57
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,080
It's about time we set the hierarchy right.

58
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,990
It's about time it's revealed.

59
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,220
Don't do that.

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,060
- This is what I think.
- Yes.

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,760
I think our ages might be similar.

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,999
Or maybe not.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
(Anyway, he wasn't caught writing the note.)

64
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,600
I might be the only one who thinks like that.

65
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,770
You should work harder.

66
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,970
(Yoo Sik comes to the kitchen with the note.)

67
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,080
I want to drink beer today.

68
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,440
Only beer?

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,149
- What?
- Only beer?

70
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,249
Is it because the weather is warm?

71
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,079
Yes. Beer because it's warm.

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
I should drink beer with ice later.

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,219
- What is it?
- You'll drink it when it's frozen?

74
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,789
- When it's frozen?
- Beer with ice.

75
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,959
Beer with ice.

76
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,229
(He put the note on the table without anyone noticing.)

77
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,030
- I've never tried it like that.
- It's good.

78
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,060
Old men drink it like that a lot.

79
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,900
Are you an old man?

80
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,399
(Glancing)

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,530
In summer,

82
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,440
on my way home, I dropped by the convenience store,

83
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,309
I saw two men drinking beer in a cup with ice.

84
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,240
They were drinking that.

85
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,409
I was so curious, so I asked, "Does it taste good like that?"

86
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,450
Then they said,

87
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,810
"It's good."

88
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,620
Kian84 drinks like that.

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
- Really?
- Yes.

90
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,390
It's good.

91
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,220
It's really cold.

92
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,190
Even with my friends...

93
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,659
What? What is it?

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,959
(She bursts into laughter in the end.)

95
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Hold on.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,360
(He's flustered.)

97
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,130
Am I like Kian84?

98
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,699
Ji Hyeon really can't hide it.

99
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
Why?

100
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,969
She can't hide it.

101
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,409
I guess she's really happy.

102
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,410
That must be heart-fluttering.

103
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,239
- I think it's a fluttering moment.
- Right?

104
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,709
- It makes your heart flutter.
- It's like secretly...

105
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,649
- Secretly giving notes.
- passing notes in class.

106
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,519
It's not a letter or a card. It's a note.

107
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
- It's a note.
- Right.

108
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,849
- There's a mood...
- Right.

109
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,190
- that analog things give.
- Analog is the best.

110
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,589
How did he think of giving it to her...

111
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,889
- like that?
- I know, right?

112
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,589
He left it there after considering the angle.

113
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,190
- He hid it.
- That was very smart.

114
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,690
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,800
There are times I randomly burst into laughter.

116
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,330
(He's still flustered.)

117
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm fine now.

118
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,169
But why did you laugh?

119
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,630
I laughed because it was funny.

120
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,769
- You mean my face?
- I laugh on my own a lot.

121
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,799
Was my face funny?

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,769
No. I was eating...

123
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,270
That face can't be funny.

124
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,810
It's not at all funny.

125
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,550
(She overcame a huge crisis.)

126
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,020
This is crazy.

127
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Look at this. I told you. See?

128
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,590
See? I said there's something.

129
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,390
I'm hearing that for the first time.

130
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,169
(The sound of the bell...)

131
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,700
(that breaks the peace they finally found)

132
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,570
(A letter arrived early in the morning.)

133
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,449
- What is this?
- Why did it come at this hour?

134
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,209
(Everyone is murmuring because of the news...)

135
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,020
(that came at an unexpected hour.)

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,750
This is going to be fun.

137
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,790
At this hour? It's bright today.

138
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,230
(Everyone gathers in the living room at the sound of the doorbell.)

139
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,390
- Shall we take a look?
- Yes.

140
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,230
- It's going to be opened.
- Okay.

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,400
"Tomorrow, you'll be going on keyword dates."

142
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,569
"The keywords of the female residents were decided..."

143
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,110
"through the Talking Room."

144
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,569
"Think back to the conversation you had in the Talking Room,"

145
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,279
"choose one of the five keywords,"

146
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
"and text it to us."

147
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,549
(Keywords: I like drinking, Someone I could learn from,)

148
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,919
(Insincere love, I like red wine, My drinking habit is falling asleep)

149
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,249
(You cannot discuss the keywords with others.)

150
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,589
(You may have overlapping dates.)

151
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,990
(You cannot choose your ex.)

152
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,559
These are the keywords picked from the conversations...

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
- they had, right?
- Yes.

154
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,659
It all depends on how attentively...

155
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,829
- and carefully they listened.
- Right.

156
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,869
So those who know whose keyword it is...

157
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,539
- would choose that.
- Right.

158
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,909
But Baek Hyun didn't enter...

159
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,339
- Yun Nyeong's Talking Room.
- He didn't go there.

160
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,510
(Baek Hyun didn't enter Yun Nyeong's Talking Room.)

161
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,410
- What does that mean?
- There are keywords here.

162
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,149
- You can take a look.
- "I like drinking."

163
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,280
"I like drinking," "Someone I could learn from,"

164
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,790
"Insincere love," "I like red wine,"

165
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,460
- There are all sorts of things.
- "My habit is falling asleep?"

166
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,759
(Several hours ago,)

167
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,660
(the Group Talking Room opened.)

168
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,670
I like drinking.

169
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,740
I think it would be difficult if the person doesn't drink at all.

170
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
(Based on the conversations they had there,)

171
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,380
(5 keywords were selected.)

172
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,549
We have to decide...

173
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,149
- The men?
- and send the text.

174
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,790
I think it's the men sending the texts.

175
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,359
(They have to think back to the conversations they had...)

176
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,860
(in the Talking Room and choose a keyword.)

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,030
(In the Group Talking Room,)

178
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,729
(Jae Hyeong chose Ji Hyeon and Yun Nyeong.)

179
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,969
I wanted to go on a date with Ji Hyeon.

180
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,800
I thought about what Ji Hyeon said.

181
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,010
(Jae Hyeong chose a keyword.)

182
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,609
Do we have to send it now?

183
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,449
(Won Kyu entered Yun Nyeong and Ji Hyeon's Talking Room.)

184
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,319
What grabbed my attention first...

185
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,220
was "Insincere love."

186
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,290
I thought a lot about it.

187
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,020
(Won Kyu sent a keyword.)

188
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,089
"My drinking habit is falling asleep."

189
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,090
(Ji Yeon's keyword: My drinking habit is falling asleep)

190
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:46,299
People who know me a little or are interested in me...

191
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,069
would have noticed that it was me right away.

192
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,539
(Who did you want to pick your keyword?)

193
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,000
Won Kyu. Just him.

194
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,880
This is crazy.

195
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,419
(Baek Hyun entered Hyeon Ji and Ji Yeon's Talking Room.)

196
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,479
That was that. I had to go on a date with Yun Nyeong.

197
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,520
(Baek Hyun wants to go on a date with Yun Nyeong.)

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,220
I knew Yun Nyeong liked red wine.

199
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,230
But I didn't enter the Talking Room,

200
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,729
so I thought about it seriously.

201
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,600
(He's struggling to figure out what Yun Nyeong's keyword would be.)

202
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,000
(Baek Hyun chose a keyword.)

203
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,879
(Yoo Sik entered Hyeon Ji and Ji Hyeon's Talking Room.)

204
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,380
(Whose keyword did you want to pick out of the two?)

205
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,780
There wasn't anyone who took up a bigger place in my heart.

206
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,620
(Yoo Sik chose a keyword.)

207
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,620
(Woo Jin sent a keyword.)

208
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,590
(Everyone's keyword was sent.)

209
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,360
Why is it so quiet?

210
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,970
(Kim Woo Jin and Kwak Min Kyung's keyword date has been set.)

211
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,579
I thought I wanted to go on a date with Min Kyung...

212
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,980
after the Talking Room ended.

213
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,020
(Woo Jin chose Min Kyung.)

214
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,989
Is it dirty?

215
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,750
(Cho Yoo Sik and Park Hyeon Ji's keyword date has been set.)

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
I chose "I like red wine."

217
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,860
She's been on my mind,

218
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,960
and I thought I wanted to get to know her.

219
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
(Yoo Sik chose Hyeon Ji's keyword, "I like red wine.")

220
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,269
Hyeon Ji? Really?

221
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,769
I thought he'd choose Ji Yeon.

222
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,570
- Me too.
- He's proactive now.

223
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,909
(Lee Jae Hyeong and Park Ji Heyon's keyword date has been set.)

224
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,680
I was so excited and full of anticipation.

225
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,980
I wanted to get to know what kind of person Ji Hyeon was...

226
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,819
and let her know what kind of person I was.

227
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,260
I thought that was important.

228
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,030
(Jung Won Kyu and Choi Yun Nyeong's keyword date has been set.)

229
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,369
(Won Kyu chose Yun Nyeong...)

230
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,670
(instead of Ji Yeon.)

231
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,540
Ji Yeon told me...

232
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,210
to tell her what I felt...

233
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,279
after getting to know other people as well.

234
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,850
I was also curious about Yun Nyeong.

235
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,620
(Ji Yeon's hopes didn't come true.)

236
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,890
(One person struggled the most here.)

237
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,300
(Sung Baek Hyun and Hong Ji Yeon's keyword date was set.)

238
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,010
I chose, "My drinking habit is falling asleep."

239
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,309
I thought that was Yun Nyeong,

240
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,310
but it was Hong Ji Yeon.

241
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,440
Her drinking habit is falling asleep.

242
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,750
I thought I heard that in passing.

243
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,619
Falling asleep when I drink a lot is my drinking habit.

244
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,450
(He did hear that in passing.)

245
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,959
Actually, I thought I'd figure it out...

246
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,820
even if I didn't go to the Talking Room.

247
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,490
That was arrogance.

248
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,729
(To some, it was coincidental,)

249
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,530
(and to some, it was what they wanted.)

250
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,800
(The keyword date selection ended.)

251
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,209
Baek Hyun said he could figure out Yun Nyeong's keyword...

252
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,879
without entering the Talking Room, but he failed to guess it.

253
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,509
Wouldn't Yun Nyeong feel bad when she gets to know about it?

254
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,749
- He'd have to make excuses later.
- Right.

255
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,719
Won Kyu chose Yun Nyeong.

256
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,449
I think they look really good together.

257
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,149
He's really calm with Ji Yeon,

258
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,119
but Yun Nyeong responds well,

259
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,019
- She's bright and energetic.
- and she's cheerful.

260
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,689
- I want to see that as well.
- Right.

261
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,129
I think this date is going to be very important.

262
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,160
- It is important.
- It is important.

263
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,340
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

264
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,980
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

265
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,920
(Hong Ji Yeon and Kim Woo Jin)

266
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,720
(Park Ji Hyeon and Jung Won Kyu)

267
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,619
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

268
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,320
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

269
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,600
(EXchange 4)

270
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,440
(Episode 9: Easy to Misunderstand, but Hard to Understand)

271
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

272
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,679
Right. You can see everything now.

273
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,320
In that case, I've been thinking...

274
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,020
Ji Yeon...

275
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,320
and Won Kyu...

276
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,259
I couldn't tell...

277
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,660
(She hears her ex's name as soon as she enters the room.)

278
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,329
if they like each other...

279
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,500
or if they're exes.

280
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,870
Their ideal types were so similar.

281
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,969
There's only one person who is fair-skinned...

282
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,110
and has a tall nose.

283
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,909
Won Kyu said his ideal type is someone with a tall nose?

284
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,909
Someone with a tall nose and fair skin.

285
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,050
Really?

286
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,820
There's only one person who fits the description.

287
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,579
- I know. That's what I thought.
- I guess he has lingering feelings.

288
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,450
I'm not sure if it's his ex or someone he's interested in.

289
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,620
- So I've been thinking.
- I guess he has lingering feelings.

290
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,359
But people wouldn't describe their exes as their ideal type.

291
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,859
They could make it obvious too.

292
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,170
That's possible if they have feelings for their exes.

293
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you want to get back with your ex, Min Kyung?

294
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,270
I don't know.

295
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Do you want to go on a date with your ex?

296
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,710
I have many things to talk about with him.

297
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,780
Why? Didn't you say everything when you broke up?

298
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,050
Well...

299
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,120
I didn't.

300
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,590
Me neither.

301
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,930
No couple can break up after talking about everything.

302
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,330
I loved him with all my heart,

303
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,299
so I think he regrets it.

304
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,340
(I think my ex regrets it.)

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,540
How could he lose me?

306
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,509
That's what I thought too.

307
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,440
But he's been doing so well here.

308
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,179
- Has he?
- Yes.

309
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,810
He's been hanging out well with someone who suits him.

310
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,980
I don't see anyone who's getting along so well.

311
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,690
But this isn't anyone's fault.

312
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,560
We came here to do that.

313
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,260
To move on.

314
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,600
I came prepared to lose and to gain.

315
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,200
When I was dating my ex,

316
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,600
I thought, "I'm the best..."

317
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,039
- The best...
- "person for him."

318
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,210
But after coming here...

319
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,679
You don't think the same?

320
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,720
I could see that such a kind of person...

321
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,420
suited my ex more.

322
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,749
Really?

323
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,990
I thought I was the best person for him.

324
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,620
But I could see that wasn't the case.

325
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,260
That made me feel horrible.

326
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,300
But if he says he likes her,

327
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,729
You can let him go.

328
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,330
I think it's right to let him go.

329
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,970
Because I've already...

330
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,740
lost that person once before.

331
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,070
It's okay.

332
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,340
We've already broken up.

333
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,880
What more can I lose when we've broken up?

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,120
Perhaps I'm understanding what "breaking up" means wrongly.

335
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,019
It's not wrong. It's different.

336
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,719
People interpret it differently.

337
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,089
Min Kyung hasn't broken up yet.

338
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,859
- She hasn't.
- She hasn't. It was nine years.

339
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,729
Nine years is really powerful.

340
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,759
It's too powerful.

341
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,999
I think she's in the middle of breaking up.

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,199
- They've not broken up completely.
- Right.

343
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,069
It would feel like that more when they're in that space.

344
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,669
- Right. You keep seeing them.
- You keep seeing the person.

345
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,169
Right. That's how the system is...

346
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,499
- in EXchange.
- Yes.

347
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,009
It would be harder if the person is right in front of you.

348
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,010
That's why it's annoying.

349
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:43,039
Even if they parted really badly,

350
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,239
- they'd develop feelings...
- Right.

351
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,439
if they go there.

352
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,839
- This...
- You'd have feelings.

353
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,979
The past tense...

354
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,109
- turns into present progressive...
- Right.

355
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,679
- Right.
- when they come here.

356
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,649
Ji Hyeon said this earlier.

357
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,489
"We came here to do that."

358
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,119
She said that she came prepared to lose and to gain.

359
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,019
- That's really cool.
- Yes, that's what she said.

360
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,829
- She's right.
- If she thought about gaining,

361
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,389
she had to think about losing too.

362
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,530
- That's what this show is about.
- Right.

363
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,600
Are you going to drink today?

364
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,900
I don't know. I should read the room.

365
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,299
Even if we gather,

366
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,770
- there will be only silence.
- I know.

367
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,080
It always happens when we get a direction.

368
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,550
To be honest,

369
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,249
I want to knock on the door and ask every girl in turn...

370
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,250
for a conversation.

371
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,120
But I think that's not possible in this mood at all.

372
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Where are you going?

373
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,360
What are you doing here?

374
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,989
We're just having a date.

375
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,560
What? Just the two of you, spending quality time?

376
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,000
Can we join?

377
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,299
- Are you getting used to it here?
- No.

378
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,529
- Not yet.
- He couldn't.

379
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,569
- Why?
- After he came, yesterday,

380
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,599
the atmosphere wasn't very good.

381
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,640
- Right.
- That's right.

382
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,739
It seems the vibe is going downhill.

383
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
Do you think so?

384
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:53,479
- Let's make it...
- But people here...

385
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,580
are not that energetic.

386
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,119
I think you'll get used to it soon.

387
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,990
Is there anyone you want to go on a date with?

388
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,490
- I'm not sure yet.
- Really?

389
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,259
No wonder. You came here yesterday.

390
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,920
Do you have anyone in mind?

391
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,160
I...

392
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,299
For now, I plan to get to know people here.

393
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,269
I guess you have someone you want to get to know.

394
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,500
(He feels uncomfortable sitting between Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon.)

395
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,739
That was good, Ji Yeon.

396
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,239
He chose someone else. Goodness.

397
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,509
He's even sitting between them.

398
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,539
Oh, gosh.

399
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,909
He's having a date tomorrow.

400
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,709
- The girls don't know.
- They don't.

401
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,779
- They don't know...
- They don't.

402
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
- who chose whom yet.
- They don't know yet.

403
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,950
The texts are revealed only to the men.

404
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,660
- Did you take some rest?
- I stayed alone upstairs.

405
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,460
What do you want to do on a date, everyone?

406
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,200
- I want to do tufting.
- Tufting, I see.

407
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,840
At that time, I already knew I'd go on a date with Ji Yeon.

408
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,740
I thought, "What should I do?"

409
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,780
"Do I have to apologize now?"

410
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,450
But I couldn't say whom I was going on a date with.

411
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,020
I felt so sorry.

412
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,559
We're going out at this hour. Is it okay if we don't come back?

413
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,520
(A car leaves the House in the late evening.)

414
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,630
Have you been busy today?

415
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,660
Today? Not that much.

416
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,730
- Can I speak casually to you?
- You can speak casually to me.

417
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,210
Then how can I call you?

418
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
How can you call me? Just my name?

419
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,150
I like it when a girl calls me by my name.

420
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,250
Really?

421
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,580
But you can do as you like.

422
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,520
How did you think about writing a note?

423
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,320
- Me?
- Yes. I love those things.

424
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,489
It's been several years since I wrote something by hand.

425
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,490
Is that true?

426
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,390
That makes me feel good.

427
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,300
Am I coming on too strong?

428
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,569
What? To whom? To me?

429
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,570
Yes.

430
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,070
So what? It's a good thing, isn't it?

431
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,910
- Do you like it?
- It's good to show your feelings.

432
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,750
I think so.

433
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,350
Do you?

434
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,090
That's the place, I guess.

435
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,120
I didn't know I was hungry, but now I feel hungry.

436
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,030
(Moss Garden)

437
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,840
You said that you get cold easily, right?

438
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,440
I definitely get cold easily.

439
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,069
Do you have to wear a puffer jacket, no matter what?

440
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,610
In winter, I just give up looking stylish.

441
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,010
I don't care about the style.

442
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,550
As for me, in summer, I don't care about the style at all.

443
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,280
In summer, I just give up being myself.

444
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,889
Sweating during practice...

445
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,019
- is absolutely fine.
- But the weather...

446
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,690
But I hate sweating when I'm not moving.

447
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,660
Then what do you do in summer?

448
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,130
- Don't you play in the water?
- Play in the water?

449
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,100
Not very often, but I do when there's an occasion.

450
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,770
- Really?
- During summer.

451
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,970
It looks really good.

452
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,280
It looks so good.

453
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,750
Do you like it?

454
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,350
This is amazing.

455
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,660
- Shall we make a toast?
- Yes.

456
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,730
There's an apple slice here.

457
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,160
Would you like to have an apple?

458
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,430
- That's funny.
- Why?

459
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,170
You said, "Would you like to have an apple?"

460
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,700
Why do you laugh so much?

461
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,270
When you laughed earlier, it surprised me.

462
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,109
- When you gave me the note?
- Yes.

463
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,470
I was born with a smile.

464
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,610
I gave it in secret, and then all of a sudden...

465
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,509
I laughed out loud.

466
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,349
- I thought you didn't see it.
- I did.

467
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,480
You were laughing, all of a sudden.

468
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,790
I wondered, "What is it? Is this supposed to be funny?"

469
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,890
You're so cute.

470
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,130
This is crazy.

471
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,660
Look at her. She keeps smiling.

472
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,659
- What makes it so funny?
- I know.

473
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,469
- She's never been like that.
- She's smiling so much.

474
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,930
Her complexion has changed.

475
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,469
Ji Yeon was sitting next to me, and she kept looking at you.

476
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,310
So I wished she'd look somewhere else.

477
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,180
Do you like water spinach?

478
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,980
I like it. You don't?

479
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,950
I love it.

480
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,260
Did you and your ex have similar tastes in food?

481
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,430
For some food, our preferences matched well.

482
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,560
But if she didn't like the food I liked,

483
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,869
- You didn't eat it?
- I never went to eat it.

484
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,130
My ex ate it, though.

485
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,639
You seem to be much sweeter than I thought.

486
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
- Me?
- Yes.

487
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,380
I was so sure that you were an actor.

488
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,180
I thought I was 100 percent right.

489
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,090
I never heard anyone saying I looked like a dancer.

490
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,660
I was really awkward on the first day.

491
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,560
It's nice to be awkward.

492
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,660
I like a dork.

493
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,800
I can wear a cap backward or sideways.

494
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,700
I won't take a shower and look dirty.

495
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,670
I didn't say I like someone dirty.

496
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,150
He led the conversation very smoothly,

497
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,880
and he was witty. That made my heart flutter.

498
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,719
- I'll make kale juice tomorrow.
- In the morning?

499
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,760
- Yes.
- Why?

500
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,530
Gosh, really. Stop using honorifics.

501
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,690
I'm sticking with it.

502
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,230
Do we have kale left, by the way?

503
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,029
I left some in the refrigerator.

504
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,900
I guess no one touched it. Right?

505
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,909
What if Won Kyu suddenly eats it thinking it's for wrap?

506
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,310
He might think it's a wrap to go with stir-fried spicy pork.

507
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,580
I need to send him to the supermarket in the early morning...

508
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,780
saying, "Won Kyu, you need to go and buy it again."

509
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,980
- Are you done?
- I'm done.

510
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,990
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

511
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,159
Ji Hyeon seems to be an open book.

512
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,890
Right. Her eyes were full of affection.

513
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,729
Yoo Sik certainly looked comfortable too.

514
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,029
He looks very comfortable when he's with Ji Hyeon.

515
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,629
I guess Yoo Sik needs a partner with a bright personality.

516
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,699
Exactly. He's showing smiles...

517
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
- he hasn't shown before.
- Right.

518
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,710
(Everyone gathered at the Pyeongchang-dong House.)

519
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,480
Have a seat.

520
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Shall we?

521
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,450
Are you going all out tonight, Yoo Sik?

522
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,950
- Me?
- Yes.

523
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,450
I'm going all out, without limits tonight.

524
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,490
Oh, my.

525
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,699
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

526
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,130
(Let them know via text.)

527
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,869
(Day 6 since moving in)

528
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,340
(The one who made my heart flutter the most today)

529
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,309
(Now, some of them feel free of worries,)

530
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,510
(while others are more deeply worried.)

531
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,250
(Everyone's feelings are expressed.)

532
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I caught it.

533
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,620
It's a mosquito, right?

534
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,190
- What's this?
- It was here.

535
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,630
- You can check it out.
- It's a thread.

536
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,630
- It's a thread?
- Yes.

537
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,870
Who caught it?

538
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,970
(It's nice to see you eating well.)

539
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,810
(Won Kyu)

540
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,480
(Our plates are so cute.)

541
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,820
(They made plates together two days ago.)

542
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,060
- I like working with my hands.
- You do.

543
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,590
(The plates they made together arrived today.)

544
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,760
(They're on the same wavelength again today.)

545
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,670
(Ji Yeon)

546
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,710
(You look tired. Make sure you get enough sleep.)

547
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,540
(Your ex picked you.)

548
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,809
Someone told me it was nice to see me eating well.

549
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,080
Someone else told me I looked tired.

550
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,180
So I felt very strange...

551
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,050
rather than feeling very sad like I did yesterday.

552
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,929
- Woo Jin.
- Goodness, Woo Jin.

553
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,260
- No.
- He talked to her before that.

554
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,559
Woo Jin, that...

555
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,359
- won't work.
- However firmly she speaks...

556
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,529
This is what I'm curious about.

557
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,600
Do you think Ji Yeon might have second thoughts?

558
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,799
- Not yet.
- Now she only thinks about Won Kyu.

559
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,539
He's only a wound to her.

560
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,670
I see.

561
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,209
But it will be hard for Woo Jin to control his feelings.

562
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,810
Woo Jin is totally lost now.

563
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,019
(Woo Jin)

564
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,260
(Your ex did not pick you.)

565
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,759
I didn't feel good about it,

566
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,530
but I'm trying to stay calm.

567
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,169
What are we going to do now?

568
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,210
(Won Kyu)

569
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,710
(Won Kyu received one more text.)

570
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,880
(The stir-fried spicy beef was good!)

571
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,520
(Your ex did not pick you.)

572
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,890
(Won Kyu cooked stir-fried spicy beef he had made yesterday.)

573
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,590
- Won Kyu, you're the best!
- It looks so good.

574
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,629
(Those who loved the dish are Yun Nyeong...)

575
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,070
(and Min Kyung.)

576
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,770
I think it could be Yun Nyeong.

577
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,140
I sent, "The stir-fried spicy beef was good!" to Won Kyu.

578
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,879
So far, I've sent texts to someone...

579
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,309
I had a pleasant date with,

580
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,520
but it wasn't a day that I had a date.

581
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,550
I focused on something I liked...

582
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,349
and sent a text to Won Kyu.

583
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,720
He wouldn't have expected it at all.

584
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,700
(Your ex did not pick you.)

585
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,770
Does anyone want to drink tonight? Won Kyu?

586
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,210
Do you want to drink again?

587
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,240
I haven't had a drink so far.

588
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,810
I'm going to drink.

589
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,280
(Surprised)

590
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,890
(Ji Hyeon)

591
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,290
(I want to get closer to you!)

592
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,729
Other people wouldn't tell her that they wanted to get closer.

593
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,500
It's already been five days, about a week.

594
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,539
If Ji Hyeon received several texts,

595
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,200
she should think I sent one. So I wrote that I wanted to get closer.

596
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,310
I received a text from Jae Hyeong.

597
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,980
(Jae Hyeong's intention hit the mark.)

598
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,379
You have wide thumbs.

599
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,649
So do I.

600
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,289
It means you're skillful with your hands.

601
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,490
- Really?
- Yes.

602
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,219
Baek Hyun also has wide thumbs.

603
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,089
(Baek Hyun)

604
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,430
(You selected my keyword, right?)

605
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,140
I thought, "I'm in big trouble. What shall I do?"

606
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,470
"I'm doomed. My goodness."

607
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,040
That's the only thing that came to my mind.

608
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,280
(Yun Nyeong)

609
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,080
(I want to try tufting too. I won't look back if I do.)

610
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,920
It was definitely from Baek Hyun.

611
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,060
I love it that he makes it so obvious.

612
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,270
(They've sent texts to each other for 4 days.)

613
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
(Your ex did not pick you.)

614
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,910
I was thinking, "To whom should I send the text?"

615
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,549
Then I thought, "I should send one to Yoo Sik..."

616
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,010
"since I'm at least interested in him."

617
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
Then I thought again.

618
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,489
I had a talk with Baek Hyun,

619
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,760
and it made me disturbed.

620
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,059
I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

621
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,660
(She's curious about someone new, but she's bothered by her ex too.)

622
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,010
(Where is Hyeon Ji's heart going?)

623
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,510
(I guess you like beer too.)

624
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,310
I sent a text to Yoo Sik.

625
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,190
I wasn't determined to reunite with my ex.

626
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,689
I thought it was wrong to send him a text...

627
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,960
without feeling responsible for reunion.

628
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,860
(Your ex did not pick you.)

629
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,930
I was so angry.

630
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,299
Since she didn't send me a text, I felt more certain...

631
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,970
that she didn't want to reunite with me.

632
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,339
So my mind was set.

633
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,570
I rather appreciated that she didn't send me a text.

634
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,840
If she suddenly sent me one...

635
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,849
at a moment I want to focus on someone I'm attracted to,

636
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,380
my resolve might have shaken.

637
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,720
I rather appreciated that I didn't get a text from her.

638
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,690
(Yoo Sik)

639
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,970
(I wish the date didn't end. Look forward to kale juice tomorrow.)

640
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,770
It was too bad we had to leave so soon.

641
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,070
We had more things to talk about,

642
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,980
so my heart fluttered. I felt a unique sensation.

643
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,379
(Hyeon Ji and Ji Hyeon)

644
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,150
(Yoo Sik received texts from two people he's most interested in.)

645
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,649
(Two new people...)

646
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,420
(and his ex)

647
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,300
(Thanks for staying late. And I'm not an actor.)

648
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,969
(Yoo Sik sent a text to Ji Hyeon.)

649
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,600
My fingers are very flexible.

650
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,440
They bend way back.

651
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,880
She expresses her feelings in a very honest way.

652
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,510
So I can't help being attracted to her.

653
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,420
(Your ex did not pick you.)

654
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,300
(Your ex did not pick you.)

655
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,280
(Everyone's text has been sent.)

656
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,579
Yoo Sik sent a text to Ji Hyeon.

657
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,849
It looks like...

658
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,419
he's over his ex,

659
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,559
- right?
- He isn't over her yet.

660
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,319
- He's getting over her...
- He's getting over her.

661
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,489
- very slowly.
- He's going through the process.

662
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,229
He's doing the best he can.

663
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,729
- He's getting over her very slowly.
- Yes.

664
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,429
When you think about it, it can't be helped.

665
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,769
They began dating when they were in school.

666
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,599
They dated for nine years and broke up recently.

667
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,269
That means he hasn't been in many relationships.

668
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,469
- No.
- He never did it as an adult.

669
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,480
- That's right.
- His behavior is understandable.

670
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,109
(Min Kyung and Hyeon Ji come to the room.)

671
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm exhausted.

672
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm so tired.

673
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,700
It's so funny.

674
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
What's funny?

675
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,470
The situation is funny.

676
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,310
I don't care.

677
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,439
- About what?
- I don't care about anything.

678
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,240
- Now? I feel the same.
- Yes.

679
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,709
I suddenly feel fine.

680
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,720
Right? You feel at ease, right?

681
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,650
"Do you want someone else? You'll regret it." It's like that.

682
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,290
I think the woman will regret it.

683
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,300
The woman will regret it.

684
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,470
I didn't get a text from anyone today.

685
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,370
(Me neither.)

686
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,410
Who is getting all the texts?

687
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,009
Maybe one person is receiving...

688
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,540
- many texts.
- I know.

689
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,910
- Maybe they chose their exes.
- That's possible.

690
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,080
Maybe 1 woman got 3 texts. There are 5 men.

691
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,520
Why are we making deductions when we don't care?

692
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,160
It's like, "Who is it?"

693
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,860
(Women on the 4th floor go to bed early today.)

694
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,369
I think it'll be like that.

695
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,600
I haven't been on many dates.

696
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,669
Don't you go out every day?

697
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,270
I really don't. I'm not very popular.

698
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,670
- "Not very popular?" - I'm not very popular.

699
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,540
- I'm not popular at all.
- I got zero texts on some days.

700
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,610
"Some days?"

701
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,920
Maybe one woman is receiving all the texts.

702
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
All the texts?

703
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
- There are...
- I hear noises.

704
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,490
What?

705
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,589
- What?
- Who is it?

706
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,660
I don't know.

707
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,400
What? What is it?

708
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,770
What is it?

709
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,600
Aren't you going to bed?

710
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,569
Who are you?

711
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,600
It's me.

712
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,170
It's me, Ji Hyeon.

713
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,780
- What?
- Ji Hyeon.

714
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,009
Why aren't you going to bed?

715
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,080
(She hears her ex's voice outside the door.)

716
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,880
Is everyone sleeping?

717
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,450
We aren't sleeping.

718
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,719
- Can we go inside?
- No.

719
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,120
Hold on. Can they come inside?

720
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,290
- Sure.
- Okay.

721
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,260
- You can come inside.
- Really?

722
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,459
Really?

723
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,659
It doesn't matter.

724
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,800
Why are you guys chatting instead of going to bed?

725
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
People in this room...

726
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,930
are always chatting.

727
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,299
It's the hardest to see Yoo Sik's face.

728
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,310
- Me?
- Yes.

729
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,940
It's Yoo Sik's first visit to this room.

730
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,780
- It's my second time here.
- Baek Hyun visits often.

731
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,409
It's my second time here.

732
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,979
Really? When was the first visit?

733
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,280
I visited earlier when Hyeon Ji was here.

734
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,650
Why?

735
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,919
- He told me to come and eat.
- I see.

736
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,090
- What?
- Those words can be misunderstood.

737
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,490
Being in the room together without anyone else...

738
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,460
So this is my second time.

739
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,860
Those words can be misunderstood.

740
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,129
- I...
- That startled me.

741
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,600
I wanted to charge the vacuum cleaner.

742
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,970
That's right. The vacuum cleaner.

743
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,470
I mean...

744
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,980
Seriously, the things the two of you are saying...

745
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,880
can be misunderstood.

746
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,850
How is it? Are things harder now?

747
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,559
(In one corner, Baek Hyun and Ji Hyeon are talking.)

748
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,420
- Things are fine now.
- Really?

749
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,259
- Things are fine now.
- Really?

750
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,530
Were you having a hard time?

751
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,200
I had no idea.

752
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,129
This place makes people that way.

753
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,170
Totally.

754
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,540
Today was...

755
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,479
- Was it the worst?
- Yesterday and today.

756
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Really?

757
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,680
(She can't help but worry about their conversation.)

758
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,020
This and that...

759
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,450
We're suddenly having a serious conversation.

760
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
It's my bag.

761
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,560
Baek Hyun is organizing things.

762
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,970
It looks like Baek Hyun has many things to talk about.

763
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,699
- No, I don't.
- No?

764
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
No.

765
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,250
(The air inside the room is tense.)

766
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,250
How is it here?

767
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,690
Me? What do you mean?

768
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,330
I'm just curious about the emotions you had when you came here.

769
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,530
I feel like...

770
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,599
my thoughts have changed a lot...

771
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,270
upon entering the house.

772
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,640
Well,

773
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,950
because of that...

774
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,620
I want to wash up.

775
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,519
To be honest,

776
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,460
he said many nice things...

777
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,160
in the introduction from the ex...

778
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,570
and during the preliminary meeting.

779
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,040
It looked like he wanted to get back together with me.

780
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,209
I suddenly felt like I wouldn't be able to talk to him...

781
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,810
if not today.

782
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,180
Shall we go and get some water?

783
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,950
- What?
- Let's go and get some water.

784
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,490
Okay. Let's do that.

785
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,960
Aren't you going to go downstairs?

786
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,290
No. I'm okay.

787
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,730
(She tries to make it happen through a natural excuse.)

788
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,900
Aren't you going to go?

789
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
No.

790
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,800
What?

791
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,970
- Look at her facial expression.
- That facial expression was insane.

792
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,539
She gritted her teeth.

793
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,370
- I got goosebumps.
- That was scary.

794
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,779
I bet she was really angry.

795
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,079
"Aren't you going to go?" "No, I'm okay." That's so funny.

796
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,780
She should've just said it.

797
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,280
My heart is pounding.

798
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,750
What?

799
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,900
(They talk about something.)

800
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,910
- Do you want to use a lip mask?
- No, I need a moment.

801
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,250
I felt like I really needed to talk to him today.

802
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,260
So I waited on the terrace...

803
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,200
and asked Hyeon Ji for a favor.

804
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,269
I asked her, "Could you make Yoo Sik come..."

805
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,570
"to the terrace for a moment?"

806
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,110
(Min Kyung gets help from Hyeon Ji in the end.)

807
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,580
Lip scrub.

808
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,510
Will you use this and go to bed?

809
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,380
I'll leave it on for ten minutes.

810
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,550
- All right.
- Call over Yoo Sik.

811
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,390
- What? Whom should I call over?
- Yoo Sik.

812
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,720
Is he looking for me?

813
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,760
(Call him over and make him go to the terrace.)

814
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,559
Do you want me to do that?

815
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,100
(Baek Hyun saw Min Kyung go out on the terrace.)

816
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,330
What do you mean...

817
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,769
I'll go downstairs. I'll pretend to go downstairs.

818
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,770
Go downstairs.

819
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,210
(Baek Hyun steps in to help their conversation.)

820
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,750
- Come here.
- What?

821
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,320
Go to the terrace.

822
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,710
Why do you keep avoiding me?

823
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,050
I don't understand why you're doing this to me.

824
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,590
We could be on good terms.

825
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,090
Things don't need to be uncomfortable between us.

826
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,190
Right.

827
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,990
We've dated for eight years.

828
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,600
- Nine years.
- Same thing.

829
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,500
Come here. Let's stand over here.

830
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,620
Don't lean on it.

831
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,690
What will you do if it collapses?

832
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,760
I don't care. Maybe not.

833
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,859
Come here. People will see you.

834
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,899
- Why do you keep complaining?
- People will see you, Min Kyung.

835
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,399
Why do you keep complaining?

836
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,599
Why do you keep trying to school me?

837
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,269
Why do you do that? What have I done?

838
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,600
Please be quiet.

839
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,080
What have I done? Why are you doing this to me?

840
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,679
In your words and actions,

841
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,649
you've made it clear...

842
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,410
that I was your ex from the first day.

843
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,780
I didn't make it clear.

844
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,050
What's good about making it clear that I'm your ex?

845
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,289
I didn't make it clear.

846
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,259
You made it clear. Everyone figured it out.

847
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,690
Women didn't know.

848
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,130
Why aren't you acting like yourself?

849
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,000
What do you want me to do?

850
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,169
This was what I wanted to do.

851
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,669
Had I made things so obvious, you should've told me.

852
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,640
Then I wouldn't have done it.

853
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,040
There's a bug.

854
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,810
- Don't make it obvious.
- I don't do that.

855
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,349
- You make it obvious.
- Does anyone say that?

856
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,909
- Does anyone say that?
- You make it obvious.

857
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,020
It's obvious who you're interested in.

858
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,350
- Who am I interested in?
- Ji Hyeon.

859
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,590
Is it Yun Nyeong? Ji Yeon?

860
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,760
Everyone? You're nice to everyone.

861
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:46,059
You buy them yogurt. You do the things you did for me.

862
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,099
Am I supposed to see that and go...

863
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,629
Can't I go out and buy something like that?

864
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,269
"He must be interested in someone."

865
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,200
Am I supposed to be happy about it?

866
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,200
It's not like I fell in love at first sight.

867
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,610
It seems that way.

868
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,010
You don't care about me at all.

869
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,580
Am I supposed to care about you?

870
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,779
- Then...
- Am I supposed to come here...

871
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,820
and do that nonstop?

872
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,790
I was just curious about how you felt.

873
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,530
I just...

874
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,069
I don't know how I feel.

875
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,969
You kept avoiding conversations,

876
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,170
so I became more frustrated.

877
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,509
- I don't really want to talk.
- Why?

878
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,910
Why do you want to talk?

879
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,680
What improvements can come from our conversations?

880
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,060
So what do you want to say? Do you want me to look after you?

881
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,520
- No. Never mind.
- Then what?

882
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,800
All right. Go inside. I'm going to go and wash up.

883
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,140
Go inside.

884
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,039
Let's relax.

885
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,809
I get it. Please.

886
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,639
- I get it too.
- I say this all the time,

887
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,410
- I get it.
- but don't drag the conversation.

888
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,510
Who?

889
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,479
- Don't drag the conversation.
- Right now?

890
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,020
- Yes. Go inside.
- You do the same.

891
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,790
Why do you keep getting irritated?

892
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,090
Please.

893
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,190
I can't sleep these days.

894
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,260
I have under-eye bags down to my chin.

895
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,130
- Please. Why do you keep going?
- Fine.

896
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,480
(Their conversation ends in an irritated manner.)

897
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
This is so much fun.

898
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,469
All kinds of things happen there.

899
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,669
- That's the scary spot.
- That was the peak.

900
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,499
I didn't know Yoo Sik was someone...

901
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,669
who could talk back like that.

902
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,439
I think he suppressed his anger for the past week.

903
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,139
- That's right.
- He held it in a lot.

904
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,579
Last time, he just answered,

905
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,879
"Okay."

906
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,379
Today, it was like, "Until when do I need to put up..."

907
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,949
- "with your irritable manner?" - Exactly.

908
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,019
- Yoo Sik exploded in the end.
- Yes.

909
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,790
Both Yoo Sik's behavior...

910
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,019
and Min Kyung's disappointment are understandable.

911
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,290
- That's right.
- I understand both of them.

912
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,260
The timing is regrettable.

913
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,099
(Hyeon Ji visits Baek Hyun's room.)

914
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,430
I'll give you the mask sheet.

915
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,670
You put it on and take it off the next day.

916
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,100
Where did Woo Jin go?

917
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,180
(She closes the door.)

918
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,280
Why didn't you come out yesterday?

919
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,690
I couldn't.

920
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,820
I wanted to.

921
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,460
Do you want to go out now?

922
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,830
Do you?

923
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,400
You wanted to talk later.

924
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:12,870
Did you wait?

925
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,299
Of course, I did. We were supposed to meet at 3am.

926
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,070
I couldn't go out.

927
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,670
Why not?

928
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,380
In any case, did you want to?

929
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,780
Did you try to go out?

930
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,850
- Hold on.
- What is it?

931
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,660
What should I do? Should I go to the bathroom?

932
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,760
(Be quiet.)

933
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,970
Did he lock the door?

934
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,240
Isn't locking the door too much?

935
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,170
What are they going to do?

936
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

937
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,039
- Woo Jin.
- Yes?

938
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,350
- I'm really sorry, but...
- Okay.

939
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,710
please go downstairs. Okay.

940
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,950
Come down to the entrance.

941
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,560
I need to leave early tomorrow. Can we talk tomorrow?

942
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,330
- Does it have to be now?
- It won't take long.

943
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,330
It won't take long.

944
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,740
Do we talk outside?

945
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,980
- Let's just talk here.
- Okay.

946
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,780
- Yesterday...
- Yes?

947
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,720
Why didn't you come to meet me?

948
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,390
Someone might've seen us.

949
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,420
- What?
- Someone might've seen us.

950
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,090
Who?

951
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,390
Yoo Sik.

952
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,430
Yoo Sik suddenly came into my room.

953
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,800
Leaving suddenly...

954
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,940
would've been...

955
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,439
You thought it'd be obvious if you came downstairs?

956
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,379
Yes, that's why I couldn't do anything.

957
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,410
Seriously.

958
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,749
We can't get caught.

959
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,750
For real?

960
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,820
I'm sorry. I really am.

961
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,890
We promised to meet...

962
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,319
- at 3am, didn't we?
- I'm...

963
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,460
I'm sorry.

964
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,090
I didn't know what to do.

965
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,800
Sorry.

966
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,670
I'm sorry.

967
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,940
Seriously, you...

968
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,209
I don't understand...

969
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,340
a lot of what you do.

970
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,040
Like what? Tell me, and I'll explain.

971
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,779
I'll be honest with you.

972
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,050
But you're not honest with me.

973
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
I'll be honest.

974
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:41,820
You weren't honest yesterday either.

975
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,120
What? No, I was being honest.

976
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,759
I'm being completely honest.

977
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,489
What is it that you're being honest about?

978
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:50,630
Doing things based on how I feel.

979
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,429
- When?
- Listen.

980
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:59,070
- When Ji Hyeon came today, - Yes?

981
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,940
why did you touch her?

982
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,440
- Touch her?
- Yes.

983
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,580
- The high five?
- Yes.

984
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,010
(Baek Hyun high-fived Ji Hyeon when she came home.)

985
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,220
Is it mealtime?

986
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,350
Do you hate that? Do you feel self-conscious about it?

987
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,959
Do I feel self-conscious?

988
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,260
Do you have feelings for me?

989
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,430
Do you want to get back...

990
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,300
together?

991
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,970
I'm not sure.

992
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,540
- Why?
- Is that so? Really...

993
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:38,740
What?

994
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
- You said you weren't sure.
- Yes.

995
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,920
You're being inconsistent.

996
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,980
How am I being inconsistent?

997
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,820
I...

998
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,260
Regardless of that, I think it's wrong.

999
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,600
What's wrong? Did I hold her hand or what?

1000
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,270
It was just a high five.

1001
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,639
- If you think like that, - Yes?

1002
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,570
then we just think differently.

1003
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,940
But I still think it's wrong.

1004
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,350
If you don't want to get back together,

1005
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,319
why would you say anything about me high-fiving someone?

1006
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,280
- It's not like I...
- We're not strangers.

1007
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,150
- We are now.
- No...

1008
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,789
All right. Come here.

1009
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,889
Are you jealous?

1010
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,530
Are you jealous even though you don't like me?

1011
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,930
- Seriously.
- I'm just curious.

1012
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,900
You don't want to get back together with me.

1013
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,740
I just thought you doing that in front of me was wrong.

1014
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,440
- That...
- I see. Did that make you upset?

1015
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,880
It's not about wanting to get back together.

1016
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,549
In a situation where misunderstandings...

1017
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,860
keep building up, acting like that in front of me...

1018
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,860
is rude.

1019
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,429
But to say that I'm being inconsistent...

1020
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,300
while we're having this conversation?

1021
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,770
If you're that bothered about me,

1022
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,169
you'd express it.

1023
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,909
But since your attention is on someone else,

1024
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,380
you must be flirting with them.

1025
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,449
How am I flirting with them?

1026
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,850
I don't know, but...

1027
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,580
We send text messages, right?

1028
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,550
But...

1029
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,259
- I don't care about those.
- It's not that I want it.

1030
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,719
I don't read into...

1031
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,059
who you text.

1032
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,859
I just think...

1033
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,999
what you do in front of me is disrespectful.

1034
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,129
I'll be careful about that.

1035
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,070
What did I do in front of you?

1036
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,240
You have the wrong idea about me and Ji Hyeon.

1037
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,680
Earlier, you came into our room,

1038
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,579
sat where I could see you when I was about to sleep,

1039
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,320
and chatted with her?

1040
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,850
That's what I think is rude.

1041
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,360
I see now how it might look.

1042
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,700
It might seem wrong.

1043
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,810
Nobody here acts like you do.

1044
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,580
In front of me, of all people?

1045
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,880
I'm sorry. That was thoughtless of me.

1046
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,250
But...

1047
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,050
Let's see.

1048
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,319
I'm sorry I got...

1049
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,519
on your nerves. I really am.

1050
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,160
It wasn't intentional.

1051
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,500
I swear I didn't do those things...

1052
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,270
to hurt you on purpose.

1053
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,670
Nor do I want to.

1054
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,910
(Misunderstandings come easily, but understanding is hard.)

1055
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,679
Do people usually fight...

1056
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,980
so closely like that?

1057
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,679
They can't be loud.

1058
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,849
But isn't that a bit too close?

1059
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,789
In the midst of it, he's apologizing really hard.

1060
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,919
I can understand Baek Hyun.

1061
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,289
She doesn't want to get back together,

1062
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,429
so what's the point of being thoughtful?

1063
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,859
But he should've still...

1064
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,029
kept his promise, even if they're not getting back together.

1065
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,899
- That's a given.
- Of course.

1066
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,069
But high-fiving others and stuff...

1067
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,439
That high five earlier was just...

1068
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,669
- Right?
- a high five.

1069
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,409
Like, "Hey, man."

1070
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,639
And he apologized because she nagged about it.

1071
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,739
I like seeing him accept it.

1072
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,409
- Yes.
- I can understand Baek Hyun now.

1073
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,510
- Right?
- Totally.

1074
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,219
- He has no ill intentions.
- Exactly.

1075
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,080
He has zero ill intentions.

1076
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,520
(There's only silence in the dining area.)

1077
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,730
Was everyone cheerful before I moved in?

1078
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,830
And did you hang out well?

1079
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,300
We did hang out,

1080
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,340
but we weren't all that lively.

1081
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,009
- It's the same.
- Really?

1082
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,879
But I haven't hung out with anyone yet.

1083
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,940
(The silence is long, especially tonight.)

1084
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,010
Everyone upstairs is having a tough time.

1085
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,080
That's what I feel.

1086
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,790
I'm not sure. No, actually...

1087
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,590
Other than me, everyone is struggling.

1088
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,760
Nobody can be completely fine.

1089
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,730
It's the situation.

1090
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,330
Is there anyone who has no interest?

1091
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,229
- In their ex?
- Yes.

1092
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,870
- Is that even possible?
- Except for you, Ji Yeon.

1093
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,040
Do you have no interest at all?

1094
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,610
No, none at all.

1095
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,740
I came here with zero interest.

1096
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,950
What about you, Woo Jin?

1097
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,050
I'm in the same boat.

1098
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,840
(The conversation ends with silence.)

1099
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,750
What?

1100
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,349
- Nice.
- He's upset.

1101
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,419
- Everyone is on edge today.
- Today, the couples are...

1102
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,819
- What a day.
- The exes are...

1103
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,220
Today just isn't the day.

1104
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,100
My ex kind of nudged me on my foot,

1105
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,370
as if telling me to follow him to talk.

1106
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,899
I'd better go to sleep.

1107
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,239
(Woo Jin secretly asked to talk.)

1108
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,310
Good night.

1109
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,710
Good night.

1110
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,050
What time is it?

1111
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,110
I want to stop talking to him.

1112
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,020
There's nothing more...

1113
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,320
to talk about.

1114
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,830
I'm going...

1115
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,829
to head downstairs after saying good night...

1116
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,300
- to the girls.
- Okay.

1117
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,530
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

1118
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,740
It's cold.

1119
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,440
- Should I get you something?
- Yes.

1120
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,880
(Sighing)

1121
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,750
What does he want to talk about?

1122
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,660
(Taking an outerwear for Ji Yeon)

1123
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,770
- What? Where are you off to?
- What?

1124
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,639
- Where are you going?
- For a smoke.

1125
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,870
(Jae Hyeong was on his way to the terrace.)

1126
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,140
Let's smoke downstairs.

1127
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,909
Downstairs? I don't think we can.

1128
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,639
- No, let's go downstairs.
- Can we?

1129
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,149
(Woo Jin doesn't know where smoking is allowed.)

1130
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,320
Is there a smoking area?

1131
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,650
- A smoking area.
- Can't you just smoke over there?

1132
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,150
We can go out through here.

1133
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:08,490
(Ji Yeon is waiting for Woo Jin on the terrace.)

1134
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,530
I don't think we can.

1135
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,529
- It's the yard.
- Give me a second.

1136
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,229
(Either way, Woo Jin is taken aback.)

1137
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,500
- What is it?
- Give me just a second. Stay here.

1138
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,110
(Taking a step back for a bigger step)

1139
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,850
What now?

1140
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,150
I have something to say to Ji Yeon.

1141
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,189
- Give me just a second.
- Over there?

1142
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,320
Yes. Give me one second.

1143
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,060
Who is it?

1144
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,560
Jae Hyeong.

1145
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,869
- Really?
- He was coming up for a smoke.

1146
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,469
- Is that so?
- I had nothing to say.

1147
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,769
So what did you say?

1148
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,970
To wait because we had to talk.

1149
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,179
- You said that?
- What else could I say?

1150
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,910
I suggested we smoke outside.

1151
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,749
Like in the yard.

1152
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,310
He was like, "But we can't."

1153
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,880
Are you trying to spread rumors?

1154
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,350
Seriously.

1155
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,750
That timing was awful.

1156
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,660
Shall we talk in the room so he can smoke?

1157
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,990
I think we should.

1158
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:19,590
I don't think he can smoke outside.

1159
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,729
Is it hard to see from the girls' room?

1160
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,799
Yes.

1161
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,000
(Leaving the terrace for Jae Hyeong to use)

1162
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,780
(They move to the empty living room, out of sight from others.)

1163
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,290
(Sighing)

1164
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,230
Why are you glaring at me?

1165
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:51,760
I'm just looking at you.

1166
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,730
On a scale of ten, how much do you want...

1167
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,500
to get back together with me?

1168
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,370
Before coming here,

1169
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,080
it was about...

1170
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,410
fifty-fifty.

1171
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,780
I don't get how you feel.

1172
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,250
You don't?

1173
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,950
No.

1174
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,220
During the preliminary meeting,

1175
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,060
it didn't seem like you had any interest in getting back together.

1176
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,830
I'm sure we both want to.

1177
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,469
But the first thought I had was...

1178
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,670
- fifty-fifty...
- One hundred.

1179
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,570
- One hundred?
- One hundred.

1180
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,810
I don't know how I feel either.

1181
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,480
Don't say that your wishy-washy feelings are a hundred.

1182
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,550
Fine.

1183
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,360
I swear I didn't come here with any clear intention...

1184
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,160
of getting back together with you.

1185
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,600
It's just that...

1186
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,330
I came to have a conviction...

1187
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,669
of my own.

1188
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,740
What conviction?

1189
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,770
Remember what you said yesterday?

1190
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,110
That I changed.

1191
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,980
You said I'd changed and that you felt lonely near the end.

1192
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,020
Whether...

1193
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,320
that was because I was truly busy,

1194
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,550
or because my feelings...

1195
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,490
had died down, using work as an excuse.

1196
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,230
Here's what I want to know.

1197
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,489
Yesterday's talk was okay.

1198
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,700
We talked for the first time after coming here.

1199
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,800
And...

1200
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:41,039
I get that you texted me...

1201
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,410
to show how bad you felt.

1202
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,370
But why did you send one today?

1203
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,079
Personally, I thought about you...

1204
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,850
the most today.

1205
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,589
I kind of...

1206
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,350
- You know, I...
- Yes?

1207
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:06,259
I don't want you to send me texts simply because...

1208
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,860
you miss me.

1209
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,370
I didn't write that I missed you in the text.

1210
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,669
I know. It's how you feel.

1211
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:18,510
Telling you what to do and what not to do feels wrong.

1212
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,080
But this is how I feel.

1213
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,340
Even if you send me a text like that,

1214
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,880
I have nothing to say to you.

1215
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:38,960
Shall we go to our rooms?

1216
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,760
You want to end things here?

1217
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:53,480
(Woo Jin leaves first.)

1218
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,650
(Sighing)

1219
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,520
She must be a mess too.

1220
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,520
I didn't want to put pressure on her just yet.

1221
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,030
But it's not like I've fully made up my mind.

1222
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,829
My feelings were jumbled up.

1223
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,400
(He still has mixed feelings.)

1224
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,470
(A night when confusion rises)

1225
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,470
Why is everybody so annoying today?

1226
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,139
Everyone had a talk with their exes only.

1227
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,339
- Exactly.
- It's that kind of moment.

1228
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,479
If Woo Jin really wants to get back together with her,

1229
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,079
he should be more careful about starting...

1230
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,490
a conversation or approaching her.

1231
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,619
At this rate,

1232
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,229
what he's doing could become a catalyst that pushes Ji Yeon...

1233
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,929
to go all in on Won Kyu.

1234
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,700
True. If Woo Jin...

1235
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,399
had been more sincere and told her,

1236
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,200
"My feelings for you have grown..."

1237
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,339
- instead of "100," - Yes.

1238
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,869
- Had he been more honest, right?
- then...

1239
01:02:56,870 --> 01:03:00,009
how Ji Yeon took that would've been different.

1240
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,109
But I don't think him saying "100..."

1241
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,910
was a complete joke.

1242
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,679
In Ji Yeon's shoes, it might feel like one.

1243
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,680
He even tapped her with his foot in order to talk to her.

1244
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,300
I apologize for my shortcomings. I'm sorry.

1245
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,870
- But anyway...
- I understand you.

1246
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,770
If my behavior bothers you and makes you uncomfortable...

1247
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,239
- What?
- Wait a minute.

1248
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,569
- Is he still apologizing to her?
- Wait.

1249
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,209
Have they been talking all along?

1250
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,839
Isn't he practically apologizing...

1251
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,479
- on his knees?
- Three hours?

1252
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,910
Seriously.

1253
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,649
He's apologizing for his behavior during the last few days.

1254
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,650
I know.

1255
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,860
However, there's one thing I cannot promise you.

1256
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:53,230
Let's say there's someone I'm interested in.

1257
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,499
I might express my feelings for her in my behavior...

1258
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,970
without realizing it.

1259
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,600
I can't promise you that I wouldn't.

1260
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,640
I'm not saying that I'll behave in that way...

1261
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,410
because I'm interested in her.

1262
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,320
I don't like knowing that you could be interested in someone...

1263
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,450
and flirt with her right in front of me.

1264
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,690
It's annoying.

1265
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,320
You mean, later?

1266
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,690
I don't care when. It could be anytime.

1267
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,430
I don't know anymore.

1268
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,900
You have to figure out now how you feel about me.

1269
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,109
I'm being clear with you so that you could be more at peace.

1270
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,980
- Don't worry about that. I beg you.
- Okay.

1271
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,839
Please!

1272
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,849
I'm not worried.

1273
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,149
I'm doing what I really want.

1274
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,780
- I told you...
- That's even worse.

1275
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,250
Goodness.

1276
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,750
(Sighing)

1277
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,129
No, you're not the person I used to know.

1278
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,990
That's why I feel so confused.

1279
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,460
Really?

1280
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,899
- Is it true?
- What?

1281
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,240
- Is it how you really feel?
- About what?

1282
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:11,310
Everything that you've been telling me.

1283
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:13,009
- Just now?
- Yes.

1284
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,840
That I'm interested in someone? I'm being honest.

1285
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,220
After breaking up with you,

1286
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:27,220
I couldn't be in a relationship for two years.

1287
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,060
It was very hard for me during that time.

1288
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,529
As you know,

1289
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:40,340
you were very important to me during my 20s.

1290
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,540
- You know...
- Exactly.

1291
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:44,010
- You know better than anyone.
- Exactly, but...

1292
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,880
You were everything to me during my 20s.

1293
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,910
I'm being honest.

1294
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,720
Why would I lie to you at this place?

1295
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,320
I'm interested in someone.

1296
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,790
I want it to work out.

1297
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,930
No.

1298
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,240
You've been here for 4 to 5 days.

1299
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:24,779
During that time, we never sent a text...

1300
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,780
to each other.

1301
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,420
So I thought that you were also interested in someone.

1302
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,589
It's normal to think that, right?

1303
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,990
I feel the same.

1304
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,930
I want to get to know someone new.

1305
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,400
But if I was...

1306
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:52,670
on your mind even just a little...

1307
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,910
I didn't expect you...

1308
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,649
to be interested in someone...

1309
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,350
so seriously.

1310
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,560
I can't say anything for sure,

1311
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,460
but I want to get to know her.

1312
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,830
- Oh, come on.
- Okay.

1313
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,830
Goodness.

1314
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,970
Are you annoyed?

1315
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,700
I can't believe that you're interested in someone.

1316
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,070
- Let's go to bed.
- Okay.

1317
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,310
I'm tired.

1318
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,850
I wanted to sleep early today.

1319
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,380
- Me too.
- Right?

1320
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,719
Do you feel at peace? Do you feel better?

1321
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,050
No, not at all.

1322
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,560
Is it worse? Are you more annoyed?

1323
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,660
Are you more annoyed...

1324
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:43,460
- after the conversation?
- Yes.

1325
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,429
There's no more misunderstanding.

1326
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:46,590
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1327
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,530
There's no more misunderstanding.

1328
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,399
- Are you just annoyed?
- Things are clear now.

1329
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,270
- What do you mean?
- How you feel.

1330
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:57,069
Go in.

1331
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:58,310
Have some water before going to bed.

1332
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,510
Let me open it.

1333
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:08,520
I was having a very hard time two days ago.

1334
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,420
I feel much better after our conversation.

1335
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,690
- I should've let you suffer.
- What?

1336
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,460
- I should've let you suffer.
- Then wouldn't it kill you?

1337
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,360
I really hope that you'll be at peace.

1338
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:24,470
- You want me to be at peace?
- Yes.

1339
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:26,400
Then...

1340
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,340
be good to me.

1341
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:31,840
- To you?
- Yes.

1342
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,979
With what intention should I be good to you?

1343
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,580
Like how I treat other people well?

1344
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,949
- No.
- With sincerity?

1345
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:45,950
Yes.

1346
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,690
So you're telling me to get closer to you.

1347
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,530
Can't you be good to me with sincerity?

1348
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,200
And feel like I did in the past?

1349
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,030
Like how I put my life on the line for you?

1350
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,740
- Like me in the past?
- No.

1351
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,609
- You don't want that much?
- No.

1352
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:07,080
- Half of that half?
- No.

1353
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,440
- Or even half of that?
- No.

1354
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,050
Or even smaller than that? Would that be enough?

1355
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,350
Yes.

1356
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,450
Just a small portion of that.

1357
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,960
Like when we met for the first time.

1358
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:27,230
I liked you so much back then.

1359
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,900
I really liked you then.

1360
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,530
When you asked me out to the movies,

1361
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,440
I pushed my friends inside a fried chicken restaurant.

1362
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,780
I left them with some food, and I came running to you.

1363
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,350
Do you remember what you did?

1364
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,150
Please.

1365
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,190
My goodness.

1366
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
What's going on?

1367
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,240
- Gosh.
- What's going on here?

1368
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,439
When the guy keeps comforting you like Baek Hyun,

1369
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,440
anyone could behave like Hyeon Ji.

1370
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,579
- This is crazy.
- We've never seen such a couple.

1371
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,580
We've never seen such a couple.

1372
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:18,979
- I agree with you.
- That's why I can't explain.

1373
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,980
We've never seen anyone like them.

1374
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:22,619
I feel a lot of heat in my body.

1375
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,650
Please.

1376
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,460
My goodness.

1377
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,060
Gosh, what should I do?

1378
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,939
- It must be fun for you.
- What do you mean?

1379
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,940
- I mean this situation.
- It's not fun.

1380
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,839
Wouldn't I be a psychopath if I'm enjoying it?

1381
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,840
Maybe.

1382
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,180
I weigh as much as I did when I met you.

1383
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,380
Did you gain weight?

1384
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,020
I used to weigh around 79kg.

1385
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,789
Go in. Let's go to bed.

1386
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,490
Okay. Sleep well.

1387
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,830
Let's talk again next time.

1388
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,130
What?

1389
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:10,970
Go to bed.

1390
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,200
- Gosh.
- You can do it.

1391
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,640
Okay.

1392
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,450
Good night.

1393
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,550
Go in.

1394
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:37,560
Hurry and go to bed.

1395
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Go in.

1396
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,649
Hyeon Ji still likes him very much.

1397
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,779
- She does.
- Right.

1398
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:03,379
Baek Hyun loved her so much that he could've bet his life on it.

1399
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:06,189
She's not used to seeing him expressing his interest...

1400
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,259
in someone else.

1401
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,619
- She can't believe it.
- She can't believe it either.

1402
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,789
She doesn't want to believe in anything he says.

1403
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:11,159
- "He's mine. He was mine." - He's mine.

1404
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,929
- He still belongs to her.
- Even though they broke up.

1405
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:13,930
I agree with you.

1406
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:15,929
- He's hers even after the breakup.
- Exactly.

1407
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,329
"I've been your love all your life."

1408
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:19,069
Yes, that's exactly how she feels.

1409
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,199
That's why when Baek Hyun brought up his 20s,

1410
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,299
she reacted that way.

1411
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,239
There are couples like them.

1412
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,639
- You're right.
- How shall I put it?

1413
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,209
- They can't let each other go.
- Right.

1414
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,379
- They're one of them.
- There are couples like them.

1415
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,979
After watching them argue, it became clearer.

1416
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,649
In my opinion, they make a better couple...

1417
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,820
than Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong.

1418
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,050
You're stating the obvious.

1419
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,789
That's what we go through all the time.

1420
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,829
After this scene, we think, "Yes, you make the best couple."

1421
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:48,230
When they meet someone new, we think, "New couples are the best."

1422
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,929
- Is that normal?
- We go through that all the time.

1423
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:50,930
- It's normal.
- Goodness.

1424
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:52,330
EXchange drives me crazy.

1425
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,669
(After a long night,)

1426
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,940
(the day of the date finally arrived.)

1427
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:01,140
(Everyone is busy getting ready for the date this morning.)

1428
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,250
(Ji Hyeon comes out to the kitchen as soon as she gets up.)

1429
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,819
Yoo Sik and I both eat healthy.

1430
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,519
We seem to have similar tastes.

1431
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,250
I promised to make him kale juice.

1432
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,860
Where is the kale?

1433
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,390
Instead of kale, there was only cilantro.

1434
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,330
I thought, "Did someone eat it?"

1435
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:19,959
I was disappointed.

1436
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,660
(In the end, she couldn't make kale juice for Yoo Sik.)

1437
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,430
(4th floor, Min Kyung, Ji Hyeon, and Hyeon Ji's room)

1438
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:27,899
Last night, I acted like a crazy person.

1439
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,070
I laughed right after crying.

1440
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,379
I understand you completely.

1441
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,780
Anyone can do that.

1442
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:39,450
- Gosh, what should I do?
- Goodness.

1443
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,549
Knowing that the guy who knows me the best is...

1444
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,089
with someone else is...

1445
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,620
what really scares me.

1446
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,259
I realized that I didn't know...

1447
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,260
much about my ex.

1448
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,530
Really?

1449
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,700
Did you two also talk about this?

1450
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,669
If he was interested in someone?

1451
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,200
Yes, he told me about it clearly.

1452
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,770
You know what?

1453
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,640
I never wanted to believe it.

1454
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,309
That he could be interested in someone?

1455
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,650
When we were in a relationship,

1456
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,780
he liked me much more than I did.

1457
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,290
(Glancing)

1458
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,690
Wait.

1459
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,290
(She heard someone going out.)

1460
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:32,030
(She sees Yoo Sik going out.)

1461
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,570
I like our room.

1462
01:14:38,571 --> 01:14:39,970
This is so fun to watch.

1463
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,040
What's going on?

1464
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,479
- It's nothing. I saw something.
- I'm curious.

1465
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,610
He left.

1466
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:47,420
(Tiptoeing out of curiosity)

1467
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,520
Taking a peek at others on a date is so funny.

1468
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,560
(Min Kyung goes out on her date at 12:20pm.)

1469
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,760
(Hyeon Ji goes out on her date at 12:40pm.)

1470
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:04,400
(Everyone goes out on their keyword date.)

1471
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,269
(On the 4th floor,)

1472
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,140
(Ji Hyeon is sound asleep.)

1473
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:25,490
Hello.

1474
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,120
Hello.

1475
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,990
- You're sleeping.
- Yes.

1476
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,630
You must be tired.

1477
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,230
I'm very tired.

1478
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,130
You came back late last night.

1479
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,140
I would've been so exhausted if I drank last night.

1480
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,039
(Groaning)

1481
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,240
(Moaning)

1482
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,180
Stop making strange sounds.

1483
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:58,790
You look good with a bit of color in your outfit.

1484
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,320
Not in white?

1485
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,360
Something like that instead of wearing all white.

1486
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,440
What is it?

1487
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,410
I came to see you because I was curious.

1488
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,910
You were on my mind.

1489
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:27,820
Would you go on a date with me?

1490
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,790
Do you want to go on a date with me?

1491
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,990
Yes.

1492
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:36,920
Oh, my.

1493
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:42,160
I wasn't expecting it at all.

1494
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,800
I said, "Oh, my."

1495
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,300
At that time,

1496
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,940
I was surprised.

1497
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,170
I thought to myself, "Why?"

1498
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,840
"Why is he asking me out on a date?"

1499
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,939
(Why did you ask her out on a date all of a sudden?)

1500
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,480
I just wanted to talk to her, so I asked her out.

1501
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,050
I'll ask you next time.

1502
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,320
- About what?
- I'll ask you on a date.

1503
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,520
Okay.

1504
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,490
- Rest well.
- Thank you.

1505
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,379
- The two of them?
- What are they doing?

1506
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,909
What's happening?

1507
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:36,179
Isn't this the result of the Talking Room?

1508
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,149
Listening to the phone call...

1509
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,949
must have triggered something in them.

1510
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:42,559
- That sparked everything.
- It was a turning point.

1511
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,729
Hearing how your ex feels...

1512
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:47,289
directly from her.

1513
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:50,229
And overhearing her say it when she doesn't realize your presence.

1514
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:51,529
There's a huge difference between them.

1515
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,999
- It's just like overhearing.
- The difference is really big.

1516
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,469
- It'd be like hearing...
- Right.

1517
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:59,469
- how she honestly feels.
- Why did he ask out her ex?

1518
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:02,080
He's the type who does how he feels.

1519
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,409
He's definitely a teto-boy.

1520
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,650
While chewing his gum loudly, he woke her up.

1521
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,950
- "Would you go on a date with me?" - "Would you go out with me?"

1522
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,249
He left right after saying that.

1523
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,590
He sounded like Choi Min Soo.

1524
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,959
- He's amazing.
- He's the first one...

1525
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,629
to ask out his ex before the ex date.

1526
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,359
- They usually ask if they can talk.
- Right.

1527
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,329
- They don't ask them out on a date.
- Exactly.

1528
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,629
I'm seeing a lot of strange things in this season.

1529
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,170
It's impossible to predict what will happen.

1530
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,740
I couldn't wait to find out who it was.

1531
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:34,910
I hope that it's Baek Hyun.

1532
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,980
I want to go on a date with him.

1533
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,819
(Yun Nyeong's keyword date is...)

1534
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,290
(Won Kyu.)

1535
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:53,330
Out of nowhere, Won Kyu...

1536
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:57,630
magically appeared from afar.

1537
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:01,600
I never imagined that it would be Won Kyu.

1538
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,670
I was happy to see him.

1539
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,410
Besides, I had never been on a date with him.

1540
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,510
I thought it would be fun to go on a date with him.

1541
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,780
I bet you had no idea.

1542
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:13,710
Wait, did you know?

1543
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,319
- I did. Yes.
- Really?

1544
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,720
- That's crazy.
- Yes.

1545
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:19,650
I really had no idea.

1546
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,319
I wore Andersson Bell for you.

1547
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,360
- That's why?
- Yes.

1548
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,429
Yun Nyeong said...

1549
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:27,289
she liked denim. So I wore jeans to the date.

1550
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,759
She also said she liked Andersson Bell.

1551
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,470
So I wore my Andersson Bell jeans.

1552
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:36,100
On my way to the date, I wondered if she was curious about...

1553
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,310
or interested in me.

1554
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,110
It was a mix of excitement and curiosity.

1555
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,939
I'm curious about their chemistry.

1556
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,309
- Me too.
- I am.

1557
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,310
We originally thought...

1558
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,310
- they used to date before.
- Right.

1559
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:47,449
A calm, cold-hearted man...

1560
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,649
- and a cheerful woman.
- Right.

1561
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,020
- Yes.
- They're the perfect example.

1562
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,220
Personal color?

1563
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,420
Right.

1564
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,829
- Won't that be fun?
- Hello.

1565
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:58,989
- Hello.
- Hello.

1566
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,790
You can come this way.

1567
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,160
All right. For an accurate analysis, I put the cape around you.

1568
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,199
Colors that complement your skin tone...

1569
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,699
and help you find your ideal look as well as confidence...

1570
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,910
- are called personal colors.
- Yes.

1571
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:14,439
Let's focus on how the colors make your skin tone look different.

1572
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
Okay.

1573
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,440
All right. Cool red.

1574
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,750
What do you think?

1575
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,749
All right. Warm red.

1576
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,850
(He places the warm red fabric on top.)

1577
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,619
- Cool seems to suit me better.
- Okay. Right?

1578
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,049
- Yes.
- He has a good eye, doesn't he?

1579
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,359
I agree. Cool colors complement him better.

1580
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,659
- They do, right?
- Yes.

1581
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,760
His skin looks especially fair with cool colors.

1582
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,959
Do you want to come here and try it?

1583
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,159
- Me?
- I'll help you.

1584
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,260
Sounds good.

1585
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,929
- I'll give you...
- All right.

1586
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,100
- an accurate analysis.
- Okay.

1587
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:41,670
I think you'll be good at this.

1588
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,240
Let's try that. That's a warm color.

1589
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:45,539
- Just like that, - A warm color.

1590
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,840
you can keep adding them to the pile.

1591
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,310
Here.

1592
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,739
A cool color.

1593
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,950
(It's cool pink this time.)

1594
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,410
Cool colors are much better.

1595
01:20:53,411 --> 01:20:55,050
- Much better. Yes.
- Right?

1596
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,719
Do what you did earlier. Try that again.

1597
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,690
(She compares the warm and color colors again.)

1598
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:01,820
Try that again.

1599
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,359
Warm pink. Cool pink.

1600
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,960
I feel humiliated when you put on warm colors.

1601
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,500
- Cool colors look much better.
- What do you think?

1602
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,099
- I feel humiliated.
- She's loving it.

1603
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,270
He's so funny.

1604
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,840
When you sit in that chair,

1605
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,340
you feel so small.

1606
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:23,080
It intimidates you too.

1607
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,310
I kept looking at the mirror...

1608
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,050
and wondered, "Is this right?"

1609
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,120
It makes my skin look yellow right away.

1610
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,860
We can stop checking with warm colors.

1611
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,989
I like cool colors.

1612
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,090
(Won Kyu definitely has cool undertones.)

1613
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,460
Why is this so funny?

1614
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:41,860
Warm.

1615
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,300
Seriously. This is the worst.

1616
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,830
(He seems to be enjoying this given how he feels intimidated.)

1617
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,539
He has cool undertones and bright and dark colors...

1618
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,009
suit him well.

1619
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,840
At the same time, black suits his skin very well.

1620
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,010
Bright colors also complement his skin.

1621
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,879
With that being said, what would be his season?

1622
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,050
- Clear colors suit him well.
- Clear colors? Spring or summer?

1623
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,750
- Winter.
- Winter?

1624
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,379
- Really?
- That's right.

1625
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,849
So you knew a little bit about this.

1626
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,390
Is that why you dyed your hair black?

1627
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,490
I had white hair.

1628
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:10,720
That's why.

1629
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,199
He's adorable. He's a Young 40.

1630
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,559
(He exudes the vibe of a Young 40.)

1631
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,069
You're going to call him that?

1632
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,769
You start getting white hair at 40. I have them too.

1633
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,970
- You think he's around my age?
- Yes.

1634
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,810
(Won Kyu will analyze Yun Nyeong's personal color.)

1635
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,010
- That's cool green.
- Okay.

1636
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,580
Focus on her skin tone.

1637
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,710
Warm.

1638
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,819
- More. Yes. That's it.
- Like this?

1639
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,719
- Right. This suits you better.
- Is this better?

1640
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,820
- Right? Her face looks flushed.
- Yes.

1641
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,790
- Since her face isn't curved, - Yes.

1642
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,400
- she looks healthier, right?
- Yes.

1643
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,030
When I put the green fabric under Yun Nyeong's face,

1644
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:54,499
the color looked really good on her.

1645
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,840
I thought she looked so adorable.

1646
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,739
Let's try the cool pink.

1647
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,740
(He will place the pink fabric and compare.)

1648
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:03,080
I don't think it will look good on me.

1649
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:05,079
It looks awful.

1650
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,950
- Wait.
- Wait.

1651
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,680
It really doesn't look good on her.

1652
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,420
It really doesn't look good on her.

1653
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,620
You look so good in green.

1654
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,460
- Right?
- Hey.

1655
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:22,030
My gosh. He's so witty. He's a catch.

1656
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,130
Green looked so good on you.

1657
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:28,369
Seriously. I was so busy laughing. I can't remember what they said.

1658
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,770
It was hilarious.

1659
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,410
I kept laughing.

1660
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,110
"This doesn't look good on you."

1661
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,210
He was acting like a thinker in that moment.

1662
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,610
So that was that. But it was still fun.

1663
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,449
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1664
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,250
I'm so hungry that everyone looks tasty.

1665
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,490
(The next spot Won Kyu picked out)

1666
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,820
Hello.

1667
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,059
(Picking Pleasure)

1668
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,429
The atmosphere here is great.

1669
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:55,860
- Right.
- I didn't know about this place.

1670
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,760
Doesn't this remind you of movies from Ghibli?

1671
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,870
- Yes. It does.
- Right?

1672
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:05,010
Seriously. I had no idea I'd go on a date with you today.

1673
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,540
- You had no idea, right?
- Right.

1674
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,039
Did you have someone specific in mind?

1675
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,380
No, not at all.

1676
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,979
- Not at all?
- Not at all.

1677
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,380
Here's why. The keywords were confusing.

1678
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:16,350
There was one about wine too.

1679
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,089
I thought you might be unsure whose keyword they were.

1680
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,650
They were completely random.

1681
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:21,859
But you said you knew it was mine.

1682
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,119
- I did.
- I wondered...

1683
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,790
if I came across as a drunk.

1684
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,259
Actually, even if I didn't know much about you,

1685
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,759
I would've assumed that was yours.

1686
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:31,829
You're not a drunk.

1687
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:34,270
But you can hold your liquor compared to other women.

1688
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,269
- You can drink.
- I see. Okay.

1689
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,370
And...

1690
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:42,409
remember the phone call yesterday?

1691
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,440
Yes.

1692
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:47,550
Through the phone call yesterday,

1693
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:48,979
I could figure out the keyword.

1694
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:50,079
- Really?
- Yes.

1695
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,789
I see. Did we talk on the phone?

1696
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,089
- Yes. We did.
- Really?

1697
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,160
(She finally finds out about the mystery guy on the phone.)

1698
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:00,289
I thought, "Won Kyu was the one who wanted to know more about me..."

1699
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,330
"in the Talking Room?"

1700
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,670
But I really didn't expect it to be him.

1701
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:08,400
(Why was this unexpected for you?)

1702
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,770
I just thought he and I would never interact.

1703
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,580
Anyway, I was curious.

1704
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,450
I see.

1705
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,079
- So... Yes.
- About me?

1706
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,580
- I see.
- Because I was curious about you,

1707
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,289
I requested to talk to you in the Talking Room.

1708
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,350
- Really?
- Yes.

1709
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:30,990
I see.

1710
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,460
Thank you for the food.

1711
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,500
My gosh.

1712
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,910
- This is your kind of food. Right?
- It's so good.

1713
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,080
- What kind of fashion style...
- Yes.

1714
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,350
do you want your girlfriend to wear?

1715
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:55,780
- I...
- What do you like?

1716
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:57,879
I want her to wear something comfortable.

1717
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:58,950
An outfit she seems comfortable in.

1718
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,559
Strangely, I find women more attractive in such outfits.

1719
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,860
- Really?
- Yes.

1720
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,659
Like wearing comfortable tracksuits?

1721
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,100
Yes. I like them too.

1722
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,630
- They could wear my T-shirts too.
- Yes.

1723
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,570
I like it when they do that.

1724
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,839
Your outfit looked great on you.

1725
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,040
- My outfit?
- Yes.

1726
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,210
Was it because it was brown? It didn't have any other colors.

1727
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,280
You'll connect everything with personal colors now.

1728
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,680
You have to wear only green from now on.

1729
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,079
- Did it look that good on me?
- Yes.

1730
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:32,490
To be honest, it was way too funny.

1731
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:35,620
I couldn't pay attention to the colors.

1732
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,060
- It was...
- You looked like a frog.

1733
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,490
A frog? That's...

1734
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,899
An adorable frog.

1735
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,499
- An adorable frog?
- A frog.

1736
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,500
Yes.

1737
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:48,699
It doesn't feel good to hear that I looked like a frog.

1738
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:49,940
- Frogs are cute.
- How can you call me a frog?

1739
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,610
Can't you compare me to something cute?

1740
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:56,180
I'll think about it and let you know later.

1741
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,010
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Yes.

1742
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,550
There were many moments that made me laugh when we talked.

1743
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,250
I had fun.

1744
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:07,090
I think she also had fun.

1745
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,090
Won Kyu is really funny.

1746
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:12,760
We had fun on the date.

1747
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,999
They're like good friends.

1748
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,329
Right. That was the vibe I got.

1749
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,569
When Won Kyu and Ji Yeon are together,

1750
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:21,539
she keeps him on his toes.

1751
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,699
People associate that feeling as excitement.

1752
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,709
People think they are having butterflies and want to be careful.

1753
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:27,869
But as we saw in the videos, we know he can be playful.

1754
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,209
He danced playfully...

1755
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,809
- with Ji Hyeon on their date.
- Right.

1756
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:32,779
- There are hidden sides of him.
- Exactly.

1757
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,679
Considering that, Yun Nyeong might be a better match.

1758
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,989
He might like women who can bring out...

1759
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,220
- his playful side.
- That's right.

1760
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:45,190
(Gapyeong)

1761
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:57,200
"Who am I going on a date with?"

1762
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,270
"Who's interested in me?"

1763
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:02,610
I couldn't stop wondering about that.

1764
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,949
Hello.

1765
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:11,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

1766
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:13,550
- Isn't it nice to be out?
- Yes.

1767
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,059
- It was you, Woo Jin.
- You had no idea?

1768
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,760
No, it didn't cross my mind at all.

1769
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:21,429
At that point, I thought...

1770
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,930
no one was interested in me.

1771
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,169
That's when Woo Jin approached me.

1772
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,670
I was surprised and intrigued by that.

1773
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,369
I was looking forward to our date then.

1774
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,570
(She's looking forward to today's date.)

1775
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:36,140
Then could you figure out to whom the keywords belonged?

1776
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,450
- Yes. Because...
- Really?

1777
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,309
I knew I was picking yours.

1778
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:42,880
- Really?
- Yes. I knew I was picking yours.

1779
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,179
I wanted...

1780
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,689
- To talk?
- another date to talk...

1781
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,690
- and get to know you.
- Really?

1782
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,860
- I had no idea.
- I knew I was picking yours.

1783
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:53,860
- Thank you. This will be fun.
- Our date...

1784
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:55,130
I hope we can have fun.

1785
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,230
- You like staying active.
- Yes.

1786
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,430
- It'll be fun to do it together.
- Sounds great.

1787
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:01,969
- I've never been here before.
- Here?

1788
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:02,999
- Never.
- This is your first time?

1789
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
- Yes.
- You've never been here before?

1790
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,169
- It's my first time ever.
- You've never done...

1791
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:07,170
any water activities then?

1792
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:08,180
It's my first time.

1793
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:11,709
Are you okay with water?

1794
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:12,710
Yes. I love it.

1795
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:15,050
It's hot. I can't wait to get in.

1796
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:17,820
(Falling in love with water leisure park)

1797
01:29:17,821 --> 01:29:19,589
- This never crossed my mind.
- It's your first time here?

1798
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,049
- It's my 1st time ever.
- Your 1st time ever?

1799
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:22,060
Yes.

1800
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:24,619
- I'm so excited.
- Same here.

1801
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:25,690
Why am I nervous?

1802
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:27,960
- Seriously.
- Right.

1803
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,699
- It's...
- How do you usually stretch?

1804
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,230
- Let's just stretch our shoulders.
- Shoulders?

1805
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:33,470
- It seems you've done this a lot.
- Of course.

1806
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:35,969
You can try this.

1807
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,970
(Stretching in the same way)

1808
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:39,640
This is making me shy.

1809
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,439
Do you want to start with that?

1810
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,710
- Aqua Festa.
- Sure.

1811
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:47,650
This will be fun.

1812
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,549
I think we're having...

1813
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,220
- the most fun dates. Right?
- Totally.

1814
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,720
- Nothing is more fun than this.
- Seriously.

1815
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,590
- Nothing can top this. Right.
- Especially in hot summer?

1816
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,859
- Here we go.
- This will be fun.

1817
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,060
- Hold on tight.
- Oh, no.

1818
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,900
Grab my hand. Go ahead.

1819
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,710
- Are you okay?
- This is so funny.

1820
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:17,139
This wipes away all the stress I get from the house.

1821
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,210
Totally. It's completely wiped.

1822
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,110
Faster!

1823
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,450
Faster!

1824
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,389
- Nice.
- I love it.

1825
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,790
- Faster!
- Faster!

1826
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:33,260
- I didn't know it was this fun.
- This is so much fun.

1827
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,730
I had a blast. Seriously.

1828
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,100
My date with Min Kyung...

1829
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,600
was the most fun. I really enjoyed it.

1830
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:46,810
We're going faster.

1831
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,540
- That was so fun.
- Seriously.

1832
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,810
- What do you want to ride next?
- It was super fun.

1833
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:54,149
- Right?
- This one looks easier, right?

1834
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,150
(They're serious about water activities.)

1835
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,450
Hold on.

1836
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,150
This is fun.

1837
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,960
- Take your time.
- This is crazy.

1838
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,790
- Isn't it hard?
- Gosh, how did you do it?

1839
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:10,160
What are you doing?

1840
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,069
I should run and do it in one go?

1841
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:15,470
Yes. Try to finish it in one go. You're less likely to fall then.

1842
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,140
- You're good.
- My gosh.

1843
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,880
I looked so funny.

1844
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,949
- He kept catching me.
- What? You're so good.

1845
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:29,449
- It felt like he kept trying...
- I'm good.

1846
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,580
- to protect me.
- How are you so good?

1847
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:34,990
He made me feel that he was putting me first.

1848
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,560
I was grateful for that.

1849
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,860
We'll look so tanned when we go back. What if...

1850
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:40,789
- What if it gives us away?
- I think it will.

1851
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:42,530
- Let's go.
- Okay. Sounds good.

1852
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,030
Spicy braised chicken sounds so good.

1853
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:45,900
It's going to be so good.

1854
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,699
- Our outfits match in color again.
- Right.

1855
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:50,700
- It's like we planned it.
- How is this possible?

1856
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:52,939
We wore similar outfits last time too.

1857
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,970
Totally.

1858
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,839
- They look pretty good together.
- They make a good couple.

1859
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,480
- They look good. Their vibes match.
- Their vibes match.

1860
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,880
Honestly, this was the furthest thing on my mind.

1861
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,519
- Whether I'd choose you or not?
- I didn't know...

1862
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,450
you would pick me for the date.

1863
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:08,119
Why didn't you know? Is it because I don't express myself?

1864
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,589
- I mean...
- I don't express my interest.

1865
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,490
- I'm not that quick to catch on.
- You're not?

1866
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:13,530
You really don't know who's interested in you?

1867
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,660
No.

1868
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,569
I only date women I could actually feel

1869
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:19,570
a romantic connection with.

1870
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,399
- Really?
- I don't even try. That's just me.

1871
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,400
Now, I'm curious...

1872
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,400
- about the women you dated before.
- Let me explain.

1873
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,640
Here's why. That's the thing with dating.

1874
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,210
- You must be drawn to that person.
- Yes.

1875
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:35,650
You were the one whom I saw having a romantic connection with.

1876
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,750
Really?

1877
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,019
That's why I chose you...

1878
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,090
- for the Talking Room.
- My gosh.

1879
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,420
I really had no idea.

1880
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:48,400
Woo Jin told me that he had been interested in me...

1881
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,400
from the start.

1882
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,130
So it made my heart flutter.

1883
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,700
I'm curious about your age.

1884
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:57,300
- Right. Age.
- I didn't know your age.

1885
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,339
Guess my age.

1886
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,139
- You're... Can I guess it?
- Guess my age.

1887
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,680
- Yes.
- Around 26.

1888
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:05,380
I know this for sure.

1889
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,010
You're definitely younger than me.

1890
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,150
I think you're three years older than me.

1891
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,250
- Three?
- Yes.

1892
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:14,849
Three years.

1893
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,259
(As they guess each other's age...)

1894
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,759
We got here pretty fast. I had to drive for three hours earlier.

1895
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,790
Didn't it feel long?

1896
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:22,799
It feels like I can put away my worldly trouble.

1897
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,800
- Seriously.
- Right?

1898
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,370
Right on the cauldron lid.

1899
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,870
- That looks so good.
- This is a perfect hangover cure.

1900
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,080
- There's a valley here.
- Right.

1901
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,640
It feels like summer.

1902
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:39,410
I hope it tastes good.

1903
01:33:40,350 --> 01:33:41,409
- Thank you for the food.
- It's impossible not to taste good.

1904
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,420
Right?

1905
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,790
Can this dish ever taste bad?

1906
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,089
- I want to brag it to the others.
- Yes.

1907
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:56,560
I want to brag about what we did and what we ate.

1908
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,070
- Today's date was special.
- Yes.

1909
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:00,670
Right.

1910
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:03,040
I think having a drink with this would enhance the flavor.

1911
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,570
- Do you want to? Yes.
- Should we have a drink?

1912
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:06,970
Which one?

1913
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,140
Beer or makgeolli sounds good.

1914
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:10,840
- Do you want to drink makgeolli?
- How about makgeolli? Yes.

1915
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,180
Sounds good.

1916
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,350
Can you give us a bottle of makgeolli?

1917
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:15,350
Are you okay with pine nut makgeolli?

1918
01:34:15,351 --> 01:34:16,449
- Sounds good.
- That's great.

1919
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,149
- I love pine nut makgeolli.
- I love pine nut makgeolli.

1920
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,249
You know the chestnut makgeolli...

1921
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:20,490
- from Gongju, right?
- Of course.

1922
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,490
Actually, I can share this with you.

1923
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,719
- Are you a makgeolli lover?
- No.

1924
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,859
- What is it?
- I'm from Daejeon.

1925
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,960
- Really?
- Yes.

1926
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,430
Why did you keep that from everyone?

1927
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,400
Just in case.

1928
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:35,399
I kept it a secret just in case.

1929
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,039
But it's fine now. So you're the first one...

1930
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,340
- I'm sharing this with.
- Okay.

1931
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,570
No one knows.

1932
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,379
I believe she said that...

1933
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,449
because she was interested in me.

1934
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:50,980
I don't think she said that for no reason.

1935
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:55,890
Don't you think it'll only be more fun?

1936
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,130
Yesterday... Who was that? Ji Yeon said,

1937
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:02,560
"Today will be the most peaceful day."

1938
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,800
If we get to go elsewhere,

1939
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:06,729
our stories...

1940
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:08,800
and our exes will be revealed too.

1941
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:09,970
How do you feel about that?

1942
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:14,009
I'm not worried...

1943
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:17,810
about my story or my ex getting revealed.

1944
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:20,449
Let's say I like you.

1945
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,079
And when your ex's revealed,

1946
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,479
it's someone I'm closest to.

1947
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,790
If I had to pick someone I'm close to.

1948
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:28,789
Then would I be comfortable with it?

1949
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,120
- That makes sense.
- That's what I'm worried about.

1950
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:34,030
I kind of don't want that to be revealed.

1951
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:39,630
Aside from that,

1952
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,170
what about the relationship period?

1953
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,039
- It might be short...
- Right.

1954
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,770
or we might have broken up many times before.

1955
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:49,080
Honestly, I don't think the period matters.

1956
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,480
What if it's like 20 years?

1957
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,250
That'd be too much.

1958
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:55,580
- Because...
- You said it didn't matter.

1959
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,480
But 20 years is too long.

1960
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,150
If someone I like dated for ten years?

1961
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,790
Say you dated someone for ten years.

1962
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:08,559
Rather than someone who had been in many relationships,

1963
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,759
I prefer someone who was in a serious relationship.

1964
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,300
- Really?
- I mean it.

1965
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,669
When we start dating,

1966
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:17,299
we could go beyond that.

1967
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:18,470
When I think about it that way,

1968
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:22,710
it doesn't really bother me.

1969
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,880
Do you care about your partner's past?

1970
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,389
I'd see whether you'd broken up or not.

1971
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:34,489
- During the relationship?
- Yes.

1972
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:35,560
I never broke up during the relationship.

1973
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:39,290
It was over when it was over.

1974
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:44,600
If I were to meet someone new,

1975
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:47,600
I want her to have loved her ex so much.

1976
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,300
I want someone who knows how to love others.

1977
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,040
Right.

1978
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,270
I want her to have a lot of memories with him.

1979
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:55,380
- Just have a good breakup.
- Then there's something to learn.

1980
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,240
That's true.

1981
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:01,710
We have something in common.

1982
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,549
We got along the best.

1983
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:05,950
I had the best time with her.

1984
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:08,019
If I were to date someone new,

1985
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:09,990
it's going to be Min Kyung for me.

1986
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:13,290
Among all the dates I had,

1987
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:16,399
it was the most memorable one.

1988
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,000
I had the best time today.

1989
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:20,430
I liked it.

1990
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:25,070
Next time, let's have a more relaxing date.

1991
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:27,509
We had an active day today.

1992
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:28,879
- Right.
- Maybe something natural.

1993
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:29,880
Right.

1994
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,210
Let's do that next time.

1995
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,280
- Ready to go?
- Yes, thank you for the food.

1996
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:35,520
Thank you for the food.

1997
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:44,990
I wonder who's coming.

1998
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:49,499
The weather was nice.

1999
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,259
I wondered what kind of date...

2000
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,700
we'd have.

2001
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,779
- Hello.
- Hello.

2002
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:06,410
(Ji Hyeon's keyword date is Jae Hyeong.)

2003
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:09,080
So it was you?

2004
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:10,949
- You didn't know, did you?
- No.

2005
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:12,419
We happen to be wearing...

2006
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:13,519
Really? Awesome.

2007
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,950
- We're wearing matching shirts.
- It's similar.

2008
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,389
- Let's go down. Yes.
- Are we going down?

2009
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:18,420
Okay.

2010
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,329
When he was walking toward me,

2011
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:24,829
we made eye contact.

2012
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:26,170
I was like, "Oh, it's Jae Hyeong."

2013
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,639
I thought I should take this chance...

2014
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,770
to get to know Jae Hyeong.

2015
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,270
We wore matching clothes.

2016
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:36,440
It felt like it was planned. I liked it.

2017
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:39,909
I wanted to talk to Ji Hyeon.

2018
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:42,320
I was curious about her.

2019
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,279
The leather workshop.

2020
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,389
(Yubro)

2021
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:49,220
We can make wallets or something in here.

2022
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,920
I thought we could make the passport case.

2023
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,290
Sounds good.

2024
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:58,300
Let me tell you this before you decide.

2025
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,729
Most couples make one...

2026
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,269
for each other.

2027
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,999
- Really?
- That way, it's more meaningful.

2028
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,769
Do you trust me? Will you?

2029
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:07,809
- Sure.
- That way...

2030
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:09,080
Let's trust each other.

2031
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,210
- Let's make one for each other.
- Sounds good.

2032
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,949
- Follow the line.
- Okay.

2033
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:16,750
And make holes.

2034
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,190
Hit a little harder.

2035
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:24,559
Then flip it...

2036
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,559
and see if the blade is out. It's not, is it?

2037
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,589
- No.
- Then hit harder.

2038
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:28,960
- Hit it until it's out?
- Yes.

2039
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,500
(Unlike Jae Hyeong who's careful,)

2040
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:36,770
(Ji Hyeon doesn't hold back.)

2041
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:40,070
How come the sizes are the same?

2042
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,369
Me?

2043
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,340
Because I used the hammer at school.

2044
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:45,450
- What? Really?
- Yes.

2045
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,909
- Why?
- I'm an acting major.

2046
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:50,520
In the first year, we can't perform.

2047
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,820
We have to make the stage for the seniors.

2048
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,759
I hammered and nailed.

2049
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,460
I'm serious. Until the morning.

2050
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:01,459
You have the talent.

2051
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:03,159
What's your major again?

2052
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,260
- Robot engineering.
- Oh, right.

2053
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:08,329
Isn't robot engineering a promising industry?

2054
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:09,970
You can say that.

2055
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:13,739
How did you switch from robot engineering?

2056
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:16,480
How did working at a cafe appeal to you?

2057
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:18,779
Rather than the taste of coffee,

2058
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:21,350
people often drink coffee in the morning.

2059
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:24,550
It felt like I was making them happy...

2060
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,289
on their way to work.

2061
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:27,919
- Really?
- That's what I liked about it.

2062
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,160
- Really?
- Yes.

2063
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,489
- Really?
- Yes.

2064
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:33,060
That's really meaningful.

2065
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,330
When I told her the reason I like working at a cafe,

2066
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,499
she thought it was new.

2067
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,740
I liked how she was amazed by it.

2068
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:47,710
I liked her reaction.

2069
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,740
I found her more charming.

2070
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:53,479
Give me the end of the thread. I'll hold it.

2071
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,480
Okay.

2072
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:58,550
- About this much?
- It's long. Maybe...

2073
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:00,090
here?

2074
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:07,560
This is the hardest part.

2075
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:09,500
That's the Gyeongsang Province dialect.

2076
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,899
- I'm from Seoul.
- Really?

2077
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:12,900
Yes.

2078
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,500
That's a big misunderstanding.

2079
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,639
I didn't live in Korea when I was young.

2080
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,439
- Really?
- I went to elementary school...

2081
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,639
in China.

2082
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:21,739
Really?

2083
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:23,610
My friends were from outside the city.

2084
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,949
I guess I was influenced by them.

2085
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:27,409
How many years did you live in China?

2086
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:29,419
- Seven years.
- That's a long time.

2087
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:32,720
I was there for a long time. I went to elementary school there.

2088
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:36,360
(Learning new information about Jae Hyeong)

2089
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,860
You spent a few days at the House before I arrived.

2090
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:43,130
Was there anyone you liked aside from your ex?

2091
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:47,399
There was.

2092
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,630
- There was?
- Yes.

2093
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,200
You said you have someone in your mind.

2094
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,510
- And your ex too.
- Yes.

2095
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:57,510
Is there room for someone else?

2096
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,010
I think so.

2097
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:04,220
I think it'll change a lot in the remaining time.

2098
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:07,090
I'm just asking, hoping for that to happen.

2099
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,430
- That's...
- Gosh.

2100
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:13,530
He's good.

2101
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:14,929
- Things are going great.
- Yes.

2102
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:16,130
- They make a good couple.
- Yes.

2103
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:20,270
When you knew it was my keyword,

2104
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:21,570
why did you request a date?

2105
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:25,470
Because I was attracted to you the most.

2106
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:29,309
I can't believe you'd say that straight up.

2107
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:30,310
Awesome.

2108
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:32,040
It's nothing to hide.

2109
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:36,180
I was curious about you. I wanted to talk to you.

2110
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,050
I see.

2111
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,250
Thanks.

2112
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,720
I became more interested in Ji Hyeon after the date.

2113
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:47,359
There's no reason to hide my feelings.

2114
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:50,200
So I expressed my feelings honestly.

2115
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:54,530
I realized he was pretty warm while talking.

2116
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:56,700
Perhaps because he lived abroad for a long time,

2117
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,240
unlike typical Koreans,

2118
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,570
he's pretty bold.

2119
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:02,910
He's honest...

2120
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:06,080
and confident.

2121
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,610
I liked it.

2122
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,449
It's not bad.

2123
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,619
- Really?
- I'm happy with it.

2124
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,319
It looks somewhat defective.

2125
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,320
(A passport case with a flaw is made.)

2126
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:16,990
Look at it with contacts off, right?

2127
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,919
- Here you are.
- It looks nice in front.

2128
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,759
Oh, this is so nice.

2129
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:21,790
You did well.

2130
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:24,229
(They built memories.)

2131
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:25,870
I like it. Good job.

2132
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,100
- Do you want to go eat?
- Sounds good.

2133
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,970
(Magnettt)

2134
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:38,439
I was expecting to talk casually by the time I joined.

2135
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,510
No.

2136
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:41,810
I want to drop the honorifics,

2137
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:46,090
but it's awkward to say, "Let's drop it. Okay."

2138
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:47,850
I prefer dropping the honorifics.

2139
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,489
- It doesn't matter.
- Really?

2140
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:50,859
Whatever the other person likes.

2141
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:52,220
Drop the honorifics then.

2142
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,460
Sure. Let's do that.

2143
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,030
- Okay.
- Okay.

2144
01:43:57,630 --> 01:44:01,100
I think whoever I go on a date with,

2145
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,900
I wouldn't be as nervous as our date today.

2146
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:07,610
- Why?
- Because you have that impression.

2147
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:10,210
You looked elegant.

2148
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,710
I knew you'd be bright,

2149
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,720
but when I first saw you,

2150
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,420
you looked elegant...

2151
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:21,390
and graceful.

2152
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:23,259
Are you saying I'm not?

2153
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,759
But after spending a day with you,

2154
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:26,229
you're easy to talk to.

2155
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:27,859
Is that a good thing?

2156
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:28,890
It's a good thing.

2157
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:33,929
When I said I'm a handful, you said you felt guilty.

2158
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:34,970
Yes.

2159
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:36,699
I'm quite a handful.

2160
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,900
I try not to be.

2161
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:40,910
I like taking care of others.

2162
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,880
It's nice to be taken care of too.

2163
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:44,910
Right.

2164
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:48,750
Thank you.

2165
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,990
My goodness.

2166
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,160
Thank you.

2167
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:03,829
- It's good.
- Is it good?

2168
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:04,830
Yes.

2169
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:11,600
Can I get any information...

2170
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:14,440
on the type of person you like?

2171
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:19,850
I tend to take the lead,

2172
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,950
but I like someone who leads me.

2173
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:25,789
- What do you...
- Someone who leads me...

2174
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:26,920
when I like taking the lead.

2175
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,190
Someone who's more leading than you?

2176
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:32,320
Not someone who leads me because he's leading.

2177
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:33,990
It was more like...

2178
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,629
they knew me well.

2179
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:38,660
I see.

2180
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,030
I see.

2181
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,840
So...

2182
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:47,140
to find the person attractive,

2183
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:51,380
a moderate tension is necessary when we're alone.

2184
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:54,050
- That's what I think.
- It's true.

2185
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:58,280
What about now? Is there a moderate tension?

2186
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,520
Yes.

2187
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:03,860
I'm glad to hear that.

2188
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,590
How about a toast?

2189
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:09,200
Okay.

2190
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,070
That was an awkward thing to say.

2191
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:19,940
Should I stop?

2192
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,410
I think I'm frank.

2193
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:28,810
You don't hold back.

2194
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,349
What did you think of today?

2195
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,390
Today...

2196
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,019
- I think it was new.
- New?

2197
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:39,020
And...

2198
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:41,560
unlike...

2199
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:43,230
your appearance,

2200
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,799
I got the idea about how you speak...

2201
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,640
and what you like.

2202
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,910
I feel closer than before.

2203
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:55,670
Are you curious about me?

2204
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:00,250
You keep catching me off balance.

2205
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:02,980
Don't answer me. I was just curious.

2206
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,219
You don't have to answer me. It's okay.

2207
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,650
I'm curious about your age the most.

2208
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:10,860
I'm curious about your age and your ex.

2209
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:17,199
Then can I ask you a question?

2210
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:18,230
What?

2211
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,570
It might be hard to answer.

2212
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,870
Do you think our date today...

2213
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:30,040
will contribute to...

2214
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:33,010
changing your mind?

2215
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,350
It's okay to say no.

2216
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,589
- Totally.
- Totally.

2217
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:47,989
- Totally.
- Yes.

2218
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:49,799
- Can you believe what he said?
- No one...

2219
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,299
would say no to that.

2220
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,799
"It's okay to say no."

2221
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,630
- That's the standard example.
- He's so cool.

2222
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:56,569
- And it's not pressuring.
- It's not pressuring.

2223
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:58,069
Even if she had no feelings for him, she'd get feelings for him...

2224
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:59,369
- after that.
- Exactly.

2225
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:02,639
Ji Hyeon is very shy.

2226
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,639
She looks more excited than when she was with Yoo Sik.

2227
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,679
You're right.

2228
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,049
- Jae Hyeong...
- He hasn't even started yet.

2229
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:09,979
- No. He hasn't.
- He hasn't even started yet.

2230
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:12,349
And he clearly has feelings...

2231
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:13,590
- for Ji Hyeon.
- Yes.

2232
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:16,959
I think we can look forward to this relationship.

2233
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,860
They have my support.

2234
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:23,029
Only if I made you think,

2235
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,900
"Who is this guy?"

2236
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,840
Everything that happened in the last few days while I wasn't here...

2237
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,410
is up to me to deal with.

2238
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:35,270
It can't be helped.

2239
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:37,310
You don't need to worry about that.

2240
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:39,949
You just need to follow your heart.

2241
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:41,310
Yes. I like that.

2242
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,180
"I'm going straight to you."

2243
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:46,850
"Regardless of your heart,"

2244
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:51,260
"I want to get to know you more." I think that's what he meant.

2245
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,590
I might be wrong.

2246
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:57,160
Unlike the other residents,

2247
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:00,670
he's enthusiastic, and he doesn't hesitate to express his feelings.

2248
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,570
I thought...

2249
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:05,640
that was manly.

2250
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,470
The date was fun.

2251
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,240
I liked it even more because my date was Ji Hyeon.

2252
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,250
I'm starting to like her even more.

2253
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:17,950
(EXchange 4)

2254
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:19,650
How was your date?

2255
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:21,590
I didn't want to confuse him.

2256
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,290
Even though I went on a date with others, I have feelings for you.

2257
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:25,660
Cheers.

2258
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,500
(We don't have much time left.)

2259
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:32,360
What's your favorite brand?

2260
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:33,730
Me?

2261
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:36,070
Nothing in particular.

2262
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:39,770
Is there water?

2263
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:45,039
- There's no water.
- Do you want to grab it?

2264
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,509
- Why?
- I feel...

2265
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:49,310
(The night of confused hearts)

2266
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:56,320
The time has come.

2267
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:59,360
I had to see it to understand my heart.

2268
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:02,329
It's time to face the time...

2269
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:04,330
we've spent together.

2270
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,000
(I was scared.)
