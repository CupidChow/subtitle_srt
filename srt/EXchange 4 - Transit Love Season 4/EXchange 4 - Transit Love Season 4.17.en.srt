1
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,689
Today, we have...

2
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,459
two hip-hop warriors.

3
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,660
"Hip-hop warriors."

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,859
- Nice to meet you.
- They're my hip-hop brothers.

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,929
We have CODE KUNST and Loco.

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,299
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,469
Isn't he a veteran MC...

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,910
- of reality dating shows?
- He's a veteran.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,769
I enjoy observing people.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,709
- I'm the master of observation.
- The master of observation. Right.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,710
Right.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,209
Was there a moment you were completely absorbed?

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,680
The moment I remember is when Baek Hyun...

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,150
cried at the end.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
- When he wailed.
- Right.

16
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:55,219
He was like a wolf crying in a cave.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,220
- Right.
- A wolf crying in a cave.

18
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,559
He couldn't contain it.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,419
- He was pouring it out.
- Right. I remember that moment.

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,159
I remember the moment when Jae Hyeong and Yun Nyeong...

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,159
cried while talking about the time...

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,629
- when he was in the military.
- Yes.

23
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,069
- I recently got discharged.
- Right.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,070
- It somehow...
- Right.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,669
- reminded me of that time.
- You could relate.

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,140
I used to write letters every day when I was in the military.

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,009
I even wrote them...

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,139
to my ex-girlfriend.

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,079
- Letters you didn't send?
- I never sent them.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,779
I couldn't send them because we had broken up.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,150
But I felt lonely.

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,519
That doesn't suit you.

33
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,319
- You just made that up.
- That's so bittersweet.

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,349
- What?
- There's no way we can check.

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,419
- Do you have the letters?
- "You just made that up."

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,559
I'll take pictures and send them to you later.

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,719
You have to show me.

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,230
It's called the notes of Private First Class Jo.

39
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,490
Really?

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,510
(Kamakura Station)

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,830
(Morning came once again to the seaside town.)

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,630
(Purple Room, Min Kyung and Yun Nyeong's room)

43
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,200
(Yun Nyeong with 3 dates got up 1st.)

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,779
Yun Nyeong.

45
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes?

46
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,080
Did you call me?

47
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,750
Let's talk while you get ready.

48
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,419
- You want us to talk?
- Yes.

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,949
- Aren't you sleepy?
- I'm not.

50
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,020
Okay. I'd like that.

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,130
You came back early last night.

52
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,500
There was no one to complain to.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,370
You had no one to complain to?

54
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,099
So I was more snappy to my ex.

55
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
You were?

56
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,470
You don't like that?

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,810
I don't want him to see that side of me.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,539
You don't want him to see that.

59
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,149
Me being snappy.

60
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,179
(It bothers her that she kept being snappy.)

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,210
Right.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,979
Yoo Sik would also know...

63
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,020
why you were snappy.

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,590
He met you for nine years.

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,529
But I really understand...

66
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,660
how you feel.

67
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,330
No.

68
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,640
I keep crying in bed.

69
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,180
(Tears keep coming.)

70
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,610
I'll ask him casually.

71
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,780
I think he'd feel uncomfortable.

72
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,849
- I can...
- You can just...

73
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,360
talk to him comfortably...

74
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,429
and eat something nice. That's what I want.

75
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,270
Even when we talked,

76
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,540
he seemed to be having a hard time already.

77
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,870
Last night?

78
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,009
I can understand.

79
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,310
(She's only thinking about her ex since morning.)

80
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,380
(Communal area)

81
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,950
(Ji Yeon is the only one without a date today.)

82
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,690
- Did you sleep well?
- What?

83
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,220
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

84
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,189
Did you drink a lot?

85
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,289
(Won Kyu came to Ji Yeon who is eating alone.)

86
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,559
- Three glasses.
- You're lying.

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,990
- It's true. Yes.
- Three glasses of whiskey?

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,000
- Did you buy this yesterday?
- Yes.

89
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,070
We should have gone to eat the yakiniku.

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,050
I don't even know what we're eating.

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,880
Go and eat something nice.

92
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,390
In the end, we couldn't go out on a date.

93
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,930
I felt bad about that.

94
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,090
I didn't feel so good.

95
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,929
Did you talk well yesterday?

96
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,970
I did. It wasn't a deep conversation, though.

97
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,670
It was a light talk.

98
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,910
A light talk? But it took quite a while.

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,240
I wanted to go upstairs,

100
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,250
but Baek Hyun was talking.

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,250
You had a long talk.

102
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,859
It started from why she made such a decision...

103
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,059
I didn't know you were in the room next door.

104
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,630
- Min Kyung is here.
- Hi!

105
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,929
- How pretty.
- Hi.

106
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,800
- Talk to you later.
- Talk to you later.

107
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,699
- See you.
- Have a nice time.

108
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,300
- You look so pretty.
- Talk to you later.

109
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,420
It's so beautiful.

110
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,919
(Min Kyung and Won Kyu's pick-a-date)

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,190
It's pretty.

112
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,090
- You're hungry, aren't you?
- So much.

113
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,690
I'll drink as well.

114
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,630
- What?
- Can we drink alcohol?

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
I want to drink alcohol.

116
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,729
That's understandable for you.

117
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,799
It's so nice. "For me?" It's the same for you too.

118
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
That's right. Let's drink.

119
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,770
- I love this.
- I'm drinking day and night.

120
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,609
We talked a bit...

121
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,109
after we became comfortable with each other.

122
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,479
- But...
- You're comfortable with me, right?

123
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,609
I'm really comfortable with you now.

124
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,050
You seemed uncomfortable right after our ages were revealed.

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,619
It's my first time meeting someone like you.

126
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,190
- The gap?
- The gap. It's because...

127
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,889
I had people introducing people to me...

128
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,399
or people who gave me their numbers.

129
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,659
- Of course.
- So our age gap...

130
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,899
was like 1 to 3 years apart.

131
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,370
We were almost agemates.

132
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,300
It's my 1st time meeting someone who is 8 years older.

133
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,739
It means you were 20 when I was 12.

134
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,039
Don't talk about that.

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,840
(The guy who is 8 years older feels annoyed.)

136
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,749
I was eating things like Amino Cool...

137
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,579
in elementary school,

138
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,950
and you were on group blind dates when you were 20.

139
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,350
- I'm joking.
- That's right.

140
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,460
So our roommates were each other's exes.

141
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,890
That's right.

142
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,959
I had a nice time with Ji Hyeon.

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,030
I had a nice time,

144
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,070
but I somehow felt uncomfortable.

145
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,570
Of course.

146
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,269
I had a lot of feelings for my ex,

147
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,980
and I had been with him for many years.

148
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,349
But my roommates...

149
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,380
seemed to like my ex.

150
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,480
Of course, you would have had a hard time.

151
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,650
You had a lot of feelings for your ex.

152
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,889
I don't think I had a single day when I felt comfortable.

153
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,060
Of course.

154
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,030
It's a proper meal.

155
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,760
Right. I'm having a proper meal.

156
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,830
Try to eat as much as you can.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,069
Why is everyone saying that?

158
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,169
I eat well.

159
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,599
I've never seen you eat well.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,840
- Really?
- Really.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,670
Thank you for the food.

162
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,480
The weather is so nice. It's breezy.

163
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,610
Is it good?

164
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,220
It's good.

165
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,020
We'd empty the plates today.

166
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,420
- We would.
- Seriously.

167
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,190
I want you to talk to him today or tomorrow.

168
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,390
It's not like...

169
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,100
he's decided on anyone.

170
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,470
But he's going on a date with Hyeon Ji.

171
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,870
Wouldn't it be okay for you to approach him more?

172
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,500
It's not like he has a certain mind...

173
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,140
that he's sticking to.

174
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,179
"Why can't I seem to see his honest feelings?"

175
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,579
That's what I think.

176
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,550
(Min Kyung doesn't know Yoo Sik's honest feeling.)

177
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,320
I don't know.

178
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,660
We both have great pride.

179
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,860
It seems like nobody here has a weak ego.

180
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,300
But we still do it.

181
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,099
Isn't it better to talk about it?

182
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,340
- It feels so good.
- Right?

183
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,610
- I had a good meal.
- I had a good meal.

184
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,180
- I really ate well.
- I really ate well.

185
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,580
I'm so full.

186
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,780
In the end, of course...

187
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,250
- Something always happens.
- I always hit something.

188
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,490
We're a pair that causes trouble.

189
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,589
What?

190
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,729
Why does something always happen to his head...

191
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,960
- whenever he's with Min Kyung?
- I know, right?

192
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,639
With all the exes revealed,

193
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,439
you can see that people have almost made their minds up.

194
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,769
They get some time to openly talk about things.

195
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,209
- I know.
- It's a relief.

196
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,209
- It could be a healing time.
- To anyone.

197
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,849
- It's nice but also not nice.
- Not nice.

198
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,510
Still, I think you'd feel better talking to someone like that.

199
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,159
(Sung Baek Hyun)

200
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,959
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

201

(Kim Woo Jin)

206

(Kwak Min Kyung)

207

(Jung Won Kyu)

208

(Hong Ji Yeon)

209
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,280
(Shin Seung Yong)

210
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,360
(EXchange 4)

211
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,130
(Episode 17: A Way to Keep You With Me)

212
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,799
Let's go.

213
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,170
- Shall we go?
- Shall we go?

214
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,100
Let's go for a healing camp.

215
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,240
- Why is it a healing camp with me?
- Why not?

216
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,510
(Observing)

217
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,820
Isn't that the finger for a couple ring?

218
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,480
We made it yesterday.

219
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,750
Really? Rings?

220
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
(Yoo Sik wore the ring he made with Hyeon Ji yesterday.)

221
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,090
- Is it good?
- Really? You made rings?

222
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,489
It looks so pretty.

223
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,930
- Did you make it for each other?
- Yes.

224
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,770
- It's amazing.
- You react so well.

225
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,740
It's pretty.

226
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,739
- I made it better.
- Really?

227
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,840
- You can look at it later.
- Okay.

228
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,810
How long does it take?

229
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,239
Thirty minutes.

230
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
(Yun Nyeong and Yoo Sik's pick-a-date)

231
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,179
Did you try to get to know other people?

232
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,389
- Me? I was very careful.
- Yes.

233
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,759
- At first.
- I hadn't opened up when I came.

234
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,089
You were thinking about getting back with her.

235
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,029
Yes. I hadn't opened my mind when I came here.

236
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,200
So I opened up really late.

237
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,270
I thought it would be right to say something...

238
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,570
when I was sure.

239
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,570
I could have opened up 100 percent...

240
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,980
just because I was a little curious and liked the person,

241
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,450
but it might turn out to not work.

242
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,520
You don't have to say 100 percent of your feelings.

243
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,480
So I talked about it recently.

244
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,359
I told her I was done organising my thoughts.

245
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,689
- Really?
- Yes.

246
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,530
- To the person you liked?
- Yes.

247
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,730
We met each other for a very long time.

248
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,300
We never had a breakup over that long period.

249
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,570
That's so cool.

250
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,839
There was a reason why we didn't break up.

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,909
I also thought there was a reason why people...

252
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,310
who never had a breakup over those years broke up.

253
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,610
That thought came to me.

254
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,480
The reason was that the situation didn't get better,

255
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,619
and I didn't see us...

256
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,050
make an effort to make it better.

257
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,720
So I thought, "Is this something..."

258
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,220
"I could overlook for us to get back together?"

259
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,500
We're on a date.

260
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,970
We're on a date.

261
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,599
We can talk about these things even if we're on a date.

262
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
- We can.
- Yes.

263
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,750
(Namihei, Kamakura)

264
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,759
- Yoo Sik.
- Seriously.

265
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,959
I'm so happy.

266
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,130
- It looks so good.
- Let's eat.

267
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,829
- Let's eat.
- I don't know where to start.

268
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,530
- I'll eat the sashimi first.
- Me too.

269
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,770
- Is it good?
- It melts.

270
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,170
It's so good.

271
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,610
It's good, right?

272
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,650
What kind of person did you say you like?

273
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
Someone very honest.

274
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,050
An honest person?

275
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,350
Someone honest.

276
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,620
Someone I can learn from as well.

277
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,500
Before Hyeon Ji came...

278
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,399
Why do you have such a serious face?

279
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,500
Nothing. Before Hyeon Ji came?

280
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,669
I had a date with Hyeon Ji.

281
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,669
With Hyeon Ji? I didn't know.

282
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,340
- Really?
- I don't notice things so well.

283
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,610
I had no idea.

284
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,610
That's why you liked her.

285
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,180
- Me?
- Yes.

286
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,780
At first,

287
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,389
I wanted to help her...

288
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,720
get along well.

289
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,319
I had no idea.

290
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,730
But we went...

291
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,630
on dates the most as well.

292
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,830
I think she's the most honest person.

293
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,969
- That's why.
- That's why you felt attracted.

294
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,040
That's right.

295
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,080
So you went on a date with her for two days.

296
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,510
Yes.

297
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,120
For six days.

298
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,749
Ever since we were in Seoul.

299
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,790
Really?

300
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,589
- My hunches are so bad.
- Why?

301
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,789
I thought you were doing well with someone else.

302
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,830
Until when?

303
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,400
Up until we came here.

304
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,170
- Here? Japan?
- Yes. Japan.

305
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,670
Really?

306
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,540
(Yun Nyeong thought Yoo Sik and Ji Hyeon were getting along well.)

307
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm a little...

308
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,280
Do I have indigestion?

309
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,210
What is this?

310
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,580
This is funny.

311
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,320
I really had a great meal.

312
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,619
You're busy. You can leave now.

313
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,950
This busy girl has to go now.

314
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Shall we do this?

315
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,019
- Bye.
- Bye.

316
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,030
Bye.

317
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,660
Yun Nyeong is leaving for another date.

318
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,769
- She has three dates.
- She has three dates.

319
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,639
How come Yoo Sik's skin looks so good?

320
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,799
Yoo Sik's skin is getting better.

321
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,639
It seems that they...

322
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,209
are in contrasting conditions,

323
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,239
- which makes me sad.
- Yoo Sik's skin is getting better.

324
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
- His look got better as well.
- His face...

325
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:36,539
- is lighting up.
- Min Kyung is the opposite.

326
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,750
- He's elaborate.
- Right.

327
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,349
But I think he'll return to Min Kyung after all.

328
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,379
- I know.
- Really?

329
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,749
- I get the same feeling.
- That's how I feel.

330
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,249
- I think he'll never go back.
- He'll end up...

331
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,519
- going back.
- Why?

332
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,489
That's just the feeling I get. My intuition.

333
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,660
I have the same feeling. I don't know why.

334
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,329
I think this kind of date...

335
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,729
is very nice because of this.

336
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,629
Let's say I date someone I'm not interested in.

337
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,669
However, if there's someone else...

338
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,699
who keeps coming to my mind,

339
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,899
her presence in my heart...

340
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,299
- will get bigger and bigger.
- Right.

341
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,569
I have a feeling that Min Kyung's presence will grow.

342
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,439
On average, men realise things...

343
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,539
- a bit later.
- Later. You're right.

344
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,210
I think Yoo Sik cares about Min Kyung very much,

345
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,779
but he's completely fallen for Hyeon Ji.

346
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,119
- His heart has. I see.
- Right.

347
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,189
I really think...

348
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,289
I feel like his feelings for Hyeon Ji...

349
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,220
- might suddenly take a sharp turn.
- At the end?

350
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,520
That's what I feel.

351
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,230
(Kamakura House)

352
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,300
(Yoo Sik came back alone and fell asleep in the communal living room.)

353
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,039
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

354
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,110
(Min Kyung and Won Kyu came back after the date.)

355
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,980
(Won Kyu goes to his room first.)

356
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
What?

357
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,760
(Min Kyung carefully moves so she won't startle him.)

358
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Gosh.

359
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,430
(The tears she had been holding back finally start to fall.)

360
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,510
(Sighing deeply)

361
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,110
We were not much different from how we were before,

362
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,070
and we were resting there.

363
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,139
I wondered how things turned out like this...

364
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,150
and thought we were not supposed to be this way.

365
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,590
So that made me feel sad.

366
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,700
(Min Kyung left the seat next to Yoo Sik quietly.)

367
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,110
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh, my!

368
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,680
Oh, my.

369
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,319
Rather than a scene of sobbing in tears,

370
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,219
that scene made my heart ache even more.

371
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,289
- She left in silence.
- When you can't explain...

372
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,389
the emotion in a scene, that feels sadder.

373
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,459
You're right. That's...

374
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,019
Staying by his side while he didn't realise it and left, that's so...

375
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,029
I know.

376
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,629
When Yoo Sik is asleep, that's the only moment...

377
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,999
she can stay by his side comfortably. That must be sad.

378
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,629
He must have slept on her lap...

379
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,829
- when they were dating, - Right.

380
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,069
- but now...
- She can't even touch him.

381
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,869
although he's right next to her, she can't hold his hand.

382
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,209
She feels that he is so distant.

383
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,940
That would really break her heart.

384
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,650
(Yokohama)

385
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,020
(Hyeon Ji and Jae Hyeong's pick-a-date)

386
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,350
It's been a long while since I went to a place like this.

387
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,620
How do you feel about going to an aquarium?

388
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,190
Going to an aquarium? I like that.

389
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,790
My mood is lifting.

390
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,170
(Sea Paradise, Hakkeijima)

391
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,700
I can't wait to go in.

392
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,270
- Are you curious?
- Yes.

393
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,870
I'm so excited.

394
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,670
What do you want to see the most?

395
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,579
It starts from here.

396
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
That's right.

397
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,780
- It's really big.
- This one looks very interesting.

398
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,279
- Oh, my. It's beautiful.
- This is amazing.

399
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,480
Look at its tail.

400
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,780
- So many interesting creatures.
- I'm amazed.

401
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,320
- This one looks pretty.
- It's moving.

402
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,890
- You mean the clown fish?
- Yes.

403
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,130
How come I'm so amazed and pleasant?

404
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm just watching fish.

405
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,960
Look at this fish's lips sticking way out.

406
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,470
I guess it's angry at something.

407
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,169
Doesn’t it look like my hands will pass right through if I touch them?

408
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,200
- Right?
- Yes.

409
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,640
- They look like flowers, too.
- Flowers.

410
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,579
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

411
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
They're focused on something.

412
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:11,710
What are they looking at?

413
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,050
I think they gathered for a meeting.

414
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,220
- What are they doing?
- What are they doing?

415
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,590
That one's walking in earnest.

416
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,820
They're in different colours. There's a gold one.

417
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,360
- It slipped.
- It slipped.

418
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,030
- It's coming here.
- Here it comes.

419
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,169
Look at its feet. Isn't that amazing?

420
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,440
- Those look like flippers.
- Like flippers.

421
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,039
What?

422
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,270
(They said the same thing again at the same moment.)

423
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,109
Do they want to go out?

424
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,510
(Taking photos of the penguins, he turns the camera toward Hyeon Ji.)

425
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,120
(Hyeon Ji photographed by Jae Hyeong)

426
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,719
It smells like the sea.

427
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,290
I know. It smells like the sea.

428
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,160
It really feels like I'm under the sea.

429
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,500
It's so beautiful.

430
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,230
- Isn't it so beautiful?
- It is.

431
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,400
(Amazed)

432
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,069
This is really amazing. It's magical.

433
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,070
Right.

434
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,540
When I talk with Jae Hyeong, it feels so comfortable.

435
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,009
Jae Hyeong also told me...

436
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,680
that he didn't realise I was this talkative before.

437
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,190
She's not overly high-energy in a way that overwhelms me.

438
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,519
But she's not low-energy in a way that feels burdensome, either.

439
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,290
I feel Hyeon Ji's energy level is just right,

440
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,630
and she has a comfortable vibe.

441
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,900
Rather than a romantic kind of excitement,

442
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,100
I felt human comfort more in the date.

443
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,269
Even if he swapped his ears with CODE KUNST, no one would notice.

444
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,640
He's the same species as you.

445
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,039
I know what you mean.

446
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
He looks like a revised edition of me.

447
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,639
What? A revised edition?

448
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,349
He's an upgraded version.

449
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,349
I heard those ears are in trend these days.

450
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,019
The thing is, I don't feel like I'm benefited...

451
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,450
from the trend.

452
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,790
I think I should.

453
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,120
Let's get off.

454
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,429
(Jae Hyeong and Hyeon Ji came back after the date.)

455
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,490
It feels cold.

456
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,800
Who are they?

457
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,839
They're Won Kyu and Yoo Sik.

458
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,970
Ji Yeon is wearing a similar outfit to ours today.

459
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,109
(Hyeon Ji came to Yoo Sik right away.)

460
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,139
Hello, Hyeon Ji.

461
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,939
- Hi.
- Have a seat here.

462
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,780
- What are you doing here?
- We drank during the day.

463
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,009
We were drinking in the daytime.

464
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,010
In the daytime?

465
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:28,779
Are you back right after the meal?

466
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,479
- We went to an aquarium...
- Really?

467
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,489
- Yes.
- An aquarium?

468
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,719
- What's going on?
- What are we, really?

469
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Why?

470
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:35,520
I just gave a ride.

471
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,719
- You had a meal, - I'm the one who went out early,

472
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,859
- and he only had a meal.
- gave a ride, and came back.

473
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,990
Were you disappointed?

474
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,060
- Why did you go out?
- Baek Hyun could take my time.

475
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,130
So why did the date proceed fast?

476
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,370
Do you want me to give you that monkey?

477
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,009
I have something to bring him.

478
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,469
May I go to my room for a moment?

479
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,509
You can give it to me later.

480
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,740
- Later?
- Yes.

481
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,650
I'm afraid I might forget. You like it very much.

482
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,720
Are you doing this to give them space?

483
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,249
Come on. You don't have to.

484
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,290
- Hold on.
- What are you saying?

485
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,560
Are you saying you want to stay in your room?

486
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,059
I'll go to my room and give it to you.

487
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,730
I see. You don't have to get mad at me.

488
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,259
You want me to come with you?

489
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,559
Just come with me.

490
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,430
Do not argue.

491
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,600
- Why am I being scolded now?
- Go with her.

492
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,339
- Why are you so clueless?
- If it's just the two of them,

493
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,370
- it might feel uncomfortable.
- No.

494
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,180
I woke up after 10am today.

495
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,320
I saw you talking until late.

496
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,690
It just didn't end.

497
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,620
Every time I start a conversation at night, it doesn't end.

498
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,660
I shouldn't start a conversation at night, in the first place.

499
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,530
That made me go to bed early last night.

500
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,730
I wanted to go to bed early.

501
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,900
Don't mind anything, and just listen to me.

502
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,480
You could have just sent a text to Baek Hyun.

503
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,409
Why didn't you do that?

504
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,449
(He's curious why she never sent a text to Baek Hyun.)

505
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,179
Sending a text to someone I feel thankful for a day...

506
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,419
and sending a text to Baek Hyun...

507
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,390
have different senses of responsibility.

508
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,229
After having a conversation with him...

509
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,660
and getting confident about getting back together, then...

510
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,630
- Then you'd text him?
- I'd express it, I thought.

511
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,970
But our conversation didn't work out all the time.

512
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,899
At first, Baek Hyun was in the first place in my mind, for sure.

513
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,639
The one I wanted to date was Baek Hyun.

514
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,370
However, after dating you,

515
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,610
I liked you.

516
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,550
So I kept texting you.

517
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,050
I was really trying to keep a straight face.

518
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,890
(He ended up laughing at her straightforward remark.)

519
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,830
I was just curious.

520
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,300
Seeing you having a conversation a lot all the time,

521
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,630
I felt you still had feelings for him.

522
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,370
Something I was curious about was resolved.

523
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,270
The moment we were talking honestly...

524
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,680
was very...

525
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
nice.

526
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,620
I knew I'd come back early anyway.

527
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,349
Did you plan to go out alone?

528
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,020
No, I planned to go out with you.

529
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,220
I'm going to say I'd go out really far tomorrow.

530
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,730
Tokyo?

531
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:29,230
Yes, I’ll ask if I can go to the faraway sea if it's available.

532
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,969
You took off the ring right away.

533
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,300
I've been out wearing the ring.

534
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,670
I took off everything and went to sleep.

535
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,810
And I found out I had no watch, and I wore it for convenience.

536
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,640
Wait here.

537
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,380
I'll go and bring it.

538
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,850
(The raw honesty makes their hearts ripple.)

539
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,119
Now they have romantic excitement,

540
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,349
- became more comfortable, - I know.

541
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,719
- and more honest.
- Right.

542
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,859
So I think these two are matched for sure.

543
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,529
- What do you think, CODE KUNST?
- CODE KUNST.

544
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,329
I think his heart will turn after about four episodes.

545
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,100
You look very comfortable now.

546
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,470
(Hakone)

547
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,539
Let's go.

548
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,910
(Ji Hyeon and Seung Yong's pick-a-date)

549
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,809
During our date today, let's love each other.

550
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,910
- Good.
- Okay.

551
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,380
(Craft House, Hakone)

552
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,219
- It's so amazing.
- It's true.

553
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,519
(Here, you can craft an artwork using glass.)

554
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,790
- It's cute.
- This one's so cute.

555
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,660
(Seung Yong ties up the apron for Ji Hyeon.)

556
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,170
I'll tie yours.

557
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,910
- Do you want a ribbon?
- Yes.

558
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,070
Do it as a ribbon, please.

559
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,180
This is so cute.

560
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,750
I feel like a hip-hop rapper in the 1990s.

561
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,089
Why does a dermatologist have biceps like that?

562
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,989
I know. Does he use a syringe this big?

563
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,059
When the veins in his arms pop out like that...

564
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,060
- He can pop out every pimple.
- Those biceps.

565
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,460
He'll remove all the pimples if he uses his arms enough.

566
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,729
Those biceps can do that.

567
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,129
He can get rid of the acne completely.

568
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,769
He can get rid of it with his biceps.

569
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,569
- His triceps are good, too.
- They're great.

570
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,700
His triceps, goodness.

571
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,910
Which one will go first?

572
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,009
- Which of us will go first?
- Which one first?

573
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,779
- Me?
- Okay.

574
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,480
Please sit down here.

575
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,380
Oh, my gosh.

576
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,450
(She heats the glass batch before shaping it.)

577
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Okay. Thank you.

578
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,190
- It's extremely hot.
- Really?

579
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,130
Now, let's make a lump shape.

580
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,870
Please don't touch it.

581
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,500
(Seung Yong shapes the heated glass into a round form.)

582
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,640
- Sorry.
- Nice work.

583
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,940
Are you okay? Sorry.

584
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,750
I'm tearing up, suddenly.

585
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,750
You're in pain.

586
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,090
It's okay. I'm tearing up.

587
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,070
(On behalf of Seung Yong tearing up, Ji Hyeon blows it.)

588
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,700
Gosh. It got bigger.

589
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,470
- This is fun.
- I know.

590
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,740
The instructor is very professional...

591
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,450
in teaching us, right?

592
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,220
I think it's the same with you when you work.

593
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,819
I'm curious...

594
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,949
how everyone works...

595
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,520
- in their workplace.
- I know. I'm so curious.

596
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,390
Hello. So this is what you're concerned about?

597
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,130
- All right.
- This might sting a little.

598
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,059
(Playing along with the sudden role-play without batting an eye)

599
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,300
I go, "It might hurt."

600
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,530
I call attendance.

601
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,369
- In your class.
- Ji Min!

602
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,770
Let's make some shape here.

603
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,040
Okay, you start here.

604
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,439
Okay. Keep rolling.

605
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,580
How skilled are the doctor's hands?

606
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,810
You're good, as expected.

607
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,080
Seung Yong, I'll help you.

608
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,879
- This isn't easy.
- It's not, is it?

609
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,619
(Carefully syncing their breaths, they shape the glass.)

610
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,650
This one turned out nicely.

611
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,690
It's hot.

612
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,290
It's like that Jang Dong Gun meme.

613
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,460
What's this photo?

614
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,530
Isn't it funny?

615
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,130
It'll be a good memory.

616
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,700
I know. It was my first time doing something like this.

617
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,740
(Takinoya)

618
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,869
You're hungry, right?

619
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,079
Yes. How about you?

620
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,279
I'm hungry now.

621
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,080
We'll really enjoy the meal now.

622
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,309
- It's boar meat.
- Really?

623
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,780
- Yes. Boar meat.
- Boar and deer meat.

624
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,350
Shall we give it a go?

625
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,490
Let's do that.

626
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,549
It suddenly feels so fascinating.

627
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,790
- What do you mean?
- It's just that...

628
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,829
you were a total stranger.

629
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,790
- But we suddenly came to Japan.
- We came to Japan together.

630
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,630
You're right.

631
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,370
- Where else would we eat boar meat?
- I know.

632
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,140
Among the dates you've had so far, which one was the most memorable?

633
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,640
- The haunted house.
- I was going to say that.

634
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,980
Seriously, it was so...

635
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:12,909
It was bound to be memorable.

636
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,320
- It was so intense.
- Seriously.

637
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,490
In that scary situation, you were the only one I could depend on.

638
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,990
I felt conflicted.

639
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,789
When a couple goes to a haunted house,

640
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,989
- the man is supposed to protect.
- "Ji Hyeon, follow me."

641
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,889
But I was so scared that I stayed close to the wall...

642
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,059
and said, "Hold on a second."

643
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,460
Seriously, it was so scary.

644
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,870
Both of us were so...

645
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,200
We overcame that.

646
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
I know.

647
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,940
(As they reminisce about the good memory they share)

648
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,940
- I've never seen boar meat before.
- I know.

649
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,450
It looks so tasty.

650
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,650
The smell is insane.

651
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,550
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

652
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,589
(She tries a spoonful of the hot soup.)

653
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,760
Let's enjoy it.

654
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,959
Seung Yong, it's so tasty.

655
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,560
- The soup is doenjang-based.
- Yes.

656
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,830
(They try the wild boar meat they were excited about.)

657
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,269
Are you okay with the smell?

658
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,610
The gamey smell?

659
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,610
This much is okay.

660
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
- I feel happy.
- Seriously.

661
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,879
- Very much so.
- Thank you, Seung Yong.

662
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,750
Don't mention it. I should be thanking you.

663
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,020
Did you have a good day?

664
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,250
Of course.

665
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,920
I had an incredible day today.

666
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,330
Compared to staying in the house,

667
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,300
- spending time outside...
- It's much better, right?

668
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,899
makes me more stable.

669
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,670
- Really?
- And...

670
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Same here.

671
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,370
It makes me comfortable.

672
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,239
Had I entered the house from the start,

673
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,880
I would've gone on many more dates with Ji Hyeon.

674
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,780
I was a bit disappointed I couldn't do that.

675
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,580
Ji Hyeon, you have a knack...

676
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,119
for putting people at ease.

677
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Really?

678
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:03,190
I have a knack for making people uncomfortable.

679
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,060
If the two of us come together, things will be in the middle.

680
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,600
It sounds nice.

681
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,929
Seung Yong is a very nice man.

682
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,869
I actually think...

683
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,710
he's the easiest person to talk to in the house.

684
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,210
But I could feel...

685
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,810
that he had no interest in me whatsoever.

686
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,850
It can't be helped.

687
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,789
- Shall we go?
- Okay. Shall we get going?

688
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,860
Okay.

689
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,560
- It was a nice meal. Seriously.
- Seriously.

690
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,829
- Really?
- Really?

691
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,270
My goodness. Seriously.

692
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,429
I think Seung Yong has feelings for Hyeon Ji.

693
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,839
- You're right.
- He still has...

694
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,639
- unresolved feelings.
- He hasn't gotten over her.

695
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,739
He hasn't gotten over her.

696
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,469
The way she described it...

697
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,709
- I guess she could feel it.
- It was so...

698
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,739
Seriously.

699
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,479
I think Ji Hyeon is quick on those things.

700
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,610
- That's right.
- Women definitely have...

701
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,579
a hunch when it comes to those things.

702
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,719
There are things women can feel.

703
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,249
- They don't need to say it.
- That's right.

704
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,850
"This person isn't interested in me."

705
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,060
(Kamakura House)

706
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,290
What? Seung Yong.

707
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,270
(Seung Yong is back after a date.)

708
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,739
- Did you have a nice date?
- Did you have a nice date?

709
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
Yes.

710
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,740
When did you come back?

711
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,579
I came back very early.

712
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,480
- Really?
- I didn't leave the house.

713
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,540
I see.

714
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,710
- I ate natto...
- Why did the weather turn warm?

715
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,849
- You're wearing warm clothes.
- I know.

716
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,979
- Is that the reason?
- It's because you're wearing...

717
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,020
- warm clothes.
- I think so.

718
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,520
Why is everyone going out early and coming back early today?

719
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,060
At what time did you go out?

720
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,460
I went out at 12:30pm.

721
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,400
Let's talk for a second.

722
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
- What?
- Let's talk for a second.

723
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,300
(Yoo Sik comes to the common area.)

724
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,570
Have you eaten?

725
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,880
- What? Yes, I've eaten.
- Have you eaten?

726
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,750
- What is it?
- Why are you so wary?

727
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,479
Your tone was scary.

728
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,919
I just wanted to talk.

729
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,550
I see. Okay.

730
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,400
- What's this?
- What's this?

731
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,030
Haven't you had dinner?

732
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,369
Me? Of course, I haven't had dinner.

733
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,800
I just slept.

734
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,439
Didn't you go out today?

735
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,700
I did go out, but...

736
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,610
(Yoo Sik leaves the common area first.)

737
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,049
Shall we sit here?

738
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,850
I think it'll be nice to go outside.

739
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,979
- What?
- This way.

740
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,390
(Seung Yong and Hyeon Ji go to the opposite terrace.)

741
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,120
What's that handkerchief in your back pocket?

742
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,060
- What?
- Is it a pouch?

743
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,590
Oh, this? It's nothing.

744
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,100
What is it?

745
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,970
Everyone...

746
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,370
talks a lot with his or her ex.

747
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,440
- Everyone? You're right.
- Yes.

748
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,140
But I didn't get to talk to you...

749
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,910
- after that one time.
- Yes.

750
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,350
I thought, "Other people keep trying to talk to their exes."

751
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,819
"Why doesn't she want to talk to me?"

752
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,319
- "Didn't she..." - Well, I thought...

753
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,920
- "mean her words?" - we talked in the morning.

754
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,590
I felt like you had had...

755
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,390
enough thought.

756
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,360
Also,

757
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,630
why did you pick Ji Hyeon as my date?

758
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,540
- Min Kyung was my initial choice.
- Okay.

759
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,700
But I didn't pick Min Kyung...

760
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,069
because you sent a text to Ji Hyeon.

761
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,780
I figured that you had a good feeling about Ji Hyeon,

762
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,080
so I picked her.

763
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,050
Don't you get jealous?

764
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,320
Are you okay with everything?

765
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,990
To be honest, I don't know whom you're interested in.

766
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,830
I'm not interested in anyone.

767
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,359
I really don't feel much jealousy when it comes to you.

768
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,100
I just worry about you a lot.

769
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,569
If I'm being honest, I feel jealous now.

770
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,070
"Had it been me,"

771
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,079
"I would've been jealous."

772
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,240
"Doesn't she feel jealous?" I had that thought.

773
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,009
(Sighing)

774
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,150
Why are you sighing?

775
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,950
You really make me worry about you.

776
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,190
Me?

777
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,160
After some time,

778
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,430
I might fail to control my emotions and tearfully ask you to come back.

779
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,429
Seriously, I cried every day.

780
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,570
Because of Baek Hyun?

781
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,339
I was a bit shocked...

782
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,009
that he was interested in someone else.

783
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,080
Why?

784
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,439
I never thought it'd happen.

785
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,450
Why?

786
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,780
What? No one is his ideal type.

787
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,920
What's his ideal type?

788
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,390
I say it's me.

789
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,400
- Incense.
- What's this?

790
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,669
- I had time to buy something.
- Really?

791
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,870
I bought yours as I bought mine.

792
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,439
(Seung Yong bought a present for Hyeon Ji at a glass studio.)

793
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,879
- Are you going to buy two?
- Yes.

794
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
- Really?
- Yes. Why?

795
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,979
Why are you suddenly so kind?

796
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,819
I've always been kind.

797
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,120
I bought you a present when I went to India.

798
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,020
It smells nice.

799
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,660
- What are those?
- These are bracelets.

800
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,500
I bought them because they were cute.

801
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,670
They're matching bracelets.

802
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,510
Did you buy them for you and Ji Hyeon?

803
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,879
- No, 1 of them is for you.
- Is 1 of them for me?

804
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,380
But if you aren't going to wear it...

805
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,850
Let me see it.

806
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,749
Where did you go to buy something like this?

807
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,690
It was a studio. It looked pretty.

808
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,190
How are you feeling?

809
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,390
How am I feeling?

810
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,190
Honestly speaking, I was in a foul mood...

811
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,800
during my time here.

812
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,369
There were a few instances where I felt like...

813
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,200
Baek Hyun didn't respect me.

814
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,709
But when I go on a date with Yoo Sik,

815
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,180
those bad thoughts...

816
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,410
disappear.

817
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
And?

818
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,819
He'll go on a date with his ex, right?

819
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,619
I'm actually anxious.

820
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,060
I don't know how hung up he is on his ex.

821
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,030
Have you made up your mind?

822
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,460
Yoo Sik is the one I'm interested in the most.

823
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,170
Are there no lingering emotions?

824
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,740
Me? I had lingering emotions for you.

825
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,270
And?

826
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,940
I can't help but feel a certain way...

827
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,780
because I made judgments based on the behaviours I see.

828
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
Right.

829
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,450
And?

830
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,719
You know what kind of man I want.

831
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,290
I told you repeatedly.

832
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,630
A handsome and tall man?

833
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,830
No!

834
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,030
A kind man.

835
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,000
A kind and considerate man.

836
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,810
"A handsome and tall man."

837
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,710
Had I been a woman, I would've liked Yoo Sik too.

838
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,620
Yoo Sik.

839
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,220
But it won't be easy to get over a nine-year-old relationship.

840
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,390
I told Yoo Sik to talk to Min Kyung a lot...

841
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,760
because I wanted to appear cool.

842
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,600
I envy Yoo Sik.

843
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Why?

844
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,910
He stole Park Hyeon Ji's heart.

845
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,240
When I was crying my eyes out,

846
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,850
you were so heartless toward me.

847
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
I think we needed to talk more.

848
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,590
You probably acted that way because I was lacking.

849
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,560
I lack in many ways.

850
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:44,110
(The sea wind becomes strong as the sun sets.)

851
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,050
Aren't you cold?

852
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,380
I'm okay.

853
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
It's cool.

854
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,290
Aren't you going to eat dinner?

855
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,820
I don't have much appetite.

856
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,960
Shall we go inside? It's too cold.

857
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,259
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

858
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,260
Let's go inside.

859
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,800
I'll drink tea.

860
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,270
You like to drink as you wrap up the day.

861
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,780
Are you going to go upstairs?

862
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,140
No.

863
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,249
- Seung Yong wants her back, right?
- Yes.

864
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,349
- He does.
- He really does.

865
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,519
- He definitely wants Hyeon Ji back.
- He has feelings for Hyeon Ji.

866
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,489
- But Hyeon Ji is too...
- She has no interest.

867
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,519
aloof.

868
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,589
- She just wants him to do well.
- Yes.

869
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,229
- That's right.
- She received the presents...

870
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,899
in an aloof manner.

871
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,159
- Yes.
- She has no interest whatsoever.

872
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,729
She rested her head on her arm.

873
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,029
- Also, - That's right.

874
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,899
I think I know why Hyeon Ji wants Seung Yong...

875
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,870
to be kind.

876
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,609
Seung Yong's words and actions...

877
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,809
are kind,

878
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,709
but it isn't the type of kindness that comes and hugs you.

879
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,779
Does he need to think to be kind?

880
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,980
I feel like his kindness is...

881
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,989
learned.

882
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,519
- In his introduction from his ex, - That's right.

883
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,019
- he was described...
- That's right.

884
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,020
- Right.
- as "A romantic by effort."

885
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:04,489
But Yoo Sik has that quality.

886
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,389
- He has kindness from the heart.
- That's right.

887
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,599
- He was born with it.
- I think Baek Hyun has that too.

888
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,659
- Baek Hyun has it. Totally.
- Very much.

889
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,199
That's the type of kindness...

890
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,369
Hyeon Ji wants to see...

891
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,110
and feels comfortable about.

892
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I...

893
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,549
I want to talk to Yoo Sik.

894
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,890
Sure. Go and talk to him.

895
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,590
He might misunderstand.

896
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,660
- Because we talked?
- Yes.

897
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,660
I see that you're certain.

898
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,269
If he misunderstands...

899
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,370
I don't like it when it happens to me.

900
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,410
I don't like it when someone gives me mixed signals.

901
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,040
That's why I don't want to give mixed signals.

902
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,930
- Go and talk to him.
- What?

903
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,390
Have a nice talk.

904
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,360
(The emotions he suppressed in front of Hyeon Ji burst out.)

905
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,410
It put me in a foul mood.

906
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,350
I was jealous of their relationship.

907
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,720
She's interested in a guy who's younger, more handsome,

908
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,620
and kinder than I am,

909
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,060
and things are going well between them.

910
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,760
That made it hard for me to control my feelings.

911
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,679
Thinking she might truly have no intention...

912
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,279
of patching things up between us...

913
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,550
made me feel upset...

914
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,450
and sad.

915
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,829
The thought that we won't get back together...

916
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,899
and that I couldn't make her fall for me again...

917
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,200
worried me the most.

918
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,680
Where did everyone go?

919
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,620
Everyone?

920
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,650
Won Kyu went to bed.

921
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,189
- Gosh.
- Gosh. What is it?

922
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,390
Me? Seung Yong wanted to talk.

923
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,230
- Yes, I heard.
- So we did.

924
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,970
Ji Yeon told me to stop wandering around.

925
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,970
How far does the queue go?

926
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,210
You're Miss Popular right now.

927
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,480
Seung Yong was jealous of you.

928
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,720
How come, Seung Yong?

929
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,620
I want that.

930
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,089
- This? But it isn't cold.
- Yes.

931
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,360
- Should I get you a cold one?
- What's this?

932
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,760
- Mango.
- It doesn't have to be cold.

933
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,630
It's close to lukewarm.

934
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,340
(Seung Yong is still in the communal living room.)

935
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,450
(An awkward silence hangs in the air.)

936
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,690
(The two guys don't share a single word.)

937
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,830
(Sighing)

938
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,770
(He wipes the can opening with a tissue.)

939
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,280
- Aren't you cold?
- No, are you?

940
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,380
- Slightly.
- Do you want a blanket?

941
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,050
I...

942
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,820
(Yoo Sik runs over as soon as Hyeon Ji mentions being cold.)

943
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,499
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

944
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,600
What did you have?

945
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,000
I just went to a local restaurant.

946
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,970
- Local restaurant?
- Wild boar hot pot.

947
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,439
- What was it?
- Wild boar hot pot.

948
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,540
Wild boar? That sounds good.

949
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,180
I heard Ji Hyeon wasn't feeling that well today.

950
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,150
(Hyeon Ji steps back after noticing Seung Yong.)

951
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,680
Are you feeling okay?

952
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,079
- Me?
- Yes.

953
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,849
Yes, I'm fine. I went to bed earlier than I had expected last night.

954
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,460
(Bothered by Hyeon Ji waiting outside)

955
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,790
I will see you again later.

956
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,170
Please tell me if it gets too cold.

957
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,830
- It's cold, right?
- A little.

958
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,000
Should we head inside?

959
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,140
Bring it.

960
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,840
The introduction from my ex?

961
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,440
I don't really want to show mine.

962
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,540
How come?

963
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,689
What's going on right now is extremely cruel.

964
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,019
Only when you let go of your feelings for your ex...

965
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,059
can you develop feelings for someone new.

966
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,229
- Exactly.
- Yes.

967
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,789
When one person becomes happy,

968
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,059
- the other...
- Right?

969
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,800
- becomes miserable.
- It can't be helped.

970
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,729
CODE KUNST keeps saying no.

971
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,099
Isn't that changing your mind?

972
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,369
Honestly, it has changed a bit.

973
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,039
- Right?
- Has it changed?

974
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,040
Yes.

975
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,409
- It's only natural.
- We're watching to change.

976
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,540
You're totally right.

977
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,380
(Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun's pick-a-date by the ex)

978
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:16,090
After talking to Hyeon Ji that late in the night,

979
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:20,190
I was overwhelmed with unbearable feelings.

980
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,500
I wanted to tell Yun Nyeong about it.

981
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,800
We have always been cheerful,

982
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,670
but it was time for us to have a serious conversation.

983
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,430
Hey.

984
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,100
- You've put on a pretty top today.
- Right?

985
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,030
I wore all black today.

986
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,140
Nice, right?

987
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,170
- It's pretty.
- Is it?

988
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,339
- Did you wear all black?
- Yes.

989
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,540
Really?

990
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,920
- It's been half a day.
- Yes, half a day.

991
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,550
The last time we saw each other was last night.

992
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,650
Did you miss me?

993
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,900
I thought this date wouldn't happen.

994
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,830
- Why?
- Because the ex chooses the date.

995
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,170
- It's not up to us.
- Right.

996
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,300
Did you think Hyeon Ji wouldn't choose you?

997
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,210
I expected her to think carefully about it.

998
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,370
- Really?
- Yes.

999
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,710
That makes sense.

1000
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,120
Did you expect Hyeon Ji to choose me...

1001
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,590
if there came a moment when the girls picked the date?

1002
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,860
If it had to be someone other than the ex,

1003
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,260
then yes.

1004
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,000
What if she were included?

1005
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,040
I'm not entirely sure.

1006
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,770
She would've been in a dilemma.

1007
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,279
Baek Hyun has become serious right now.

1008
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,280
He's calm now.

1009
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,579
- The atmosphere is different.
- Right?

1010
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,119
- Yes.
- The vibe's different.

1011
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,650
It feels like the calm after the storm.

1012
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,790
You must be starving.

1013
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,430
It's chuck flap tail.

1014
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,370
It's good.

1015
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,470
- It's good.
- Right? It's delicious.

1016
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:47,970
To be honest,

1017
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,080
before coming to Japan,

1018
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,610
my mind...

1019
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,020
was a total mess.

1020
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,460
May I ask why?

1021
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,260
Hyeon Ji.

1022
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,830
- It's about her.
- I see.

1023
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,910
Hyeon Ji and I...

1024
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,280
- had a lot of misunderstandings.
- Right.

1025
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,450
We had upset each other badly.

1026
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,389
Spending time with you makes me really happy.

1027
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:36,390
But...

1028
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,229
I clearly felt bad for being bothered...

1029
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,429
- by Hyeon Ji, - I see.

1030
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,960
- if I'm being honest with you.
- Okay.

1031
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,200
As it kept bugging me,

1032
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,880
it's true that I couldn't focus on you solely.

1033
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,450
After a wonderful time together with you in the morning,

1034
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,320
by evening,

1035
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,029
Hyeon Ji and I would be up against each other,

1036
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,060
and misunderstandings would build up.

1037
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,030
I have ill feelings for Hyeon Ji, and being with her...

1038
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,800
wasn't pleasant.

1039
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,840
It felt like it, like how you thought about Hyeon Ji.

1040
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,679
First off, I could feel that...

1041
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,720
Hyeon Ji meant quite a lot to Baek Hyun.

1042
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,820
If Hyeon Ji shakes him up,

1043
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,790
he might even waver.

1044
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,490
That's how much she means to him.

1045
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,800
He and I have only known each other for 2 to 3 weeks,

1046
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,130
but Hyeon Ji is his ex.

1047
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,530
It did bother me.

1048
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,869
I don't know the details.

1049
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,339
- But when you talk to Seung Yong...
- Yes?

1050
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,310
or Hyeon Ji,

1051
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,780
and...

1052
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:14,390
when the exes were revealed,

1053
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,690
I was concerned about your expression,

1054
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,319
especially since you were right next to me.

1055
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,459
(First time hearing about Yun Nyeong's feelings)

1056
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,330
You seemed at a loss.

1057
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,700
You could suddenly develop feelings.

1058
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,500
Nobody knows how the feelings work.

1059
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,799
What's more, it's much more intense here.

1060
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,810
True.

1061
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,509
There's not much time left.

1062
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,709
We'll be dining together and going on dates,

1063
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,609
so I thought it'd be best to ask any questions I had, and so I did.

1064
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:43,780
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1065
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:50,020
No matter how much I try to give her certainty,

1066
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,489
this place makes it impossible.

1067
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,530
Such feelings just naturally grow.

1068
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,360
All I could think of...

1069
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,930
was showing her my certainty more and acting it out.

1070
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,610
Remember the package from the ex?

1071
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,380
What did Jae Hyeong send you?

1072
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,710
Can we talk about it?

1073
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,610
Can we not?

1074
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,850
He returned our matching ring.

1075
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,160
The one we bought with my name on it.

1076
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,789
He still had it?

1077
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,820
I guess.

1078
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,360
He had it until now?

1079
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,270
So he sent your matching ring. That's interesting.

1080
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,539
- What?
- Jae Hyeong sending the ring...

1081
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,670
No, the fact that he still had it is a shocker.

1082
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:43,539
Same here.

1083
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,439
The fact that it didn't rust is also a shocker.

1084
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,179
Was it silver or gold?

1085
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,750
Why does that matter?

1086
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,220
That doesn't really matter.

1087
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,220
I have this sort of belief.

1088
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,459
What belief?

1089
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,590
Rings...

1090
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:04,100
If I were to marry someone someday,

1091
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,870
that would be my first and last matching rings.

1092
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Really?

1093
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,910
I've never had matching rings before.

1094
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:16,940
I respect that.

1095
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,179
- Interesting.
- What is?

1096
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,980
That Jae Hyeong kept it,

1097
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,080
and that you wanted...

1098
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,350
to get them first.

1099
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,460
I don't know. I think I like getting matching rings.

1100
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,529
Have you always had one?

1101
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,590
Why do you want to know?

1102
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,730
- Why?
- Of course, I'm curious.

1103
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,299
- You said you like it.
- No comment.

1104
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,830
So I'm wondering if you always had one,

1105
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,530
and how many you had.

1106
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,370
I'm just the type who likes to make it obvious.

1107
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,280
Does that mean you've always had matching rings?

1108
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,110
Say we open your drawer. What if there are...

1109
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,120
more matching rings than coins in a piggy bank?

1110
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,020
I'll be looking out for that.

1111
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,089
Baek Hyun was being honest,

1112
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,589
- Right.
- and Yun Nyeong...

1113
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,499
was understanding. That's very praiseworthy.

1114
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,859
Rather than being upset,

1115
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,860
- I'm sure Yun Nyeong...
- Yes.

1116
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:14,629
simply felt his honesty.

1117
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,330
- Exactly.
- Yes. The more honest,

1118
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,239
- the better it is.
- Totally.

1119
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,269
Had it been me, and I had feelings for Yun Nyeong,

1120
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,039
I wouldn't have told her.

1121
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,279
- That serious talk?
- Those things?

1122
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,209
I don't think an answer is necessary,

1123
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,249
personally.

1124
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,279
It's only 2 to 3 weeks.

1125
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,349
I don't want to give her sadness, happiness,

1126
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,589
sweetness, or anything like that.

1127
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:35,989
So as not to confuse her.

1128
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,059
I'm the complete opposite.

1129
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,659
- Because he has feelings for her, - All the more...

1130
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,159
I'm sure he opened his heart to Yun Nyeong.

1131
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,659
Laying your feelings bare...

1132
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,530
is the next step...

1133
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,730
in becoming a couple.

1134
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,370
Min Kyung.

1135
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,340
- Min Kyung?
- Here, I'm in the bathroom.

1136
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,509
- Yun Nyeong.
- Hey.

1137
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,380
- How was it today?
- Today?

1138
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,020
Like talking... Hold on.

1139
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,520
Let me change into pants.

1140
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:12,159
Today? It was like...

1141
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,659
Bye after an hour of chatting,

1142
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,189
and then bye after an hour of chatting.

1143
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,190
For real?

1144
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,460
Was it all right with Yoo Sik?

1145
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,000
Yoo Sik?

1146
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,969
- Why not change first?
- Okay.

1147
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,000
(Min Kyung wants to know how Yoo Sik feels.)

1148
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,709
Have you talked to Yoo Sik today?

1149
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,610
No, not today.

1150
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,719
You see, we didn't talk about much.

1151
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,050
But I casually asked, "How are you feeling right now?"

1152
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,060
He said, "I went on many dates..."

1153
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,459
"with Hyeon Ji."

1154
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,900
"We made this, and we made that."

1155
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,229
He drove the car...

1156
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,830
on our date.

1157
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,199
When I took a glance, he was wearing a ring on the fourth finger.

1158
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,670
I asked what that was, and he said they had made it.

1159
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,909
(Sighing)

1160
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,180
I can't believe it.

1161
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,779
They made matching rings?

1162
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,480
Yes, he was wearing a matching ring.

1163
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,750
Did he say it was one?

1164
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,449
He made it with Hyeon Ji at a studio.

1165
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,650
They made one for each other.

1166
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,790
Is Yoo Sik upstairs?

1167
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,959
I don't know.

1168
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,190
I'll be back. Is that all?

1169
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,300
- Is that all he said?
- We didn't talk more.

1170
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,700
I'll be back.

1171
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,830
Thank you.

1172
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,840
(Sighing)

1173
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,850
Yoo Sik.

1174
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,680
Yoo Sik.

1175
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,089
Is Yoo Sik here?

1176
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,120
(Yoo Sik isn't in his room.)

1177
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,870
(Intuitively, she heads to Hyeon Ji's room.)

1178
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,979
Who is it?

1179
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,580
- Hyeon Ji.
- Yes?

1180
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,950
Who are you with?

1181
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,580
- I think it's Min Kyung.
- Just tell her.

1182
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,520
I'm with Yoo Sik.

1183
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,520
Can you open the door, please?

1184
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,260
- He's inside.
- Yoo Sik? Are you with him?

1185
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,929
- Yoo Sik.
- Yes?

1186
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,230
Can I talk to you?

1187
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,400
- Here?
- No, outside.

1188
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,010
Hyeon Ji, I'm sorry. I need to talk to him.

1189
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,890
- Gosh, this is...
- Oh, no.

1190
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,589
I have never seen Min Kyung...

1191
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,259
- Me neither.
- like that before.

1192
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,629
Couple rings mean something different.

1193
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,029
- Rings are different.
- They're different.

1194
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,370
He's in trouble.

1195
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:13,570
(Blue Room, Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

1196
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,710
What were you two talking about?

1197
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,510
- About...
- What were you talking about?

1198
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,850
- Just...
- The two of you.

1199
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,380
- Show me your hand.
- Why?

1200
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,590
Couple rings?

1201
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:33,860
Couple rings?

1202
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,400
(Couple rings?)

1203
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,500
Why is the air conditioner set so high?

1204
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,840
Use this blanket.

1205
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,150
Are you two wearing couple rings?

1206
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,119
We made them at the studio.

1207
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,920
So you're wearing couple rings with her?

1208
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,590
In my presence?

1209
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,090
You made couple rings with Hyeon Ji.

1210
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,530
Yes, we made them.

1211
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,330
Why did you do that?

1212
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,370
Are you that sure about her?

1213
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,610
Am I the same as someone you've been seeing for a week?

1214
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,510
- Of course not.
- Then...

1215
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,479
how could you wear couple rings with her?

1216
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,850
You don't wear rings.

1217
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,380
You don't ever wear rings.

1218
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,020
You don't like wearing accessories.

1219
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,860
But you're wearing a couple ring?

1220
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,750
It's not that I don't care about you.

1221
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,350
How could you say that to me?

1222
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,660
You're really harsh.

1223
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,790
Don't you understand why I'm acting like this now?

1224
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,030
Why do you hate me?

1225
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,400
I don't hate you.

1226
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,009
We never broke up in the past.

1227
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:32,040
Isn't there a reason why we broke up this time?

1228
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:34,110
What do you think the reason is?

1229
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,909
The future that we envision for ourselves is different.

1230
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,350
What kind of future do you envision?

1231
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:43,820
You said that my priority wasn't you.

1232
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,330
That wasn't what bothered me.

1233
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,260
I just didn't like being neglected by you.

1234
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,000
I don't want to get back with you 100 percent.

1235
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,140
I don't want to get back with you 100 percent.

1236
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,180
It's not 100 percent.

1237
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,510
Then your feelings for someone else must be stronger.

1238
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:09,910
For now, they are.

1239
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,050
What do you mean "for now?"

1240
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,380
It's the case now.

1241
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,219
I don't particularly want to get back with you.

1242
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,490
I don't want to.

1243
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,960
You don't want to?

1244
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,970
Even if we get back together,

1245
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,300
I know that we'll break up again for the same reason.

1246
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,740
You have no intention to change that?

1247
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,310
You said, "Shouldn't you give up?"

1248
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,180
Don't you remember?

1249
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,580
I remember.

1250
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,520
I never felt that I had to give up something.

1251
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,360
You have no intention to change your mind.

1252
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,800
Let's not care about each other for a while.

1253
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,240
What do you mean?

1254
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,939
Let's imagine that we are apart...

1255
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,509
and not care about each other.

1256
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,010
If we still think about each other...

1257
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,320
- We don't have much time left.
- I know.

1258
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,989
So stop pouring out your heart on me.

1259
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,320
It only makes me have bad feelings about you.

1260
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,429
So don't...

1261
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,960
I understand completely how you feel.

1262
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,070
I'll take a step back and think more rationally.

1263
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,440
Who...

1264
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,969
(Someone came to the room.)

1265
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:43,980
Yes?

1266
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,910
- Come down to the living room.
- Okay.

1267
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,880
We'll talk later.

1268
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,520
- I don't want to.
- We'll talk later.

1269
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,850
What will we talk about again?

1270
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,730
(Their conversation isn't over yet.)

1271
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:10,000
Considering the way Yoo Sik expressed himself...

1272
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,370
to Min Kyung...

1273
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,740
and the words he chose,

1274
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:17,070
I believe that he communicated to her clearly.

1275
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:20,310
It doesn't seem like Min Kyung agrees.

1276
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,749
It'd be nice if she could accept it easily, but it's impossible...

1277
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,749
- Right.
- because she has feelings for him.

1278
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,219
Min Kyung also lacks experience in breaking up.

1279
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,619
They were together for a long time.

1280
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,160
I can also understand Yoo Sik.

1281
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,229
He has an interest in someone else, and he's sure about it.

1282
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,799
I understand how he feels,

1283
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,999
- but they've been together...
- Right.

1284
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,159
for eight years.

1285
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,769
He made couple rings with someone he's been seeing for a week...

1286
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:43,970
right in front of her.

1287
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,239
I can understand why...

1288
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,899
- she got angry.
- It's upsetting.

1289
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,469
- It's understandable.
- Anyone would get angry.

1290
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:49,510
It's upsetting.

1291
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,879
(Red Room, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

1292
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,179
This one is a palm tree.

1293
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,650
- Yes.
- You see the one in the middle?

1294
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,979
The one with leaves sticking out. Which tree is it?

1295
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,020
(They spotted an unusually robust tree.)

1296
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,590
It looks like you.

1297
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:01,920
- Does it look like me?
- Yes.

1298
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,190
You look like Monchhichi.

1299
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,790
- "Monchhichi?" - Yes.

1300
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:08,290
Monchhichi.

1301
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,930
It's hairy and black.

1302
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,360
Black? Do I look black?

1303
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,600
- I'm yellow.
- Yellow?

1304
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,930
It's cute.

1305
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,040
Only you think that it's cute.

1306
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,570
Seriously, it's a cute stuffed toy.

1307
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,110
There's something I noticed here.

1308
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,449
Now that our exes got revealed in Japan,

1309
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,050
isn't everyone talking to their ex these days?

1310
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:32,120
Not me. I only talk to Baek Hyun.

1311
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:35,290
Except you two. It's clear between you two.

1312
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,620
It's the case for me and Won Kyu.

1313
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,360
It seems like Yoo Sik talks a lot with Min Kyung.

1314
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,329
- Min Kyung.
- During my date with Yoo Sik,

1315
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:44,800
he was wearing a couple ring.

1316
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,299
- A couple ring?
- Yes.

1317
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,500
- With whom did he make them?
- With Hyeon Ji.

1318
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,800
- He made couple rings with her?
- Yes.

1319
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,370
- Really?
- Yes.

1320
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,540
Unbelievable.

1321
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,480
I went on a date with Yoo Sik today.

1322
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,380
Min Kyung asked me about his feelings.

1323
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,750
I guess she wanted to know. When I told her...

1324
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,320
about his couple ring, she got upset and went upstairs.

1325
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,450
She has the right to be angry,

1326
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:10,860
but he has the right to wear it too.

1327
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,190
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1328
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:16,530
(Everyone got together late at night.)

1329
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,950
(Sighing)

1330
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,580
Eating something sweet makes me feel good.

1331
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,980
- Take them and share with others.
- Gosh, it tastes so good.

1332
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:41,150
Right?

1333
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,050
Isn't that a couple ring that you made with Yoo Sik?

1334
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,160
No, it's not this one.

1335
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,429
- It's not?
- No.

1336
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,230
Then what's that? Let me see it.

1337
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,830
- Why?
- I'm just curious.

1338
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,529
- Let me see it.
- No.

1339
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:57,569
Why not?

1340
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,900
Why not? You're wearing it.

1341
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,840
I put it on because I'm wearing many rings today.

1342
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,280
I'm just curious. Why are you getting angry?

1343
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,210
Let me see what you made.

1344
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,780
- Did you make it for each other?
- Yes.

1345
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,080
- It's stylish.
- Isn't it well made?

1346
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:14,650
- Yes, it's stylish.
- Right?

1347
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,949
- It's very stylish.
- Didn't he make it so well?

1348
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,360
I totally ruined mine.

1349
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,590
- Really?
- Yes.

1350
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,389
I made it so badly that I might get a phobia from it.

1351
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,390
(They don't stop talking about couple rings.)

1352
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,130
- Me too.
- What?

1353
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,239
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

1354
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,339
(Let them know via text.)

1355
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,240
(Your text will be delivered with your name.)

1356
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,720
(They start caring more about each other's feelings.)

1357
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,830
(Their worries grow heavy tonight.)

1358
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,540
(Everyone's true feelings were sent.)

1359
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,669
I ate like a pig today.

1360
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,440
- What?
- What did you eat?

1361
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,980
- We had sashimi...
- And something like tendon.

1362
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,079
- And...
- Shirasu rice bowl?

1363
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,580
That's right.

1364
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,850
It was a type of rice bowl.

1365
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,850
Yun Nyeong said to me, "You can't eat raw food."

1366
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,059
- Why can't you eat raw food?
- She mistook me for Woo Jin.

1367
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,220
I got confused.

1368
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,730
Who can't eat raw food?

1369
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,960
- He can't eat shrimp.
- I got confused.

1370
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:31,800
It must've been delicious.

1371
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:36,170
(Yun Nyeong)

1372
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,099
(It's our third day of the trip. Thanks to you, my first trip...)

1373
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,369
(in Japan is filled with good memories. Thank you so much.)

1374
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,440
(Let's go on another date tomorrow.)

1375
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,610
(The message is from Sung Baek Hyun.)

1376
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,849
I felt good,

1377
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,720
but I was embarrassed to read his long and sincere message.

1378
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,990
I should've sent one like that too. I have a lot to say to him.

1379
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:00,160
(Baek Hyun)

1380
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,660
(Gotcha, Monchhichi.)

1381
01:12:01,661 --> 01:12:04,359
(The message is from Choi Yun Nyeong.)

1382
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,100
It ended with Baek Hyun.

1383
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,070
- Today...
- "Gotcha, Monchhichi."

1384
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,740
It has a lot of hair.

1385
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,670
It's a very hairy...

1386
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,940
stuffed toy.

1387
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,810
She said that I look like Monchhichi because my hair is voluminous.

1388
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,020
I want to take a walk at night, don't you?

1389
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,489
- A walk at night? Totally.
- Right?

1390
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,290
It'd be really nice to take a walk here.

1391
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,860
Seung Yong, it looks like you drank alcohol.

1392
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,660
- Why?
- Your face is red.

1393
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,060
It's because I'm tired.

1394
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,400
Someone makes me tired.

1395
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,630
(Hyeon Ji)

1396
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:45,139
(Let's talk later with some whisky.)

1397
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:48,110
(Your ex picked you.)

1398
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,380
(Seung Yong sent Hyeon Ji a message as expected.)

1399
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,779
(I hope that your worries disappear.)

1400
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,609
(Like me, you're also free. Follow your heart,)

1401
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:58,220
(but don't forget to buy me beer.)

1402
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,650
(The message is from Lee Jae Hyeong.)

1403
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:04,720
(Hyeon Ji)

1404
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,189
(It's raining tomorrow, so wear something comfortable.)

1405
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,159
(We'll eat good food, so don't eat too much today.)

1406
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,490
(The message is from Cho Yoo Sik.)

1407
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,370
(To whom Hyeon Ji sent her text today)

1408
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,509
You slept early for the first time.

1409
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:23,639
- That's right.
- Right?

1410
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,110
(Yoo Sik)

1411
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:27,979
(Let's go on many dates from now on.)

1412
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:32,550
(The message is from Park Hyeon Ji.)

1413
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:38,390
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik's hearts connected again today.)

1414
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:44,460
(Min Kyung)

1415
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:52,100
(Your ex picked Park Hyeon Ji.)

1416
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,070
(Yoo Sik's choice didn't change.)

1417
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,740
Of course, I don't feel good about it.

1418
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:04,550
I felt somewhat betrayed by Yoo Sik.

1419
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,079
When we were in Pyeongchang-dong,

1420
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,289
Hyeon Ji and I were roommates.

1421
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:11,189
We talked a lot to each other,

1422
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,390
so it didn't bother me so much.

1423
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,660
Now that we aren't roommates anymore,

1424
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,900
we don't get to talk a lot.

1425
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:24,130
I expected more complicated situations in the future.

1426
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,240
(Jae Hyeong)

1427
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,380
(Your ex picked Sung Baek Hyun.)

1428
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:41,620
Hyeon Ji has feelings she's built up until now.

1429
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,090
It was difficult...

1430
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,820
to overcome the barrier in one day.

1431
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,490
Our date today...

1432
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,270
It was comfortable, which is a good thing.

1433
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:58,100
But it was a little far from making my heart flutter.

1434
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:02,110
I need to think about how I feel.

1435
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,880
I have to spend more time with her.

1436
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,680
(Seung Yong)

1437
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:12,679
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1438
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,080
I felt very hurt.

1439
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,019
It felt like...

1440
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,520
Hyeon Ji kept saying that her heart was leaning towards Yoo Sik.

1441
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,290
It felt like she kept twisting the knife in my heart.

1442
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,799
So I became more impatient...

1443
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,760
and thought I had to be more proactive.

1444
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:31,740
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1445
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,980
(Ji Hyeon and Ji Yeon both get a message.)

1446
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,519
(They didn't get to go on a date together.)

1447
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,950
(Where does Won Kyu's heart lie?)

1448
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,760
(The weather was great. I hope we get to go out together too.)

1449
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,560
(Your ex picked you.)

1450
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:05,900
(Won Kyu chose to text Ji Hyeon two days in a row.)

1451
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,810
We got to talk recently...

1452
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,280
although I didn't understand some of the things she said.

1453
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,780
Despite everything, I had...

1454
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:20,350
the strongest feelings for my ex, so I texted her.

1455
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,690
The weather was really good today.

1456
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,890
Right. But it was slightly cold.

1457
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,089
Now, yes.

1458
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:32,100
(The text from her ex gets her think about a lot of things.)

1459
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,900
(I can't wait to spend time with you dressed in black from head to toe.)

1460
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,570
(Your ex picked you.)

1461
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:46,680
(Ji Yeon gets a text message from Woo Jin, not Won Kyu.)

1462
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,650
(Won Kyu)

1463
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,230
(The beer was good!)

1464
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,329
I think she texted me, saying the beer was good...

1465
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:06,500
to thank me for being a good listener.

1466
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:10,869
(Your ex picked Jung Won Kyu.)

1467
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,199
I see. This one.

1468
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,900
- That looks so good.
- That's what we had.

1469
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,670
I took a selfie. And this is Woo Jin.

1470
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,880
- I have it too.
- Show it to me.

1471
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,580
(Won Kyu)

1472
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,860
(Won Kyu receives another heartfelt message.)

1473
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,130
Well, I like getting one too.

1474
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:41,599
- What about you, Jae Hyeong?
- I like doing it myself.

1475
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,430
(Woo Jin)

1476
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,840
(I think you cook the best ramyeon.)

1477
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,970
(Your ex picked you.)

1478
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,950
(Ji Yeon's heart was drawn to Woo Jin.)

1479
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,549
- Gosh, in the end? Yes.
- Yes! It's over.

1480
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,180
- I didn't know this would happen.
- Gosh, she chose him in the end.

1481
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,120
- She chose him in the end.
- See? Min Kyung still has a chance.

1482
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,619
- Yes. Things like this do happen.
- You never know.

1483
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,859
- You're using this as an example?
- My gosh.

1484
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,029
- You're using it as an example?
- You're making a case for her?

1485
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,489
- Did you know this would happen?
- So this was...

1486
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,490
- what you were talking about?
- You didn't know.

1487
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:12,429
- There were some signs with them.
- Right.

1488
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,659
- No, in the beginning.
- Right.

1489
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,029
- In the beginning...
- There weren't any signs then.

1490
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,069
- You didn't know, right?
- Not at all.

1491
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,469
- Exactly. You never know.
- Woo Jin and Ji Yeon...

1492
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,769
She started to lean toward Woo Jin...

1493
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:22,109
- when Won Kyu stopped texting her.
- She had a change of heart.

1494
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:24,479
My gosh. See? Won Kyu!

1495
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,079
I've never seen him this emotional.

1496
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,610
I'm just disappointed. In the end...

1497
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,850
Gosh, fine. Okay.

1498
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:40,860
(Ji Yeon's heart was drawn to Woo Jin.)

1499
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:44,330
The content of the text message didn't matter much.

1500
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,570
The fact that she texted me meant a lot.

1501
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:50,700
I was grateful for that.

1502
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,240
I thought that she might've changed her mind about me.

1503
01:18:56,870 --> 01:19:00,880
(Their feelings are aligned.)

1504
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:08,750
(Let's talk more, moving forward.)

1505
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:16,360
(Your ex picked you.)

1506
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
- Gosh. Seriously?
- I told you.

1507
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,600
I guess these two...

1508
01:19:21,601 --> 01:19:23,369
- can't break things off.
- Seriously.

1509
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:24,599
- They'll end up together.
- Gosh.

1510
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,969
- Gosh. It's her first text to him.
- Seriously.

1511
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,999
This is crazy.

1512
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,009
- I told you it'd happen.
- It's her first text to him?

1513
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,040
Yes. She texted him for the first time.

1514
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:32,780
My gosh. Are they really going to get back together?

1515
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:40,650
(Won Kyu receives the first message from Ji Hyeon.)

1516
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:45,760
First of all, it was...

1517
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:49,160
the 1st text message from my ex during these 2 weeks.

1518
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:54,130
I was relieved that she still wanted to talk.

1519
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:57,330
I was just happy to get a message from her.

1520
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:59,340
It meant that she didn't text anyone else.

1521
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,370
I was happy.

1522
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:05,209
But I thought more about what I needed to do...

1523
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:08,180
in order to win her back.

1524
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,980
Even when I was sending the message,

1525
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,220
I wasn't sure if it was right to text him given how I felt.

1526
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:19,319
To send a message to someone new,

1527
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,690
I just have to be curious and excited.

1528
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,360
But sending a message to my ex...

1529
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:31,570
didn't come with only excitement or good feelings.

1530
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,270
We fought and argued in Japan.

1531
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,710
This love-hate attachment might have rekindled it.

1532
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:44,380
(As the fast-moving swirl of emotions takes hold,)

1533
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:55,130
(how will their feelings change?)

1534
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:58,600
I should look at Yoo Sik's ring too.

1535
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,830
- What?
- I'll look at the ring you made.

1536
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:03,530
He didn't bring the ring I made.

1537
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,300
- Yoo Sik didn't?
- No.

1538
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,170
Why not?

1539
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,369
He wore it when he went out earlier.

1540
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,910
But he took it off when he came back.

1541
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,950
Talk to him.

1542
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,050
Should I really do it?

1543
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,720
But what's going on with Min Kyung all of a sudden?

1544
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:23,490
She said she wasn't interested in getting back with him.

1545
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,460
Right. She came to get him when we were talking earlier.

1546
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,990
- Min Kyung did?
- Yes.

1547
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,230
We're supposed to fight for love here.

1548
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,530
This guy must be possessed by an evil spirit.

1549
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,869
- Seung Yong, show it to us.
- What happened to you?

1550
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,070
Show us the evil spirit.

1551
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:39,670
You want me to?

1552
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,280
- Where's Min Kyung?
- What are you going to do?

1553
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,010
- I heard what happened.
- To encourage her?

1554
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,550
Yes. What?

1555
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,450
I think he's trying to get in my way.

1556
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,850
Everyone has a goal.

1557
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,320
- Come on.
- Of course. Everyone has a goal.

1558
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,630
What if I can't be friends with her anymore?

1559
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,190
There's nothing you can do.

1560
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:05,800
You gain 1 and lose 1.

1561
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,100
- What?
- Or you can keep both.

1562
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:10,499
You can keep your friendship with her.

1563
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,400
And you can keep your relationship with Yoo Sik and me too.

1564
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,510
You're right. What do you think?

1565
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,970
What do you think about that?

1566
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,080
You can keep your relationship with him too.

1567
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,850
Why him? He's doing fine on his own.

1568
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,280
I'm just saying.

1569
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

1570
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,790
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1571
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,660
- Ji Yeon might be here.
- Right.

1572
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:41,199
She's talking to Woo Jin.

1573
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,270
What? What do you want to do?

1574
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:44,270
- To talk?
- Yes.

1575
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,240
Good luck.

1576
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:49,810
Good luck.

1577
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,440
Let's go.

1578
01:22:58,820 --> 01:22:59,979
It's warm in here.

1579
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,980
(He comes to Hyeon Ji's room to talk.)

1580
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,150
What more is there to talk about?

1581
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,320
I've been thinking.

1582
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:11,729
I said I was going to wait for your answer.

1583
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:14,230
What? You said you were going to wait for my answer?

1584
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,830
I said I'd wait for your decision.

1585
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,270
I was just going to wait...

1586
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:22,140
until you made up your mind without doing anything.

1587
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,640
I thought I might regret it...

1588
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,450
if you didn't pick me in the end.

1589
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,849
Anyway, I'm going to do my best here.

1590
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:32,880
You'll do your best to express your feelings?

1591
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,350
I'll do my best to win you over.

1592
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,850
Are you warning me?

1593
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:40,390
No, I'm not. But anyway...

1594
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:42,630
That's scary.

1595
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,929
You said you didn't want to get back together...

1596
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,370
- after the preliminary meeting.
- Yes.

1597
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:51,270
But I did think about you more...

1598
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:53,840
after the preliminary meeting.

1599
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:58,040
If we could resolve the issues we had,

1600
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:01,140
I thought I'd be able to picture myself...

1601
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,910
- marrying you.
- Okay.

1602
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:06,750
You wanted to marry young.

1603
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,150
We talked about getting married next year or the year after that.

1604
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,960
When it comes to marriage and our future,

1605
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:16,660
I'm ready to take that step...

1606
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:19,460
- I see.
- unlike Yoo Sik.

1607
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,500
If you date Yoo Sik, when will you guys get married?

1608
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,530
I'm different from him.

1609
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,970
I'm ready to take that step.

1610
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,109
My gosh. That was brutal.

1611
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,839
- Did he really say that?
- Gosh. What?

1612
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,680
- He made her face reality.
- He played his trump card.

1613
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,079
- He injected a dose of reality.
- That was his trump card.

1614
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,849
Actually, when I hear that,

1615
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:40,279
it might be a wake-up call.

1616
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,719
Personally, it might come across like that.

1617
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,120
- I wonder how that feels.
- It's reality.

1618
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,889
This is on another level. When you watch dating shows,

1619
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,529
you hear so many people say, "I'll be good to you."

1620
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,359
- Right.
- "It will never happen."

1621
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,929
"I'll try to change." But this is...

1622
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,959
- What he said...
- He brought up...

1623
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:54,999
- would change the way she thinks.
- marriage.

1624
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,730
Right. It would completely change her view.

1625
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,899
But for those who want to get married young,

1626
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,439
- you have to consider that.
- That's tough.

1627
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,169
- Of course.
- Yes. It's only natural.

1628
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,939
- This strategy would work...
- Right.

1629
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,879
- only on Hyeon Ji.
- It's the perfect thing to say.

1630
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,410
- It's tailored just for her.
- Honestly, he's right.

1631
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,379
That does nothing for people who aren't interested...

1632
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,579
- in getting married.
- It won't work.

1633
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,849
- Never.
- Right.

1634
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:15,989
He can only say that because he knows her so well.

1635
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,819
Totally. When she was there, she got butterflies and excited.

1636
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,289
But what he said would knock her...

1637
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,520
- back into reality.
- Right.

1638
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:25,030
If you date Yoo Sik, when will you guys get married?

1639
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:27,100
I'm different from him.

1640
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:30,530
I'm ready to take that step.

1641
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,770
Right. I won't say that it didn't cross my mind.

1642
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:36,640
Yoo Sik is quite young.

1643
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,780
I may not be as handsome as Yoo Sik.

1644
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,680
But this is the only thing I can offer to you.

1645
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:44,180
I'm being realistic.

1646
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:48,320
Seriously? Did you just say that to me?

1647
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,390
What?

1648
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,490
Marriage...

1649
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,560
Of course, I want to get married.

1650
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,530
I seek stability.

1651
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,730
I can't believe you brought in real-life factors...

1652
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,300
to take into account.

1653
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,009
- Come on. You're so cruel.
- What?

1654
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:11,810
That's the only thing I can offer to you that he can't.

1655
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,180
Think about it realistically, Hyeon Ji.

1656
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:17,310
I can make you a VIP at a department store.

1657
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:19,850
Come on.

1658
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,890
I need to make my offer look as attractive as possible.

1659
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:27,159
We're simple and modest people.

1660
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,890
Well, sure. We are modest.

1661
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:33,600
- I was just joking earlier.
- Right.

1662
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:38,370
Yoo Sik.

1663
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,970
It hasn't been that long since he expressed his feelings...

1664
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,210
properly.

1665
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,380
At first, there was someone else he was interested in.

1666
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,679
But he said that expressing his interest in someone...

1667
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,050
who made his heart flutter was the right thing to do.

1668
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:56,850
Did that make your heart flutter?

1669
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:58,860
Yes.

1670
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,400
I want to turn evil. Be careful.

1671
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,900
All joking aside, he's so sweet and thoughtful.

1672
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,569
In my opinion, having a sweet personality is...

1673
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,109
a skill and can be learned.

1674
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:19,910
But I'm afraid I might get lonely in our relationship.

1675
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,080
I see.

1676
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:25,350
I think I'm ready to make our relationship better.

1677
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,150
You're so smart.

1678
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,320
What do you mean?

1679
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:31,789
Seriously. You are...

1680
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:32,860
What?

1681
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,160
Are you finally starting to reconsider?

1682
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:39,000
I can't suddenly have feelings for you just because...

1683
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,699
- Right.
- you said these things to me.

1684
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,630
As for real-life factors,

1685
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,900
I didn't consider them. But now, I will probably.

1686
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,940
Well, you don't have to decide now.

1687
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,539
Anyway, it does bother me that...

1688
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,680
Min Kyung can't let go of Yoo Sik.

1689
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:57,380
Why does that bother you?

1690
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:01,449
If they want to get back together,

1691
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,890
I don't want to get in their way.

1692
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:05,889
After they talk, I'd like him to tell me...

1693
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:09,490
what they discussed and tell me clearly what's going on.

1694
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,460
- Are you talking about Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

1695
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:13,900
But he and I didn't get to talk.

1696
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:17,669
So you want to talk to him about that now?

1697
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:19,369
I don't have to talk to him now.

1698
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:21,600
Well, he asked me about my schedule tomorrow.

1699
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,470
Okay.

1700
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:26,110
- I see.
- So we are...

1701
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,310
going out tomorrow.

1702
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,010
- With Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

1703
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,950
You guys decided to go on a date?

1704
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:34,850
Yes.

1705
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,860
I see.

1706
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,090
I found out that they were quite certain...

1707
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,799
about each other.

1708
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,330
So I became more impatient.

1709
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,670
I decided to try harder to win her back,

1710
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,869
and it also made me want to get in their way...

1711
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:56,310
after hearing that.

1712
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:04,980
(Red Room, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

1713
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,520
Do you think Hyeon Ji has her heart set on him?

1714
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,389
Honestly, I'm not sure.

1715
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:13,320
She and I didn't talk about our feelings that deeply.

1716
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,859
I'm close to her.

1717
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,630
- So I want to talk to her.
- Yes.

1718
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,430
It's a bit uncomfortable now.

1719
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:24,900
Woo Jin. Is it just you and Ji Yeon?

1720
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,600
I'm with Ji Yeon and Min Kyung.

1721
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,140
Didn't you look for Min Kyung earlier?

1722
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,039
I wanted to talk to her.

1723
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,279
Wait. I'll go up.

1724
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,250
- Sure.
- Yes. He's funny.

1725
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:38,209
He's exactly how you described him.

1726
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:39,449
- He's so funny.
- He's funny, isn't he?

1727
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:41,279
Really? Have fun.

1728
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,390
Okay. I'll go and refresh.

1729
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,420
(Baek Hyun and Hyeon Ji are in Yoo Sik's room.)

1730
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,389
- You two.
- What? It's behind you.

1731
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,090
See if it gives you trypophobia.

1732
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:50,890
It's next to the clock.

1733
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,960
You said it might give you trypophobia.

1734
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,000
Did you shake your hands, Hyeon Ji?

1735
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,640
- It's not bad.
- Right.

1736
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,170
Put it on.

1737
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,280
I put it on when I went on a date with Yun Nyeong this morning.

1738
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:08,440
I had it on me then, so I showed it off to Yun Nyeong.

1739
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:12,280
Where did you guys get it done? Did you do it in Japan?

1740
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,979
Yes. It's not far from here.

1741
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,720
- We did it yesterday.
- Yesterday?

1742
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,320
Then it was the date your ex chose for you. Right?

1743
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,260
Right.

1744
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:22,260
I chose you for her.

1745
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:23,490
And you two made rings?

1746
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,570
How is it?

1747
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,210
What are you doing? What were you all doing?

1748
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,540
- What?
- What were you doing?

1749
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,210
- We're on a date.
- We just...

1750
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:41,949
Why did you look for me?

1751
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:44,310
Why did I look for you? Because...

1752
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:47,680
I was curious about your emotional state.

1753
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,620
So I wanted to ask you.

1754
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:51,650
That's why I looked for you.

1755
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,560
- My emotional state?
- Yes.

1756
01:30:57,030 --> 01:31:00,060
Isn't it hard to have no regrets toward your ex?

1757
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,659
It's even harder after nine years.

1758
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,900
Yes, it's harder.

1759
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:07,470
You and Yoo Sik are...

1760
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:09,840
Anyway, and?

1761
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:12,780
- What?
- So how is it now?

1762
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,549
- You're scaring me.
- Sorry.

1763
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:17,550
Okay. And?

1764
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:20,750
- Don't threaten her.
- Sorry. Keep going.

1765
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,289
- She's younger than us.
- Sorry.

1766
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:24,290
I was just focusing on your story.

1767
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:26,189
- Yes, I know.
- I was listening carefully.

1768
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,459
Let me bring more snacks.

1769
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,529
- Keep talking. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1770
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:32,160
(Jae Hyeong leaves.)

1771
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:35,970
I actually talked to Yoo Sik earlier.

1772
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:38,129
Yoo Sik seemed to be...

1773
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:41,269
more interested...

1774
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:43,110
in meeting new people.

1775
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,810
Is that how he seemed or is that what he said?

1776
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:51,109
We did talk about it,

1777
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,980
and he said he doesn't know how it's going to change.

1778
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,549
I think that's enough.

1779
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:00,719
I still had feelings left for my ex Hyeon Ji.

1780
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,230
So I...

1781
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,330
struggled emotionally.

1782
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:08,199
I had to suggest how to overcome the reason we broke up...

1783
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,830
and show her that I can change.

1784
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,039
I thought about how to bring it up.

1785
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,369
Should I just go on...

1786
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,139
that I want to get back with her?

1787
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,609
I thought about it.

1788
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:21,009
Then I decided to do my best.

1789
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:23,549
Whether I ruin it or root for her,

1790
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,279
- it occurred to me today...
- Right.

1791
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,350
that I should be selfish.

1792
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,050
I talked to Hyeon Ji pitifully.

1793
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:33,290
So I've already talked to her.

1794
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,730
The reason I looked for you earlier.

1795
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:39,399
Honestly,

1796
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,359
things are going well between Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji,

1797
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,730
and I want to ruin it.

1798
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:44,269
I want to interfere.

1799
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:46,699
So rather than interfering alone,

1800
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,939
if you plan to get back with him...

1801
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:50,869
- We should do it together?
- I thought...

1802
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:52,309
we should sway them together for our own sakes.

1803
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:54,379
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1804
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:56,379
Other people might think...

1805
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,379
- this is a cowardly act...
- Oh, no.

1806
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,549
and selfish.

1807
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:01,349
I think I have no other choice...

1808
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:02,990
for my happiness.

1809
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,260
But...

1810
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:10,490
it's up to you.

1811
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:12,300
I want to...

1812
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:17,069
- get in between them.
- You want to get in between them.

1813
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:18,500
I want to make them feel uncomfortable.

1814
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:23,170
Nice.

1815
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:25,479
Right. It's a good idea to find an alley.

1816
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,140
We have Zhuge Liang as a resident.

1817
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,549
- He's a strategist.
- He really is.

1818
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:32,079
But that is true.

1819
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,879
- He must win her anyhow.
- Right.

1820
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,649
But if he can't do it alone,

1821
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:38,520
use the other person to sway her.

1822
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:39,919
But will that work?

1823
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,389
- No, it won't.
- It won't.

1824
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,029
But rather than sitting on his hands,

1825
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,529
- Right.
- that's better.

1826
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:45,800
- He should do something.
- He should do something.

1827
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:48,259
They're going on a date tomorrow.

1828
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,229
- Who?
- Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji.

1829
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:51,269
How?

1830
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,600
They decided to go out.

1831
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:57,310
(Exclaiming)

1832
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,450
Anyway, the two are going out for sure.

1833
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,879
- Tomorrow...
- What time is it now?

1834
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,219
- Tomorrow?
- Now.

1835
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,280
Right now...

1836
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,319
Let me go talk to him.

1837
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,150
- To Yoo Sik? Wait.
- What?

1838
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,660
What are you going to say?

1839
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:14,860
If he's going on a date tomorrow.

1840
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,590
If he's going on a date?

1841
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,530
Do you want to rehearse first?

1842
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:21,360
So you've made up your mind?

1843
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,670
Then you can tell me.

1844
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:27,100
Why are you acting like that?

1845
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:29,240
(Exclaiming)

1846
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:32,939
- Can you stop for a second?
- What?

1847
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,550
When you talk to him...

1848
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:38,450
- I'm not kibitzing.
- Okay.

1849
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,390
I don't know Yoo Sik or you that well.

1850
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:45,890
I had no idea.

1851
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:50,360
When you talk to him,

1852
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:52,530
you...

1853
01:34:52,531 --> 01:34:54,160
Do you want me to talk calmly?

1854
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:56,229
- A little.
- Okay. I'll do that.

1855
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:59,870
I'm the same. When I talk to Hyeon Ji,

1856
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,369
I want to keep calm too.

1857
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:05,370
Only then we can talk.

1858
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:08,409
If Yoo Sik's like me,

1859
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:11,609
your conversation won't go anywhere...

1860
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:13,519
when you yell at him or corner him.

1861
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,320
Then I run away.

1862
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,820
So keep calm?

1863
01:35:17,821 --> 01:35:20,259
If you talk to him calmly,

1864
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,959
Yoo Sik might get it off his chest.

1865
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,760
Where is his room?

1866
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:25,390
- The next door?
- Yoo Sik?

1867
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,530
I think it was the next room.

1868
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,670
- Unit 202.
- Okay.

1869
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:45,310
- What?
- Can you come out for a second?

1870
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,950
- What?
- I'll be right back.

1871
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,270
Are you going on a date tomorrow?

1872
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,430
Why do you ask?

1873
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,240
- Are you going on a date tomorrow?
- Why are you suddenly asking?

1874
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:22,889
You're going on a date even though it's not official?

1875
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:23,919
What?

1876
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,820
You'd go on a date even though it's not official?

1877
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,860
It's not a date... You're wearing a ring.

1878
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:39,370
Baek Hyun told me to put it on. So I'm just trying it on.

1879
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,870
I want you to take it out.

1880
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,740
- Yoo Sik.
- Yes.

1881
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,820
What are you thinking?

1882
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,620
Are you that certain?

1883
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,289
We agreed not to talk about the same topic again.

1884
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:07,060
You're going on a date when it's not a date day.

1885
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:08,299
We can talk about it tomorrow.

1886
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:09,899
You're going on a date when it's not a date day.

1887
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,930
Yes.

1888
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,540
Didn't you express what was on your mind?

1889
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,440
Didn't you think I'd hear that?

1890
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,410
You're going on a date when it's not a date day?

1891
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:26,120
How am I supposed to understand that?

1892
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,590
I don't even have strength to stay up.

1893
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,060
- You're going on a date.
- So?

1894
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,159
Even you requested it.

1895
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,330
Though it's not an official date.

1896
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:49,770
You're doing something you're going to regret.

1897
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,450
Can I ask you what you're thinking to go on a date?

1898
01:37:57,650 --> 01:37:58,909
I don't want to talk about it today.

1899
01:37:58,910 --> 01:38:00,280
- No.
- We've been talking about it.

1900
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:02,820
It's not no. I don't want to talk about it.

1901
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:04,589
Can I ask you what you're thinking...

1902
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,490
to go on an unofficial date?

1903
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:08,290
What do you mean it's unofficial?

1904
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:11,490
- It's not here.
- You requested it.

1905
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,200
Tomorrow isn't a date day.

1906
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,640
What?

1907
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,509
Tomorrow isn't a date day.

1908
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:24,169
I didn't only go on a date day.

1909
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:26,040
Because you have feelings for her.

1910
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,780
(Sighing)

1911
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,250
That's why you're wearing a ring.

1912
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:37,150
I didn't know...

1913
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,960
you could express yourself like that.

1914
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,500
I'm taken aback.

1915
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:53,239
Are you going on a date...

1916
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,470
because you have something to say?

1917
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:00,310
Yes.

1918
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:04,550
You don't care about me at all, do you?

1919
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,280
When did I say that?

1920
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,760
You're making me a tactless person again.

1921
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:18,390
Let's go down first.

1922
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:23,530
Come on.

1923
01:39:28,061 --> 01:39:31,491
(The two move to the 1st floor.)

1924
01:39:33,431 --> 01:39:35,101
You made this situation.

1925
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:37,831
(Sighing)

1926
01:39:39,471 --> 01:39:41,171
How fun is it?

1927
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:45,111
That you keep going on a date with the same person?

1928
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:47,611
Then? Are you expecting me to change my date every time?

1929
01:39:48,211 --> 01:39:49,711
Why are you going out?

1930
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:54,350
Why didn't I know?

1931
01:39:54,351 --> 01:39:55,551
Why did you lose so much weight?

1932
01:39:57,221 --> 01:39:58,351
Doesn't it break your heart?

1933
01:39:58,691 --> 01:40:00,521
- I lost weight too.
- I lost weight because of you.

1934
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:02,491
Why did I lose weight then?

1935
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,331
- Because of me?
- Because of me.

1936
01:40:07,631 --> 01:40:10,900
Yet you enjoy going on a date in Japan?

1937
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:12,870
- Okay.
- Oh, don't leave.

1938
01:40:12,871 --> 01:40:15,301
I'm having a stomachache.

1939
01:40:16,571 --> 01:40:17,610
Get up.

1940
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:21,411
Oh, I don't know. People keep asking me and telling me.

1941
01:40:21,841 --> 01:40:23,651
I keep getting pushed.

1942
01:40:23,881 --> 01:40:25,081
Yoo Sik, did you eat anything?

1943
01:40:25,681 --> 01:40:27,051
- I had milk.
- Let's go up together.

1944
01:40:28,151 --> 01:40:29,190
- Bye.
- No. Wait.

1945
01:40:29,191 --> 01:40:31,291
- Min Kyung, please.
- Come here for a second.

1946
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:32,961
- Wait.
- No.

1947
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:40,401
- Just tell me the reason.
- What?

1948
01:40:41,031 --> 01:40:42,630
The reason you're going on a date tomorrow.

1949
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:44,071
Because I want to talk to her.

1950
01:40:44,831 --> 01:40:47,471
Whatever it is, you want to talk to her?

1951
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:49,571
Okay?

1952
01:40:50,111 --> 01:40:51,370
Don't lie down here.

1953
01:40:51,371 --> 01:40:52,480
No, I'm not lying down.

1954
01:40:52,481 --> 01:40:53,781
Okay.

1955
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,011
Get up.

1956
01:40:56,381 --> 01:40:58,480
Hurry up. Don't do this.

1957
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:01,281
Stop lying or sitting on the floor.

1958
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:05,550
- Bye.
- No.

1959
01:41:05,551 --> 01:41:06,560
What do you mean? Stop acting up.

1960
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:07,620
Wait then.

1961
01:41:07,621 --> 01:41:09,060
Wait. Let's finish the conversation.

1962
01:41:09,061 --> 01:41:10,861
- Let's finish it here.
- Okay. Inside.

1963
01:41:13,101 --> 01:41:14,901
Yoo Sik.

1964
01:41:18,171 --> 01:41:19,171
What?

1965
01:41:22,171 --> 01:41:24,111
This is crazy.

1966
01:41:27,311 --> 01:41:28,741
- Yoo Sik.
- Yes.

1967
01:41:29,611 --> 01:41:32,721
So you want to go on a date in the end.

1968
01:41:33,681 --> 01:41:35,050
Why are you asking me?

1969
01:41:35,051 --> 01:41:36,350
Because I want to.

1970
01:41:36,351 --> 01:41:39,320
I still have feelings left for you,

1971
01:41:39,321 --> 01:41:42,690
and I said I wanted to get back with you.

1972
01:41:42,691 --> 01:41:44,591
Yet you requested her a date.

1973
01:41:44,991 --> 01:41:47,160
Did I say I have feelings left for you?

1974
01:41:47,161 --> 01:41:48,201
But...

1975
01:41:49,471 --> 01:41:51,671
You said it's not that you don't have any feelings left for me.

1976
01:41:53,071 --> 01:41:54,441
You said it's not that you don't have any.

1977
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:56,340
I said I don't want to get back with you fully.

1978
01:41:56,341 --> 01:41:57,411
Exactly.

1979
01:41:58,171 --> 01:41:59,211
Then...

1980
01:41:59,611 --> 01:42:02,750
did you mean you don't want to get back with me 99 percent?

1981
01:42:02,751 --> 01:42:05,081
One percent? Should I make an effort for that one percent?

1982
01:42:05,851 --> 01:42:08,381
- I never asked you to do that.
- I know.

1983
01:42:09,121 --> 01:42:11,020
- I know that.
- I don't want you to do that.

1984
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:12,090
I know that.

1985
01:42:12,091 --> 01:42:14,020
But your date tomorrow doesn't make any sense.

1986
01:42:14,021 --> 01:42:16,961
I get that, but there is more than just an official date.

1987
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:19,201
Didn't you request anyone a date in Seoul?

1988
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:21,861
This is so upsetting.

1989
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:26,770
Will you not let me hear that?

1990
01:42:26,771 --> 01:42:29,270
Stop asking people about me.

1991
01:42:29,271 --> 01:42:31,771
I didn't. People kept calling me.

1992
01:42:32,311 --> 01:42:33,341
Okay.

1993
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:36,981
Why did you... Why do you keep calling me then?

1994
01:42:38,381 --> 01:42:39,621
You know how I feel.

1995
01:42:40,681 --> 01:42:42,350
How many times do I have to say yes?

1996
01:42:42,351 --> 01:42:44,120
- You know it.
- Okay.

1997
01:42:44,121 --> 01:42:45,591
Answer me just once.

1998
01:42:46,021 --> 01:42:48,191
How many times do I have to say that I know?

1999
01:42:49,231 --> 01:42:50,231
Maybe 500 times?

2000
01:42:50,761 --> 01:42:51,761
Okay?

2001
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:53,701
- Okay.
- Okay.

2002
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:56,471
Get some rest.

2003
01:42:57,701 --> 01:42:58,830
Don't have fun.

2004
01:42:58,831 --> 01:43:00,400
- Okay.
- I hope it's not tasty.

2005
01:43:00,401 --> 01:43:01,500
- What?
- I hope it's not tasty.

2006
01:43:01,501 --> 01:43:03,441
- What's not tasty?
- Whatever you do.

2007
01:43:04,341 --> 01:43:05,371
Goodnight.

2008
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,311
Rest. Goodnight.

2009
01:43:11,581 --> 01:43:12,721
(Grunting)

2010
01:43:14,681 --> 01:43:16,390
This is how we always said goodbye.

2011
01:43:16,391 --> 01:43:17,391
When?

2012
01:43:17,392 --> 01:43:19,291
Go. I want to see you leaving.

2013
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:25,091
Get inside. Close the door.

2014
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:28,260
- This is what we always did.
- Okay. Close the door.

2015
01:43:28,261 --> 01:43:30,100
- I'll watch you leaving...
- I'll go when you close the door.

2016
01:43:30,101 --> 01:43:32,300
- No. Go.
- Hurry up. Please.

2017
01:43:32,301 --> 01:43:35,071
Turn around, then I'll go inside.

2018
01:43:42,881 --> 01:43:44,211
Close the door.

2019
01:43:49,821 --> 01:43:55,191
(She can't possibly close the door as she watches Yoo Sik leaving.)

2020
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:04,131
Why is everyone giving me a hard time?

2021
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:06,441
Stop telling me.

2022
01:44:08,401 --> 01:44:12,811
(EXchange 4)

2023
01:44:12,941 --> 01:44:14,941
- Have you tried it?
- Not yet.

2024
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:17,511
Sorry.

2025
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:21,151
He's been talking to Min Kyung a lot lately.

2026
01:44:22,081 --> 01:44:25,651
(He might be swayed.)

2027
01:44:25,751 --> 01:44:26,921
Yoo Sik, what about you?

2028
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:29,261
Your feelings for Min Kyung.

2029
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:30,731
Min Kyung?

2030
01:44:32,161 --> 01:44:34,931
(Why did you break up?)

2031
01:44:35,061 --> 01:44:37,601
Was it about something heavy like marriage?

2032
01:44:38,131 --> 01:44:40,341
Marriage was part of it.

2033
01:44:40,501 --> 01:44:43,411
But if she says...

2034
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:46,181
she understands you,

2035
01:44:46,841 --> 01:44:48,511
would that change your mind?

2036
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:52,151
If Min Kyung understands my situation?

2037
01:44:54,751 --> 01:44:56,190
Hyeon Ji's planning to get married.

2038
01:44:56,191 --> 01:44:57,651
What do you think about marriage?

2039
01:44:58,151 --> 01:44:59,491
You said you can't marry me.

2040
01:45:00,691 --> 01:45:02,831
Is it nice to make a fool out of me?

2041
01:45:03,661 --> 01:45:04,960
When did I make a fool out of you?

2042
01:45:04,961 --> 01:45:07,061
- You keep doing that.
- When?

2043
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:08,731
Is this why you're here?
