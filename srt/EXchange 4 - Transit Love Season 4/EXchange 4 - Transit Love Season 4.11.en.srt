1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,140
(EXchange 4)

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,949
Today, we're once again joined by Min Hyuk.

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,950
(Lee Yong Jin)

4
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:16,979
(Jeong Ki Seok)

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,949
I'm here again. I'm BTOB's Lee Min Hyuk.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,249
(Kim Ye Won)

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,949
The Ex Room is finally open.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,990
It's finally open.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,859
Yoo Sik and Min Kyung's Ex Room was revealed first.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,929
- Yoo Sik entered it.
- Yes.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,259
Is there an Ex Room that you're looking forward to?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,359
Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon's.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,029
- Won Kyu.
- Me too.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,829
I'm curious about their story.

15
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,269
Also, who will enter it?

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,339
- Who...
- Right.

17
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,740
Now, I'm also curious...

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,110
about who will see it.

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,809
Ji Yeon went to the Ex Room...

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,910
- wearing Won Kyu's shirt.
- Right.

21
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,009
That as well,

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,449
but they wouldn't have thought...

23
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,849
- that they would meet each other.
- That's right.

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,819
She'll be wearing a shirt with a heart.

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,519
She'll be possessed by an evil spirit again.

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,590
Right.

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,060
(Ji Hyeon came to the Choice Room.)

28
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,710
It turned out we both couldn't enter the Ex Room.

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,550
I don't know. I'm just sad.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,560
I wondered what was left of a love that passed?

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,930
That's what I thought about.

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,400
(The thought of facing her past troubles her.)

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,610
(Ji Hyeon chose the Ex Room.)

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,979
I wanted to see...

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,850
what traces were left...

36
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,920
from our relationship.

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,340
I wondered...

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,740
if my ex would also see this.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,950
I think she would have also had a lot of thoughts.

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,020
You don't know how the feelings would change...

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,790
after seeing that.

42
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,330
(Won Kyu also decided to enter the Ex Room.)

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,430
I was very curious to see what was there.

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,240
I think I went there...

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,209
thinking I wanted to check...

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,170
how I felt about my ex...

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,210
and how much feelings I had left for her.

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,230
(An awkward hand wave)

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,870
I don't think most people could resist that.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,599
- I get most nervous about this.
- This...

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,239
I think I'd cry if I saw that there.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,709
- That room would be a tear-jerker.
- Right.

53
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,479
- That...
- Ji Hyeon's eyes are already teary.

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Right.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,910
(They first check each other's reasons for breaking up.)

56
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,819
(Insincere love)

57
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,660
It was written "insincere love" on mne.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,360
I expected it.

59
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,300
When I went to the Talking Room, I heard the conversation.

60
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,499
From that conversation, I heard...

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,270
that she thought the love was insincere.

62
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,880
Still, that was...

63
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,680
very heartbreaking to hear.

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,610
I felt uneasy.

65
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,250
I thought, "So that's what it felt like for her."

66
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,860
The keyword my ex wrote was "reality."

67
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,370
It's a word that really stings me,

68
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,370
but also serves as a wake-up call.

69
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,450
(Their 10-minute conversation begins.)

70
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,790
Insincere love?

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,620
Talking Room...

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
- The one with calls.
- Yes.

73
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,630
That's what I heard then.

74
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,900
- You came.
- Yes. I heard it too.

75
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,280
Why did you feel that way?

76
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,450
Because I felt like you let me go for such a trivial reason.

77
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,320
- A trivial reason?
- Yes.

78
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,290
Back then,

79
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,300
I actually didn't understand why we had to break up.

80
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,630
I just accepted it.

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,299
I thought we weren't the kind of couple...

82
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,440
to break up over something like this.

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,740
So I thought you didn't love me as much.

84
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,320
But they were too significant...

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,420
to be called trivial.

86
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,059
It wouldn't be a problem...

87
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,860
if I thought the relationship was casual.

88
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,200
But I really had the thought of marrying her,

89
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,470
and I didn't really like my ex...

90
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,400
being fickle and indecisive.

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,609
It wasn't like I wanted her...

92
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,370
to be financially well-off.

93
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,810
I thought it would be nice if she had a stable job.

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,550
I stopped acting back then.

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,690
I was working part-time...

96
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,790
and studying at the academy.

97
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,430
So I did feel sorry.

98
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,660
You had a more stable life,

99
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,900
and I was different...

100
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,810
from people who worked as office workers.

101
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,880
I thought it would be better for you to meet someone like that.

102
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,080
So I said...

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,250
I didn't have the power to hold you if we broke up.

104
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,330
Do you remember that?

105
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,830
Yes.

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,600
How could I possibly ask you to stay?

107
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,170
Reality?

108
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,070
"Let's keep seeing each other since we love each other."

109
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,140
"Let's not break up."

110
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,650
I couldn't say those words in that situation.

111
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,890
You always said I only chased dreams.

112
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,770
He was a very practical person,

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,700
so he said this a lot when we were seeing each other.

114
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,500
"Don't just chase your dreams."

115
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,379
He also talked a lot about the limitations...

116
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,980
of arts and sports.

117
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,420
I was someone who had only done that all my life.

118
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,120
It felt like I was being denied.

119
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,460
I think I told him this a lot when we were dating.

120
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,800
"Stop seeing me."

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,570
"Meet someone who lives a stable life."

122
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,040
I'd never once...

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,610
felt small when meeting anyone.

124
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,510
But for the first time in my life,

125
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,050
I felt miserable.

126
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,430
I guess because it ended like that,

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,300
I felt like you never truly loved me.

128
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,869
It was the kind of love...

129
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,270
that you would let go when reality hit you.

130
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,540
That wasn't the only reason.

131
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Then?

132
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,270
It was also because we were so different.

133
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,079
You always sought change, and I always sought stability.

134
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,410
Our styles were so different.

135
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,719
- But...
- Then why did you say...

136
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,020
you wanted to marry me?

137
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,400
Despite everything,

138
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,700
I really wanted to.

139
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,170
I really liked you.

140
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,340
I thought I could handle everything.

141
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,740
I thought I could accept all the changes...

142
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,980
by becoming stable myself.

143
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,990
Reality.

144
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,520
About reality...

145
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,329
I don't think many people get married...

146
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,690
because they're prepared.

147
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,670
I thought, I wouldn't find someone...

148
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,740
I liked more than you.

149
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,710
- The state of my mind...
- All right.

150
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,580
We don't have much time left.

151
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,750
(The 10-minute conversation is almost over.)

152
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,550
Our...

153
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,990
Ex Room...

154
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,190
I'm already crying when I've not even entered it yet.

155
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,759
So I don't think I need to go in.

156
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,100
You can go in.

157
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,340
My ex hates me,

158
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,280
but she also feels sad.

159
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,550
I was actually a bit flustered.

160
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,250
There were some regrets,

161
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,160
but I wanted to see it...

162
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,630
and check how I felt.

163
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,170
I thought there would be traces...

164
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,200
about why I came to hate my ex so much...

165
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,740
in the Ex Room.

166
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,440
So I wanted my ex to see it.

167
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,640
(I want to kiss you.)

168
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,640
(P.S. It's a really nice moment, isn't it?)

169
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,880
(I'm walking while drunk.)

170
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,450
(I like it because it looks like you.)

171
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,990
(I love you more than anyone.)

172
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
When I saw the photos,

173
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,100
that's when I gasped.

174
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,240
I hardly had any photos.

175
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,740
But my ex had many photos.

176
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,349
(It felt like I had the whole world when I ran with you.)

177
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,120
That was unexpected.

178
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,600
I thought she may have wanted...

179
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,730
to forget about me quickly.

180
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:57,480
(Looking at the photos she kept makes him lose in thought.)

181
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,730
Our birthdays are one day apart.

182
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,159
When my birthday ends, it's my ex's birthday.

183
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,230
(Our birthdays are one day apart. January 22, January 23)

184
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,740
The cake was the cake my ex gave me on my birthday.

185
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,369
It felt like celebrating our birthdays together.

186
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,410
I liked that.

187
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,049
- Really?
- What?

188
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,319
It would be nice to be together on each other's birthdays.

189
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,089
They would remember each other every birthday.

190
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,150
Exactly.

191
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,630
That stuffed bear was a doll...

192
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,429
that I gave my patients to hold...

193
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,300
to endure the pain at my first workplace.

194
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,970
My ex liked hugging something while sleeping.

195
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,010
She said it was cute, so I gave it to her.

196
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,680
She had irritated skin.

197
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,750
I gave her ointments for basic treatment,

198
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,720
and I would also prescribe medicines for her.

199
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,519
She didn't use it all.

200
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
(My own doctor. My ex gave me all kinds of medicines.)

201
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,130
She should have used it well.

202
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,510
(If I ever get married, I want it to be with you.)

203
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,940
(If I ever get married, I want it to be with you.)

204
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,879
(A pre-ceremony video that never got to be played)

205
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,680
(A video filmed to be played at the wedding)

206
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,320
It was written that it was a video to be played before the ceremony.

207
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,520
I had forgotten that we even made such a video.

208
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,460
That was the saddest part.

209
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,230
We were a couple that thought so much...

210
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,899
about the future together.

211
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,940
(Wedding questions and answers between us)

212
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
But now, we're in this state.

213
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,279
(He's cool and reliable.)

214
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,550
(He's the first person who gave me stability.)

215
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,719
(I have a dream of forming a happy family.)

216
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,819
(I don't want to part with my partner.)

217
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,590
(It would be nice to have someone on my side forever.)

218
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,270
We were really in a serious relationship,

219
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,910
and we really liked each other.

220
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,290
There were texts we sent when we broke up.

221
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,570
That shocked me too.

222
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,139
(I think it's because you and I are in different situations.)

223
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,840
(I can't help but feel bad, but I won't control you.)

224
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,539
(That's true. Such a person wouldn't exist.)

225
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,940
(But still. This is who I am, and that won't change.)

226
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,910
(I think we'll keep clashing over this issue.)

227
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,220
They were memories of when we broke up.

228
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,450
I felt bad.

229
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,659
I didn't break up with her because I hated her.

230
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
(Yes, let's end this.)

231
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,170
(What was the specific reason for the breakup?)

232
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,470
I think...

233
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,640
I felt like she was restricting me.

234
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,979
It was after I quit my job.

235
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,849
There was about a two-week gap between my resignation...

236
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,710
and joining a new company.

237
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,490
I thought I could go on a trip to Gangwon Province...

238
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,689
for about two days.

239
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,260
So I told my ex, "I want to go to Gangwon Province alone."

240
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,030
She didn't let me do that.

241
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,729
I don't get so many resting days in my work.

242
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,470
We don't have annual leaves.

243
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,299
I told her I didn't like that she restricted me like that...

244
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,440
when I rarely got days off.

245
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,810
Normally, when I tried to do things,

246
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,920
she didn't want me to do it...

247
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,380
and didn't really like it.

248
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,389
I thought, "I also have my own life."

249
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,330
I felt a sense of resistance toward that.

250
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,830
Another issue was related to my female friends.

251
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,800
I had a friend I had known for more than ten years.

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,670
That friend was getting married.

253
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,709
Most of the people around him were Korean medicine doctors.

254
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,540
There were many married couples who were Korean medicine doctors.

255
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,680
As far as I know, she was quite well-off.

256
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,180
That female friend's...

257
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,410
groom-to-be was busy.

258
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
One day, she needed to pick...

259
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,250
her wedding dress.

260
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,260
Her female friends were coming,

261
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,290
but she also needed a man to see it, and she asked if my ex could come.

262
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,790
And he said he would.

263
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,560
I knew that he had no ulterior motive.

264
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,500
But I just felt...

265
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,000
so upset. My suppressed emotions burst out.

266
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,470
"How can you go to help another woman pick her wedding dress?"

267
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,080
After many compromises,

268
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,580
I had told him, "You can go."

269
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,680
I didn't feel fine, but I pretended I did.

270
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,050
After a couple of days,

271
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,390
I still couldn't understand it, and I snapped.

272
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,020
"Won Kyu, I've given it a thought."

273
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,030
"I don't think that's okay. How can you do this to me?"

274
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,200
"You shouldn't go help another woman choose her wedding dress."

275
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,070
In my ex's point of view, that was what made him angry.

276
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,340
"You said it was okay. You told me I could go."

277
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,070
Saying that, I got angry too.

278
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,280
I told her the things I couldn't understand.

279
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,150
I had a bad feeling that day.

280
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,520
After we hung up the phone,

281
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,950
I received a long instant message from him.

282
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,190
"Actually, I don't understand your perspective now."

283
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,500
"We recently argued a lot."

284
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,770
"So I told you to be more considerate of each other,"

285
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,969
"but this happened, only after a few days,"

286
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,639
(I think we'll keep clashing over this issue.)

287
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,069
(But still. This is who I am, and that won't change.)

288
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,709
We're different in so many ways.

289
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,539
(I wonder if I can narrow the gap.)

290
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,280
"This isn't a healthy relationship."

291
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,050
"You sound like you want to break up with me."

292
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,920
That was what I replied.

293
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,290
Then, "Okay. Let's stop this."

294
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,319
He replied right away.

295
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,490
("Okay. Let's stop this.")

296
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,730
I thought it wasn't something we could settle soon.

297
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,560
There were issues of personality and economy.

298
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,530
I felt that even if we meet again, those issues will recur.

299
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,930
- I see.
- What?

300
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,469
Do you hate it if your lover helps his friend pick a wedding dress?

301
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,739
- But that's...
- But that's sort of...

302
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,840
His friend is going to get married.

303
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,380
That's true.

304
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,379
But before he helps Ji Hyeon choose her wedding dress,

305
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,719
- he did that for his friend.
- Right.

306
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,579
I think that can make your lover upset.

307
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,619
It means something.

308
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,349
- It's a bit...
- It's because they also...

309
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,989
thought about getting married.

310
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,189
He didn't have to do it.

311
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,119
But she said okay after all.

312
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,189
- She let him go.
- She did.

313
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,329
And after a few days, she said, "That's not right."

314
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,829
Considering Won Kyu's personality...

315
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,870
What do you think about this? He said Ji Hyeon restricted him.

316
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,440
I think that didn't happen only once.

317
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,569
- I don't think so.
- Right.

318
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,939
- If I feel restricted...
- In Won Kyu's perspective,

319
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,809
he thought he was restricted.

320
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,909
I think he kept thinking.

321
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,879
"You tell me not to do this and not to do that."

322
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,019
"And this time, you're doing it again."

323
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,619
I think they conflicted many times.

324
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,589
If she had let him go on a trip and then complain...

325
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,019
- about the wedding dress thing...
- Right.

326
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,759
- Then it could have been nothing.
- He might have understood...

327
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,929
- that she didn't like it.
- Exactly.

328
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,559
The resentment built up.

329
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,159
- It accumulated.
- That's what happened.

330
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,869
But from Ji Hyeon's point, she confronted him on the wedding dress,

331
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,530
and he was breaking up with her for that.

332
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,599
- I know.
- She'd feel so insignificant.

333
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,209
- That could happen.
- She thought he wasn't sincere.

334
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,469
That's why she said it wasn't a sincere love.

335
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,110
She thought his love wasn't sincere.

336
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,239
Regarding these issues, it depends on people.

337
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,579
People can have different standards.

338
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,979
In a way, if they shared the same values and direction,

339
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,389
it was something they could have just let it slide.

340
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,089
- But since they're so different, - They are different.

341
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,160
Conflict is inevitable.

342
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,760
After we broke up like that,

343
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,630
I decided to achieve something, and the idea obsessed me.

344
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,870
I tried to forget him by my work and study.

345
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,840
Then he contacted me again.

346
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,910
It was seven months after the breakup.

347
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,220
She had gifted me a hoodie.

348
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,720
I thought a lot about our relationship.

349
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,420
I felt that I had a lot to apologize to her.

350
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,330
I didn't know whether she succeeded in getting employed,

351
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,860
but I thought I should support her if she was preparing for it.

352
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,400
So I told him.

353
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,140
I told him I was teaching at school.

354
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,910
I guess I was furious.

355
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,950
When I was having the hardest time,

356
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,850
when I had nothing, he gave up on our relationship.

357
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,990
Now that I was growing...

358
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,660
and establishing myself,

359
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,500
he changed his mind and tried to get back together.

360
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,730
Of course, if he meets me now, it would be much better...

361
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,500
as my situation got much better compared to the past.

362
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,770
I hate him so much.

363
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,980
I just hate him.

364
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,620
I don't know why she thought so.

365
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,690
I think she's misunderstood me.

366
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,629
She thinks I contacted her...

367
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,060
because she got a job,

368
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,830
but that's not true at all.

369
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,070
I had no idea how my ex was doing.

370
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,410
I wanted to clear it up quickly.

371
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,480
I thought I wanted to talk about that.

372
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,080
My ex is such a great person.

373
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,390
But back then, I overinterpreted...

374
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,120
her flaws and our differences,

375
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,930
and that covered up the good sides of her.

376
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,160
In fact, nobody's perfect.

377
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,370
But I wasn't satisfied with what I had...

378
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,069
and I craved more.

379
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,910
(I think I craved more.)

380
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,149
The piling up of misunderstandings finally reach a breaking point,

381
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,549
and they broke up.

382
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,190
Even after they're here, the misunderstanding remains.

383
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,890
They need to clear up the misunderstanding.

384
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,660
They do have different personalities.

385
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,629
- They're so different.
- Their values are also different.

386
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,259
It's just not for one person.

387
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,229
To be in a relationship together,

388
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,329
you have to be willing to give some things up.

389
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,729
You need to fully accept a part of the other.

390
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,439
- Right.
- If you don't accept that,

391
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,539
situations you can't understand recur.

392
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,739
And it seems that Ji Hyeon...

393
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,909
had her self-esteem dropped...

394
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,910
- after that relationship.
- I know.

395
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,009
That makes me feel sorry for her.

396
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,479
First of all, I want them to clear things up.

397
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,809
She thinks he contacted her because she got a job.

398
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,920
- That's a misunderstanding.
- That's a huge one.

399
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,430
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

400
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,029
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

401
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,939
(Hong Ji Yeon and Kim Woo Jin)

402
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,670
(Park Ji Hyeon and Jung Won Kyu)

403
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,639
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

404
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,310
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

405
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,690
(EXchange 4)

406
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,460
(Episode 11: You, Back Then)

407
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,130
(This time, Woo Jin entered.)

408
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,510
I thought I could see it only if I wanted to,

409
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,810
so I thought deeply about it.

410
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,250
The reason that concerns me...

411
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,620
was that I was afraid I'd get emotional after seeing it.

412
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,420
I was a bit scared.

413
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,430
(Woo Jin chose to go into the EX Room.)

414
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,700
Since I couldn't get my head straight yet,

415
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,070
I strongly believe that I'd be able to pull myself together...

416
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,510
only after I entered the Ex Room.

417
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,380
So I wanted to go and make up my mind.

418
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,030
Woo Jin might have wanted me to see it.

419
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,400
He might not have chosen it so that I could see it.

420
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,440
But I'm afraid I might lose my determination...

421
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,010
after I see the Ex Room...

422
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,410
because of our old memories.

423
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,250
That was what worried me.

424
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,120
(Ji Yeon fell into deep thought.)

425
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,660
(Woo Jin waits for Ji Yeon's decision.)

426
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,140
(Ji Yeon chose to enter the Ex Room too.)

427
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,280
I didn't expect it, but she entered.

428
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,389
Anyway, we can see how we started our relationship...

429
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,590
and how we ended it.

430
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,260
I guess my ex was also curious about the Ex Room.

431
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,470
He saw her.

432
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,769
Oh, my goodness.

433
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,640
I was certain that Ji Yeon wouldn't see it.

434
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,339
- I don't think he saw her shirt.
- He doesn't know about that.

435
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,080
He doesn't know about it, but he looks happy that she came.

436
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,209
He might not know that it's Won Kyu's shirt.

437
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,650
- That's possible.
- He doesn't.

438
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,190
(They first check the reasons why they broke up, from both sides.)

439
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,499
(Loneliness)

440
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,660
It was loneliness.

441
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,000
I realized I made her feel lonely.

442
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,110
It broke my heart.

443
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,650
It said "Neglect."

444
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,790
Looking at the word, I felt angry again.

445
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Right. That was why we broke up.

446
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,100
(The 10-minute conversation began.)

447
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,740
Why did you decide to be on this show, Woo Jin?

448
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,990
Why are you so mad at me?

449
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,620
Did I do anything wrong when we were in a relationship?

450
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,360
Be honest with yourself.

451
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,630
While I was dating you,

452
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
did I fall short in any way?

453
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,600
No.

454
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,140
I think I really did my best.

455
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,080
But why...

456
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,250
do you get mad at me so often recently...

457
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,649
and why do I keep saying sorry to you?

458
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,380
I apologize without even realizing it.

459
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,590
I have no idea what I did wrong...

460
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,920
after I joined this show.

461
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,329
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- When I joined this show,

462
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,260
I was determined to look for a new partner.

463
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,170
I told you so,

464
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,240
and I think I've never confused you about that.

465
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,939
Whenever you get busy,

466
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,010
you'd neglect me again, so I don't want to get back together.

467
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,650
I seriously told you that.

468
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,150
I meant what I said.

469
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,790
Why do you keep coming to me and getting angry?

470
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,990
I told him not to talk to me emotionally.

471
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,130
That makes things difficult for me.

472
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,029
If lingering affection, upset feelings,

473
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,899
and sympathy for my ex's difficulty...

474
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,370
shake my resolve, I'd hate that.

475
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,299
I don't want my ex to weaken my determination...

476
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,139
with those things.

477
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,769
To express such feelings of mine...

478
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,539
in ten minutes,

479
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,680
I poured it out to him.

480
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,780
Do you seriously want to get back together? Is that why?

481
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,879
Go there and find out...

482
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,690
what your heart truly wants.

483
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,560
I think I couldn't control my emotions well.

484
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,930
Anyway, what I did yesterday was my fault.

485
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,630
So...

486
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,070
I felt very sorry and ashamed.

487
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,279
If I don't pull myself together...

488
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,910
and talk to her in a provoking way,

489
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,820
it would be too inconsiderate of her.

490
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,050
Did you want to see the Ex Room?

491
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,490
Did you come here because you wanted to see it?

492
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,830
I didn't come here because I wanted to see it.

493
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,830
I was afraid you didn't choose to see it...

494
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,130
because you wanted me to see it.

495
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,340
You should go in.

496
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,939
I hope my ex looks at the whole picture...

497
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,250
of how we dated...

498
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,620
and thinks clearly...

499
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,080
if it is right to get back together.

500
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,950
You should go in.

501
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,690
Okay.

502
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,890
I will go in.

503
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,000
Go.

504
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,380
When I broke up with him,

505
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,910
I thought we had no future.

506
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,580
I don't want my resolved mind to change.

507
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,010
It's my ex's place.

508
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,090
Since I worked on weekends,

509
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,860
our dating schedules didn't match.

510
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,930
So we dated at my ex's place a lot.

511
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,029
They decorated the room with a white-toned interior,

512
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,609
making it look similar to my ex's place.

513
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,210
(With white-toned interior items, it looks similar to his ex's place.)

514
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,579
While we we were in the relationship,

515
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,480
it was the place where we spent the most time.

516
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,489
So it was a very meaningful place.

517
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,560
(A precious hideout where their memories accumulated)

518
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,030
Oh, my.

519
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,329
How can they make it look like her place?

520
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,799
They said they often dated at her place.

521
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,570
They mostly spent time at her place.

522
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,469
To think they recreated the place of their memories...

523
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,939
He's visiting the place again, by himself.

524
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,840
It's a place he can never go again.

525
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,440
And they recreated it.

526
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,080
First, I saw...

527
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,550
the pajamas.

528
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,660
There were my pajamas, which my ex gave me as a gift.

529
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,990
There were also matching pajamas.

530
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,499
In those pajamas, we were chatting, and before we knew it,

531
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,899
it was always morning when we finished.

532
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,270
(The memory of talking all night in matching pajamas)

533
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,430
Actually, that space was like our photo spot.

534
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,530
It was the elevator of my ex's place.

535
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,170
(Friendly Neighbors, Warm Greetings)

536
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,840
Since we mostly dated at her place,

537
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,079
whether we were on the way out or on the way home,

538
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,809
the elevator was the space where we took photos all the time.

539
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,450
(The elevator at Ji Yeon's place was their mirror selfie spot.)

540
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,550
(Woo Jin comes to the kitchen area.)

541
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,790
(I'll make you something tasty every Wednesday. Screenshot it.)

542
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,070
Since my ex lived alone,

543
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,740
she often skipped meals.

544
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,870
I felt bad, so...

545
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,540
I bought ingredients and cooked for her.

546
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,610
I divided up the dishes into small portions for convenience...

547
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,079
and told her how to eat them.

548
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,919
(Perhaps I should make you stew every Sunday. Make sure you eat.)

549
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,750
(Since I kept boiling seaweed soup, it became tastier.)

550
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,859
Whenever my ex wanted to eat something,

551
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,029
I made it for her right away.

552
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,430
(Woo Jin cooked whatever Ji Yeon wanted to eat.)

553
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,900
I really liked my ex a lot.

554
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,909
(She was different from my ideal type.)

555
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,339
(But since I liked her as herself, )

556
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,640
(she became my ideal type.)

557
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,650
(My days off are yours.)

558
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,650
(My days off are yours.)

559
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,619
I often told my ex, "My days off are yours."

560
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,330
(My days off are yours.)

561
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,100
But something I told my ex before breaking up...

562
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,600
was printed in a large font.

563
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,140
(Don't just assume that my days off are yours.)

564
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,710
I told her not to just assume that my days off were hers.

565
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,650
(Woo Jin's words changed from the beginning.)

566
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,720
My work was important,

567
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,220
so we began to see each other less.

568
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,859
(Don't just assume that my days off are yours.)

569
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,630
(Ji Yeon began waiting for him to contact her.)

570
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,950
She must've been very lonely.

571
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,990
Yes.

572
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,390
Honestly, I never thought about it when we were dating.

573
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,060
I'm glad my ex didn't check out the Ex Room...

574
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,169
because it would've made her determined...

575
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,470
not to go down that road again.

576
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,410
It made my heart ache a lot.

577
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,290
He upset me on many occasions.

578
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,960
I knew that he wouldn't be the same as he was in the beginning,

579
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,329
but I couldn't help but compare the two.

580
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,060
"He wasn't like this back then."

581
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,540
"I'm really exhausted, Ji Yeon."

582
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,709
"It isn't easy to come here."

583
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,010
He said that.

584
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,620
"Once my ex open up his business, things will get better."

585
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,460
"It isn't that he has lost his interest in me."

586
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,190
"He's just busy."

587
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,560
I kept steeling my heart with those thoughts.

588
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,370
But when I steeled my heart,

589
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,670
he crushed it.

590
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,140
When I did it again, he crushed it again.

591
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,710
Those moments piled up...

592
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,520
and I realized that a breakup was the only possible outcome.

593
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,150
I ended things sternly.

594
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,999
(My days off are yours.)

595
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,670
(Don't just assume that my days off are yours.)

596
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,810
I was negligent and it hurt her badly.

597
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,150
I'm sorry and grateful...

598
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,050
for many things.

599
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,690
I want to go back to the past.

600
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,090
I had that thought the most.

601
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,299
(At a place where Ji Yeon felt lonely, )

602
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,540
(Woo Jin remains alone.)

603
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,149
I'm glad Ji Yeon didn't enter.

604
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,519
- She would've broken down.
- Seriously.

605
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,819
Even if Ji Yeon had entered,

606
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,959
she wouldn't have changed her mind...

607
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,689
- about Won Kyu.
- Of course not.

608
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,019
It would've made her cry...

609
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,859
and let go of the past for sure.

610
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,929
- That's right.
- That's right.

611
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,059
- She would've been more certain.
- That's right.

612
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,499
- She would've been more certain.
- That's right.

613
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,229
Seeing "Don't just assume that my days off are yours" again...

614
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,270
- Seeing it again...
- That's right.

615
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,039
I bet entering the Ex Room made Woo Jin more hung up.

616
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,739
- I know. I bet he's very regretful.
- He must be very regretful.

617
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,509
Rooting for Ji Yeon...

618
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,949
is the only way he can redeem himself.

619
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,650
If I were in Woo Jin's shoes,

620
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,849
I'd try to change her mind until the very end.

621
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,219
- Until the very end.
- Even if there's no hope?

622
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,519
I'd try a different approach.

623
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,789
- I'd use nice words...
- That's right.

624
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,459
And root for her.

625
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,730
If that tactic doesn't change her mind,

626
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,559
I'd accept that the relationship had ended for real.

627
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,629
She might change her mind.

628
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,169
- Never.
- I know it's unlikely.

629
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,500
- It'll never happen.
- Also,

630
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,039
he should try until the end...

631
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,439
- in order to get over her.
- Then he'd have no regrets. Right.

632
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,840
He must be so lost on what to do.

633
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,850
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

634
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,020
(Yoo Sik returns after checking out the Ex Room.)

635
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

636
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,150
Did you eat something?

637
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,119
Spicy pork. No, not spicy pork. What did we eat?

638
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,660
- Boiled pork.
- Bossam? Boiled pork.

639
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,490
- Boiled pork?
- Yes.

640
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,460
It's in the fridge.

641
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,700
I don't need to eat.

642
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,400
Did you decide to talk casually to everyone?

643
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,200
- Yes.
- To men?

644
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,040
Baek Hyun and I speak casually to each other.

645
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,980
Let's speak casually to each other.

646
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,649
I'm okay with that.

647
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,680
Okay.

648
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,490
I want to make something, but there are no ingredients.

649
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,230
You should just eat boiled pork.

650
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,370
I'll come upstairs and eat later.

651
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,710
Okay.

652
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,650
(Sighing)

653
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,990
I'm the type to go to sleep if I'm feeling down.

654
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,160
So I decided to stay in my room and go to sleep.

655
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,130
(Min Kyung becomes thoughtful after running into Yoo Sik.)

656
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,940
I was just curious about what he was thinking.

657
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,030
He stayed in his room for a while,

658
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,870
so I went to his room.

659
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,810
When I opened the door and peeked inside,

660
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,280
Yoo Sik...

661
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,920
was lying down.

662
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,950
I wondered if he was struggling emotionally.

663
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,190
I thought,

664
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,060
"Was there something he didn't expect in the Ex Room?"

665
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,000
I was sad and confused.

666
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,100
(Min Kyung comes to the room and falls asleep.)

667
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,370
Yoo Sik.

668
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,810
(Sighing)

669
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:25,320
(She wakes up as she calls for Yoo Sik.)

670
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,860
I have a headache.

671
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,410
Why do I keep crying?

672
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,980
It's hard.

673
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,589
- Did she talk in her sleep?
- Did she talk in her sleep?

674
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,620
Really?

675
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,720
I guess she woke up crying.

676
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,720
Did she wake up crying? Oh, no.

677
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,559
Min Kyung didn't think about getting back together with her ex.

678
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,959
- That's right.
- I think that's changing...

679
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,399
- little by little.
- Does she want him back now?

680
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,269
But Yoo Sik doesn't know that.

681
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,429
That's the biggest problem.

682
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,669
She doesn't make it clear.

683
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,639
- She woke up calling his name.
- I know.

684
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
He must be on her mind.

685
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:17,509
They must've fought or broken up in her dream.

686
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,679
- I know.
- What is she going to do?

687
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,010
I'm in tears.

688
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,150
(Won Kyu comes back after checking out the Ex Room.)

689
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

690
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,220
- You're back.
- Yes.

691
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,990
I took a nap with the robot vacuum running.

692
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,490
- Would you like an apple?
- Yes.

693
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,900
Sit down and eat.

694
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,220
Have you been out to the garden?

695
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,590
- The chairs? Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,789
- Why do you ask?
- It's a very nice spot.

697
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,360
You always sit there.

698
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,830
Why don't we talk there as we eat this?

699
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,200
- This apple? Outside?
- Yes.

700
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,170
Sure.

701
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,340
- I'll bring a sun umbrella.
- Okay.

702
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,150
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

703
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,120
He asked me to step outside to eat an apple with him.

704
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,090
What is it?

705
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,300
Are we eating an apple here? That's nice.

706
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,880
Why did you want to talk to me?

707
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,550
Just because. We haven't talked much.

708
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,250
Have you been to the Ex Room?

709
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,150
Of course.

710
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,449
But I don't know why you think that.

711
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,519
What do you mean?

712
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,160
I didn't reach out to you because you had become stable.

713
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,630
- I didn't know anything.
- But even back then...

714
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,429
Right. You reached out to me without knowing anything.

715
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,430
Yes.

716
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,000
I gave you a present.

717
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,510
"I want to get back together with you."

718
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,540
- You didn't say that.
- I didn't say that.

719
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,510
Exactly. I never said that I wanted to get back together with you...

720
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,149
- because you had become...
- That wasn't the reason?

721
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,620
Stable.

722
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,890
It was strange that you didn't say that you wanted me back.

723
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,760
It was your birthday.

724
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,700
You were on my mind and I wanted to root for you.

725
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,670
- Don't take this as an attack.
- Okay.

726
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,040
We've known each other for many years.

727
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,210
Have you developed...

728
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,710
an interest that rivals what we had?

729
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,110
- An interest that rivals it?
- Yes.

730
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,850
Of course, it doesn't rival what we had.

731
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,690
How could it rival what we had?

732
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,260
But we already had a relationship...

733
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,530
and hurt each other.

734
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,060
With someone new, there's no pain.

735
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,230
There's no memory of pain.

736
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,640
So it isn't a matter...

737
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,040
of whether or not it rivals what we had.

738
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,580
With someone new, I have more expectations.

739
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,380
There are people who show...

740
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,350
sides you've never shown.

741
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,950
Everyone is so sweet.

742
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,490
I was so surprised, Won Kyu.

743
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,530
It made me a bit sad.

744
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,500
"Did everyone have such an affectionate relationship?"

745
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,840
I'll just lay out my emotions.

746
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,670
Firstly, you're very...

747
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,310
That might be a ruse, but you appear to be doing well.

748
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,750
When I see that,

749
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,880
I feel jealous and...

750
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,150
I don't like that.

751
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,160
I don't know if I'm in a position to not like that.

752
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,570
That's how I feel.

753
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:39,970
You don't like that?

754
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,910
You don't like how I behave. You feel jealous.

755
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,880
I don't like how you behave. I feel jealous. Despite that,

756
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,480
I have an idea of what your happiness is.

757
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,050
What's my happiness?

758
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,990
Meeting someone you want.

759
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,060
Your ideal type is nothing like me.

760
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,500
Yours is nothing like me either.

761
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,500
You like fair women with a high nose bridge.

762
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,270
I have a small nose.

763
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,440
From the beginning,

764
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,970
when we dated...

765
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,440
You like small-boned women.

766
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,640
You like tall women.

767
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,050
- That's...
- You even called me short.

768
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,750
- We did talk about that.
- Are you kidding me?

769
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,550
I don't mean the outward appearances.

770
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,230
Were you the one at the Talking Room?

771
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,070
I was there too.

772
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,040
- Was there someone else as well?
- Yes.

773
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,240
I think I was mistaken.

774
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,940
- About what?
- It doesn't concern you.

775
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,180
I can see whom you're interested in.

776
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,150
I don't exactly hide it.

777
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,160
Why do you annoy me so much?

778
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,160
You're the one to talk. Why did you eat ramyeon late at night?

779
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,860
You rarely eat ramyeon.

780
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,700
I guess your heart does flutter.

781
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,200
- Because of other people?
- Yes.

782
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,380
I won't answer that.

783
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,850
Let's go back inside.

784
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,590
This spot is really nice.

785
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,460
(Sighing)

786
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,260
So when will you have a date with me? Let's do it tomorrow.

787
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,730
What?

788
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,430
I asked you to go on a date with me.

789
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,870
I'll give it some thought.

790
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,970
When will you give me an answer?

791
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,339
Give me an answer by the end of today.

792
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,539
I'll do it by the end of today.

793
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,350
I'll do it before we send out a text today.

794
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,490
The two of us on a date? Will that be fun?

795
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,060
Don't do that.

796
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,560
See?

797
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,190
- Don't say, "Will that be fun?" - You aren't affectionate at all.

798
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:41,380
(A conversation between them ends.)

799
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,560
- How strange.
- It's strange between them.

800
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,829
Although their words are harsh, there's a good rhythm between them.

801
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,729
Won Kyu becomes a different person...

802
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,899
- when he's with Ji Hyeon.
- Right?

803
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,900
A totally different person.

804
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,360
The two are too different.

805
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,599
But I don't feel that the misunderstanding has been resolved.

806
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,309
Why does Won Kyu want to go on a date with Ji Hyeon so badly?

807
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,709
To confirm his feelings, to see whether he has...

808
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,439
- lingering feelings for her or not.
- Right.

809
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,509
He'd be able to find out if the two went on a date.

810
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,349
- Possibly.
- He seems like the type.

811
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,609
Won Kyu simply wants to know.

812
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,080
Even in the situation...

813
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,979
when Won Kyu said...

814
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,719
the date wasn't for fun,

815
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,089
I could tell...

816
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,559
- he was being realistic.
- Totally.

817
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,619
Since they have even thought...

818
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,620
- of marriage, - Right.

819
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,159
- fun isn't the problem right now.
- True.

820
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
- You're on point.
- What she meant was,

821
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:27,829
"Will we still get along well?"

822
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,230
But Won Kyu...

823
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,129
- It comes across...
- He's different.

824
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,540
Like a childish fight between adults.

825
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,840
What? You're still here?

826
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,310
- Is he still outside?
- Yes, it looks like it.

827
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,280
Did something happen?

828
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,380
Maybe.

829
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,490
I'll be right back.

830
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,550
Are you going to Mr. Won Kyu?

831
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,959
"Mr. Won Kyu?" I haven't heard that in ages.

832
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,120
To Won Kyu.

833
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,160
After all, he's my roommate.

834
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,170
You missed me, didn't you?

835
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,140
- It looks great on you.
- What does?

836
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,479
- Your outfit.
- My outfit?

837
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,609
- You can borrow it if you'd like.
- No, it's okay.

838
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,280
- I'm serious.
- It suits you.

839
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,880
You saw yesterday, right? Anyone can borrow anything of mine.

840
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,090
- Just open my closet.
- Right, I remember.

841
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,950
Come to think of it, I lost one of my clothes.

842
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,859
Which one?

843
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,290
Ji Yeon took my Andersson Bell top.

844
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,389
- The heart one?
- Yes, now that I think about it.

845
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,560
Mine was the Andersson... No, ADERERROR top.

846
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,530
Yun Nyeong took it.

847
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,470
What's that?

848
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,670
Should I greet them?

849
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:55,350
(Ji Hyeon is bothered by her ex and Yoo Sik, who are outside.)

850
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,850
I didn't know we could be seen.

851
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,890
(Ji Hyeon comes out to the yard immediately.)

852
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,900
(Ji Hyeon, Won Kyu, and Yoo Sik sit together again.)

853
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:15,700
(Yoo Sik and Won Kyu have stopped talking.)

854
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,740
What else should we talk about?

855
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,180
Shall we leave?

856
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,880
What?

857
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,579
Shall we leave?

858
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,950
- To leave me alone?
- Yes.

859
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,390
- Was that what you wanted?
- No.

860
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,160
I'd like to have a chat.

861
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,140
- With him.
- I see.

862
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,670
- No, we'll head inside.
- No.

863
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,210
Here is a bit...

864
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,380
Stay.

865
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,479
- But...
- I have to ask Yoo Sik.

866
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,680
I'd be happy to talk.

867
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,660
So in short, I should just stay seated on this chair?

868
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,090
Fine, I'll be alone.

869
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,660
(Ji Hyeon and Yoo Sik leave.)

870
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,100
Wanting to talk,

871
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:19,770
the two left.

872
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,210
I knew my ex was interested in Yoo Sik.

873
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,340
I saw it in person.

874
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,750
But that situation still upset me.

875
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,350
(Ji Hyeon and Yoo Sik have come to the terrace.)

876
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,989
(Why did you want to talk to him?)

877
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,120
What nice weather.

878
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,930
The one who was...

879
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,800
in the Talking Room was Won Kyu, not Yoo Sik.

880
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,800
What? Does that mean Yoo Sik and I...

881
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,040
don't feel the same way?

882
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,210
That was what crossed my mind.

883
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,779
We went on two dates.

884
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
Yes.

885
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,750
Is there someone you want to get to know better?

886
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,550
Like someone you're interested in.

887
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,060
Honestly, I haven't had any deep conversations with anyone.

888
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,599
Didn't you go on the keyword date?

889
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
I did.

890
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,670
I wanted to ask if you had someone you wanted to get to know better.

891
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,470
I think I was curious about someone.

892
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,350
That was why I wanted to talk to her.

893
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,419
I'm not entirely certain,

894
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,390
but things are starting to become clear.

895
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,400
It was a bit of a letdown.

896
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,430
I was...

897
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,540
I was mistaken.

898
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,810
What went wrong? When did things go wrong?

899
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,280
Those were the thoughts I had.

900
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,610
Are you sincere?

901
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,150
- About what?
- Everything.

902
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,620
I'm being so sincere, which has me...

903
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,889
- Scared?
- Worried.

904
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,930
- Same here.
- Am I the only sincere one?

905
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,500
But because I'm sincere,

906
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,070
I can't make quick decisions.

907
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,140
True.

908
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,610
(Ji Hyeon has realized Yoo Sik's true feelings.)

909
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,479
She is disappointed.

910
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,709
I'm sure Ji Hyeon keeps thinking how great it'd be...

911
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,379
if Yoo Sik's feelings were the same as hers.

912
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,149
- Right.
- But hearing that he was curious...

913
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,349
about others would be a letdown.

914
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,419
What's more, Yoo Sik said...

915
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,819
things were becoming clearer.

916
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:58,590
But I don't think that meant Ji Hyeon.

917
00:59:58,930 --> 00:59:59,930
Totally.

918
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:01,299
Ji Hyeon must've felt that...

919
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,860
it wasn't about her.

920
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,799
She thinks Yoo Sik wasn't in her Talking Room.

921
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,169
There's that misunderstanding too.

922
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,869
But even if you have feelings, if the other party doesn't,

923
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,370
- it's not easy at all.
- No, it's not.

924
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,579
Ji Hyeon is going all in on Yoo Sik right now.

925
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,010
But at this rate,

926
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,649
Ji Hyeon is making me worried.

927
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,710
Exactly.

928
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,350
(At that moment, Ji Yeon has returned.)

929
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,520
Hi.

930
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,160
(Surprised)

931
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,660
Pretty, right?

932
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,660
It suits me, right?

933
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,360
It really does.

934
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,200
Let's return it to him.

935
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,710
How come? You won't wear it?

936
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,480
No, and wearing it doesn't feel right.

937
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,510
Why? I wore mine.

938
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,010
No.

939
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,980
He's not someone I'm interested in.

940
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,690
(Meanwhile, Hyeon Ji has entered the Choice Room.)

941
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,550
Upon reading what was inside the envelope...

942
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,190
I knew my ex wouldn't go inside.

943
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,839
I kind of wanted to know if my ex...

944
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,310
still had my belongings.

945
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,920
(Baek Hyun enters the room after her.)

946
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,900
It said only one could enter the Ex Room.

947
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,540
It was either me or my ex.

948
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,209
Should I take a look...

949
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,439
at my memories with Hyeon Ji and sort out things?

950
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,440
Or...

951
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,750
should I not look and just hold on to my feelings?

952
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,220
Hyeon Ji might've just left,

953
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,230
so I wondered if I should go in.

954
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,370
I never thought I'd hesitate.

955
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,380
But I did, and for quite a while.

956
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,560
I wanted to stick...

957
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,360
to my current feelings,

958
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,330
so I didn't enter the Ex Room.

959
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,900
- What?
- Goodness.

960
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
- Baek Hyun...
- What a big twist.

961
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,900
Seriously?

962
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,010
(In the end, Baek Hyun didn't enter the Ex Room.)

963
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:47,920
(Your ex didn't choose the Ex Room. Enter the Ex Room.)

964
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,360
It infuriates me.

965
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,690
It does.

966
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,370
I keep getting hurt.

967
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:06,370
(Without a single conversation, Hyeon Ji enters the Ex Room.)

968
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,969
(Hyeon Ji, you're good luck to me.)

969
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:07,400
(The clover Baek Hyun found in the military and gifted)

970
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,809
(Things I want to do with Hyeon Ji)

971
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,109
(Visit the zoo, go to the milk tea place in Maebong Station, )

972
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,710
(go to an Italian pasta place, swim and surf in the night sea)

973
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:23,550
(A space where memories of the past relationship remain)

974
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,190
I wanted to leave the moment I opened the door.

975
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,560
I didn't have the confidence to look at them.

976
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:36,559
I regretted it the moment I opened the door.

977
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,970
(I regretted going into the Ex Room.)

978
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,990
(Facing the past memories again is tough.)

979
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:06,959
(Hoping that both you and I become...)

980
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,060
(a part of each other and indispensable to each other.)

981
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,130
(I thought that, besides her, I didn't want to date anyone.)

982
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,300
(Let's get married, Hyeon Ji.)

983
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,990
When Baek Hyun was in the military,

984
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:35,260
he wrote me a letter every single day.

985
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,229
(To Hyeon Ji from a soldier on the last day of January)

986
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,589
(To Hyeon Ji, whom I'll marry)

987
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:40,699
(To whom I miss)

988
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,829
(My future wife)

989
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:42,999
(To my princess)

990
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,430
(To my dear Hyeon Ji)

991
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,800
(I miss you, Hyeon Ji.)

992
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,479
(Thank you for liking someone like me.)

993
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,079
(All I want is to be with you. That day will come, right?)

994
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,920
(Thank you for appearing before me.)

995
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:06,620
(Have a happy relationship with me.)

996
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,660
(I'll look at you as if I'm looking at a flower.)

997
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,330
He truly had...

998
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,770
deep feelings for me.

999
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,240
(Their memories are laid in a corner.)

1000
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,569
(To Baek Hyun, who loves poems)

1001
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,640
("Written on Snow" by Na Tae Ju)

1002
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:21,330
(Another object that Baek Hyun had kept)

1003
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:26,900
(A journal Baek Hyun had written in the military)

1004
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:32,339
(There's someone I'm really interested in.)

1005
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:35,780
To be honest, I really missed Hyeon Ji when I was in the military.

1006
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,710
But in the military,

1007
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,480
I couldn't tell my feelings to anyone.

1008
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,520
That was why I started keeping a journal. And in there...

1009
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,990
are feelings that Hyeon Ji has no idea about.

1010
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,799
(I dearly miss Hyeon Ji...)

1011
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,070
(and want to hear her voice.)

1012
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:00,870
(Hyeon Ji, whom I dearly like)

1013
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:06,570
(I really miss Park Hyeon Ji.)

1014
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,600
While keeping a journal alone,

1015
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,940
he wrote about me numerous times.

1016
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,519
(I'm not sure if you're flying, but when I'm outside...)

1017
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,450
Seeing the planes that fly around...

1018
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,960
reminded him of me.

1019
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,399
During training, I looked up at the sky multiple times...

1020
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,600
since Hyeon Ji was a flight attendant.

1021
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:06,029
Every time a plane flew past, I missed her terribly.

1022
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,600
Is Hyeon Ji in that plane?

1023
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,669
That was when I was reminded of her a lot.

1024
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:13,210
(The sky is beautiful. It's one I want to look up at with someone.)

1025
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,470
Out of everything, the one that stuck with me the most...

1026
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,750
was the water I had bought for him after a flight.

1027
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,520
He still had it.

1028
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,730
Little did I expect that.

1029
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:15,740
(A bottle of water that left a deep impression on Hyeon Ji's memory)

1030
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:17,540
He didn't open it.

1031
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,370
Goodness.

1032
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,109
(It's time for us to stop. You've gone through a lot.)

1033
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,780
(It's impossible to communicate with you.)

1034
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,259
(Stop lying.)

1035
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:13,059
Things that we said during our fights were written.

1036
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:14,330
(It's time for us to stop. You've gone through a lot.)

1037
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,929
(It's impossible to communicate with you.)

1038
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,530
(We fought again today. How many times have we fought?)

1039
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:21,299
It was very hard to read things that we said...

1040
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,940
in the heat of the moment.

1041
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,620
I was alone again in recalling our memories.

1042
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,620
It was terrible.

1043
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,150
It was the most passionate relationship possible during my 20s.

1044
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,920
She was my everything during that time.

1045
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,160
I spent all my time on her.

1046
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:18,460
We got along in every way.

1047
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,130
We had similar tastes in food.

1048
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,230
We both liked similar things like music and traveling.

1049
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,310
Her personality was the opposite of mine.

1050
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:34,840
The most important in a relationship is accepting the other's difference.

1051
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:36,780
We couldn't accept each other's differences.

1052
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:38,480
During our conversation,

1053
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,079
I would say, "This is what disappointed me."

1054
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,650
Her answer would be, "You disappointed me too."

1055
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,690
That drove me crazy.

1056
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,390
As I was in my 20s during our relationship,

1057
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:53,790
I wasn't emotionally mature enough.

1058
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,560
We argued a lot.

1059
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,730
We hurt each other's feelings a lot.

1060
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,900
That was how our relationship was.

1061
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:04,009
I don't exactly remember when we broke up.

1062
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:07,780
We broke up and got back together countless times.

1063
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,910
After breaking up and getting back together repetitively,

1064
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:13,780
when I was...

1065
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,150
emotionally drained,

1066
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,990
I broke up with her.

1067
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:33,599
It was a relationship with most regrets...

1068
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,840
among all the relationships I had.

1069
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,739
What would have happened...

1070
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,740
if I had been warmer to her at that moment?

1071
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,140
What if I had...

1072
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,710
let more things slide?

1073
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:49,050
What if we had met when I was more emotionally mature?

1074
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,450
Could we have been more mature in our relationship?

1075
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,460
I thought about such things a lot.

1076
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,399
The one that Baek Hyun is interested in is...

1077
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,699
much different from how I was...

1078
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,840
when we were together. She gives him a sense of stability.

1079
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,310
It was very hard for me.

1080
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,629
Baek Hyun loved Hyeon Ji tremendously.

1081
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,570
- Yes.
- Right.

1082
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,639
He had kept the bottle of water she gave him as a gift.

1083
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,910
He had kept that bottle of water for four years without opening it.

1084
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,339
He couldn't make himself throw it away.

1085
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:26,249
It was his most passionate relationship in his 20s.

1086
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,479
What he said is accurate...

1087
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,449
because it was only possible during that time.

1088
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,750
- You know what I mean?
- I do.

1089
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:35,860
The idea of getting over her ex seems impossible.

1090
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,729
Based on her memories with him,

1091
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,460
she would want to get back with him even more.

1092
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,099
Hyeon Ji is very well aware of it.

1093
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,929
- She realizes that someone...
- Right.

1094
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,030
Loved her this much.

1095
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:48,839
It must be why she can't forget about him after five years.

1096
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,939
She cried so much even after four years.

1097
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,509
- Right.
- Their relationship was impactful.

1098
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,009
She cried as if they had broken up recently.

1099
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,010
- Right.
- Right.

1100
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,810
If Baek Hyun had come into the Ex Room, what would've happened?

1101
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:02,849
He might think that he's done his best.

1102
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,089
I think that's how...

1103
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,819
- Baek Hyun feels right now.
- Right?

1104
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,420
He gave his all in the relationship.

1105
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,689
- So he could feel indifferent...
- Right.

1106
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,329
- about it now.
- When you give all to someone,

1107
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,359
you don't regret it.

1108
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,829
Hyeon Ji feels resentful about recalling their past alone...

1109
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:21,470
and getting emotional about it.

1110
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:26,070
If she's the only one with lingering feelings for him,

1111
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:28,980
she'd want to get back with him no matter what.

1112
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,850
I think that they'll get back together...

1113
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,680
even if they break up again.

1114
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,080
Couples like them could stay connected without realizing it.

1115
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:42,990
(Yun Nyeong came into the Choice Room.)

1116
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,609
At the beginning, I'd thought about it more than now.

1117
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:02,640
But now, I'm interested in someone else.

1118
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,810
"Should I still take a look at the Ex Room?"

1119
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,620
"Should I reconsider it?"

1120
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,780
After having such thoughts,

1121
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:16,290
I didn't think I'd feel differently after seeing the Ex Room.

1122
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,330
Neither did I want to look back at our memories.

1123
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,340
So I turned around and came back out.

1124
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,379
(Yun Nyeong didn't choose the Ex Room.)

1125
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,449
(Why didn't you want to look back at your memories with your ex?)

1126
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,220
I really liked him at first,

1127
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:48,060
but later... Well...

1128
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,730
I mostly remember the hard times between us.

1129
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,400
In the Ex Room,

1130
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:00,469
I didn't leave any memories.

1131
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,840
I didn't put any souvenirs either.

1132
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,240
After breaking up with him,

1133
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,510
I moved on completely.

1134
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,550
I think I wanted to erase him...

1135
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:14,450
from my memory.

1136
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,950
(Yun Nyeong's ex will be revealed now.)

1137
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,260
Yes, it's about time.

1138
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,919
It must be Jae Hyeong.

1139
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,359
- Jae Hyeong?
- No way.

1140
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,389
I bet it's someone new.

1141
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,959
- I don't think it's Jae Hyeong.
- It will be someone new.

1142
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,129
- Someone new?
- Someone new.

1143
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,130
All of a sudden?

1144
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,530
(Yun Nyeong's ex will be revealed now.)

1145
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:37,840
(A week before moving in at Seongsu-dong)

1146
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:56,559
(Yun Nyeong's ex, )

1147
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,990
(Yun Nyeong's ex, Jae Hyeong)

1148
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,999
Is it Jae Hyeong?

1149
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,599
- So it's him.
- We never saw them interact.

1150
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,740
They make a good match.

1151
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,169
(Yun Nyeong's ex, Jae Hyeong)

1152
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:14,170
I can't believe it.

1153
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,980
It's unbelievable.

1154
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,410
Long time, no see.

1155
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,719
You haven't changed at all.

1156
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,150
- I haven't?
- No. I've changed, haven't I?

1157
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,849
- No.
- Have I not changed?

1158
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:28,389
- You have the same vibe.
- Really?

1159
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,060
- Yes.
- What kind of vibe did I have?

1160
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,090
It's similar to now. You smile a lot.

1161
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,500
- It's awkward.
- This is so funny.

1162
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,170
It's been a while. We haven't seen each other for six years.

1163
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,370
It's been a long time.

1164
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,910
We haven't talked in a long time.

1165
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:48,439
(Exhaling)

1166
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,680
It feels strange.

1167
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,980
I agree.

1168
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:54,680
Have you thought about being on the show with me?

1169
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,850
At first, I refused to do it.

1170
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,620
I didn't want to be on the show,

1171
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,730
but I don't know. It just happened.

1172
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,290
How about you?

1173
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,030
I actually wanted to talk to you once.

1174
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,030
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Maybe it was for my own greed.

1175
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,240
I know it was a long time ago,

1176
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,479
but the relationships I had when I was young and immature...

1177
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,610
- Right.
- They stay...

1178
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:26,180
- in my memory longer.
- Really?

1179
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,420
I feel so honored.

1180
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,720
You're saying that you thought of me of all people.

1181
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,160
We started our relationship on March 14, 2018.

1182
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:46,570
It ended on April 7, 2019.

1183
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,240
When I met him for the first time, we weren't going out.

1184
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:52,040
It was at a snack bar.

1185
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,310
We were high school students.

1186
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,279
"He's the one who's very popular,"

1187
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,279
"and he's a good dancer."

1188
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,180
That's what I thought when I saw him for the first time.

1189
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,419
Yes, I thought that he was famous.

1190
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,889
He was handsome,

1191
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,859
and he was also a good dancer.

1192
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:13,230
People said that he was one of the top students.

1193
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,130
I thought, "He really is handsome."

1194
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,029
That's what I thought.

1195
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:19,330
"He's very handsome."

1196
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:24,139
While saying hello to a friend at the cafeteria,

1197
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,040
I saw her for the first time next to my friend.

1198
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:29,280
I thought that she was pretty.

1199
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,049
As she was popular,

1200
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,309
I knew her name.

1201
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,079
"So that's her. She's pretty."

1202
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,920
That's what I thought at first.

1203
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,689
I had a friend who was older than me.

1204
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,619
She asked me to go to the movies with her.

1205
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,659
She said that she'd bring one of her friends.

1206
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:46,490
It was Jae Hyeong who joined us.

1207
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:50,129
After watching a movie together, we became Facebook friends.

1208
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:53,930
After that, we stayed in contact.

1209
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,539
I had a feeling that he was interested in me.

1210
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,770
Yes, he was giving me the green light.

1211
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:02,439
I went to see her often.

1212
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,750
We stayed in touch all night long.

1213
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,879
Although I was exhausted in the morning,

1214
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,150
I was in a good mood when I opened my eyes.

1215
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:15,320
Maybe my ex felt frustrated, so she asked me...

1216
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,990
out first.

1217
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:20,390
I agreed.

1218
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,230
She kissed me on the cheek.

1219
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,630
That's how our relationship started.

1220
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:28,640
She confessed her love to me first and kissed me on the cheek.

1221
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,370
Back then, a kiss was a big deal to me.

1222
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,840
It was surprising...

1223
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,610
and flustering in a happy way.

1224
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:41,949
It was the sweetest moment for me...

1225
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,520
during my first 20 years.

1226
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:49,460
(That's how they became lovers from high school colleagues.)

1227
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,729
My heart fluttered a lot.

1228
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,530
He was like a friend to me.

1229
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,370
When he became my boyfriend,

1230
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,199
it made my heart flutter so much.

1231
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,900
I hugged my pillow at home.

1232
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,010
I usually went...

1233
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:08,380
to pick her up depending on her schedule.

1234
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,280
Back then, she had a curfew.

1235
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:15,180
When she was done with her studies, it was past 10pm.

1236
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,089
There were only 20 minutes before her curfew.

1237
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,849
Spending 10 to 15 minutes before going home was...

1238
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,560
our usual date.

1239
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:26,090
From Mokdong Station to my house, Jae Hyeong walked me home...

1240
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,260
almost every day.

1241
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,129
It's not easy, and it could be annoying.

1242
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:33,830
I appreciated his concern for me.

1243
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,840
The date I remember the most?

1244
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,740
I remember our trip to Gangneung.

1245
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:44,010
That was the farthest trip we had taken back then.

1246
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:46,950
(Their first long-distance day trip to Gangneung)

1247
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,220
We were wearing matching hooded sweatshirts.

1248
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,750
Starting from when we took photos together in the train,

1249
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,119
we kept smiling.

1250
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,290
We were so happy.

1251
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,630
It was a very happy memory.

1252
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,800
I did a lot of new things with Jae Hyeong.

1253
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,640
Things I did for the first time.

1254
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,770
I had a lot of fun with him.

1255
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,310
It's possible to like someone so much.

1256
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,520
She made me realize that for the first time.

1257
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,650
She really liked me.

1258
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:26,890
I had a worn-out wallet.

1259
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,260
For our first anniversary, she gave me a wallet as a present.

1260
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,459
She changed something old to new.

1261
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,030
It seemed to represent...

1262
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:37,199
our future together.

1263
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,470
That's how it felt back then.

1264
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,169
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1265
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:44,040
- He was such a baby.
- He really was.

1266
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:45,540
That's cute.

1267
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:47,769
He was such a baby.

1268
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,379
It sounds so young.

1269
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,809
They took the train to go on a day trip.

1270
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,280
- It's so cute.
- It's adorable.

1271
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,050
I haven't eaten something like this with you in a long time.

1272
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:57,220
I know.

1273
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,820
During the last month, we didn't even see each other.

1274
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:01,860
Why was that?

1275
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,160
That's probably when you lost...

1276
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,059
your feelings for me.

1277
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,399
It's not exactly that.

1278
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,359
Our lifestyles didn't match. Do you remember that?

1279
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,499
You're right. I remember it clearly.

1280
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,500
Yes.

1281
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:15,670
When I think about our past,

1282
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,340
I feel sorry.

1283
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:20,470
Overall,

1284
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,410
I feel sorry,

1285
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,680
but I'm more grateful than sorry.

1286
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:30,049
Thanks to you, I got to know a wide spectrum of feelings.

1287
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,050
Really?

1288
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,320
I'm glad to hear that. It was the same for me.

1289
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,820
I'm surprised to hear that.

1290
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,659
I felt a lot of emotions too.

1291
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,360
If I only had bad memories of us, I wouldn't be here now.

1292
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,830
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1293
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:50,440
Back then, we were young.

1294
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:53,010
It should be different now.

1295
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:55,480
Right.

1296
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:59,210
She was my first love.

1297
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,180
It was beyond control.

1298
01:27:01,181 --> 01:27:03,780
That's the first thought I have.

1299
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,160
(Before moving in, time room)

1300
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,930
(More stripes means new, more brown means getting back together)

1301
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,669
If I say that my ex is...

1302
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,240
not on my mind at all,

1303
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:29,739
it'd be like letting go...

1304
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:32,080
of our time together in the past.

1305
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,820
I left one slot.

1306
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,390
It's not because I want to get back together.

1307
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:47,729
I wanted to keep my memory...

1308
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,630
of my first love.

1309
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,900
After our preliminary meeting,

1310
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,640
my opinion slightly changed.

1311
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:01,980
In my memory, my ex was immature.

1312
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,010
I didn't think we made a good match.

1313
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,820
After our conversation during the meeting,

1314
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,350
I saw that he got more mature. He had changed a lot.

1315
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,959
As I wanted to talk more with my ex today,

1316
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,500
I left four hours on the clock.

1317
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,770
(8 o'clock, Yun Nyeong, 11 o'clock, Jae Hyeong)

1318
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:35,010
(Each of them had a meaning behind the time they left.)

1319
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,279
- I would feel strange about it.
- Right.

1320
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,149
You meet someone when he's childish.

1321
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,120
Then he appears as a man.

1322
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,049
All his skills must have increased.

1323
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,189
- Right.
- All his capacities.

1324
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:47,149
Then I'd be curious about him.

1325
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:48,789
Right. You could hit it off...

1326
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:49,790
when you meet at a later age.

1327
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,560
- Exactly.
- That's right.

1328
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:56,000
I changed a lot while being in a relationship with you.

1329
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,430
You changed?

1330
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:03,240
My ideal type became more clear to me.

1331
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,710
And how I love someone.

1332
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,570
I learned a lot from you too.

1333
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:08,680
You became stronger.

1334
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,280
Of course.

1335
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:15,950
(Yun Nyeong x Jae Hyeong, March 14, 2018 to April 7, 2019)

1336
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,260
(They met in the Chatting Room when Jae Hyeong moved in.)

1337
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:24,930
(Hello)

1338
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,990
(Hello)

1339
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:29,300
I felt like...

1340
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,570
it was my ex.

1341
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,140
I asked her if she still had feelings for her ex.

1342
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,009
When I see him once he moves in,

1343
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,080
my feelings might change.

1344
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,539
"It's not like I don't have strong feelings for him,"

1345
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:44,809
"but it doesn't mean I have any."

1346
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:46,549
That's exactly what I said.

1347
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,680
(I wouldn't say I don't have any feelings left.)

1348
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:50,750
That made me think a lot.

1349
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:53,120
If what she said was true,

1350
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,760
one of us was bound to get hurt.

1351
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,260
I didn't want her to get hurt.

1352
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,400
(I hope you adjust well and don't have a hard time here.)

1353
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:09,400
For some reason,

1354
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,240
he sounded like my ex.

1355
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,179
Of course, it's been six years.

1356
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:19,250
But I still have some memories of him.

1357
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,750
At the end of the conversation, he wished me happiness.

1358
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,050
I knew it had to be my ex.

1359
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:29,159
(The two of them figured out...)

1360
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,220
(they were talking to each other just by the way they talked.)

1361
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:36,000
(And that night)

1362
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,930
- What?
- Hello.

1363
01:30:37,931 --> 01:30:40,330
I was quite flustered.

1364
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:42,669
I saw Min Kyung come in...

1365
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,600
and then a man was walking in behind her.

1366
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:47,510
It was my ex. So I thought,

1367
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:50,280
"He's here. He will join us now."

1368
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,679
I just wanted to know...

1369
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,250
how I would feel once I faced my ex.

1370
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,480
Nice to meet you.

1371
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,320
The first person I saw...

1372
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,090
was my ex.

1373
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:04,620
It seemed she was comfortable and doing well in the house.

1374
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:08,599
(And today, )

1375
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,860
(Jae Hyeong enters the Choice Room.)

1376
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:28,210
I thought about whether or not I should enter the room.

1377
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,460
(Jae Hyeong decides to see the Ex Room after deliberation.)

1378
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,870
I thought it would be nice...

1379
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:49,240
to move on after seeing the room once.

1380
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:56,080
Honestly, I wanted my ex to come in too.

1381
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,550
I didn't have a chance to talk to her after moving in.

1382
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:02,950
I thought using this occasion to talk to her would be nice.

1383
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:10,290
(But Yun Nyeong didn't choose to see the Ex Room.)

1384
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:21,900
(Your ex didn't choose the Ex Room. Enter the Ex Room.)

1385
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,729
(When I saw her for the first time, I thought she was pretty.)

1386
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,829
(She worked hard, was outgoing, and had many friends.)

1387
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:53,930
(That's why I found her so attractive.)

1388
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,710
(She was my first love.)

1389
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:04,840
(A place where time stopped in that moment from 6 years ago)

1390
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,550
Most of the items in the room were from me.

1391
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,819
Actually, there were times I could have thrown them out.

1392
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,690
But I thought holding onto some of them was understandable.

1393
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,859
The first section that got my attention was...

1394
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:26,070
the one with our photos. They were hanging on the wall.

1395
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,110
"We were happy back then."

1396
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,610
We were smiling in all of the pictures.

1397
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,750
The pictures were a nice contrast to how things turned out for us now.

1398
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:53,859
We hung out in the playground, talked, and took pictures.

1399
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,860
I could see from the pictures that we were so happy.

1400
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,500
So they got my attention.

1401
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,410
They were both so young.

1402
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,709
I'm surprised that...

1403
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:07,969
- there are still pictures of them.
- Right.

1404
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,309
Let me get this straight.

1405
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,639
Yun Nyeong said she didn't keep anything from their relationship.

1406
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,679
So they all must be from him.

1407
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,810
- Right.
- Probably.

1408
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,350
He still has pictures of his relationship in high school?

1409
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,619
That must mean that...

1410
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:19,849
- she must have left an impression.
- He must have missed her.

1411
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:22,060
I guess she was someone he really missed.

1412
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:36,070
Two diaries were placed on the table side by side.

1413
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,440
One of them was the diary my ex kept while dating me.

1414
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,540
One of them was the diary I wrote after we broke up.

1415
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,109
It was such a strong contrast.

1416
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:45,250
(The two diaries show a strong contrast.)

1417
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:54,850
My ex wrote it every day while we dated.

1418
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,790
I kept it with me the whole time.

1419
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:03,760
What she wrote in the diary made me emotional.

1420
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:08,740
There was just so much love on those pages.

1421
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:12,410
The pages were filled with how much she liked me.

1422
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:16,809
She mostly wrote, "I love you. I miss you."

1423
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:17,909
(I thought of you and bought flowers.)

1424
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:19,010
(I've never given flowers as a present before.)

1425
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:22,020
My ex is an affectionate person by nature.

1426
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:24,220
And she's very sweet too.

1427
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:26,120
Even after all these years,

1428
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:28,589
seeing her again...

1429
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:32,590
helped me realize that she was full of love...

1430
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:37,100
and that I must have been happy with her.

1431
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,870
So that made me emotional.

1432
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:53,680
(He faces another diary then.)

1433
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:59,890
(Familiarity fooled me and cost me someone precious.)

1434
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:08,229
After my ex and I broke up,

1435
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,060
I was serving my military duty.

1436
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,900
After hearing she got a new boyfriend,

1437
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,799
it hit me hard. But I didn't have any space or method...

1438
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:16,970
to let out the pain I was feeling.

1439
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:21,410
So I kept a diary to work out my feelings and console myself.

1440
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,079
(Inverse Proportion, Thursday, July 11, 2019)

1441
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,849
(It sounds like there's a happy occasion for Yun Nyeong.)

1442
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:27,579
(Is it also a happy occasion for me? I don't think so.)

1443
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,479
(I looked at our photo in the back of my phone case.)

1444
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,919
(I envy who we were back then. And I want to go back to that.)

1445
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,390
(Seeing how I'm ending my day like this, I'll need more time...)

1446
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:34,989
(The more I write my diary, the more I think of her.)

1447
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:36,720
(Maybe, I should stop writing.)

1448
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:57,339
I realized once again that my ex had taken up...

1449
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,279
a big part of my life...

1450
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,819
because when I read the diary after all these years,

1451
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:05,450
I could see how deeply I wished the best for her.

1452
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:08,890
Despite everything, I was still grateful to my ex.

1453
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,759
That crossed my mind.

1454
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,300
(I'm so sorry.)

1455
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:18,630
We couldn't have picked a worse moment to date.

1456
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:20,470
Our timing was so off.

1457
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:25,339
I can only say that it's an excuse from my side.

1458
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,809
It was my military service.

1459
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,170
(The reason of their conflict, the military service)

1460
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:30,179
It was before I enlisted.

1461
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,980
After the date of enlistment was set,

1462
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:35,449
I had fun and did everything I wanted to do.

1463
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,050
That's when we didn't see eye to eye.

1464
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:41,250
After he took time off from school, he sort of changed.

1465
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,259
After he took time off from school to fulfill his military duty,

1466
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:46,229
his daily routine changed significantly.

1467
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:47,390
He became a night owl.

1468
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,559
But I had to wake up early in the morning...

1469
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,429
and then go to sleep early. That was my daily routine.

1470
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:55,469
But he didn't need to wake up or go to sleep early.

1471
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,900
He woke up and went to sleep whenever he wanted.

1472
01:37:58,070 --> 01:38:00,170
Our routines didn't match at all.

1473
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:03,079
When I came home after spending my day,

1474
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:06,050
he told me that he had just woken up.

1475
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,679
Then I told him I was going to get ready to sleep...

1476
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,149
and said good night.

1477
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:12,350
Toward the end of our relationship, that became a pattern.

1478
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,719
She often said we should talk on the phone...

1479
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,760
when we couldn't meet.

1480
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:21,390
But back then, I didn't like talking on the phone.

1481
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,000
So I tried to avoid calling her.

1482
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:27,270
Even when we talked on the phone, I tried not to talk for a long time.

1483
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:29,939
It wasn't working out for me, so I talked to him.

1484
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:33,009
I was in college.

1485
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:34,209
So I asked him to match my schedule if he could.

1486
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:35,539
I said, "You go out at night to play games at Internet cafes."

1487
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:37,640
"You just play computer games there."

1488
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:39,909
It was before his military service.

1489
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:42,549
He said he wanted to have some fun before the service.

1490
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:44,020
He wanted me to understand that.

1491
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,090
But I couldn't.

1492
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:49,260
I was more comfortable and had more fun with my friends.

1493
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:53,160
I didn't feel a sense of urgency that I should fix that.

1494
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:56,760
Back then, I was more focused on my military service.

1495
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,530
I couldn't let go of this chance to have fun.

1496
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,499
We talked less and spent less time together.

1497
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:06,410
As the distance between us grew, our affection got weaker.

1498
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,080
That's how I slowly fell out of love.

1499
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,449
I guess it must have affected my behavior,

1500
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,710
and he could see the change.

1501
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,019
When we were talking on the phone, something fell off.

1502
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:19,849
That's when she told me.

1503
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:21,449
She said she stopped having feelings for me...

1504
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,260
and wanted to stop because it was too hard on her.

1505
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:28,590
That's when I could feel my heart drop.

1506
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,299
I thought, "I'm in trouble." That's when I felt the urgency.

1507
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,329
There's a saying,

1508
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:35,329
"Familiarity fooled me and cost me someone precious."

1509
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,269
I instinctively felt that when she told me.

1510
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:41,140
"I can't lose her. I was such a fool."

1511
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,679
Back then, I tried everything to get her back.

1512
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,780
I just...

1513
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,580
That was the first and last time I cried on the street.

1514
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,190
He cried so much.

1515
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:54,720
I had never seen anyone cry that much.

1516
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,589
He said, "Please reconsider."

1517
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:59,690
He kept calling me back then.

1518
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:02,500
This is what I said to him.

1519
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:05,829
"If you're really sorry, stop calling me."

1520
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:07,570
That's what I said.

1521
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,570
He took a moment and then said he understood.

1522
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,739
He said, "I'm sorry for everything. Take care."

1523
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,210
That's how we ended things.

1524
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,479
(He once again hears the reason they broke up 6 years ago.)

1525
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,780
Back then, I was still so upset.

1526
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,179
"What's the point of all this now?" That crossed my mind.

1527
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:25,550
I thought, "He should've done his best when we were together."

1528
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,359
It was emotionally draining.

1529
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,930
So I didn't have a hard time after we broke up.

1530
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:45,170
I watched my ex talk about our relationship.

1531
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:48,610
It was my first time hearing her side of the story.

1532
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:53,610
There were definitely more times I could have done better.

1533
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:55,849
She's my first love...

1534
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:57,720
and took up a big part of my life.

1535
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:00,820
But we're broken up and it's really over between us.

1536
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:05,390
I accepted that this was the end for us.

1537
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:09,459
Knowing that, it became clear to me...

1538
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:12,400
that I would never be able to feel like that again.

1539
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,030
That actually made me sad.

1540
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,839
(The longer I date you, the more I like you.)

1541
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,969
(When I look at you, my heart just melts.)

1542
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:22,980
(I really wanted to tell you today that I loved you.)

1543
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,910
By the time I left the Ex Room,

1544
01:41:25,850 --> 01:41:29,119
it was after I had faced our memories together...

1545
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,820
and the feelings my ex had.

1546
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:35,020
I thought we would be able to have a healthier conversation.

1547
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:36,990
So I couldn't wait to talk to her.

1548
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:44,060
(I like you this much.)

1549
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,730
It's bringing back a lot of old memories.

1550
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:47,099
That was a common reason for breakups.

1551
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,129
- When we were immature.
- Yes.

1552
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:49,269
- I remember those breakups.
- Yes.

1553
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:50,299
That's how it is when you're young.

1554
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,099
That's why we keep...

1555
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,670
writing down our regrets after time passes.

1556
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:58,179
Gosh, I guess she really was his first love.

1557
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,679
- He kept...
- He wrote a diary in the military.

1558
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,779
- Right. He even kept a diary.
- You know?

1559
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,749
It just means this is a strong memory for him.

1560
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:06,889
When you can actually feel pain in your heart...

1561
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,549
- after you break up, - Gosh, it's so painful.

1562
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:10,319
I'd say that's your first love.

1563
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,859
- It's like your heart...
- Seriously.

1564
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:13,389
- is ripped into pieces.
- Yes.

1565
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:15,189
Despite everything,

1566
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:18,299
people say there comes a moment for men...

1567
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,629
- friendship trumps love.
- When they're young...

1568
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:24,069
- Was that the case for you?
- It's definitely true.

1569
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:26,139
- Was it when you were young?
- But as for friends like that,

1570
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,109
they live diligently in their own ways.

1571
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:29,540
So we naturally grow apart.

1572
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,709
But when we were young,

1573
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,779
- we acted like...
- Right.

1574
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:32,950
- friends were our lives.
- Like they're everything.

1575
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:36,519
That's when men would ask things, "Choose. Me or your girlfriend."

1576
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,550
- Right.
- Yes.

1577
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:41,320
- Gosh, that was a great meal.
- It was so good.

1578
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:46,030
This one didn't pass.

1579
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,290
- Really?
- Yes.

1580
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:49,730
You're right.

1581
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:53,300
We should finish that. There are only two left.

1582
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,370
Do you need an apron? It's a white shirt.

1583
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:02,070
What do you think?

1584
01:43:02,071 --> 01:43:05,780
You're right. This is a cute shirt. I should put it on.

1585
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:11,080
Hold on. I'll put it on you.

1586
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,350
Thank you.

1587
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:17,060
How many people are here for the dishwashing duty?

1588
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:20,230
Everyone is looking for a job.

1589
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:29,070
- Thank you.
- Oh, no. It's inside out.

1590
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,840
- Is that okay?
- What's this? What?

1591
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,310
- It's inside out.
- It's fine.

1592
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:36,440
- Your age...
- Don't use honorifics to me.

1593
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,080
No, you can't say that.

1594
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,780
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1595
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,720
"What?" I was surprised.

1596
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,760
My ex wore that shirt the day before.

1597
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,960
And she wore the same shirt the next day.

1598
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,900
I thought, "They must have the same shirt. That's crazy."

1599
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:01,770
I can see that Won Kyu and Ji Yeon...

1600
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,440
are interested in each other. They even had the same shirt.

1601
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:11,810
I thought, "What a twist of fate."

1602
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,479
I'm going to rest upstairs for a bit.

1603
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,480
Sure.

1604
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:23,559
Thinking it's fate must be more annoying...

1605
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,619
than to think it's the same shirt.

1606
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:26,729
- Right.
- What if she finds out the truth?

1607
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:28,559
Gosh, there's another misunderstanding?

1608
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,899
There's another one even after they broke up.

1609
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,829
- It might be better off that way...
- Right.

1610
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,599
- for Won Kyu.
- It's better for him.

1611
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,670
To think it's a coincidence?

1612
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,800
(Sighing)

1613
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:45,380
My gosh. I don't think I can keep a poker face.

1614
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,810
- But everyone seems...
- Oh, no.

1615
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:52,080
No. Just going downstairs...

1616
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:57,359
(She feels more conflicted after seeing the Ex Room.)

1617
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,760
It feels...

1618
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,389
There's nothing we can do...

1619
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:04,100
other than having fun.

1620
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:07,470
(Sighing)

1621
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:08,769
(Sighing)

1622
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:10,240
Why are you sighing?

1623
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,870
It's nice to stay in the room...

1624
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:19,850
because this way, I won't feel the vibe in the communal area.

1625
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:21,210
Right.

1626
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:30,219
(The atmosphere outside their room must be tense.)

1627
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:33,760
(The two of them stay quiet for a moment.)

1628
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:50,380
Yes?

1629
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:54,050
- What are you doing?
- I changed my clothes.

1630
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:56,880
- You did?
- Yes. Wait.

1631
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:59,890
- I'll be on the terrace.
- Okay. I'll be there soon.

1632
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:04,859
(Jae Hyeong asks Ji Hyeon to talk with him.)

1633
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:05,860
Hi.

1634
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,760
There are so many mosquitoes here.

1635
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:10,229
Really? Should we go down then?

1636
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:11,829
No. I've got this.

1637
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:14,200
Did you spray the deodorant? No, I mean the repellent.

1638
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,199
- I don't think...
- There's one. We have everything.

1639
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,800
I can just cover myself with a blanket.

1640
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,170
This is our first time talking in private, right?

1641
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:21,939
In the house?

1642
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,879
Yes. I'm not interested in anyone...

1643
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,909
- but you.
- Really?

1644
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:28,210
Yes. So I wanted to talk to you.

1645
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:34,820
Telling me about how I feel might make you uncomfortable.

1646
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,420
You might feel a bit of pressure.

1647
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,760
But it doesn't mean that I have to hide my interest.

1648
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,860
Right. You have to show your interest here.

1649
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,670
But just because I showed my interest to you,

1650
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:49,270
I wouldn't be mad at you for not reciprocating.

1651
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:52,810
That won't make me feel small or timid either.

1652
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:54,970
You don't have to worry about me. I mean it.

1653
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:56,540
That's cool.

1654
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,540
That's cool.

1655
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:01,180
I'm serious. There's no need for that.

1656
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,420
But of course, I'll think about that.

1657
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:07,490
Then it would make me a bit happy.

1658
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,820
No, it can't be like that.

1659
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:15,860
But why are you curious about me?

1660
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:18,300
Because I'm interested in you.

1661
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:25,140
Then I have a question for you.

1662
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:29,780
Hearing about someone's life story and experiences...

1663
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,580
helps me understand them better. So I say this often.

1664
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,049
(Ji Hyeon is curious about the way Jae Hyeong lived.)

1665
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:38,879
At first,

1666
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,820
my friend ran a cafe near Myeong-dong.

1667
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:43,920
That's where I first began working.

1668
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:47,330
It was more appealing than expected.

1669
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:50,429
Making and serving coffee.

1670
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:52,669
I just enjoyed serving something to others.

1671
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:53,830
Really?

1672
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:55,699
- That's really interesting.
- Because the coffee lovers have...

1673
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,769
a habit of getting it...

1674
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:58,070
- in the morning.
- Right.

1675
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,410
It felt like I helped people start their day.

1676
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,539
I see. But have you ever regretted it before?

1677
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:06,750
Still, you went to the engineering college.

1678
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,780
- You were guaranteed to get a job.
- That's true.

1679
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,580
I find people like you the most interesting.

1680
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,849
A guaranteed path?

1681
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:18,860
Instead of taking the stable path,

1682
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:23,030
when I see people taking a rather reckless path,

1683
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:24,730
I think they're amazing.

1684
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:28,500
To be honest, I was torn about that.

1685
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:29,900
Then I...

1686
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:31,970
talked to my dad over a drink.

1687
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,240
Then my dad told me...

1688
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:36,940
until I turn 30,

1689
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:39,679
- it's my world.
- So do what you want?

1690
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,149
- I might do everything I want.
- That's nice of him.

1691
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:42,250
So I wouldn't regret it later.

1692
01:48:42,610 --> 01:48:43,950
I think...

1693
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:48,350
that really helped me set the path of my life.

1694
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:49,859
Right.

1695
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,659
I think I can pursue stability...

1696
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,930
- Later?
- a little later.

1697
01:48:54,330 --> 01:48:55,830
I want no regrets.

1698
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,970
It's okay to have feelings left, but no regrets.

1699
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:04,569
At first, Jae Hyeong felt...

1700
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:06,639
rather rough.

1701
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:09,379
When I listened to him...

1702
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:11,680
expressing his feelings toward me,

1703
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:16,020
I thought he was someone who finds meanings in little things.

1704
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:19,950
I'm starting to think that he's warm-hearted.

1705
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:23,560
So I'd like to get to know Jae Hyeong more.

1706
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,290
That's what came to my mind.

1707
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:31,400
(The two are curious about each other.)

1708
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,869
Ji Hyeon is...

1709
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:36,399
swayed by Yoo Sik.

1710
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,999
And Jae Hyeong...

1711
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,609
didn't miss the timing.

1712
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:43,009
She met someone who expresses his feelings.

1713
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:44,079
- Yes.
- That's right.

1714
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,979
She thinks they also walked...

1715
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,179
the similar path...

1716
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,719
unlike Won Kyu.

1717
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,649
Jae Hyeong also said...

1718
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:53,020
what she wanted to hear the most.

1719
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:54,250
It's perfect.

1720
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:55,789
What a perfect timing.

1721
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:56,959
Is she switching?

1722
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,220
- Right.
- Just switch.

1723
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,329
(A game has begun in the living room.)

1724
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:02,860
- What?
- It's four.

1725
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,660
What's going on?

1726
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:06,330
You alcoholics.

1727
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,930
Wine.

1728
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:09,539
Wine addiction.

1729
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:10,770
It's pretty though.

1730
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,840
- Pretty? Do you want it?
- I want it.

1731
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:22,880
Passing through.

1732
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:24,350
I showed you already.

1733
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:28,950
That's fast.

1734
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,199
(Glancing)

1735
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,300
- What?
- What?

1736
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:38,799
You've improved a lot.

1737
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,870
(She happens to be sitting across Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun.)

1738
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:48,870
- Yes.
- The cards look the same.

1739
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,850
Be laid back.

1740
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:57,580
What?

1741
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:02,090
- Be laid back.
- Only your eyes widen.

1742
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,060
When you see five, your eyes widen.

1743
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:08,689
(Her ex in her sight...)

1744
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:12,060
(and the person her ex is interested in)

1745
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:24,280
How am I going to face them now?

1746
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,310
(Sighing)

1747
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,250
Because...

1748
01:51:34,190 --> 01:51:37,160
I know he didn't come to the Ex Room.

1749
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:39,860
I had a lot on my mind.

1750
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:44,899
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

1751
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,030
- Already?
- Yes.

1752
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,300
Are we having wine again tonight?

1753
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:50,240
Women never gathered alone.

1754
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,000
I thought you gathered every night.

1755
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,969
- Not everyone.
- No.

1756
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:56,309
- Really?
- We never gathered to talk before.

1757
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:57,479
Really? Never?

1758
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:00,480
I think we were drinking at the time.

1759
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:04,019
(Who made your heart flutter today? Let them know via text.)

1760
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,220
(Your text will be delivered anonymously.)

1761
01:52:06,690 --> 01:52:11,460
(The time has arrived again today.)

1762
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:17,600
(With the Ex Room open today, )

1763
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,200
(where is everyone's heart going?)

1764
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:31,280
(Everyone delivered what's on their minds.)

1765
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:34,309
The night has arrived...

1766
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,549
for those who went to the Ex Room.

1767
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:38,819
Do you think any residents would message...

1768
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,089
their exes?

1769
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:42,589
After going to the Ex Room... I don't think so.

1770
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,289
It's hard today.

1771
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:46,290
- It'll be hard to send the text.
- It's hard.

1772
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,729
- Is it okay to drink?
- Yes, I'm drinking...

1773
01:52:48,730 --> 01:52:49,730
- with Yun Nyeong.
- Are you going to drink?

1774
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,300
I could drink.

1775
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,530
Jae Hyeong, is there anything you can't eat?

1776
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,170
Me? Cilantro.

1777
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:57,670
Cilantro?

1778
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:07,910
It's not that I can't eat it.

1779
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,510
I eat it if it's there.

1780
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,750
(Ji Hyeon)

1781
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:20,630
(I'm happy that you're the first person I became close to.)

1782
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,930
I sent it to Ji Hyeon.

1783
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:27,800
(Jae Hyeong's heart heads to Ji Hyeon for 3 days in a row.)

1784
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:30,570
At first, I received that he wanted to become close.

1785
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,370
"What should I do to become close to you?"

1786
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,240
"I want to get close." That's what he said.

1787
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,580
And now Jae Hyeong thinks we became quite close.

1788
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:41,550
Everyone might not be...

1789
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:44,079
certain at this stage.

1790
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:46,389
But I was thankful for his courage to say...

1791
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:49,890
that I was the only person he wanted to get to know.

1792
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,220
I like him even more.

1793
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:55,960
(Jae Hyeong)

1794
01:53:56,230 --> 01:54:01,830
(I want to have coffee you brew in the morning.)

1795
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,640
I sent it to Jae Hyeong.

1796
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:07,169
(Ji Hyeon's heart heads to Jae Hyeong today.)

1797
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:08,540
First of all, I was happy.

1798
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:10,509
I was sitting next to Ji Hyeon...

1799
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,040
on the couch at the time.

1800
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,880
Thinking that someone next to me sent that text,

1801
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:17,320
my heart fluttered even more.

1802
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,950
What do you want to drink?

1803
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:24,090
I don't know. Wine for now?

1804
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:27,560
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1805
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:33,100
(Won Kyu)

1806
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:38,140
(Do you like my T-shirt?)

1807
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,840
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1808
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:44,580
(Ji Yeon's heart heads to Won Kyu again today.)

1809
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:49,010
(Who did Won Kyu's heart pick today?)

1810
01:55:01,890 --> 01:55:05,500
(The two received a text each.)

1811
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,700
(Ji Yeon)

1812
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:11,670
(It looks good on you.)

1813
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:13,469
They even connected via text.

1814
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:14,540
That's perfect.

1815
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:17,580
Actually, I was very torn.

1816
01:55:18,010 --> 01:55:19,710
Whether to send it to my ex.

1817
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:23,220
After I returned from the Ex Room,

1818
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:27,019
I told my ex to have an apple in the garden,

1819
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,490
and we talked.

1820
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:30,719
Our conversation wasn't exactly a good one.

1821
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:32,460
So I didn't want to text her.

1822
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:36,360
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1823
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:45,300
"Since you didn't make my heart flutter, I won't text you."

1824
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:47,409
"Someone else made my heart flutter."

1825
01:55:47,410 --> 01:55:49,310
"But I do want to go on a date with you."

1826
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:53,610
Do I have to make your heart flutter too?

1827
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:02,120
(The two still crossed.)

1828
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:05,020
(Ji Yeon)

1829
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:07,360
(Let's stay on good terms during the remaining time.)

1830
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:09,960
(Your ex picked you.)

1831
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:16,899
Because I failed to control my emotion,

1832
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:19,039
I talked to her as if I was angry.

1833
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,609
My ex used to hate it when I get angry.

1834
01:56:21,610 --> 01:56:23,039
Even after we broke up,

1835
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,909
I felt bad and embarrassed...

1836
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:27,780
to do that again.

1837
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:30,849
I won't do that again.

1838
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:33,649
We should just focus on what we want to do.

1839
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:36,720
And be on good terms for the remaining time.

1840
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:40,190
That's why I sent that text.

1841
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:42,590
"From now on,"

1842
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,560
"let's avoid an angry conversation."

1843
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:47,400
That's probably what he meant.

1844
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:52,199
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1845
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,770
My neck hurts so much.

1846
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:58,139
- Yes, good job.
- I knew he'd do that.

1847
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:59,709
- Good job, Woo Jin.
- Good job.

1848
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:02,010
- That was the best he could do.
- Yes.

1849
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:04,550
Oh, right. Did you bring the beachwear?

1850
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:06,890
- Beachwear?
- Yes.

1851
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:08,350
- Really?
- Yes.

1852
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:09,620
Okay.

1853
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:13,730
(Yun Nyeong)

1854
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:19,260
(I can't wait to go on a date.)

1855
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,100
(Baek Hyun)

1856
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:25,500
(I barely saw your face today.)

1857
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:31,680
Right. That feels different.

1858
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:33,850
Yes.

1859
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,110
I'm certain.

1860
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:37,979
I hope Baek Hyun is certain too.

1861
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:40,090
I hope these feelings continue.

1862
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,420
I think it'll continue to be both ways.

1863
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:49,900
(Their hearts connected once again today.)

1864
01:57:53,130 --> 01:57:54,900
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1865
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:57,900
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1866
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:01,070
I think I need to buy artificial tears.

1867
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:03,379
- Did you run out?
- I have two left in my room.

1868
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:04,980
This is most refreshing.

1869
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,410
It's almost like the liquid painkiller.

1870
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,679
Mine is pretty refreshing too.

1871
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:11,379
Come on. I barely felt it.

1872
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:12,919
I thought it was similar.

1873
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,320
What do you mean it was similar?

1874
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:16,320
It's red...

1875
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:26,000
(Who did Hyeon Ji pick today?)

1876
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:41,310
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1877
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:44,950
I didn't expect him to send it to me.

1878
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:49,050
He wouldn't leave any possibility at all.

1879
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:53,020
I should really sort out my feelings.

1880
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:59,660
(Clearing her feelings after seeing her ex leaving no room)

1881
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:03,940
(Yoo Sik)

1882
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:08,070
(When do you want to go for barbecue?)

1883
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:13,810
(Hyeon Ji picked Yoo Sik.)

1884
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:22,720
(Who did Yoo Sik pick today?)

1885
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,650
(Hyeon Ji)

1886
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:53,590
(You're so busy that it's hard to see your face.)

1887
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:00,960
I was supposed to text the one who made my heart flutter today.

1888
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:03,400
I didn't see her in the house today.

1889
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:06,400
So I texted her...

1890
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:08,999
that she was so busy.

1891
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,540
(He expressed his feelings to Hyeon Ji.)

1892
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:17,840
(Their hearts connected.)

1893
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:21,850
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1894
02:00:24,950 --> 02:00:27,820
(Yoo Sik)

1895
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:31,220
(We'll need time to talk.)

1896
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:34,560
(Your ex picked you.)

1897
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:48,339
(With the Ex Room open today, )

1898
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:52,640
(Min Kyung texted Yoo Sik for the first time.)

1899
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:01,690
I never talked to Min Kyung about how I feel.

1900
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,660
Whereas Min Kyung didn't get to enter the Ex Room.

1901
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:09,160
I think she wanted to talk,

1902
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,160
so she could hear about how I feel.

1903
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:16,000
(Min Kyung requested Yoo Sik to talk.)

1904
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:17,500
Today,

1905
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:20,670
I felt so frustrated.

1906
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:23,640
I wanted to talk to him.

1907
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:26,210
That's why I said that in the text.

1908
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:31,820
(Everyone expressed how they really feel.)

1909
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:37,159
- That's the first time she texted.
- It's the first time.

1910
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:39,519
How is she feeling?

1911
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,329
I think the ten minutes...

1912
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:42,729
she talked to her ex is...

1913
02:01:42,730 --> 02:01:44,159
- as intense as the Ex Room.
- I agree.

1914
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,529
It meant a lot. They probably didn't have that chance...

1915
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:48,499
- to talk.
- Right.

1916
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,269
She woke up sleeptalking.

1917
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,439
- Right.
- She woke up with tears.

1918
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,940
I think that's why...

1919
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,439
She couldn't help but acknowledge her feelings.

1920
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,080
It's painful to dream about your ex.

1921
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,109
For the first time,

1922
02:01:59,110 --> 02:02:02,079
- she tried to face her feelings.
- Right.

1923
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,979
She tried to avoid them...

1924
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:05,450
- because of the wound.
- She avoided them.

1925
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:09,290
Min Kyung's text at this moment...

1926
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:10,760
Is it swaying Yoo Sik?

1927
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:12,959
Their conversation is what matters now.

1928
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,329
I hope they talk it out.

1929
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:15,829
Yes, their conversation now.

1930
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:17,200
Oh, my gosh.

1931
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:21,469
- Do you want to drink in the room?
- Sure.

1932
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:23,940
- How about girls' night?
- Sounds good.

1933
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:25,440
Sounds good to me.

1934
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:27,410
Why...

1935
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:29,970
Why...

1936
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:38,320
(The doorbell rang.)

1937
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:40,750
What is it?

1938
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,260
- I'll go with you.
- What is it?

1939
02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:50,830
What's there to come?

1940
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:57,700
What could it be?

1941
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,669
It must be something.

1942
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:01,640
- Oh, right.
- This is fun.

1943
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:03,680
Oh, you're reliable.

1944
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,490
There's nothing.

1945
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,760
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1946
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:25,029
(The letterbox is empty, )

1947
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:30,170
(and someone is approaching the house.)

1948
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:38,939
- What?
- What? That's crazy.

1949
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:40,350
My goodness.

1950
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:41,979
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1951
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:44,179
Wait. I'm getting goosebumps.

1952
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:45,719
What a timing.

1953
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,619
As soon as the Ex Room is over,

1954
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,889
and things are chaotic,

1955
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,119
- a new person is...
- That's what I mean.

1956
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:51,259
- appearing.
- Awesome.

1957
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:52,389
- That's crazy.
- That's so...

1958
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:53,729
It's crazy.

1959
02:03:53,730 --> 02:03:54,890
I mean...

1960
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:56,860
Do you want to go together?

1961
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:58,830
Wait.

1962
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:00,370
Wait.

1963
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:04,600
- My heart is pounding so much.
- Down there...

1964
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:11,779
This is crazy. This is really crazy.

1965
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:12,810
Is this really happening?

1966
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:25,290
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1967
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:30,930
(EXchange 4)

1968
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,800
Did you give the T-shirt...

1969
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,700
to Ji Yeon?

1970
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:37,700
I was drunk.

1971
02:04:38,240 --> 02:04:39,700
She took it.

1972
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:41,870
This is upsetting.

1973
02:04:41,871 --> 02:04:43,470
You don't even care.

1974
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:45,679
- Should I...
- What are you saying?

1975
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:46,810
Go around and flirt?

1976
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:48,109
You're never quiet.

1977
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:50,280
You talk to the guys the most.

1978
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:54,149
(Okay. No more. We're on our own now.)

1979
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:56,350
(Go on your way.)

1980
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,220
I want to talk to you.

1981
02:04:59,190 --> 02:05:00,260
Come in.

1982
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:04,329
If we dated eight years,

1983
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:06,300
you should've been careful at least a little.

1984
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:08,270
I made who you are.

1985
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:12,500
(And you abandoned me.)
