1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,479
Let me introduce today's guest who will be joining us.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,249
It's actor Kwak Si Yang.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,550
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,689
- He looks handsome.
- Welcome.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,750
He looks so handsome.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,519
You've watched all the way through Episode 11, right?

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,890
I cried so much yesterday while watching Episodes 10 and 11.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,129
I even wondered,

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,859
"Did I have a romance like that in the past?"

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,469
I was reminded of the painful memories as well.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,470
Right.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,939
- The bell.
- The doorbell rang.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,299
- That's right.
- That's right.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,639
We only saw the silhouette...

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,039
- Right.
- of the person.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,379
Let's meet the resident who pressed the doorbell.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,439
- Who would it be?
- I'm so curious.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,510
- A new face.
- I know, right?

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,650
A new face.

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,650
- There's nothing?
- There's nothing.

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,489
(An empty mailbox...)

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,490
(and the mysterious footsteps approaching)

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,840
Should we go out?

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,010
Hold on.

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,540
Hold on.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,680
- My heart is racing.
- Down the stairs...

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,749
This is crazy. Seriously crazy.

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,720
Is this real?

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,240
Hold on.

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,510
Hello.

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,279
Hello.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,320
Hello.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,979
Hello.

35
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,050
Hello.

36
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,619
- Goodness.
- Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,789
Hello.

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,160
(New resident, Shin Seung Yong)

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,430
I was really shocked.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,700
He suddenly came in.

41
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,830
So I was like...

42
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,840
He had a big build...

43
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,670
and looked cool.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,970
He seemed like he'd be very popular.

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,380
He was fit and good-looking.

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,240
He was good-looking,

47
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,380
but you could even say that he was well-sculpted.

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,660
- Hold on.
- Doesn't he resemble Ji Chang Wook?

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,029
- He does.
- Right.

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,599
He has a strong actor look.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,699
He resembles Chang Wook as well.

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,269
- He's so well-built.
- He looks different.

53
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,940
- He has a different style.
- Right.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,639
- Walk in the middle.
- It's okay.

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll go in first, and you can come in next.

56
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,910
You must have waited long.

57
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,750
No. I only waited a little.

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,080
Is this true?

59
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,030
(Jae Hyeong also saw the new resident.)

60
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,860
Hello.

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,230
- Don't be so nervous.
- Okay.

62
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,270
I think he works out as well.

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,340
He seemed mature...

64
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,910
and also cute.

65
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,939
- I think we need one more chair.
- What?

66
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,950
You startled me.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,709
Hello.

68
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,920
- Really?
- Is this real?

69
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,980
- Hello.
- I'm shocked.

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,619
It's real.

71
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,390
- It's real.
- What?

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,590
I was really shocked.

73
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,030
I thought he was good-looking.

74
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,700
He looks very stylish.

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,700
Hello.

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Hello.

77
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,340
Objectively speaking, he was handsome.

78
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,970
His face...

79
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,180
looked gentle and well-balanced.

80
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,179
Hello.

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,720
(Exclaiming)

82
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,490
Hello.

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,260
My first impression of him was that he was handsome.

84
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,330
He looked a bit cute.

85
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,200
He was very charming.

86
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,300
Hello.

87
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,700
Hello.

88
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,239
He looked manly.

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,340
He was manly.

90
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,880
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't threatened.

91
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,190
There were six men now.

92
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,320
It could really...

93
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,630
It could really get bloody.

94
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,300
He looked very solid.

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,399
He had a good build, he was tall,

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,140
and he looked manly and handsome.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
So I thought he was very upright.

98
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,840
He's threatening.

99
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,780
I thought my ex might like him.

100
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,250
So it bothered me.

101
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,490
- Shall we sit?
- Let's sit.

102
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,160
Be comfortable.

103
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
- Here?
- Okay.

104
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,930
(Someone's ex moved in.)

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,999
I think he's one of the most threatening residents.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,099
Among the men.

107
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,169
I think he'd be a big competition.

108
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,699
It feels like this.

109
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,864
It's like a capable and wealthy older brother moved in.

110
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,266
- Right?
- Right.

111
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,739
- It feels like that.
- He looks relaxed.

112
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,309
It's like someone very relaxed moved in.

113
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,209
It's like a successful businessman...

114
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,519
joined a college drinking party.

115
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,089
But he's not trying to seem relaxed.

116
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,549
- He really looks relaxed.
- He has it.

117
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,059
- It just shows.
- That's true.

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,120
That's how it feels.

119
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,489
I think those who like masculine men would like him.

120
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,490
Right.

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,060
The men should be fully alert.

122
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,360
Right.

123
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,199
- Hello.
- Hello.

124
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,300
Let's clap for him.

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,210
What's your name?

126
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,180
I'm Shin Seung Yong.

127
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,980
I was born in 1992.

128
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,450
He seemed like he was older.

129
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,790
He was very mature.

130
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,190
I thought Hyeon Ji might like him.

131
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,030
I think I'm concerned.

132
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,610
(Another person who would like Seung Yong)

133
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,179
I was born in 1992.

134
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,140
(Exclaiming)

135
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,920
Right. I knew he'd like that.

136
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,650
(Jung Won Kyu born in 1993 is happy to have an older brother.)

137
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,560
I have an older brother.

138
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,429
What's your MBTI type?

139
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm an INFJ.

140
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm a half-thinker and half-feeler.

141
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
INTJ.

142
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,470
We share similar personalities.

143
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,750
I'm an ENFP.

144
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,420
I'm an ESFJ.

145
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,550
Except for J, everything else is split evenly.

146
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,190
I'm an ENFJ.

147
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,420
I see.

148
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,660
I'm an INFP.

149
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,310
I'm a doctor.

150
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,150
I work as a general physician in the skincare and beauty field.

151
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,050
Dermatology.

152
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
He's very...

153
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,000
Hello. I'm Shin Seung Yong.

154
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,869
I work as the deputy director...

155
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,870
at a dermatology clinic in Nonhyeon-dong.

156
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,740
(Surgery Room)

157
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,149
When patients who've struggled with their skin...

158
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,450
or personal insecurities...

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,059
leave the clinic with bright, smiling faces after treatment,

160
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,530
it makes me feel that I truly chose the right path.

161
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,130
I want to be a warm and skilled doctor...

162
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,229
who cares not only for my patients' insecurities...

163
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,940
but also for their hearts.

164
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,210
(Shin Seung Yong, doctor)

165
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,380
- Doctor?
- He's a doctor?

166
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,710
- In this case...
- Two doctors?

167
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,249
- I never thought he'd be a doctor.
- Dermatologist...

168
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,779
I think the men would get very nervous.

169
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,749
- Right.
- He even said he was a doctor.

170
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,789
- So...
- He's so cool.

171
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,359
We have a man with a full package.

172
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,830
- He's not relaxed for no reason.
- Right.

173
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,390
They'd be nervous.

174
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,229
He looked very cool and smart.

175
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,200
Doctors are pretty cool.

176
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,140
My ex likes...

177
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,870
intellectual people.

178
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,610
I thought my ex might like him.

179
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,850
He seemed much cooler.

180
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,080
I wanted to talk to him more.

181
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,790
I go to the dermatologist often.

182
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,089
- Really?
- Yes.

183
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,159
- I like going there.
- Shall we clink glasses?

184
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,259
The first clink.

185
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,860
Nice to meet you.

186
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,170
How long have you been working as a doctor?

187
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,097
I started a bit late.

188
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,840
It's been two years now.

189
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,940
(Amazing)

190
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,480
It concerned me naturally.

191
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,850
About Yun Nyeong.

192
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,050
I was worried.

193
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,260
What's your ideal type?

194
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,490
My ideal type?

195
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,360
Why? Are you excited?

196
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,860
I'm curious.

197
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,469
Someone kind and pretty.

198
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,530
Kind and pretty.

199
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
You're honest.

200
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,410
Me too.

201
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,719
(Who looks interested in Seung Yong?)

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Ji Hyeon, Min Kyung...

203
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,590
They were all interested.

204
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,930
All eyes were on him.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,260
Would you like to tour around the house?

206
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,870
- Yes. I'd be grateful.
- Let's...

207
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,700
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

208
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,440
- But we...
- I'm making it.

209
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,670
I'm making it.

210
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Again?

211
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,349
- No way.
- Don't tell me...

212
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,479
Seriously.

213
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,419
- No way.
- It wouldn't make sense.

214
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,720
- Again?
- No way.

215
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,150
- But we...
- I'm making it.

216
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,489
(The doorbell rang again.)

217
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,560
- Again?
- Seriously.

218
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,030
- Seriously.
- Let's go out.

219
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,060
Don't be nervous.

220
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,460
I'm so nervous.

221
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,830
That's natural.

222
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,600
I don't think Seung Yong's ex is here.

223
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,040
I think his ex might join later.

224
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,069
I didn't expect it at the time.

225
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,109
I thought, "What is going on?"

226
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,210
I didn't think a lady would be joining right away.

227
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,250
Are two people moving in today?

228
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Right now?

229
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,160
(Did another new resident ring the doorbell?)

230
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,600
Let's go together.

231
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,230
Excuse me.

232
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,870
Let's go together.

233
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,670
A card?

234
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,840
What if it's not?

235
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,310
(There's an envelope.)

236
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Amazing.

237
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,450
- We have a card.
- Let's go.

238
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,259
- My heart almost dropped.
- I thought it was another...

239
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,290
new person.

240
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,560
Me too.

241
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,460
- I'm excited.
- The seats... This is amazing.

242
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,900
Please read it.

243
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,800
"Welcome to our new resident, Shin Seung Yong!"

244
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,510
"Choose the person you'll go on a date with tomorrow."

245
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,139
"When you've chosen,"

246
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,550
"you can ask her on a date right there."

247
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,179
- The first impressions.
- Really?

248
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,849
He has to ask her on a date right there?

249
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,219
Who do you think he'll choose?

250
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,359
- Ji Hyeon.
- Ji Hyeon or Yun Nyeong.

251
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,129
I hope he chooses Hyeon Ji.

252
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,130
Who would he choose?

253
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,489
When you've chosen,

254
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,900
you can ask her on a date right there.

255
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Right here?

256
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,670
I think you have to do it now.

257
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
He might be attracted to Hyeon Ji...

258
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,040
and might want to know her.

259
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,910
It felt like he was a bit interested in her.

260
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,950
I thought he would choose Yun Nyeong.

261
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,050
I was very anxious.

262
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,390
I thought, "Please don't choose her."

263
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,290
I was nervous.

264
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,200
I was nervous because he might choose my ex.

265
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,700
That's going to be difficult.

266
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,339
I thought Ji Hyeon...

267
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,410
had a look that men liked.

268
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,840
I was very curious what choice Seung Yong would make.

269
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,150
It would be hard.

270
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,550
- Should we close our eyes?
- No.

271
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Let's have a meal together tomorrow, Yun Nyeong.

272
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,770
Let's have a meal together tomorrow, Yun Nyeong.

273
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Okay.

274
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,580
I had a feeling he'd choose Yun Nyeong.

275
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,649
- I really thought he'd choose her.
- Because of the kind vibe,

276
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,689
- Yes.
- I thought he'd choose her.

277
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,890
Yun Nyeong is popular. That's nice.

278
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,959
- It has begun.
- Yes, but he...

279
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,389
- seems someone very stable.
- Right.

280
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,559
Women like such men.

281
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,469
- Baek Hyun would be nervous.
- This...

282
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,030
What's Baek Hyun going to do?

283
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,600
Let's have a meal together tomorrow, Yun Nyeong.

284
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,270
Let's have a meal together tomorrow, Yun Nyeong.

285
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,110
Okay.

286
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,520
It's very open.

287
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,060
Yun Nyeong...

288
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,030
seemed very bright.

289
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,639
She was petite and she looked like a fairy.

290
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,670
I chose the person who left an impression.

291
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,510
Why is your face so red?

292
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,080
Me? Really?

293
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,520
I was so grateful that he chose me.

294
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,260
But I was a bit conscious of Baek Hyun who was next to me.

295
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,200
We were going to go on a date tomorrow,

296
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,540
but I had to go on a date with another man.

297
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,940
I thought it was understandable for someone like Yun Nyeong.

298
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,940
My bad feelings were never wrong.

299
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
You must be happy.

300
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,550
You should have fun.

301
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,030
Would anyone like to drink more?

302
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,500
- Do you want to check the fridge?
- Sure.

303
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,299
Let's give him a tour too.

304
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,069
Let's get some snacks...

305
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,140
- and talk.
- That would be nice.

306
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,039
This is the second floor.

307
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,139
(They continue the tour that was paused earlier.)

308
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,340
Recently people who drink use this space often.

309
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,180
They drink here.

310
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,049
- This is the main space.
- Jae Hyeong's room.

311
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,810
- My room.
- It's Jae Hyeong's room.

312
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,880
Will he be sharing a room with me?

313
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,720
- He'll use it with you.
- He'll use it with me.

314
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,890
(A bed has been added to Jae Hyeong and Seung Yong's room.)

315
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,590
You're my roommate.

316
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,460
- Nice.
- I hope we get along well.

317
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,529
- Really?
- He'll use it with me.

318
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,960
- He was placed there.
- Yes.

319
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,670
(Jae Hyeong is happy to have a roommate.)

320
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,740
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

321
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,350
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

322
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,289
(Hong Ji Yeon and Kim Woo Jin)

323
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,060
(Park Ji Hyeon and Jung Won Kyu)

324
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,030
(Choi Yun Nyeong and Lee Jae Hyeong)

325
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,030
(Shin Seung Yong)

326
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,040
(EXchange 4)

327
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,880
(Episode 12: A Different Time)

328
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,280
What food do you like?

329
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,250
My favorite food...

330
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,750
is Pyongyang naengmyeon.

331
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,689
Which restaurant do you think sells the best one?

332
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,559
In Gangnam,

333
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
- it's Jinmi.
- Jinmi!

334
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,000
I've recently discovered its taste, though.

335
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,930
I haven't had it yet.

336
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,899
Their naengmyeon has a clean taste.

337
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,269
- It tastes subtle.
- Yes.

338
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,039
Are you going to share one cup noodles?

339
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,169
Yes.

340
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,639
I've tried several places,

341
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,480
but they didn't have an impressive taste.

342
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,210
Are you going to drink?

343
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:37,380
- I'm not going to drink.
- Didn't you bring your glass?

344
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,080
Are you going to eat ramyeon? You spilled it.

345
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,220
This is a shirt I cherish.

346
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,120
I shouldn't spill food on this.

347
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,900
- It's a white shirt, you know.
- Is that Won Kyu's shirt?

348
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,340
Is that Won Kyu's shirt?

349
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,410
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh, no.

350
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,209
How can she say that?

351
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,279
- Wait.
- She doesn't know.

352
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,909
Ji Hyeon doesn't know that it's Won Kyu's shirt.

353
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,119
She thought it was a matching shirt.

354
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,649
Didn't she blurt it out instinctively?

355
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,489
That's a woman's sixth sense.

356
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,119
- I know.
- Her sixth sense has become sharp.

357
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,730
"Is that Won Kyu's shirt?"

358
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,600
Is that Won Kyu's shirt?

359
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,200
Is that Won Kyu's shirt?

360
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,070
- It's a white shirt, you know.
- Is that Won Kyu's shirt?

361
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,270
No, it's mine.

362
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,380
No, it's mine.

363
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,820
Goodness. And she's saying that?

364
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,819
That can drive her even crazier.

365
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,219
However, anyway,

366
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,759
she couldn't tell her the truth, so she managed to get away with it.

367
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,489
But the way Ji Yeon said it,

368
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,990
the nuance was unbelievable.

369
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,660
If I were Ji Hyeon, I would have felt stung.

370
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,170
Is it good?

371
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,409
Ji Hyeon asked me if that was Won Kyu's shirt,

372
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,170
so I just said it wasn't.

373
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,079
If I answered, "Won Kyu gave me this,"

374
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,620
It would have been strange...

375
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,150
as there could be Won Kyu's ex or my ex.

376
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,889
I couldn't say it openly...

377
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,219
in a situation like that,

378
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,590
so I just said, "No."

379
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
I saw it before Ji Yeon went out.

380
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
When I saw it at that time, I thought,

381
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,200
"They happen to be wearing the same shirt."

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
"No way."

383
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,770
Then she suddenly said this.

384
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,140
"It's a meaningful shirt."

385
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,640
The moment I heard that,

386
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,240
I figured out that it was the same shirt.

387
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,250
I didn't know it was my ex's shirt.

388
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,990
(She finally noticed the secret of the matching shirt.)

389
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,930
It's my turn. Why are you doing it?

390
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,230
Well, I was just...

391
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,430
Why are you doing it, Yun Nyeong?

392
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,460
I'll do it. Stop it.

393
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,200
I mean it. I don't feel comfortable.

394
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,630
- I'll do it.
- It's fine.

395
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,570
I'll rinse the dishes.

396
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,510
What's this?

397
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,240
It's supposed to separate,

398
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,640
but you did it the wrong way.

399
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,919
- Can I ask you to wash this?
- You cooked today. I can do it.

400
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,249
- Just this one.
- Okay.

401
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,690
- Give it to me.
- Thank you.

402
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,359
- I want to help you.
- No, it's fine.

403
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Will you do this, then?

404
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,829
- Yes, I'll do it.
- Okay.

405
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,430
- Move over.
- We can stop doing this.

406
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,429
What?

407
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,430
No, I'll do it.

408
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:42,130
Maybe I shouldn't interrupt your cozy time together.

409
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,069
- Cozy? What do you mean?
- What are you saying?

410
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,070
What are you talking about?

411
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,669
I'll empty the bin.

412
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,410
(Won Kyu joins in the kitchen.)

413
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
I think they're going to flood in now.

414
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,820
(They sneak down out of sight.)

415
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,090
- Won Kyu.
- Yes.

416
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,860
Did you give your T-shirt...

417
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,400
to Ji Yeon?

418
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,940
I didn't give it to her. Were you not there yesterday?

419
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
No.

420
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
When everyone was there, you were there, too.

421
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,010
I don't remember.

422
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,440
Yun Nyeong tried Yoo Sik's clothes...

423
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,709
(They were both drunk, so they don't remember accurately.)

424
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,220
and Ji Yeon tried on my clothes.

425
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,320
While they were doing it...

426
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,690
Oh, gosh.

427
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,420
I was drunk.

428
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,960
I guess she told me to give it to her.

429
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,360
So I said, "All right. Take it and try it on."

430
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,530
And she took it.

431
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,500
- I'm mad.
- You don't care about me.

432
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,270
It feels strange.

433
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,750
It is strange.

434
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,580
Am I the only one sitting here quietly?

435
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,979
- Should I...
- What are you saying?

436
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,149
flirt with other people?

437
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,419
You're not sitting here quietly.

438
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,460
You're talking to men the most.

439
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,430
This is different from what we discussed.

440
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,129
If you give her your shirt and ask me out,

441
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,230
that's nonsense.

442
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,130
Giving her the shirt doesn't mean anything to me.

443
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,430
That's how the vibe was back then.

444
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,870
What?

445
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,240
The situation developed like that.

446
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,499
"I'm sure it'd look good on you."

447
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,510
"Take it with you and try it on." I didn't say things like these.

448
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,640
So, it's meaningless when a woman takes your clothes?

449
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,580
But in that situation, I couldn't say no.

450
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,620
It would have been weird.

451
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,890
I couldn't understand it, though.

452
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,960
He's been asking me out since yesterday.

453
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,790
And today, Ji Yeon is wearing his shirt she took yesterday.

454
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,830
Why on earth is he asking me out?

455
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,270
I asked her just now,

456
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,270
"Is that Won Kyu's shirt?"

457
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,340
I thought to myself, "No way."

458
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,810
Wouldn't you be really upset...

459
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,010
if I walk around wearing another guy's T-shirt?

460
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,980
- I'd be upset.
- This is almost...

461
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,190
like saying, "Okay. We're over. It's individual play now."

462
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,189
"Go your separate way." Isn't it?

463
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,560
- It must be upsetting.
- Giving your shirt makes no sense.

464
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,399
You're right, Ji Hyeon.

465
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,459
But please understand that it was the vibe.

466
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,930
You expect me to accept your date after I found out the truth?

467
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,240
I think you should have a date with Ji Yeon.

468
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,840
She's your ideal type.

469
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
- What do you mean?
- She has fair skin...

470
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,910
and a high nose bridge. You said that's your ideal woman.

471
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,309
I wasn't your ideal type.

472
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,280
I know. She's there, and why are you asking me out?

473
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,120
After you gave her your shirt.

474
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,320
If being an ideal type...

475
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,060
Of course, that's not everything.

476
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
It looks like...

477
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,200
you two click.

478
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,530
You seem to click with other men too.

479
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,070
I don't think it's right for me to do nothing...

480
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,270
but to see you get along well with other guys...

481
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,580
and having a thought that you'd be happier.

482
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,580
So I want to have a date with you...

483
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,580
and have a conversation...

484
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,719
because there might be aspects of me...

485
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,090
that you hate or don't like.

486
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,520
And you also need to listen...

487
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,760
to how my mind changed.

488
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,230
Get that T-shirt back from her.

489
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,170
Go and tell her to give it back.

490
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,300
Then I'll have a date with you.

491
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,869
- That's...
- That's seriously bold.

492
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,179
- How can he get it back?
- Wait.

493
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,679
She's saying he needs to make his stance clear.

494
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,109
- "If you want to have a date," - Yes.

495
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,909
- "go and get the T-shirt back." - He needs to get it back.

496
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,049
Won Kyu is really in a difficult situation.

497
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,789
- Right.
- But he needs to decide now.

498
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,019
Right. She should do that.

499
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,419
I'd do the same thing as her.

500
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,019
"Get it back if you want to date with me."

501
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,319
But how can he get it back?

502
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,759
I'd just walk around...

503
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,090
without a shirt on.

504
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,860
I'll go, "Gosh, I'm freezing."

505
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,329
- "I'm freezing." - "Is there anything I can put on?"

506
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,369
- What shall he do?
- Otherwise, what can he do?

507
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,899
Saying it is ridiculous.

508
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,869
- What can he do? I'm curious.
- There's no clever solution.

509
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,970
There's no clever solution for that.

510
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,240
Get that T-shirt back from her.

511
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,140
Go and tell her to give it back.

512
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,350
Then I'll have a date with you.

513
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,850
I can't have a date with you seeing that.

514
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,120
Then shall I tell her to give it back to me?

515
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,520
You should tell her to give it back.

516
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,360
- Yes.
- That's strange.

517
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,030
Then shall I tell her?

518
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,760
Shall I tell her, "Ji Yeon, Won Kyu wants you to give it to me."

519
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
How can you do that?

520
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,399
I don't want to take it. You should tell her.

521
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,639
Seeing her walking around in your shirt,

522
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,070
I can't have a date with you as my ex.

523
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,670
Isn't that outright deception?

524
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,679
You two must have exchanged texts.

525
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,979
And why do you need to have a date with me?

526
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
You two just have a date.

527
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,979
You and I didn't have a chance to exchange texts.

528
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,219
If you wanted us to work out...

529
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,859
No, it's not that I wanted that unconditionally...

530
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,989
from the beginning.

531
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,760
Anyway, get the T-shirt back.

532
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,270
(They finished the talk leaving one unresolved issue behind.)

533
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,100
Anyway, I want to have a date with my ex...

534
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,170
and have a conversation with her.

535
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,850
So I need to get the shirt back,

536
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,080
but now I have no idea how I can do so.

537
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,920
It's strange to ask her to give it back.

538
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,490
I need to think about it.

539
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,590
Yesterday, my ex didn't send me a text.

540
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,400
Obviously, they texted each other.

541
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,169
(What do you think was written on the texts?)

542
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,430
"The shirt looks good on you."

543
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
If he actually sent that, it's incredible.

544
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,210
That's epic!

545
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,570
"The T-shirt looks good on you."

546
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,480
Hi.

547
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,690
- Gosh, it's annoying!
- Why?

548
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,020
It's annoying!

549
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
What is it?

550
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,900
(He feels like he saw something he shouldn't have witnessed.)

551
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,410
Look at that.

552
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,509
- That's...
- That...

553
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,240
He watched it live, right in the front?

554
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,150
He saw her slamming the blanket down.

555
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,949
Jae Hyeong, of all people.

556
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,779
It was seen too clearly.

557
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
Gosh, this is...

558
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:41,850
It's unbelievable.

559
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,690
(He decides to leave the place for Ji Hyeon's sake.)

560
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,930
(He visits someone on the 1st floor, where he can't see the 4th floor.)

561
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,600
Come in.

562
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,440
- Yun Nyeong.
- Yes?

563
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,769
- Am I making you uncomfortable?
- No.

564
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,910
- Why do you avoid me?
- I don't avoid you.

565
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,810
Why? I'm not avoiding you, really.

566
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,180
Don't you have anything to talk to me?

567
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,020
Do you want to say something?

568
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,189
It's not that I have something to say.

569
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,050
You can come in and talk for a while.

570
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,819
You don't know what you're doing tomorrow?

571
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,860
No.

572
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,530
I never imagined he'd pick me.

573
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,399
That flustered me, too,

574
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,969
- Why?
- I was rather flustered.

575
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,270
- Really?
- I got flustered, all of a sudden.

576
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,869
Still, I don't find it natural...

577
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,110
to hear someone say your name.

578
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,410
It kind of feels...

579
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,410
When I first came here,

580
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,920
you were the only person I could rely on.

581
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,690
- And the first scene I saw...
- Yes.

582
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,020
was when Yoo Sik wanted to give you something.

583
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,489
When he was giving you that stuff,

584
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,560
his hands touched yours.

585
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,059
I don't think that had a meaning.

586
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,429
- I don't remember.
- I don't think it had.

587
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,559
- I don't remember.
- It didn't look meaningful.

588
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,800
But as the first scene I saw here...

589
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,139
was something like that,

590
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,470
although I expected that wouldn't bother me,

591
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,609
I thought, "Look at that jerk,"

592
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,169
when I saw that.

593
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,179
(He didn't feel fine like he expected.)

594
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,140
It wasn't easy to make myself adjust here.

595
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,450
Actually, before you joined the show,

596
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,949
after reading my introduction from my ex,

597
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,620
I wondered how I'd feel if I see you here.

598
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,089
I really had a hard time...

599
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,489
when I was dating you.

600
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,490
Yes, I know that.

601
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:32,360
But after you came here,

602
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,129
when I saw you drinking,

603
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,869
although it was just drinking,

604
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,599
it reminded me of old memories, all of a sudden.

605
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,700
So I realized...

606
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,410
that it was how it felt.

607
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,080
Rather, after you came here...

608
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,909
You had your mind set and felt comfortable?

609
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,609
It made me more like that...

610
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,720
because that made me upset when we were in a relationship.

611
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,289
So when it overlapped in my mind, it made me sort out things.

612
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,390
Baek Hyun expressed...

613
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:01,259
his feelings toward me very actively.

614
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,589
But before you came here,

615
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,900
I wasn't that resolved.

616
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,100
Baek Hyun? I think he's a good guy.

617
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,400
I thought you noticed.

618
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,110
I wish you happiness, with all my heart.

619
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,510
After all, you live on my memory as someone precious.

620
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,219
When you came here,

621
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,179
did you expect to meet someone new?

622
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,190
Yes.

623
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,150
Then commit to that.

624
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,460
Yes, I should.

625
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,460
I'll show how I feel. I'm interested in Ji Hyeon.

626
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,400
Can I help you with anything?

627
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,760
I think I can do it on my own.

628
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,269
It's nothing you can help me with.

629
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,600
You can't help me with winning someone's heart.

630
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,170
I appreciate that you wish me happiness.

631
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
Do your best.

632
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,349
- I should go.
- Already?

633
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,920
Let me know if something bothers you.

634
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,279
- Me?
- Yes.

635
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,690
- I wonder if that would happen.
- I don't think it would.

636
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,219
Do your best.

637
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
(They genuinely wish each other well in finding new partners.)

638
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:08,230
Good night.

639
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,400
That's great.

640
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,870
- They're awesome.
- It's nice to see them like that.

641
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,769
I really hope that they can genuinely wish...

642
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,000
each other well in finding new partners.

643
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,570
(The small living room)

644
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,139
Are you in the master's program now?

645
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,080
- Yes, master's.
- I see.

646
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,120
- You said you were born in 2002...
- In 2001, and I'm 25 years old.

647
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,479
You started your master's so fast.

648
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,220
So that makes it fun.

649
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,289
Didn't you want to take a break?

650
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,930
To be honest, I wasn't that much...

651
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,659
- Hi.
- Hi.

652
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,760
- Two of you here?
- Yes.

653
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,029
- Only two of you?
- Jae Hyeong was here,

654
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,300
- but for a minute...
- He left for a talk.

655
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
- I'm down here for a while.
- I see.

656
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,970
I'm here without makeup.

657
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,940
Are you really without makeup?

658
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,039
- I'm wearing a little makeup.
- You look the same.

659
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,080
- I'm wearing lipstick.
- You look the same.

660
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,320
- So, as far as I know...
- Oh, no!

661
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Are you all right?

662
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,780
- So, as far as I know...
- Oh, no!

663
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,450
Are you all right?

664
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,889
Are you all right? Did it get on you?

665
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,389
- Why did it get so shaken?
- I know. What's wrong?

666
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,229
- You came down carrying this?
- Yes.

667
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,230
- Yes.
- I see.

668
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,030
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm totally fine.

669
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,699
- It's definitely fine.
- I'm sorry.

670
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,330
- It's fine, totally.
- It's nothing.

671
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,370
You surprised me. Why didn't you call me?

672
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,070
Do you want some beer?

673
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,609
Cheers.

674
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,080
(The party grew in number, including Jae Hyeong.)

675
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,580
What's your ideal type?

676
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,150
I like someone cheerful...

677
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,319
and interested in many fields,

678
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,560
because I am interested in many fields.

679
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,160
- Then we can keep talking.
- I see.

680
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,699
I want someone similar to me, but a bit different from me.

681
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,469
Someone interested in many fields...

682
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,139
Similar to me in that respect, but I like someone...

683
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
who has a different personality from me.

684
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,709
It seems that you have really high standards.

685
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,740
Me? Why?

686
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,910
You kind of...

687
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
It's okay to have high standards.

688
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,979
It's just an ideal type.

689
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,320
You're right.

690
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,590
But I rather feel...

691
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,620
I'm three years older than Min Kyung.

692
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,830
When I was 25 years old,

693
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,029
my standards were much higher.

694
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,160
- Really?
- Yes.

695
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,999
- Isn't it the other way around?
- Really?

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,040
No. When I was young, I had a clear idea of my ideal type.

697
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,809
What's your MBTI again?

698
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,009
I'm INFJ.

699
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,339
- You're an N type.
- I'm an N type.

700
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,479
I like talking about these.

701
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,549
"What if" something like this, you know.

702
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,849
- It's fun.
- It's so fun.

703
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,749
- This is what I thought.
- I do that all the time.

704
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,079
I ride in the subway, and people are standing.

705
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,989
I wish the destinations are written for those who are sitting.

706
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,559
- Right.
- Exactly.

707
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,289
- Please...
- Exactly.

708
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,989
If someone invents an application for that...

709
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,529
- They should get an award.
- They should win a Nobel Prize.

710
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,229
- They should get an award?
- Yes.

711
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,899
- In the past...
- You surprised me.

712
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,399
The seats are joined together, and I'm standing in the middle...

713
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,569
so that I could sit on any empty seats.

714
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,769
- I stand in the middle.
- Exactly.

715
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,770
Right.

716
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,609
- What? That's so funny.
- He's right.

717
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,909
- What's this?
- Exactly.

718
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,039
- Right.
- You know,

719
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,009
before people get off, they do this.

720
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,079
- Right.
- They go, "Which station is it?"

721
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,479
- They do that.
- That makes me excited.

722
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,479
Whenever that happens, I move a bit like this.

723
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
(Demonstrating again)

724
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,090
- Life is the same for everyone.
- Right.

725
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,760
- You're so funny.
- Seriously.

726
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,789
I like your sense of humor.

727
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,259
- So...
- It's so funny.

728
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,160
- when it's disturbing...
- I love people who are this funny.

729
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,899
He's more cheerful than I expected.

730
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,929
He adapted well. He adapted immediately.

731
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,039
He's doing this on the day he meets them first?

732
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,969
- He's being so playful already?
- He's being playful.

733
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,069
- He's cheerful.
- He's very cheerful.

734
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,670
- He's cheerful.
- He's just too good.

735
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,940
What's your hobby, by the way?

736
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,650
I love books.

737
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,550
Really? I don't read books.

738
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,149
- So I brought books here.
- Me too!

739
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,220
What did you bring?

740
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,659
I brought a novel and two humanities books.

741
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,359
- Really?
- Which humanities books?

742
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,559
- What did you bring?
- How can you read those?

743
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,060
It's called "The Art of Loving."

744
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,899
- I know that book.
- I brought "The Art of Loving!"

745
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,970
- Really?
- Yes.

746
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,140
- Are you sure?
- Please review the book later.

747
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,339
I've read it about twice so far.

748
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Is that true?

749
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,209
I love Eric Fromm.

750
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,580
Do you? It's my first time to buy his book.

751
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,579
What novel did you bring?

752
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,879
"Strong Current."

753
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,319
- "Strong Current." - Jung Dae Gun.

754
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,149
- That startled me.
- That novel is popular...

755
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,619
- these days.
- That startled me.

756
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,419
I wanted to read it.

757
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,789
"Strong Current." That sounds interesting.

758
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,159
Would you lend me the book?

759
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,259
- Okay. I'm nearly done.
- You brought it.

760
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,630
Really?

761
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,000
Seung Yong brought two books,

762
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,970
and one of them is the book I brought.

763
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,740
"The Art of Loving."

764
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,680
My interest in him suddenly rose.

765
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,480
In terms of character, he's incredibly witty.

766
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,550
He seems to be modest, relaxed, and funny.

767
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,650
It'll be nice to go on a date with him.

768
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,520
I think we'll get along very well.

769
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,460
I thought, "Her sentimentality is similar to mine."

770
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,360
I became curious about Ji Hyeon...

771
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,440
and developed a desire to meet her.

772
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,669
- I'll retire to my room first.
- Okay.

773
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,939
- Bye.
- Bye.

774
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,880
- I'll retire to my room.
- Bye.

775
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,010
Good night.

776
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,049
I think Seung Yong got caught on Ji Hyeon's radar.

777
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,749
- I know. Also, it was like...
- He got caught on it.

778
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,349
- Did you see the look in her eyes?
- The look in her eyes.

779
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,619
It was like...

780
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,919
"This boy is mine."

781
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,659
- Exactly.
- That's right.

782
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,759
When they talked about Pyongyang naengmyeon,

783
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,089
- the reactions told me...
- That's right.

784
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,530
- that it has begun.
- That's right.

785
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,599
- And "The Art of Loving" too.
- I know.

786
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,529
- I know.
- I'm worried about Jae Hyeong.

787
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,069
- Earlier...
- I know.

788
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,399
He needs to express his interest in Ji Hyeon.

789
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,509
I know.

790
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,340
He suddenly got a strong rival.

791
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,480
(Jae Hyeong follows Ji Hyeon outside the room.)

792
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,009
- Ji Hyeon.
- Yes?

793
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,050
Good night.

794
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,319
Good night. Bye.

795
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,120
Isn't Ji Hyeon older than you?

796
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,719
I told him to call me by my name.

797
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,859
Really?

798
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,659
You can call me by my name too.

799
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,429
- No!
- Why not?

800
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,199
I'll just speak casually.

801
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,700
We're a family.

802
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,869
Are we a family?

803
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,970
- We're a family.
- Have things progressed so much?

804
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,699
- It's so spacious.
- This room is spacious.

805
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,940
There's a dressing room in here. Do you want to see it?

806
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,980
- It's here.
- A dressing room?

807
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,350
Hold on.

808
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,650
Why is it so big?

809
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,080
What?

810
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,489
We got this room through rock-paper-scissors.

811
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,660
Which one is your bed?

812
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,789
It's this one.

813
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,060
- The one at the end?
- Yes.

814
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,460
It's better to take the one at the end.

815
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,769
- Good night. Bye.
- Good night.

816
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,700
- Okay. I'll shut the door.
- Good night. Okay.

817
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,440
Bye.

818
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,699
Don't drink too much.

819
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,540
- Okay. I'll go to bed soon.
- Good night.

820
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,939
- Ji Hyeon.
- Yes?

821
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,680
Go on a date with me sometime.

822
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,579
- Okay. That sounds good.
- Good night.

823
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,650
Good night.

824
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,820
(1st floor, Yoo Sik and Won Kyu's room)

825
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,890
Who is it?

826
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,530
I want to talk.

827
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Come on in.

828
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,380
(Min Kyung asked Yoo Sik for a talk.)

829
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,980
There's a chair.

830
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,550
Come here. Sit down.

831
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Sit on the chair.

832
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,030
So this is what your room looks like.

833
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,500
Are you doing well?

834
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,070
The date was fun,

835
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,010
but I thought about you more.

836
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Why?

837
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,690
Don't cry.

838
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,460
Tell me without crying.

839
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,139
Even when someone expresses his interest in me,

840
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,310
I don't develop an interest.

841
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,910
My standards are too high.

842
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,940
My standards are you.

843
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,150
My standards are you.

844
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,780
I really didn't know.

845
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,520
What didn't you know?

846
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,430
I didn't know that you were a good person.

847
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,880
- That's...
- That's insane.

848
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,250
"My standards are you."

849
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,180
Her desire to get back together with her ex grew a lot.

850
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,250
They've spent so many years together.

851
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,620
Who are you texting?

852
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,220
I'm curious.

853
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
I don't know.

854
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,830
It's okay to ask.

855
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,330
It's okay to ask.

856
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,400
Then why don't you know? Why won't you tell me?

857
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,300
You need to tell me so that I can get over you.

858
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,340
My desire to get back together with you is diminishing.

859
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,440
Exactly. That's why I'm curious.

860
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,770
I want to know why you began to feel that way.

861
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,079
It just became clear to me today.

862
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,450
When you didn't text me on the first day, I realized it.

863
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,820
When I entered the Ex Room today, I realized it clearly.

864
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:02,324
What?

865
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,390
You didn't come here to get back together with me.

866
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,545
You deserted me.

867
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:09,565
I didn't desert you, okay?

868
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,490
If I live my life diligently, does that mean I'm deserting you?

869
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,330
I'm the only thing you can desert in your life.

870
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,800
How could you describe it as deserting you?

871
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
Seriously,

872
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,310
we need to go through many changes.

873
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,840
I think it's true no matter what we do.

874
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,010
To get back together?

875
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,880
If we get back together, it goes without saying.

876
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,220
So why did you choose me?

877
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,420
- What?
- So why did you choose me?

878
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,720
Today?

879
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,660
Aren't you saying that you want us to get back together?

880
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,330
I just wanted to talk to you and figure out your thoughts.

881
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,340
May I ask you who is interested in you?

882
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,910
No, I won't answer that.

883
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,370
Is there someone you're interested in?

884
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,640
I won't answer that either.

885
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,510
How is it that you don't tell me anything?

886
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,519
Why do I need to tell you anything?

887
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,250
- Why don't you tell me?
- Why do I need to tell you?

888
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,019
We've dated for eight years,

889
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,759
so you should've cared even for a bit.

890
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,929
You should've worried about me even for a bit.

891
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,260
- I did that, okay?
- No, you didn't.

892
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
It's obvious from how well you've been living.

893
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,810
Regardless of whether or not we'll get back together...

894
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,579
If there seemed to be a misunderstanding,

895
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,680
you should've tried to talk to me first.

896
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,549
What misunderstanding?

897
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,850
We broke up because of you.

898
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,820
How is that a misunderstanding?

899
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,990
Perhaps there was a misunderstanding.

900
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,060
I don't think there was. I think we broke up because of me.

901
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,460
If you know that you've done wrong, why do you act this way toward me?

902
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,330
I've done wrong when we were dating.

903
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,340
But why should I act in any way when we've already broken up?

904
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,740
You didn't come here to get back together with me.

905
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,179
Why should I act in any way toward you?

906
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,809
What's your reason?

907
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,210
Why do you think I have no intention to get back together with you?

908
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,050
- Did you ask me?
- You had no intention.

909
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,390
Hey, how would you know?

910
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,120
- Don't "Hey" me.
- How would you know?

911
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,530
I watched it today.

912
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,330
I watched the video of you saying that you wanted to meet someone new.

913
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,270
Interesting.

914
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,799
Did I watch someone you wanted to hide from me?

915
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,869
No.

916
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,969
Did you say those words, thinking that I wouldn't know?

917
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:38,540
- No.
- Then what?

918
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,810
I said those words because of the way you behaved.

919
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,920
You're here to find someone new.

920
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,290
But you got to know everyone...

921
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,920
and decided that I was the best.

922
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,590
Do you expect me to go back to you because of that reason?

923
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,730
It makes no sense.

924
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,230
So what do you want to do from now on?

925
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,270
I'll follow my heart, of course.

926
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,270
Don't you think about me at all?

927
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,740
What do you want to say to me?

928
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,479
Don't you think about me at all?

929
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,710
I do. Of course, I did.

930
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,680
That was why I didn't open up easily to other people.

931
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,320
I made all of you.

932
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,960
You didn't make all of you.

933
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,820
I adjusted everything to suit me.

934
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,560
- You...
- How could you say such a thing?

935
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,029
We began dating when we were young.

936
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,270
You didn't adjust everything to suit you.

937
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,270
I'm not a machine, okay?

938
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,699
Saying that we adjusted things to suit each other would be okay.

939
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,570
But you didn't adjust everything about me, okay?

940
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,380
It just came out that way. I'm sorry.

941
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:52,063
Even if I came here without lingering affection,

942
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:56,339
I hoped that you'd make an effort.

943
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,320
When you have no intention of getting back together?

944
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,060
I thought it'd be like that.

945
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,860
I thought the man I knew would do that.

946
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,200
So there's someone you're interested in.

947
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,200
You aren't interested in me anymore. Should I think of things this way?

948
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,299
Can't I feel gratitude toward someone...

949
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,070
who shows her interest in me?

950
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,769
Just answer the question.

951
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,140
Okay. Think of things that way.

952
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,150
You're so mean.

953
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,989
Then why did you buy things...

954
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,490
like hotteok?

955
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,490
Wasn't it for me?

956
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,390
Didn't you buy it for me?

957
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,889
Perhaps I didn't buy it.

958
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:37,959
Tell me.

959
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,059
- Perhaps I didn't buy it.
- Tell me.

960
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,330
I didn't buy it.

961
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,930
- Really?
- Yes.

962
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I thought you had behaved that way,

963
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,869
so I naturally became swayed.

964
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,580
I worried about that.

965
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,749
- Just tell me.
- I worried you'd get emotional.

966
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,950
Just tell me.

967
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,150
I didn't buy it. Satisfied?

968
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,520
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

969
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,620
- Can you bet everything?
- I'm sure.

970
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,690
- What?
- Don't say that, Min Kyung.

971
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,730
Why would you say something like "Can you bet everything?"

972
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,700
That means I was mistaken.

973
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,870
You had no feelings for me from the start.

974
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,969
You turned me into a fool again.

975
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,099
When did I turn you into a fool?

976
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,140
Then...

977
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,839
Did I go to you and say,

978
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,910
"I bought this for you?"

979
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,540
No.

980
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,549
You went grocery shopping and came back with hotteok,

981
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,020
so I thought that it meant something.

982
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,090
Go back upstairs.

983
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,550
I want to talk some more.

984
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,520
Is there anything you want to hear?

985
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:46,030
"When I went to the Ex Room, my heart ached."

986
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,700
"My heart got swayed."

987
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,570
My heart didn't ache or get swayed.

988
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,700
I went there because I wanted to hear you talk...

989
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,970
about how you felt.

990
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,210
Of course, good memories affected me.

991
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,750
I couldn't help but feel sad.

992
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,350
But why would my heart get swayed?

993
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,280
Didn't you think about the ways you mistreated me?

994
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,320
I don't think I mistreated you much when we were dating.

995
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,020
How about when we broke up?

996
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,230
All right. I'm not really...

997
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,930
Talking won't change anything.

998
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,200
We keep repeating the same words.

999
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,670
You're so mean.

1000
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,140
Just live as you feel bad about what you've done.

1001
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,059
That stopped the tears.

1002
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,900
Their method of conversation was...

1003
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,729
a bit regrettable.

1004
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,929
A couple can have...

1005
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,669
that kind of a conversation when they're sensitive, but...

1006
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,369
You know, Min Kyung thinks...

1007
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,879
Yoo Sik is entirely at fault for the breakup.

1008
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,009
- That's right.
- It makes no sense.

1009
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,279
A breakup is never one person's fault.

1010
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,420
- That's right.
- Both parties are always at fault.

1011
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,689
But she keeps saying that they broke up because of Yoo Sik.

1012
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,719
She keeps saying that he deserted her.

1013
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,489
- It's a bit...
- It's regrettable.

1014
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,959
- Yes, it's regrettable.
- Yes.

1015
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,259
Min Kyung's complaints...

1016
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,059
- sound like, "Please look at me." - That's right.

1017
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,269
I feel like it's 1 of the 3 chapters of Min Kyung...

1018
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,799
- trying to get Yoo Sik back.
- That's right.

1019
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,839
In Chapter One, she was like, "Can't you come back to me?"

1020
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,479
In Chapter Two, she was like, "You deserted me!"

1021
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,309
- In Chapter Three...
- One wears out the other.

1022
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,849
- Yes. One wears out the other.
- Yes.

1023
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,549
There are steps.

1024
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,579
- "All right. I'm sorry." - Yes.

1025
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,479
- "I'm sorry." - I bet that ending was frequent.

1026
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,249
I feel like it's a process of her trying to get him back.

1027
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,359
I don't think that's the right way...

1028
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,290
to change Yoo Sik's mind.

1029
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,589
The more she does that,

1030
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,599
the more tired Yoo Sik becomes and gets over her.

1031
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,899
In any case, he never told her before this time...

1032
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,739
that he's interested in someone else...

1033
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,939
and is trying to get over her.

1034
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,939
- He never told her that.
- No.

1035
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,479
For the first time,

1036
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,979
- he said it clearly.
- Yes.

1037
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,209
He didn't say who it was.

1038
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,719
I think Yoo Sik could say that clearly...

1039
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,489
because he's pretty much over her.

1040
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,049
I think visiting the Ex Room helped him get over her.

1041
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,360
- I think so.
- Seriously.

1042
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,219
I think everyone is sleeping.

1043
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,360
(Won Kyu and Ji Yeon are in the 2nd floor's mini living room.)

1044
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,790
The thing is,

1045
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,900
I was very drunk yesterday.

1046
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,339
So I don't remember every single detail.

1047
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,910
When I gave the clothing,

1048
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,539
- there were Yun Nyeong and...
- Yun Nyeong,

1049
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,809
- Yoo Sik, and Jae Hyeong.
- Yoo Sik.

1050
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,509
- Jae Hyeong.
- There were those three.

1051
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:53,049
- Yun Nyeong told Yoo Sik...
- She told Yoo Sik...

1052
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,449
that she liked his clothing.

1053
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,889
She said that she wanted to wear it.

1054
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,620
- Did she take it?
- She took it.

1055
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,160
But she gave it back to him.

1056
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,660
- To her room?
- Yes.

1057
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,630
Why did she give it back?

1058
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,600
She didn't want the man who was interested in...

1059
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,470
to see it and misunderstand.

1060
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,970
I see.

1061
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,940
- Why?
- In that situation,

1062
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,080
what did you say? If I remember correctly...

1063
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,449
- "Give me one too." - "Give me one too."

1064
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,980
"What? There's something that suits you."

1065
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,919
"It's this one." You took it out and gave it to me.

1066
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,050
- Really?
- Yes.

1067
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,150
I see.

1068
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,489
(He finally figured out what happened yesterday.)

1069
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,520
What is it?

1070
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,360
I see. I didn't know exactly what...

1071
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,430
had happened.

1072
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,070
Did something happen?

1073
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,440
The thing is,

1074
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,369
you wore the T-shirt...

1075
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,139
the day after I wore it.

1076
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,709
Did you wear it the day before?

1077
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,510
- Yes.
- Really?

1078
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,319
You wore it yesterday and I wore it today?

1079
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,349
Yes. That's right.

1080
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:04,290
Did you wear this to the keyword date yesterday?

1081
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,160
Really? I had no idea.

1082
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,130
Right? The thing is...

1083
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,630
It's my fault.

1084
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,100
In any case,

1085
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,130
people will figure out...

1086
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,609
that you're wearing the T-shirt I wore.

1087
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,440
The one who went on a date with you will figure it out.

1088
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,580
That person and my ex will figure it out.

1089
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,090
If my ex figures it out...

1090
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,719
She'll feel very...

1091
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,860
It won't be courteous.

1092
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,690
- I...
- Had I been your ex,

1093
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,030
I would've gotten furious.

1094
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,460
- Seriously.
- Right.

1095
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,030
Despite that,

1096
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,270
it'll be strange to take it back now.

1097
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,610
I'm wearing it already, so...

1098
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,670
I'll wash it and give it back to you.

1099
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,980
It'll be strange to take it back now.

1100
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,250
I'll give it back to you, but...

1101
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,919
You chose this T-shirt.

1102
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,749
You said that it'd suit me well.

1103
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,250
You said that you thought of one item that'd suit me well.

1104
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,430
"Ji Yeon. There's something that suits you."

1105
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,230
"There's one. Hold on."

1106
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,729
You rummaged through your things and went, "It's this one."

1107
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,070
I was like, "What? Oh, yes!" That was how I received it.

1108
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,180
Won Kyu, why did you do that?

1109
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,680
I resent myself.

1110
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,859
I never imagined an outcome...

1111
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,760
like this one.

1112
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,759
I didn't think things through.

1113
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,900
I was too drunk.

1114
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,530
I resent myself for getting so drunk.

1115
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,739
- He's out of it.
- His soul left his body.

1116
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,769
He explained it well so that she didn't become annoyed.

1117
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,279
He explained it well so that she understood.

1118
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,639
- He explained it well.
- He explained it well...

1119
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,909
and Ji Yeon was understanding.

1120
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,749
- That's right.
- Ji Yeon said it well.

1121
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,919
"Had I been your ex, I would've gotten furious."

1122
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,090
- She related to his ex.
- She related to his ex.

1123
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,019
- Both of them handled it well.
- Good.

1124
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,459
So that their relationship wouldn't end,

1125
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,789
- they kept things open.
- That's right.

1126
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,459
While he explained it well,

1127
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,460
Ji Yeon wouldn't be happy.

1128
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:29,670
- It'd be a bit...
- It wouldn't sit right with her.

1129
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,370
Are you okay?

1130
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,810
Anyway, I also feel bad for you.

1131
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,310
It's my fault.

1132
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,119
Got it.

1133
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,290
(Won Kyu leaves first.)

1134
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,680
I had mixed feelings.

1135
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,059
I do think that Won Kyu must've been bothered by it,

1136
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,120
but still...

1137
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,290
I felt a bit hurt by him.

1138
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,060
Because I didn't think that way.

1139
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,870
I do understand how...

1140
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,640
Won Kyu and his ex would feel.

1141
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,439
But it still upset me.

1142
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,280
(Despite understanding, Ji Yeon is still upset.)

1143
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,710
I wore it...

1144
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,180
with full excitement.

1145
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,920
I was like, "I'll quickly show off to Won Kyu."

1146
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,319
But Won Kyu didn't even really remember...

1147
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,460
giving the top to me.

1148
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:12,870
(Won Kyu came up to the 4th floor to find Ji Hyeon.)

1149
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,740
- What?
- Hey.

1150
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,010
What is it?

1151
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,510
Can I come in? It's me.

1152
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,250
(Won Kyu, after recalling his memories, has come by.)

1153
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,460
- Were you sleeping?
- Yes.

1154
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,230
I wanted to talk about...

1155
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,470
what happened earlier.

1156
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,710
And how will you do that?

1157
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,909
Yoo Sik and I planned to drink together yesterday.

1158
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,080
That was why we were drinking by ourselves.

1159
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,020
Out of the blue, people came by.

1160
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,150
With that, I got more drunk.

1161
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,460
That was how the mood flowed.

1162
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,030
But since you saw her...

1163
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,330
wearing the top,

1164
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,129
it's only natural that you would feel upset.

1165
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,440
If that had happened to me, I'd be too.

1166
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,010
I feel terrible about it.

1167
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,340
I told Ji Yeon about it.

1168
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:29,950
What did you tell her?

1169
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,849
If my ex saw it,

1170
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,290
it would make her unhappy.

1171
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,390
And?

1172
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,700
What is your point?

1173
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,100
Those were my points.

1174
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,870
That was what happened?

1175
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,100
- Yes.
- That was what you did?

1176
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,340
I talked to her. I'm sorry.

1177
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,640
You must be upset. It's natural that you'd be upset.

1178
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,210
Ji Yeon must also be upset.

1179
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,710
- It might be.
- Yes.

1180
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,180
(How did you feel when your ex apologized?)

1181
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,450
I couldn't understand him.

1182
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,920
My ex asking me...

1183
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,460
to go on a date,

1184
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,660
even though he already has someone he texts and gives clothes to...

1185
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,860
It really angered me.

1186
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,970
My feelings were close to resignation.

1187
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,640
What I'm certain about...

1188
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,070
is that I don't want to go on that date right now.

1189
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:37,750
(A wavering heart despite it not reaching)

1190
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,849
It's not a case that can be cleared up easily.

1191
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,450
- No.
- That's why I said...

1192
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,089
it's best to choose 1 of the 2...

1193
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,159
to avoid situations like this.

1194
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,759
Either way, no matter what they say, that's bound to happen.

1195
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,459
How could he do that in that situation?

1196
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,199
- Of course, he can't.
- Right?

1197
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,769
- But still.
- EXchange is deciding whether...

1198
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,169
to get back together with your ex...

1199
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,469
- or to find someone new.
- Exactly.

1200
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,639
You just can't fix a target and go for it all in.

1201
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,909
As a woman, I get Ji Hyeon's feelings.

1202
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,879
But I hope she understands that Won Kyu has no other choice either.

1203
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,149
I agree with that.

1204
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,819
Although it wasn't intentional,

1205
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,490
the situation just flowed in that direction.

1206
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,100
(2nd floor, Seung Yong and Jae Hyeong's room)

1207
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,570
I feel dizzy.

1208
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:43,010
(Seung Yong has his first date with Yun Nyeong today.)

1209
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,680
(Glancing)

1210
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,950
From what I heard,

1211
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,760
Yun Nyeong liked denim.

1212
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,030
- Denim?
- Do you have any?

1213
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,130
I only have jeans.

1214
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,170
Jeans and...

1215
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,169
You brought quite a lot.

1216
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,570
(Jae Hyeong tells him about Yun Nyeong's taste secretly.)

1217
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,900
Just dress up neatly.

1218
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,209
Don't feel pressured.

1219
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,980
Wear something comfortable yet neat.

1220
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,750
(He got date outfit advice from his roommate.)

1221
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,019
- He's helping.
- Is he helping him?

1222
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,619
To tell him that?

1223
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,859
Telling others things like that is nice.

1224
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,890
I agree.

1225
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Are you leaving?

1226
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,260
Yes, right now.

1227
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,439
What?

1228
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,670
Why are you so puffed up?

1229
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,640
- Am I?
- Yes.

1230
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:45,970
How bad is it?

1231
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

1232
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

1233
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,880
What are you making in the morning?

1234
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,750
Something to spread on the bread. Would you like some?

1235
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,550
But aren't you going on a date?

1236
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,190
- Yes.
- I forgot.

1237
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,620
- Am I puffed up?
- A little.

1238
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,990
I'd better drink tea to help subside.

1239
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,560
- The one from Yun Nyeong?
- Yes.

1240
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,270
I wanted to go on a date but couldn't.

1241
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,409
That was a huge bummer.

1242
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,610
"She should've gone on the date with him after going on one with me."

1243
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,550
"Why is she going on a date with Seung Yong before me?"

1244
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,750
Those kinds of thoughts made me jealous.

1245
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,360
Did you sleep well?

1246
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,060
Me? Yes, I did.

1247
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,560
- Really?
- Drinking helped me sleep well.

1248
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,430
You didn't sleep well, did you?

1249
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,630
- Sorry?
- You didn't sleep well, did you?

1250
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,070
I am fine, I slept quite a lot last night.

1251
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,870
(Someone has become a nuisance.)

1252
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,539
What? I slept for hours.

1253
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,540
(4th floor, Min Kyung, Ji Hyeon, and Hyeon Ji's room)

1254
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,410
The veins in my eyes have popped.

1255
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,319
- The vines?
- My eye veins have popped.

1256
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,750
Your eye veins have popped?

1257
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,450
It's a first for me.

1258
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,690
- Show me.
- My eyes are red.

1259
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,990
(The veins in Min Kyung's eyes have popped.)

1260
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,200
Unbelievable, right? It's my first time ever.

1261
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,070
Why did they pop?

1262
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,440
Were you too tired?

1263
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,210
I did some research, and it could be from stress.

1264
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,080
There are so many things I'm experiencing for the first time.

1265
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,450
Oh, no.

1266
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,680
What now? Should you go see a doctor?

1267
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,620
- Like an eye specialist?
- You should...

1268
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:41,960
It says that it gets better with time.

1269
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:47,229
I'm normally a very bright person.

1270
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,230
I see.

1271
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,670
But it's impossible to be bright here.

1272
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:56,070
The only bright ones are those who have no attachments to their exes.

1273
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,309
I know, right? It's so annoying.

1274
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:00,439
Exactly.

1275
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,610
And those are my ex and my ex's partner.

1276
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:06,850
He doesn't care about me one bit.

1277
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,750
(Yun Nyeong is ready to go on her date.)

1278
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,260
- Yun Nyeong.
- Yes?

1279
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,229
Do you need some eye drops?

1280
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,359
No. Why is it?

1281
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,870
- Do you have some?
- Yes. Why do you ask?

1282
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:25,230
I thought you didn't have them.

1283
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,870
Do you need a handkerchief?

1284
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:31,639
(Baek Hyun passes a handkerchief.)

1285
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,710
You might need it.

1286
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,450
Since I was going on a date,

1287
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:46,090
I think he wanted to give me something of his.

1288
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,829
It felt like he was being jealous,

1289
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,290
which was quite cute.

1290
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,730
I simply wanted her to think about me on the date.

1291
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,300
So I gave it to her so that she wouldn't forget about me.

1292
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,270
Thank you.

1293
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,910
(Seung Yong and Yun Nyeong's pick-a-date)

1294
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:13,979
- Am I driving?
- Yes.

1295
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,080
I see.

1296
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,089
That's unusual.

1297
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,189
- He's free from stereotypes.
- You're right.

1298
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,130
- That was hilarious.
- How very unusual.

1299
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,730
Where are we going?

1300
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,069
- Us? Give me a second.
- Yes.

1301
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,130
Okay.

1302
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,940
I'm excited.

1303
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,610
(Laughing)

1304
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,010
It was my first time...

1305
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,449
going on a date here,

1306
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,410
so it made me really nervous.

1307
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:48,380
Seung Yong was very tense.

1308
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,819
You do web designing, right?

1309
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,120
I'm getting off.

1310
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,119
I'm sorry. Yesterday...

1311
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,290
- What about my name?
- I know. It's Yun Nyeong.

1312
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,230
- I work for a fashion brand.
- Right.

1313
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,569
The web designer was...

1314
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,900
- the one next to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

1315
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,200
It's okay.

1316
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,470
(Seung Yong's first date starts with an apology.)

1317
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,309
Did you say you are running a restaurant?

1318
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,080
I'm actually in the restaurant business.

1319
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:19,310
You did say that, right?

1320
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,420
- I cook Spanish cuisine.
- How funny.

1321
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,390
It was nerve-racking yesterday, right?

1322
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,390
Me? Yes, I was extremely nervous.

1323
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,990
I don't even remember what I said.

1324
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,289
I guess so.

1325
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,800
There are already ten residents in the house.

1326
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,430
But everyone takes great care of me, and I'm grateful.

1327
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,470
How about we drop the formality?

1328
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,970
You start first.

1329
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,709
- No, I'll go first.
- Okay.

1330
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,780
Nice.

1331
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,150
My hair was completely flat yesterday. For real.

1332
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,080
It had some volume at first.

1333
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,889
- The time...
- But it suddenly went flat.

1334
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:00,560
- Too much time had passed.
- Exactly.

1335
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,620
You're so funny.

1336
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,330
I just thought, "He looks good with wet hair."

1337
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,660
Wait. Are you going in here?

1338
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,430
Are we heading to the parking lot?

1339
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:11,969
Yes, we are.

1340
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,100
Really? Are we at Han River?

1341
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,170
- Yes.
- Seriously?

1342
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,510
Awesome.

1343
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,479
- I've always wanted to come here.
- Right?

1344
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,680
For real?

1345
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:22,879
Oh, my gosh.

1346
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,710
Oh, my gosh. How witty of you.

1347
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,179
You're witty.

1348
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,250
Thank you.

1349
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,589
It's going to be so much fun.

1350
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,490
- Okay.
- Are we getting on a boat?

1351
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,759
We're going on a yacht.

1352
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,060
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1353
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,199
(Hyundai Yachts)

1354
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,760
Gosh, it looks fun.

1355
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:45,530
I'm scared.

1356
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:46,770
Do you need a hand?

1357
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,370
Thank you.

1358
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,570
Thank you.

1359
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,640
- Oh, my gosh.
- So cool.

1360
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,319
- Can we sit over there?
- I think so.

1361
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,380
Really?

1362
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,490
I kept saying how much I wanted to go to the Han River.

1363
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:11,690
He even prepared a yacht.

1364
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,800
All I could think of was how fun it was going to be.

1365
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,969
It's really nice.

1366
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,870
That side over there is really pretty.

1367
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,639
- I'm so excited.
- It's so nice right now.

1368
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,040
- Are you sure?
- Totally.

1369
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,940
This is California.

1370
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:30,650
California?

1371
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,310
How funny.

1372
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,720
I'm not much of an extroverted person.

1373
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,490
So I'm really jealous of your bright personality.

1374
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,890
Really? I'll share it with you.

1375
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,229
I'll share my personality with you.

1376
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,230
Can you do that?

1377
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,369
- Yes, I can.
- Nice.

1378
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,770
I'll split it in half.

1379
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,240
The weather is perfect.

1380
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,540
Shall we head inside for some food?

1381
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,940
- Okay.
- Great.

1382
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,310
- Gosh.
- What?

1383
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,980
For real?

1384
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,390
Cheers.

1385
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,590
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1386
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,429
I should write a journal entry today.

1387
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,499
A journal?

1388
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,769
A gratitude journal when I wrap the day up.

1389
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,030
"Thank you very much."

1390
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,870
I picked the perfect partner.

1391
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,070
For real.

1392
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,899
You picked someone with bobbed hair.

1393
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,510
I chose on short notice.

1394
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,240
I'm curious. Why did you choose me?

1395
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,679
You stood out the most.

1396
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,810
- I did?
- Yes.

1397
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,250
Was my outfit flashy?

1398
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,080
- I don't remember your outfit.
- You don't?

1399
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,889
- You just stood out in my eyes.
- Really?

1400
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,389
That's why I even remembered your name.

1401
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,529
Seriously?

1402
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,030
You've got great reactions.

1403
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:58,869
You're hilarious. I'm going to stop now.

1404
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:01,040
- No, I'm joking. It's just that...
- My gosh.

1405
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,369
"For someone to react so much to what I say?"

1406
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,170
"I'm deeply moved," is what I meant.

1407
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,180
But to be honest,

1408
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,480
among all the dates,

1409
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,580
I'm enjoying this one the most.

1410
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,150
(Relieved)

1411
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,650
You're quite witty.

1412
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,950
Thank you.

1413
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,290
Her reactions are big, she laughs a lot,

1414
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,490
and she's very empathetic.

1415
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:29,500
She's someone who makes others happy and at ease.

1416
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,529
Going on the first date with Yun Nyeong was a great choice.

1417
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,269
- The conversation keeps going, - Yes.

1418
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,599
- and she reacts really well.
- Right?

1419
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,840
- Totally.
- Those are...

1420
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,240
What did you order from here? A hoodie?

1421
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,950
No, I ordered a zip-up hoodie and a shirt.

1422
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:47,849
Are most of them oversized?

1423
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,950
(Won Kyu is shopping for clothes.)

1424
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,749
The sizes aren't that tight.

1425
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,220
I see, but they look tight.

1426
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,260
When did you wake up?

1427
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:57,559
I got up at noon.

1428
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,590
- Really?
- Yes.

1429
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,340
I don't know what to get.

1430
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,570
Should I choose some for you?

1431
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:11,740
Yes.

1432
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,250
First off...

1433
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,090
That looks too warm.

1434
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:28,420
But at home, hoodies seem okay.

1435
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,459
Why don’t we go shopping on our date?

1436
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,859
Shall we? How's shopping in person?

1437
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,129
That's not a bad idea.

1438
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,030
- Let's go together.
- It's okay.

1439
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,730
I'm not that insensitive.

1440
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,600
I want your opinion.

1441
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,070
I see, so that's what you wanted.

1442
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,580
Where did everyone go?

1443
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,710
There was just one more person.

1444
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,850
- It's just the two of us.
- No...

1445
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,720
(Stretching)

1446
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,860
Why don't you stretch here?

1447
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,460
- Me?
- Yes, show us.

1448
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:09,130
(Yoo Sik does a light stretch.)

1449
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,029
- Gosh, how flexible.
- You're crazy flexible.

1450
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,569
Come on. Anyone could do this.

1451
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,239
I can't stretch my leg like that.

1452
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,340
- This?
- Yes.

1453
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:18,539
Me neither.

1454
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,210
I can't put my leg up there.

1455
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,040
(Won Kyu leaves to get ready.)

1456
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:26,580
(It's just the two in the living room now.)

1457
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,250
What is it?

1458
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,250
What?

1459
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,920
- Why are you laughing?
- You looked at me all of a sudden.

1460
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:37,530
Can't I do that?

1461
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:43,330
Shall we go outside?

1462
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,500
- What?
- Shall we go outside?

1463
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,040
Okay.

1464
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:54,140
I have to check how good you are with your hands.

1465
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,420
- This is super embarrassing.
- How come?

1466
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:08,060
Until now, I thought I had always asked him out on dates.

1467
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,460
He barely sent me text messages.

1468
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,900
It was like him asking me out on a date.

1469
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,940
So it made me happy. My heart fluttered.

1470
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,269
Tell me what you're confident in.

1471
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,309
(Yoo Sik requested a date.)

1472
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,939
Me? Nothing.

1473
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,310
Just one.

1474
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,080
He's giving me butterflies.

1475
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,219
Isn't that the first time Yoo Sik asked her on a date?

1476
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,549
Yes, that's his first-ever official date request.

1477
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,219
Some people really have all the luck.

1478
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,691
He asked while touching his feet, and it still worked. Aren't I right?

1479
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,290
He asked her out exactly at the right time.

1480
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,860
- Ji Yeon.
- Yes?

1481
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,930
- Shall we go?
- Right now?

1482
01:12:52,525 --> 01:12:53,316
Let's go.

1483
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,740
- You startled me.
- Gosh.

1484
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:56,870
- Goodness.
- Where are you going?

1485
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,110
- We have personal plans.
- Personal plans.

1486
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:04,010
(Woo Jin bumped into Won Kyu and Ji Yeon.)

1487
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,950
(Sighing)

1488
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,720
Does everyone know that the two of us are going out?

1489
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,149
- Those who were with us...
- Just Yoo Sik?

1490
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:12,849
Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji know about it.

1491
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:13,890
I see.

1492
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
Did everyone go out?

1493
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,360
Kyu went out to shop for clothes.

1494
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,060
- Really?
- He went out to buy clothes?

1495
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,959
Yes, he went on a shopping date.

1496
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,700
I see. That sounds fun.

1497
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,700
So everyone has personal plans?

1498
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,270
They were on their way out.

1499
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,640
I saw them going out on a date.

1500
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,680
I see. They didn't try to hide it.

1501
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,840
I mean,

1502
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:38,710
it's not fair.

1503
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:40,949
What was that about?

1504
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,019
Did they already make their final decision?

1505
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,020
They already made their final decision.

1506
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:47,560
It's confirmed.

1507
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:54,030
Did it have to happen then?

1508
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,970
My ex didn't even look at me. She kept her head down.

1509
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,400
Gosh, I'm tired. I couldn't sleep.

1510
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,500
Is there something to eat?

1511
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,270
Let's have some beef.

1512
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,709
Beef? You want some?

1513
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,980
Let's have beef without everyone else.

1514
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,679
- Let's eat it.
- They went out to eat good food.

1515
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,379
Yes, we should have some too. Let's eat.

1516
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:16,550
(Yoo Sik also plans to go on a date with Hyeon Ji.)

1517
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,290
There are button mushrooms. Let's grill them too.

1518
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,390
I'm going to the bathroom.

1519
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:26,560
That startled me.

1520
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,660
- What's wrong?
- I thought that it was someone.

1521
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,940
(He got startled like he was guilty of something.)

1522
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,840
(Meanwhile, Hyeon Ji got ready for her date.)

1523
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,750
(Glancing)

1524
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,650
(Glancing)

1525
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,360
(Baek Hyun saw Hyeon Ji going out.)

1526
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:05,170
- It's done.
- Do you like it well-cooked?

1527
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,670
- Yes.
- Really?

1528
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,239
Four packs of bibim noodles?

1529
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,300
Aren't you having any?

1530
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:14,009
(Yoo Sik's outfit seems unusual.)

1531
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,640
I thought that you were eating with us, so I cooked this much.

1532
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,380
He's going out on a date.

1533
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,280
Yoo Sik.

1534
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,749
(He cooked quite a lot of bibim noodles.)

1535
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,990
My goodness.

1536
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,090
Gosh.

1537
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,389
See the look on his face.

1538
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,059
He's obviously dressed to go on a date.

1539
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,929
- The look on Baek Hyun's face.
- It's so obvious.

1540
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,830
The look on his face...

1541
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,030
- "What? You're a traitor." - He rolled up his sleeve.

1542
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:39,729
Woo Jin seems more resentful than him.

1543
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:40,770
"Aren't you eating with us?"

1544
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,600
"I cooked four packs, and you aren't eating?"

1545
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,809
- He cooked 4 packs.
- He said that he cooked 4.

1546
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:48,610
Yoo Sik didn't make it obvious at all earlier.

1547
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,550
Is this for real?

1548
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,420
Aren't you going on a date?

1549
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,690
You punk.

1550
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:04,830
Have fun.

1551
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,960
You're making her wait. Hurry up.

1552
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,670
I will earn a lot of money for us.

1553
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:14,170
That's nonsense. You're leaving us to find happiness.

1554
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,339
(His pretending to go to work doesn't fool anyone.)

1555
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,370
Hey.

1556
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,170
Go on. She must be waiting.

1557
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,150
(Sighing)

1558
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,290
(Coincidentally, only the two who saw their ex go out remain.)

1559
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,020
What are we doing here?

1560
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,060
What?

1561
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,130
What should we do?

1562
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,560
We'll have to eat alone.

1563
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,930
We have no newspaper, do we?

1564
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,830
Newspaper? No.

1565
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,270
Is it okay to grill meat on the table?

1566
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:55,280
(A lot of grease is splashing everywhere.)

1567
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:03,150
(Suddenly, Baek Hyun gets busy in the yard.)

1568
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,790
That's smart.

1569
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,220
It will be fun.

1570
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,459
This is so romantic.

1571
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,889
(They set up a table in the yard to avoid the splashing grease.)

1572
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:13,090
I like things like this.

1573
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,729
Woo Jin, we should spend time like this too.

1574
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:18,629
- We should treat ourselves.
- We've had a hard time.

1575
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:19,670
Exactly.

1576
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,300
All right.

1577
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,510
- Be happy.
- Be happy.

1578
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,250
Let's be happy.

1579
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,680
Shall we vacuum the floor while eating?

1580
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,980
- The robotic vacuum cleaner?
- Yes.

1581
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:40,990
(They try to clean the house while they eat.)

1582
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,460
Woo Jin, I can turn it on with the app.

1583
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,330
- Woo Jin. I can use the app.
- Do you have the app?

1584
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:47,700
Did you download it?

1585
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,760
Yes, definitely. Do you want to see it?

1586
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,200
I'll make it clean the living room.

1587
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,000
Let's see.

1588
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,240
Room cleaning will start.

1589
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,079
- Isn't this amazing?
- Yes.

1590
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,880
Gosh, this is it.

1591
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,650
Today is better than any date I've ever been on.

1592
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,850
Really?

1593
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,020
I'm glad to hear that,

1594
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:16,119
but I can't say the same for me.

1595
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,390
I understand.

1596
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,329
I had so much fun.

1597
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,929
- Yes.
- The weather was also perfect.

1598
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,469
- I know.
- Let's go in.

1599
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,830
(Seung Yong and Yun Nyeong came back home.)

1600
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,140
Yay.

1601
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,969
Mu-ya-ho.

1602
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,779
- Do you know it?
- I do.

1603
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,079
- I know it.
- Mu-ya-ho..

1604
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,880
(They finished a bottle of wine.)

1605
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,490
(Yun Nyeong spots Baek Hyun and Woo Jin in the yard.)

1606
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,889
If one more person comes back...

1607
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,430
What are you guys talking about?

1608
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,390
You're back.

1609
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,300
What are you talking about?

1610
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,259
Why did you come back so early?

1611
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,599
Why do you ask? Should I have come back later?

1612
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,339
No, you came back earlier than I expected.

1613
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,070
Really? We went out early this morning.

1614
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,440
At 11:30 am.

1615
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,610
Did you memorize her schedule?

1616
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,650
Are you her manager?

1617
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,479
That's funny.

1618
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,519
- Thank you. It was very useful.
- Did you use it?

1619
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,049
Yes, I used it to cover myself.

1620
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,319
- Really?
- Yes.

1621
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,490
(She kept Baek Hyun's handkerchief throughout her date.)

1622
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,989
The look on his face.

1623
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,729
Does it make him that happy?

1624
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,199
He's like a dog waiting for his master.

1625
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,760
Seriously. Is he happy that she got back early?

1626
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:32,700
Baek Hyun can't hide his feelings.

1627
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,099
What did you guys do?

1628
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,739
Can I ask what you did?

1629
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,470
We went on a yacht at the Han River.

1630
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,080
(He didn't expect a yacht.)

1631
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,680
That's... What?

1632
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,280
I should buy a yacht. How much is it?

1633
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:53,319
A yacht? Doesn't it cost about one million dollars?

1634
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,589
For a ride like that.

1635
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,390
- I should earn a lot of money.
- Yes, you should.

1636
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:00,230
A yacht? You went on a yacht?

1637
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Okay.

1638
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,830
Just the two of you? It must be.

1639
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,669
You're so cute.

1640
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,769
(He's quite shocked by the yacht.)

1641
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,070
That's hilarious.

1642
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,869
I'm such an open book.

1643
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:16,180
- You can't keep a poker face.
- No, I can't.

1644
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:17,610
Try it.

1645
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,910
- Shall we clean up?
- Let's clean up.

1646
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,219
(Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji's casual date)

1647
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,489
What are we going to do?

1648
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:27,790
- We're making key rings.
- Gosh.

1649
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,060
This must be it.

1650
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,860
- Here?
- Yes.

1651
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:33,930
It's Grim Factory.

1652
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,130
(They came to make doll key rings made of chenille yarn.)

1653
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

1654
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:43,600
Please pick a string over here.

1655
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,270
A string?

1656
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,710
I think we're using this to make it.

1657
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:53,110
I'll pick this one.

1658
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,620
I will pick this one.

1659
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,389
(Yoo Sik picked brown, and Hyeon Ji picked blue.)

1660
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:01,289
Please put on an apron and have a seat.

1661
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,290
Okay.

1662
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,830
I get a sense of deja vu from yesterday.

1663
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:08,230
From yesterday?

1664
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,630
This apron.

1665
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,300
I slept throughout yesterday, so I don't know what happened.

1666
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,439
It wasn't yesterday.

1667
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,469
(She had a date with Yoo Sik two days ago.)

1668
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,470
- It wasn't yesterday.
- Really?

1669
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,740
No. I meant the day before.

1670
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,510
I lost track of the date.

1671
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,810
(It's not easy to put on the apron.)

1672
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,880
Where is it?

1673
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,660
Is it a cross?

1674
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,890
Yes.

1675
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,030
Like this.

1676
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,130
There you go.

1677
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:55,340
He was friendly with me.

1678
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,050
It made my heart flutter.

1679
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:09,189
You will be making a doll with chenille yarn.

1680
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,759
You can make either a rabbit or a bear.

1681
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,059
- I'll make a rabbit.
- Rabbit?

1682
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,230
How about you?

1683
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,260
(Bowwow)

1684
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,600
Can I make a dog?

1685
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,805
It's possible to make a dog,

1686
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,248
- Is it difficult?
- but the legs are hard to fix.

1687
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,839
- Really?
- Yes.

1688
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,469
Why don't you make a bear first?

1689
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:28,080
Do you need a dog with four legs?

1690
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,680
- Yes.
- With four legs?

1691
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,910
(Yoo Sik is determined to make a dog.)

1692
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,350
- Why don't you try making a bear?
- Okay.

1693
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,860
Is it hard?

1694
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,160
No, it's totally easy.

1695
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,030
- It's totally easy?
- Yes.

1696
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,700
- I look forward to seeing it.
- Okay.

1697
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,740
(She's already making a mistake.)

1698
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,010
It's very confusing.

1699
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,840
What do you think?

1700
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:05,710
I can barely see the body. Am I wrong?

1701
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:07,820
Are the ears too big?

1702
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,220
It looks cute. A rabbit?

1703
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:20,830
It's soft.

1704
01:23:23,022 --> 01:23:23,682
A puppy...

1705
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,530
(He can't stop thinking about a puppy doll.)

1706
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,418
I will make a puppy instead.

1707
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,409
Are you going to bend the legs?

1708
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:34,880
Yes. These are forelegs and hind legs.

1709
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,380
It looks like my dog.

1710
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,780
- I was trying to make Kongyi.
- Really?

1711
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,350
You said that it's a brown poodle.

1712
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,150
Two legs?

1713
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,890
I was about to tell you at the end.

1714
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,790
Am I too sharp?

1715
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,030
I think I'm so tactless.

1716
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:00,500
I thought, "What's going on?"

1717
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:03,270
He keeps making me wonder what's going on.

1718
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:07,980
I told him that I am raising a brown poodle.

1719
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:11,040
He wanted to make a doll that looked like my dog.

1720
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,910
When I see him remembering small things about me...

1721
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,450
and trying to take care of me,

1722
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,360
I think, "Is he interested in me? What's going on?"

1723
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,630
Now you're done, please pick the parts.

1724
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,960
You should carry a Chanel bag.

1725
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:32,900
Oh, yes.

1726
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,740
(Hyeon Ji's poodle with a Chanel bag)

1727
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:39,610
Sir...

1728
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,539
What?

1729
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,240
I don't know where the arm is.

1730
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,879
Excuse me, sir.

1731
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,149
Yes?

1732
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:48,380
- I don't know which is the arm.
- Let's see.

1733
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,050
You have to make it again. The face lost...

1734
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:53,719
its shape.

1735
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,190
(The blue rabbit lost its shape.)

1736
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,190
The leg... Wait a minute.

1737
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:00,160
(He ends up disassembling Hyeon Ji's blue rabbit.)

1738
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,700
How about mine?

1739
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,829
- You did a good job.
- Really?

1740
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:06,900
It looks cute.

1741
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,840
(Her blue rabbit is brought back to life in a hurry.)

1742
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,410
- I want to add an accessory.
- Me. too.

1743
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,750
A baby bottle.

1744
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,119
What are you adding?

1745
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,450
(She gives it a baby bottle for the youngest Yoo Sik.)

1746
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,420
Gosh.

1747
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,720
I'm not that young.

1748
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,030
It looks cute.

1749
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:34,800
- Shall we go and eat?
- Yes.

1750
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:41,170
(Taesu)

1751
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,609
Do you have a wine list?

1752
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:51,039
No, you have to bring your own bottle.

1753
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,310
- Really?
- Yes.

1754
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:53,949
- Thank you.
- Can we get some water?

1755
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,080
- Water, please.
- Okay.

1756
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:00,950
They don't have any red wine?

1757
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,520
My choice was red wine.

1758
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:07,329
I picked the one who likes red wine.

1759
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:08,830
(Yoo Sik picked "I like red wine" as the keyword.)

1760
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,630
Why did you pick red wine?

1761
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,100
Why did I choose it?

1762
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,600
- What?
- Why did I choose red wine?

1763
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,240
That day...

1764
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:27,010
after talking on the phone in the Talking Room,

1765
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:31,250
to whom did you send a text?

1766
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,560
(Yoo Sik picked her keyword but didn't send her a text.)

1767
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:40,330
Is that a question?

1768
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:41,800
Yes.

1769
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:48,469
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1770
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,439
(As the food got served, their conversation was interrupted.)

1771
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,340
- I'll bring the water soon.
- Okay.

1772
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:55,280
What do you want to drink?

1773
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,809
Who ordered the mojito?

1774
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:59,380
- I'll have the mojito.
- The mojito is for her.

1775
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,780
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your food.

1776
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,350
In the beginning,

1777
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:11,990
when I moved in here, my heart was closed.

1778
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,060
I didn't think...

1779
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,559
it made sense...

1780
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,830
to be interested in someone and act on it.

1781
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,380
But now, things have changed.

1782
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,550
I thought...

1783
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,080
We have a short period of time. If I act so slowly,

1784
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,820
nothing will happen.

1785
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,960
I thought that I should get over my past.

1786
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,060
I am trying...

1787
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,990
to open up to others.

1788
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:49,960
That's my plan.

1789
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,340
Should I say something else?

1790
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,410
No, what do you mean?

1791
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,080
I was grateful to hear those words.

1792
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,650
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1793
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:18,020
Did you go on a date with someone else?

1794
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,159
(The question feels abrupt.)

1795
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,230
You startled me. What date?

1796
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:27,800
Am I being too straightforward?

1797
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,170
I was just curious.

1798
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,270
With someone else?

1799
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,570
Yes, I went on a date.

1800
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,710
That was why you were so busy.

1801
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,380
What do you mean?

1802
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,949
- What...
- I can't trust people...

1803
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:43,720
when it comes to their personal plans.

1804
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,659
Why are you so tense?

1805
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,820
- Do you usually get tense?
- No, never.

1806
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,490
I don't even get nervous before a performance.

1807
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:57,660
I've never been as nervous as I was then.

1808
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,330
We have four minutes left.

1809
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,340
It's so close.

1810
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,470
I know.

1811
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,080
I don't want to go home.

1812
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,620
(The moment is too precious to let it slip away.)

1813
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,049
They seem so comfortable around each other now.

1814
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:21,049
Yoo Sik is much more relaxed than in the beginning.

1815
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:22,059
- Right.
- There's something between them.

1816
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,819
- I think so too.
- Right.

1817
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,229
- There's tension between them.
- An exciting tension.

1818
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:28,759
- Things might go well between them.
- There's chemistry between them.

1819
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,829
Their feelings for each other are growing...

1820
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,629
as time goes by.

1821
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,099
Yoo Sik seems joyful too.

1822
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,199
It looks like Hyeon Ji's heart has changed.

1823
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,369
- He looks great today.
- Right.

1824
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:41,169
In front of Hyeon Ji,

1825
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:43,239
- Yoo Sik seems manly.
- Definitely.

1826
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,279
There's a vibe that makes your heart flutter.

1827
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,079
Even when they're exchanging looks in silence,

1828
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,420
- Right.
- there's chemistry between them.

1829
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,950
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

1830
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,360
I'll be back.

1831
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,159
Are you going to eat now?

1832
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,330
- Me?
- Yes.

1833
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,700
I'll eat a little later.

1834
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,330
When did you get back today?

1835
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,940
I went out early.

1836
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,470
I came back not so late.

1837
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:17,939
Plates and cutlery are in here.

1838
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,550
- I see.
- Over here.

1839
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,449
Didn't you want to borrow my book yesterday?

1840
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:22,580
"Strong Current."

1841
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,020
What is the book about?

1842
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,659
It's a romance novel.

1843
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,190
- Is it a romance?
- Yes.

1844
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,190
I find it interesting.

1845
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:41,030
Gosh, it looks very delicious.

1846
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,370
Also, the ventilator.

1847
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:48,069
- Okay.
- Open this to turn it on.

1848
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:49,139
I see.

1849
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,140
Seung Yong.

1850
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,509
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Yes?

1851
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:52,579
when you have a moment later.

1852
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,909
That sounds great.

1853
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:54,949
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Yes?

1854
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:55,979
when you have a moment later.

1855
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,920
That sounds great. Sure.

1856
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:00,089
Let's talk over some good food.

1857
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:01,320
Yes, let's do that.

1858
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,919
- That sounds great.
- When you have some time.

1859
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,989
That's great.

1860
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:07,990
You know, we read the same book. Once we start talking,

1861
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:10,959
- I think we'll hit it off.
- Will we have a lot in common?

1862
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,629
Because we might have a lot in common?

1863
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:15,840
No, not just that. You have an amicable face.

1864
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,169
Thank you.

1865
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:19,569
You look much better with your hair down, not up.

1866
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:20,570
Really?

1867
01:31:20,571 --> 01:31:22,779
Yesterday, I had...

1868
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:25,410
- I understand that. Right.
- a bit of a situation.

1869
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,279
I felt that we shared a lot in common.

1870
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,649
So I wanted to get to know her better.

1871
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:36,189
Once I go on a date with her,

1872
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,429
I might be able to find more things in common with her.

1873
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:41,130
That crossed my mind.

1874
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,129
The 2nd and 3rd initials in MBTI are the most important.

1875
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:47,469
His type had the initials N and F, just like mine.

1876
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,900
That might be why.

1877
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,840
I felt that the way he thought and his interests aligned with mine.

1878
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,240
And he seemed to be quite curious about many things.

1879
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:59,050
We seemed to be on the same emotional wavelength.

1880
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:02,150
I think it will be quite fun to talk to him.

1881
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:06,290
Do you often cook at home?

1882
01:32:06,409 --> 01:32:08,335
I do, but I mostly cook...

1883
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,084
- Do you not have enough time?
- to survive.

1884
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,959
- I usually cook food like this.
- That looks good.

1885
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,630
I cook super simple food.

1886
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,399
I'll go upstairs for a moment.

1887
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,420
- Okay.
- Okay.

1888
01:32:22,717 --> 01:32:24,370
- What's my name?
- Min Kyung.

1889
01:32:25,762 --> 01:32:27,402
You can drop the honorifics.

1890
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:30,580
- I see. Okay.
- Okay.

1891
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:32,410
(Cringing)

1892
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,379
Doesn't that mean you're uncomfortable?

1893
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,920
No. I'm comfortable with it.

1894
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:40,350
This looks good.

1895
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:42,420
Who cooked this? It looks so good.

1896
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:45,130
- Let's go.
- Let's eat.

1897
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,260
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1898
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:52,530
Dig in.

1899
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:55,170
It's okay.

1900
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,710
Nothing tastes new anymore.

1901
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:05,250
It's tasty.

1902
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,609
Gosh, enjoy your food.

1903
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:09,050
Oh, I will.

1904
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:10,720
When do you usually go to sleep if you go to bed early?

1905
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:12,919
- Around 3am?
- Gosh.

1906
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,990
- Or 2am. Yes.
- Right. Around 2am or 3am.

1907
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,160
When do you usually go to sleep?

1908
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,160
Between midnight and 1am.

1909
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,860
It's good to see everyone.

1910
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,100
It's so tasty.

1911
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:29,240
By the way, did you and Seung Yong decide to drop the honorifics?

1912
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,339
- Sort of. Yes.
- Sort of?

1913
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,540
- Yes. We decided to drop them.
- Yes, we did.

1914
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:35,110
You can start first.

1915
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,140
- I'll drop the honorifics.
- Okay.

1916
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,950
- Can I address you as Seung Yong?
- Sure.

1917
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:45,750
What about Won Kyu, Yoo Sik, and Jae Hyeong?

1918
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:48,320
- All three of them aren't here.
- The photo here...

1919
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:52,290
Hyeon Ji and Ji Yeon aren't home either.

1920
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,860
I see.

1921
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,769
That was such a tasty meal.

1922
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:04,840
Yes.

1923
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,469
Why don't you guys stay here and talk?

1924
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:08,339
- I'll take a break upstairs.
- Sure.

1925
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

1926
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:22,320
(Won Kyu and Ji Yeon come back after clothes shopping right then.)

1927
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,389
- Hello.
- What's that?

1928
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:26,060
- A cake.
- What?

1929
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,759
- What's that?
- A cake.

1930
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,760
What?

1931
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,759
- Talk about crazy timing.
- That's crazy timing.

1932
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,199
- Gosh.
- I'm glad she went upstairs.

1933
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,070
He also changed into a new outfit.

1934
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:41,239
Give me mine.

1935
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,880
And let's switch...

1936
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,780
- our keyrings when we have time.
- Okay.

1937
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:00,990
(4th floor, Min Kyung, Ji Hyeon, and Hyeon Ji's room)

1938
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:10,840
(Min Kyung sits alone in the room and becomes lost in thought.)

1939
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:30,260
There hasn't been a moment when he made it easy for me.

1940
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:40,870
(She can't help but be bothered that her ex is on a date.)

1941
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:44,770
Actually, even when we were dating,

1942
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:48,140
I relied on him a lot.

1943
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:52,010
So because I'm going through a tough time now,

1944
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:54,210
I find myself...

1945
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,820
thinking about him and wanting to rely on him.

1946
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:15,770
(She reads the text messages she has received so far.)

1947
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:20,470
(Then a message stops Min Kyung from scrolling.)

1948
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:26,050
(Your ex picked you.)

1949
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:31,849
(Min Kyung's time is moving backward.)

1950
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,019
- Min Kyung.
- Yes?

1951
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,090
Should I turn on the light?

1952
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:35,559
It doesn't matter if you do.

1953
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,420
- Let's turn it on. It's too bright.
- Sure.

1954
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,330
Min Kyung, I can see that you're having a tough time.

1955
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:41,930
- I mean it.
- Yes.

1956
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,760
- Are you okay?
- No.

1957
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:48,800
You must stay strong.

1958
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,140
- Okay?
- Okay.

1959
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,110
We still have so much time left.

1960
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:55,680
You can do this.

1961
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,980
- I don't want to.
- No.

1962
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:03,480
What's troubling you the most now?

1963
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,820
I don't know what made him think so.

1964
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,989
- Okay.
- He said he gave up on me...

1965
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,260
because it seemed I wasn't interested.

1966
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,790
When?

1967
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:16,560
From the start.

1968
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:20,029
It's true that...

1969
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:22,199
I wanted to meet someone new.

1970
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,600
- You did?
- Yes.

1971
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,340
As I went on more dates,

1972
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,980
I realized that my ex was better than I gave him credit for...

1973
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:31,539
and we were a better match than I thought.

1974
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,780
- That crossed my mind. Yes.
- It did?

1975
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,079
Did you tell that to your ex?

1976
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:38,990
- Yes. I did.
- What did he say?

1977
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:42,289
He said, "Now you think I'm the best after going on dates with everyone?"

1978
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:46,189
He put it in a negative way.

1979
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,900
- I see.
- But it wasn't like that.

1980
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,229
By going on dates,

1981
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:54,200
I confirmed that I couldn't open up to others because I still liked him.

1982
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:56,099
Did you say that to him?

1983
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,340
I couldn't.

1984
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,310
I think you should tell him that.

1985
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,840
But if I tell him that now,

1986
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:08,880
we might have to get back together.

1987
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,990
Think about how to make the best decision for yourself.

1988
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,990
Choosing your ex because you're not attracted...

1989
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:19,159
to the six guys here...

1990
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,100
might be a bit foolish in my opinion.

1991
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,659
- Right.
- Think about more deeply...

1992
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,000
why you broke up.

1993
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,530
If there was a specific reason you broke up,

1994
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,840
you need to examine...

1995
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:35,940
whether or not you two have grown from the experience.

1996
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:40,180
Anyway, getting back together without major changes won't be good.

1997
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,080
In my opinion, a relationship...

1998
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,650
that was once broken before will easily be broken too.

1999
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,590
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2000
01:38:56,330 --> 01:39:01,630
(It's the uncomfortable truth she must face in the end.)

2001
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:07,509
- Gosh, Ji Hyeon.
- She gave good advice.

2002
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:08,839
- She sounded so mature.
- Yes.

2003
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,709
I think she gave advice...

2004
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,839
- that would help Min Kyung.
- Yes.

2005
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,979
- She needed to hear that.
- Seriously.

2006
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,419
- She gave such realistic advice.
- Yes.

2007
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:18,619
She helped Min Kyung reexamine herself objectively.

2008
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:19,789
Her advice helped Min Kyung do that.

2009
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:21,249
She sounded super clear.

2010
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:24,159
It seems Min Kyung still doesn't know what she wants.

2011
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,459
- She's never had a breakup before.
- Right.

2012
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,659
- She's bound to struggle.
- Yes.

2013
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:31,159
Just like Ji Hyeon said, unless they both grew from it,

2014
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,169
- getting back together...
- Getting back together...

2015
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:36,039
- Right. There's no point.
- will only lead to the same issue.

2016
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,300
They'll break up over the same problem.

2017
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:43,840
No way. I can't believe you thought of me after seeing this.

2018
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,149
This is super cute. I'm serious.

2019
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:47,970
I'm glad to hear that.

2020
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:50,049
We also chose the character and color together.

2021
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:51,280
So cute. The color too?

2022
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,590
I feel the most comfortable around you.

2023
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:54,850
Same here.

2024
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,929
- Isn't it cute?
- I should make a U-turn.

2025
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:00,660
What do you think? Isn't this cute?

2026
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:02,930
- What's that?
- Isn't it cute?

2027
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:04,630
- I bought it today.
- She bought it for me.

2028
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:06,269
What's its name?

2029
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,629
I haven't given it a name yet. Do you want to do the honor?

2030
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:08,799
How about Doodle?

2031
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,400
- What a cute name.
- Doodle.

2032
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:12,139
Isn't that a good name?

2033
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,209
(It's a bigger hit than he thought.)

2034
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:14,210
Hey, Doodle.

2035
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:17,579
- Doodle with side hair.
- That's so funny. Seriously.

2036
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:18,580
Doodle.

2037
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:21,850
Are you going to have tea?

2038
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,720
- Yes. I'm going to have tea.
- I'd like some too.

2039
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,890
- Where did you get this from?
- What?

2040
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,120
Didn't the bell ring just now?

2041
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,560
- Is it really happening?
- I'm not sure.

2042
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:37,030
I'll go and check.

2043
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:41,400
(A mysterious letter arrives to stir up the night.)

2044
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:51,310
There wasn't a card?

2045
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,279
- Oh, it's right here.
- Yes.

2046
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,349
I didn't know where it was.

2047
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:56,350
(Excitement got the better of him.)

2048
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:00,490
(They safely return to the house with the envelope.)

2049
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:05,360
- My gosh, seriously.
- I wonder what it is.

2050
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:11,360
(There's tension in the air unlike other nights.)

2051
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:15,500
I'm curious what it is. I have no idea what it is.

2052
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:17,439
Should we check it together? Or should I read it first?

2053
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,540
You check it first and then read it to us.

2054
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:20,640
I mean, just read it out loud right away.

2055
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:27,180
(Amid unpredictable tension,)

2056
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:31,680
(a mysterious envelope arrives.)

2057
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:33,450
- Gosh.
- No way.

2058
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:35,320
- What does it say?
- What is it?

2059
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:37,360
We won't reveal who our ex is.

2060
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,930
I'll just read it without showing it to you.

2061
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,430
- "You're going on a trip." - What?

2062
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:54,610
- This is crazy.
- Really?

2063
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,380
"Ladies,"

2064
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:01,249
"please pick a guy you want to go on a trip with..."

2065
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:02,880
"to Kamakura, Japan."

2066
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:08,820
(Kamakura)

2067
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:29,239
"If a guy is chosen by two women or more,"

2068
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,740
"the chosen guy will make the final choice."

2069
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,250
- Yes. That's it!
- My gosh.

2070
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,919
- Things are moving so quickly.
- Right.

2071
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,250
It's the perfect development.

2072
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,249
- They're going on a trip already.
- Oh, my.

2073
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:42,119
My gosh. They're going to Japan, not Jeju Island?

2074
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,319
My gosh. EXchange 4...

2075
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:44,619
They're finally going to a new destination.

2076
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,759
- Wasn't that where...
- "Slam Dunk."

2077
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,190
- "Slam Dunk" was based?
- "Slam Dunk?"

2078
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:50,429
An international trip feels...

2079
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,729
- I bet it feels different.
- completely different.

2080
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:53,329
- Of course, it's different.
- I bet it's so different.

2081
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:54,870
They might develop new feelings there.

2082
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:56,493
Right.

2083
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,270
Can I take a look at it?

2084
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,710
- Japan?
- This will be fun.

2085
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:02,610
Gosh. Seriously.

2086
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:06,410
I didn't see that coming at all. We're suddenly going to Japan?

2087
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:07,809
"You're going on a trip."

2088
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:09,620
I was so excited and giddy.

2089
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,279
It's taking too long.

2090
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,020
I didn't think we'd be going to Japan.

2091
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,160
Seriously.

2092
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:22,999
It's draining my energy.

2093
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,560
(The beginning of a trip filled with excitement and nervousness)

2094
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,640
Oh, my gosh.

2095
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:33,710
This is crazy.

2096
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:41,980
It was so annoying.

2097
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,150
I had never traveled abroad.

2098
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,890
I wanted my first international trip to be with my ex.

2099
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,090
I told her that we should travel abroad together.

2100
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:53,960
I said, "We must."

2101
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:57,459
I even said even if we broke up, we should travel abroad together.

2102
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:58,460
It meant a lot to us.

2103
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,700
We made a promise to each other.

2104
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:07,640
But it seemed she had forgotten about that.

2105
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,750
(Ji Yeon picks her date for the Japan trip.)

2106
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:14,880
Excluding our ex?

2107
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:24,619
(After making their decisions, the thought of their ex lingers.)

2108
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:25,690
Excluding our ex?

2109
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:36,200
Even if my ex had the option to pick me,

2110
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:39,040
my ex wouldn't have picked me.

2111
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,780
Actually, she's mad at me.

2112
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:47,980
I thought that it would be nice if Ji Hyeon chose me.

2113
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,680
After all, she was the one whom I talked to the most.

2114
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:54,920
I thought I had fun when I spent time with her.

2115
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:57,759
I hoped Ji Hyeon chose me.

2116
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,860
(Jae Hyeong is hoping Ji Hyeon picks him.)

2117
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:07,700
(More guys she connected with meet Ji Hyeon's gaze.)

2118
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:16,540
(Ji Hyeon picks her date for the trip to Japan.)

2119
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,180
Gosh, Kamakura.

2120
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:25,280
I'm sure everyone was excited and happy...

2121
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:28,990
to hear that we were going to Japan on a trip.

2122
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:32,320
But I was conflicted emotionally.

2123
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:36,260
So picking someone to go to Japan with...

2124
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,560
was a difficult decision for me.

2125
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:48,010
(All the female residents picked their date for the trip to Japan.)

2126
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:51,640
It's funny how Seung Yong has to pack again.

2127
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:52,910
(He unpacked his things yesterday.)

2128
01:45:52,911 --> 01:45:54,209
- Right.
- Yes.

2129
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:56,079
- He's unpacking and packing.
- I left my suitcase as it was.

2130
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,549
- I didn't unpack.
- I see.

2131
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:59,190
- That's great.
- How wise.

2132
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:01,950
Gosh, Japan...

2133
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,860
I've never been to Japan.

2134
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,489
- Don't a lot of...
- Really?

2135
01:46:06,490 --> 01:46:08,390
- Japan feels so hectic.
- I've been to other countries.

2136
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,560
Google Maps.

2137
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,370
I'll show you that I'm a great planner.

2138
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,499
Kamakura.

2139
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,840
(Baek Hyun starts studying Kamakura in advance.)

2140
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,909
- This city looks great.
- Then...

2141
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:22,070
- Yesterday too.
- we'll have different rooms.

2142
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:24,979
(Choi Yun Nyeong chose you as a travel mate.)

2143
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:26,579
- You didn't charge it.
- We'll take the train.

2144
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:27,609
My battery is at three percent.

2145
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:29,380
- Three percent?
- Yes.

2146
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:36,289
(Sung Baek Hyun and Choi Yun Nyeong who succeeded in matching...)

2147
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:39,390
(will go on a trip together.)

2148
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,059
Why does time fly here?

2149
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,060
Right?

2150
01:46:42,061 --> 01:46:43,800
I didn't do much today. It went by so fast.

2151
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:46,700
- Today?
- I did go on a date.

2152
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,399
(Yun Nyeong went on a date with Seung Yong today.)

2153
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,070
Why...

2154
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,180
Since I was the last one to join them,

2155
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:58,779
I was quite worried that...

2156
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:02,150
none of them would choose me.

2157
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,629
I was quite surprised to get a message...

2158
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,360
that someone had chosen me.

2159
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:18,029
"Why did she pick me? I don't think we had a connection."

2160
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:19,250
That's what I thought.

2161
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:25,570
(A message confuses Seung Yong.)

2162
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:41,050
I picked Seung Yong.

2163
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,260
(Kwak Min Kyung chose you as a travel mate.)

2164
01:47:51,230 --> 01:47:56,370
(Park Ji Hyeon chose you as a travel mate.)

2165
01:47:57,170 --> 01:48:00,239
I was quite surprised to get messages that...

2166
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,680
Ji Hyeon and Min Kyung chose me which was more than I deserved.

2167
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:06,509
That day, I told Seung Yong...

2168
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:08,580
that we should have a meal together in the future.

2169
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,520
I thought we would see eye to eye on a lot of things.

2170
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:15,150
I had this sense of excitement I would have fun with him.

2171
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:19,190
I wanted to get to know Seung Yong a little better.

2172
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:24,230
(Ji Hyeon became more curious about Seung Yong.)

2173
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:28,029
Isn't it quite hot in Japan now? It's hot, right?

2174
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:30,570
- Right.
- It won't be as hot as Korea.

2175
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:34,239
- It's 20°C now.
- I think so.

2176
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,940
- It's 18°C now.
- Really? What?

2177
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:39,010
It's raining. Let's have makgeolli.

2178
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,150
Sounds great.

2179
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,550
I didn't overanalyze it. I just followed my heart...

2180
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,320
when I responded to the message.

2181
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:53,260
(He followed his heart and picked one.)

2182
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:02,499
(Shin Seung Yong and Park Ji Hyeon who succeeded in matching...)

2183
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,740
(will go on a trip together.)

2184
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,610
I actually wanted to go on a date with Ji Hyeon.

2185
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:09,740
Now that I'm going with her,

2186
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:13,250
I was excited and happy.

2187
01:49:15,710 --> 01:49:17,749
Ji Hyeon changed her direction immediately.

2188
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:20,049
I know. She changed her direction.

2189
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:21,519
Because things are great between them.

2190
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,259
Right. They had something in common.

2191
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,319
They talked about books.

2192
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,759
- They have the same interest.
- Right.

2193
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,459
They have a lot to share.

2194
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,230
This is why one's interest matters.

2195
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:37,139
(Why did you text Seung Yong?)

2196
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:39,170
What are we doing?

2197
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:42,509
My ex said he shut me out...

2198
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:46,080
because I didn't seem to have any regrets toward him.

2199
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:47,479
So...

2200
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,849
if I do anything,

2201
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:52,220
it might cause a misunderstanding.

2202
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:54,189
I thought I shouldn't create any situation...

2203
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:56,520
that might result in a misunderstanding.

2204
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:59,560
So I texted Seung Yong...

2205
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:01,830
who'd never choose me.

2206
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:11,770
(Min Kyung made a choice being aware of her ex.)

2207
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:17,879
Min Kyung, you should go see an eye doctor.

2208
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,940
- I know.
- Yes.

2209
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,879
It's serious.

2210
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,880
(Everyone pays attention to Min Kyung's condition.)

2211
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:23,250
- Is there any pain?
- No.

2212
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:27,050
I think Hyeon Ji hit me while I was sleeping.

2213
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:30,320
- Hey, be quiet.
- Like this.

2214
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,860
She was like, "Why are her eyes so big?"

2215
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:48,470
(Park Hyeon Ji chose you as a travel mate.)

2216
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:51,840
I was happy.

2217
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:55,050
We get to travel together.

2218
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,320
I was happy.

2219
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,520
I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it.

2220
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:05,920
Going to a new travel destination...

2221
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:09,800
with someone I'm interested in...

2222
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,130
made me excited.

2223
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:17,569
(Hyeon Ji's heart chose Yoo Sik.)

2224
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:19,269
When we were torn, you showed up.

2225
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:22,810
Gosh, I think I now know why you didn't say anything.

2226
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:27,280
(Hong Ji Yeon chose you as a travel mate.)

2227
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:30,949
(Jung Won Kyu and Hong Ji Yeon who succeeded in matching...)

2228
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:32,820
(will go on a trip together.)

2229
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:37,060
My ex probably noticed...

2230
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,790
that I'm going with Won Kyu.

2231
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,730
(Despite their unkept promise,)

2232
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,870
(Ji Yeon promised to make another memories with Won Kyu.)

2233
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,640
- What?
- Nothing.

2234
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:02,479
(Kim Woo Jin, Lee Jae Hyeong, and Kwak Min Kyung...)

2235
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,780
(who couldn't find a match will travel together.)

2236
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:11,190
I get it, but I'm disappointed.

2237
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:15,030
My ex and I made a promise.

2238
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:18,730
It's not each other's first trip abroad anymore.

2239
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:22,130
I was really upset.

2240
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:24,170
I mean it.

2241
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:28,339
(Kim Woo Jin, Lee Jae Hyeong, and Kwak Min Kyung...)

2242
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:30,110
(who couldn't find a match will travel together.)

2243
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,549
(Kim Woo Jin, Lee Jae Hyeong, and Kwak Min Kyung...)

2244
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:37,920
(who couldn't find a match will travel together.)

2245
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:42,790
(He didn't get the text from Ji Hyeon in the end.)

2246
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,690
It was a shame.

2247
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:47,790
Ji Hyeon chose someone else in the end.

2248
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:50,330
If I'd talked to Ji Hyeon more...

2249
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,669
or if I made more effort,

2250
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:54,670
things might have changed.

2251
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:04,140
(Their dates to travel have been chosen.)

2252
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,279
When the three of them travel together,

2253
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,319
you think nothing's going to happen?

2254
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,319
When you think about it,

2255
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,420
a lot happened in Jeju Island.

2256
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,259
You never know what might happen in Japan.

2257
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:18,589
- Right.
- If they go on a date with others,

2258
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,329
- You never know.
- they might change their minds.

2259
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:23,200
Get the business seats for those three.

2260
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,459
Why do you need a business seat for Japan?

2261
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:27,370
They need to be pampered.

2262
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:30,640
Well...

2263
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:33,870
No one's been to Kamakura before?

2264
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:37,040
I've been to Tokyo, but not Kamakura.

2265
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:38,509
I've been there once before.

2266
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:39,750
- Really?
- Just once.

2267
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:43,320
Do you have to take the Shinkansen in Shinjuku?

2268
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:45,620
I'm so happy.

2269
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,619
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

2270
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:51,089
(Let them know via text.)

2271
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:53,590
(Your text will be delivered anonymously.)

2272
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:59,400
(The last text to express their hearts before traveling)

2273
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:07,970
(The only person who made your heart flutter today)

2274
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:12,880
(Everyone's heart has been sent.)

2275
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:14,750
Where have you been?

2276
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,150
India last year was my last trip.

2277
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,389
- Really?
- India?

2278
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:22,820
- India is nice.
- Awesome.

2279
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,719
- There's so much to enjoy.
- Really?

2280
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:26,959
- How long did you go for?
- It's really fun.

2281
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,330
- He's...
- For ten days.

2282
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:30,030
- Ten days?
- Awesome.

2283
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:31,700
It's nice. I recommend it.

2284
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,600
Nice. A trip to India?

2285
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,870
That's unique.

2286
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,510
Why do I keep losing?

2287
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:43,940
I lost rock-paper-scissors again.

2288
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:48,410
(When you have nothing in the morning, I'll make you coffee.)

2289
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,920
Yesterday, she texted me...

2290
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:54,350
that she wanted to try my coffee.

2291
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,020
But we couldn't meet in the morning.

2292
01:54:57,990 --> 01:54:58,990
So I couldn't make her one.

2293
01:54:58,991 --> 01:55:02,860
I wanted to make her one next time. That's why I said that.

2294
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:06,159
The night before,

2295
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:08,300
Jae Hyeong and I texted each other.

2296
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,170
I thought that was his response...

2297
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:13,840
to my text the night before.

2298
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:17,840
(Jae Hyeong)

2299
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:21,680
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2300
01:55:22,050 --> 01:55:23,779
That was also a shame.

2301
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:26,920
She texted me yesterday.

2302
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:29,350
Perhaps she changed her mind.

2303
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,860
So it was a bummer.

2304
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:37,730
(Today, their hearts crossed.)

2305
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:39,200
I felt bad.

2306
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:42,670
Because I chose to go to Japan with Seung Yong.

2307
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:51,910
(Seung Yong)

2308
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:56,180
(I'll read "Strong Current" before going to Japan. Thanks.)

2309
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,780
I was happy.

2310
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:02,950
Is Ji Hyeon interested in me?

2311
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,560
That's what I thought.

2312
01:56:05,379 --> 01:56:08,309
Seung Yong lent me a novel.

2313
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,199
We're leaving for Japan...

2314
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:13,030
unexpectedly.

2315
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,170
To get along,

2316
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:19,270
I texted Seung Yong.

2317
01:56:20,770 --> 01:56:23,980
(Ji Hyeon's heart picked Seung Yong.)

2318
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,049
- I thought...
- It was me.

2319
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:35,389
I heard it from both sides.

2320
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:39,390
(Thanks to you, I had a good day today.)

2321
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,600
(Ji Yeon's heart was sent to Won Kyu.)

2322
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:47,230
(Who did Won Kyu's heart pick?)

2323
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:05,580
(Ji Hyeon)

2324
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,919
(Don't drink too much coffee.)

2325
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,020
(Your ex picked you.)

2326
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:15,359
- Hey!
- My goodness.

2327
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,830
I knew he'd text Ji Hyeon.

2328
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,729
- Really?
- I'm getting goosebumps.

2329
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:21,930
Yes. I told you I had a feeling.

2330
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:24,469
- That's crazy.
- What's Ji Hyeon going to do?

2331
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,869
They have to leave together tomorrow.

2332
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:28,670
- Kyu.
- What's she going to do?

2333
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:30,939
In the end, Ji Hyeon is in control.

2334
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:32,079
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

2335
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,479
Ji Hyeon is in control.

2336
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:36,210
She really brainwashed Won Kyu in the laundry room.

2337
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:39,550
- She brainwashed Won Kyu.
- Yes, she did.

2338
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:41,490
This is getting interesting.

2339
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:44,690
(Don't drink too much coffee.)

2340
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:47,660
(Your ex picked you.)

2341
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,630
My ex texted me for the first time.

2342
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:57,900
(She got a text from Won Kyu for the first time since she moved in.)

2343
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,410
I just felt complicated.

2344
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:05,280
My ex requested a date.

2345
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:07,450
The day after he requested a date,

2346
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:09,510
there was an incident about Ji Yeon's T-shirt.

2347
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,820
I wasn't exactly...

2348
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,350
okay with that.

2349
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:18,720
Actually the reason I hesitated to send it was...

2350
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:22,059
because my ex looked happier with somebody else...

2351
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:24,660
and that was the type of person she wanted.

2352
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:28,770
I wondered if it's the best for me to leave them alone.

2353
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:31,240
That's why I struggled to make a decision.

2354
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:35,269
(After having many thoughts,)

2355
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:39,310
(Won Kyu expressed his heart to Ji Hyeon.)

2356
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:47,220
(Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon's hearts crossed.)

2357
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:49,190
I felt bad.

2358
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,390
Because I didn't send it to Ji Yeon.

2359
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:57,360
I think Won Kyu sent it to his ex.

2360
01:58:58,630 --> 01:58:59,800
It happens.

2361
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,630
Perhaps he has...

2362
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:07,070
feelings left for his ex.

2363
01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:10,009
I tried to take it easy and think he could do that...

2364
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:12,639
if he wanted.

2365
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,650
But then...

2366
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:16,920
I'm disappointed.

2367
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:23,320
(Ji Yeon)

2368
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:26,520
(Let's talk at the terrace on the 4th floor at midnight.)

2369
01:59:26,630 --> 01:59:30,360
(Your ex picked you.)

2370
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,669
I wanted to express...

2371
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:36,130
that I've made up my mind.

2372
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:39,340
I thought it'd be nice to talk to her today.

2373
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,240
That's why I texted her.

2374
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,779
I thought he had something serious to say.

2375
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,009
At least that's how I felt it.

2376
01:59:48,010 --> 01:59:52,780
So I was curious about what he was going to say.

2377
01:59:53,558 --> 01:59:55,449
- It's a mess.
- He feels...

2378
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:57,159
- It really is a mess.
- It's a mess.

2379
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:59,059
Now that this happened,

2380
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:02,160
would that open Ji Yeon's eyes to Woo Jin?

2381
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:03,959
- No.
- No, that wouldn't.

2382
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,830
She wouldn't reuse the arrow...

2383
02:00:06,379 --> 02:00:08,391
- that's already on the ground.
- No?

2384
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,939
(Woo Jin)

2385
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:15,040
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2386
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:16,780
I understand we weren't on the same page.

2387
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,450
If she at least said that it was a shame...

2388
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:23,280
that we couldn't travel abroad together when we promised...

2389
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:25,950
and have a safe trip...

2390
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:28,050
Only if she said that much,

2391
02:00:28,329 --> 02:00:30,469
I wouldn't be so upset.

2392
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:34,390
She didn't text me again today.

2393
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:40,330
(Yoo Sik)

2394
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:44,170
(We'll get to have meat in Japan.)

2395
02:00:44,363 --> 02:00:45,563
I was happy.

2396
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:51,840
(Hyeon Ji's heart picked Yoo Sik.)

2397
02:00:52,606 --> 02:00:55,976
I always I said I wanted to have meat when we were on a date.

2398
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:59,049
We're suddenly leaving for Japan.

2399
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:02,390
So I said we'd get to have meat in Japan.

2400
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:06,690
(Hyeon Ji)

2401
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:10,830
(Looking up a delicious restaurant in Kamakura)

2402
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:14,700
I was happy. I'm excited and looking forward to it.

2403
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:22,240
(The two picked each other again today.)

2404
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:24,680
(Yoo Sik)

2405
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:27,480
(I'll be honest.)

2406
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:30,449
(Your ex picked you.)

2407
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:31,880
I like it.

2408
02:01:34,890 --> 02:01:39,190
She has changed her mind compared to when she came here.

2409
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:46,500
(Min Kyung)

2410
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:51,800
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2411
02:01:54,510 --> 02:02:01,180
(Continuing from yesterday, Min Kyung's heart picked Yoo Sik.)

2412
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:02,479
"I'll be honest."

2413
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,179
Oh, hang on. Min Kyung?

2414
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:06,990
Ji Hyeon's advice helped.

2415
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:09,820
I love my life.

2416
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,290
(Baek Hyun)

2417
02:02:13,930 --> 02:02:17,830
(I didn't think we'd go to Japan together. So excited.)

2418
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:25,840
I was saying I was happy to go with him.

2419
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:32,440
(Did Baek Hyun's heart pick Yun Nyeong again today?)

2420
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:33,850
You don't even buy it anymore.

2421
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,880
Okay.

2422
02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:39,320
It's so cute.

2423
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:01,340
(Hyeon Ji)

2424
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:08,510
(I want to talk to you alone.)

2425
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:19,060
(Your ex picked you.)

2426
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:22,590
Oh, no.

2427
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:24,060
What?

2428
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,499
- Isn't that the first time?
- Yes, that's the first text.

2429
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,500
Gosh.

2430
02:03:28,430 --> 02:03:36,440
(Your ex picked you.)

2431
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:41,880
(The first text from her ex)

2432
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:51,890
He picked me.

2433
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:00,025
I texted Yun Nyeong.

2434
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:03,170
(Let's go to Japan together with Doodle. Thank you for choosing me.)

2435
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:07,540
(Your ex did not pick you.)

2436
02:04:09,894 --> 02:04:12,080
I hope he's well.

2437
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:20,590
(Hyeon Ji's another ex is Seung Yong.)

2438
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,304
What? What is going on?

2439
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:24,970
Really?

2440
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:28,389
But...

2441
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:31,230
- How is...
- Does she have two exes?

2442
02:04:31,403 --> 02:04:32,833
Gosh, these people...

2443
02:04:33,106 --> 02:04:34,276
Two of her exes are here?

2444
02:04:34,930 --> 02:04:37,069
- Really?
- These people are so...

2445
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:38,399
You're lying.

2446
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:41,410
- Is this really happening?
- Stop lying.

2447
02:04:41,485 --> 02:04:43,815
- Two of Hyeon Ji's exes?
- Yes.

2448
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,510
- Stop lying.
- Hey!

2449
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,179
- Is this really happening?
- That is...

2450
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:48,549
Stop lying.

2451
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:50,520
- We've always joked about it.
- We were just...

2452
02:04:50,695 --> 02:04:52,625
What we said as a joke really came true?

2453
02:04:52,725 --> 02:04:54,695
Look at that subtitle.

2454
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,720
- It's so stimulating.
- Exactly.

2455
02:04:55,721 --> 02:04:57,589
- I want to take a picture of it.
- "Hyeon Ji's another ex."

2456
02:04:57,590 --> 02:05:00,489
I was so shocked that I jumped up all the way there.

2457
02:05:00,490 --> 02:05:02,459
- It was your biggest reaction...
- Another?

2458
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:04,130
- I've ever seen.
- It was the biggest.

2459
02:05:04,230 --> 02:05:05,230
I've never seen something so shocking...

2460
02:05:05,231 --> 02:05:07,099
- in my 42 years of life.
- I know.

2461
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,769
This is most entertaining in my life.

2462
02:05:08,770 --> 02:05:09,999
- What's going to happen?
- I've never seen something...

2463
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,239
this interesting before...

2464
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:12,769
- in my life.
- This is the best this year.

2465
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:14,570
- It's the best.
- What do you mean this year?

2466
02:05:17,317 --> 02:05:19,610
I hope he's well.

2467
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:26,249
(Hyeon Ji's another ex is Seung Yong.)

2468
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:30,249
I haven't got to talk to her yet.

2469
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:33,220
I couldn't wait to tell her what I wanted to say.

2470
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:37,630
I was bothered.

2471
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:42,399
I had a hard time watching Baek Hyun.

2472
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,770
I was worried...

2473
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:47,210
that he'd feel the same way.

2474
02:05:49,570 --> 02:05:53,480
(Seung Yong is Hyeon Ji's ex.)

2475
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:58,520
(And another ex, Baek Hyun)

2476
02:05:59,150 --> 02:06:04,090
(Seung Yong, Hyeon Ji, Baek Hyun)

2477
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:08,660
(EXchange 4)

2478
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:11,500
(Baek Hyun, how do you feel?)

2479
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:14,829
(I really liked her so much.)

2480
02:06:14,830 --> 02:06:17,340
(I really...)

2481
02:06:18,153 --> 02:06:22,070
(You have no intention of getting back with me?)

2482
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:25,810
(You never give an answer.)

2483
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:31,350
(It was driving me crazy. Why is she suddenly bring that up?)

2484
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:33,549
(What's that?)

2485
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:35,089
(Kyu bought me.)

2486
02:06:35,090 --> 02:06:36,250
(Really?)

2487
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:37,990
(We picked it together.)

2488
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:40,119
(Is he joking?)

2489
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:41,230
(What's he thinking?)

2490
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:44,530
(I heard you went on a date with Ji Yeon.)

2491
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:46,560
(What are you doing?)

2492
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:48,629
(That's not what happened.)

2493
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:49,800
(Sighing)

2494
02:06:50,230 --> 02:06:52,340
(Are you mocking me?)
