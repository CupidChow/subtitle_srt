1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,209
I lost my memory after watching last week's episode.

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,819
- Last week's episode...
- I was so shocked.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,280
- I...
- It was very sensational.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,019
- I...
- It was very shocking.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,089
I'm serious. I've never seen a video...

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,719
- It was shocking.
- that was so shocking...

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,389
and gave me such a dopamine rush as this one.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,529
It's the all-time number one.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,599
- Seriously.
- I'm not overreacting.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,899
- I said it.
- Not even a bit.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,129
In my 42 years, I've never seen anything this fun.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,469
- For me...
- It was just shocking.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,709
We're only left with happy moments.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,069
We're left with them going to Japan in this episode.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,139
We never saw Seung Yong and Hyeon Ji together.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,409
We'll be seeing that too. We have so many things to see.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,279
You never know. They might be enjoying it.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,080
This is crazy. It's going to be really interesting from now on.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,119
- Saved.
- What?

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,150
Saved.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,530
(Your ex did not pick you.)

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,550
(Hearts trembling in the uncertain relationships)

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,920
What drinks do we have?

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,890
There's Chungha as well.

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,320
Will the men drink together?

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,760
(Glancing)

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,300
(Sighing)

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,410
I felt quite conflicted.

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,650
I was a bit upset...

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,849
because my ex didn't pick me.

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,720
I wanted her to send me a text...

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,089
or take action...

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,889
in some other way.

34
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,860
I think I had some expectations.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,230
(Sighing)

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,840
(Seung Yong's time started flowing.)

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,879
(Sung Baek Hyun)

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,849
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

39
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,819
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,789
(Park Ji Hyeon)

41
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,759
(Cho Yoo Sik)

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,659
(Park Hyeon Ji)

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,429
(Shin Seung Yong)

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,399
(Kwak Min Kyung)

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,529
(Jung Won Kyu)

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,529
(Hong Ji Yeon)

47
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,500
(Kim Woo Jin)

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,050
(EXchange 4)

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,820
(Episode 13: Leaving This Night in Seoul)

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,720
(4th-floor terrace)

51
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,190
(Woo Jin requested to talk to Ji Yeon.)

52
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,130
What did you want to talk about?

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
I went to the Ex Room.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,670
Even before that, my heart was leaning toward that side.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,870
Toward getting back with you.

56
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,050
I thought about it a lot until 7am yesterday.

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,679
Actually, this ends with you making a choice.

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,790
What happens outside is more important.

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,560
So I asked myself...

60
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,559
if this feeling wouldn't change...

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,759
and if I could stop doing...

62
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
the things that gave you a hard time...

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,000
without neglecting you.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,570
My answer was that I could totally stop doing those things.

65
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,339
That sounds so genuine.

66
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,409
He said what happens outside is more important.

67
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,220
- He means it.
- He means it.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,850
(My answer was that I could totally stop doing those things.)

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,320
How am I supposed to believe that?

70
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,930
Are you sure about getting back together?

71
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,360
I just said I'm certain.

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,470
Why? How are you so sure?

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,099
This is a special situation.

74
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,699
Things may have bothered you and made you jealous.

75
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,169
You shouldn't want to get back with me...

76
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,710
because of that.

77
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,940
It wasn't because of that.

78
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,409
I've dated other people here.

79
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,410
Yes.

80
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,880
As you know, they're all nice people.

81
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,489
They're all charming people.

82
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,950
But even while meeting such people,

83
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,760
I kept thinking about you every other moment.

84
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,590
So I thought a lot about what that would mean.

85
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,739
I think I still haven't forgotten you,

86
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,770
and I'm not ready to meet other people.

87
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,210
I really wanted to go back to when we were together.

88
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,049
I talked about this yesterday.

89
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,990
I'm really...

90
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,419
Do you think it was a short day?

91
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,860
- Yes.
- Ji Yeon, I...

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
I asked myself that question hundreds of times yesterday.

93
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,670
My answer was "yes."

94
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,670
This doesn't make sense. Think about it.

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,570
Do you think I'd want to get back with you...

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,440
after hearing this? When I had no feelings for you?

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,420
You wouldn't be able to believe me because it's just words.

98
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,680
Right.

99
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,790
I can't believe you.

100
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,419
You didn't like coming to meet me...

101
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,760
no matter how much time you had.

102
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,190
That's not true.

103
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,430
It's true. That's why I wanted us to break up.

104
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,200
Don't cry. Okay. Don't cry.

105
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,069
What am I supposed to do? Tears are coming out.

106
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,799
How could I get back with you...

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,340
when just thinking about those times makes me cry?

108
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,350
Should I write it out on A4 paper and give you an answer?

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,620
Would you believe me then?

110
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,989
You never wrote me a letter when we were together...

111
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,959
even when I asked you.

112
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,620
My first and last letter was the introduction from the ex.

113
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,130
What?

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,170
You wanted me to put in an effort. I'll show you. Wait for it.

115
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,500
Make sure the whole page is filled.

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,080
- That's when I'll really...
- I'll handle that.

117
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,610
I'll show you my true feelings.

118
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,750
Just fill in a sheet of paper.

119
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,790
Then I'll think about it.

120
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,390
Are you going to drink beer?

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes. I'll drink with you.

122
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,699
I've never talked with you.

123
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,970
(Seung Yong and Baek Hyun, Hyeon Ji's exes have met.)

124
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,040
How do you feel, Baek Hyun?

125
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,339
I'm quite certain.

126
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,669
- Really?
- He's always said that.

127
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,009
Yes. I'm certain.

128
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,870
In what way?

129
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,580
Should I be straightforward?

130
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,309
What I meant to ask is...

131
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,310
do you want to get back...

132
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,349
- with your ex or meet someone else?
- Really?

133
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,590
I have no intention of getting back with my ex.

134
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,820
I've never thought about that.

135
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,259
Really?

136
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,159
Then I guess you didn't have mood swings.

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,329
I did feel restless.

138
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,230
- Really?
- He said he had a hard time before.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,930
She was someone I really liked.

140
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,640
So much.

141
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,009
I liked her a lot.

142
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,380
It was very meaningful to me.

143
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,649
You liked her so much.

144
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,580
You still don't want to get back with her?

145
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,119
- That's right.
- That's possible.

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
Really?

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,059
How do you feel about this?

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,029
- We were talking about it earlier.
- Yes.

149
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,199
- The ex of the person I like...
- Yes.

150
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,369
would be a fellow man.

151
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,969
- Could you get close with him?
- You'd get close,

152
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,639
but he may have a hard time.

153
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,539
We also said that the person...

154
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,739
may have to be a bit cautious.

155
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,010
I wouldn't be cautious. I wouldn't mind.

156
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,450
(Jae Hyeong knows about Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun.)

157
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,620
Instead, when I get to know the ex of the person...

158
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,059
I like,

159
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,020
I will have a conversation with that person.

160
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,230
I'll have a conversation.

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,359
Will you say, "I'm sorry?"

162
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,629
Not that.

163
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,369
- Why would he be sorry?
- Not that.

164
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,499
Why would he be sorry?

165
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,340
If the person has a hard time.

166
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,769
- I'll just...
- Still, he wouldn't need...

167
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,070
to be sorry.

168
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,010
I would say, "You met a really nice person."

169
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,450
So...

170
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,280
"I'll treat her well."

171
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,320
"I'd like to be on good terms with you if that's all right."

172
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,130
"I wouldn't hope for us to meet together,"

173
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,160
"but I hope we could be comfortable."

174
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,960
I...

175
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,530
wouldn't mind.

176
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,500
Really.

177
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,470
It's not easy.

178
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,450
I root for everyone.

179
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,210
I root for everyone.

180
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,949
I want everyone to be happy,

181
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,620
but they're all gloomy and suffering.

182
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,489
It's not gloomy.

183
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,619
I'm not feeling gloomy.

184
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,659
(Their relationships are strangely tangled.)

185
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,320
People are almost jobless here.

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,490
(Ji Yeon and Woo Jin are still on the terrace.)

187
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,129
Since we broke up,

188
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,739
the way you treat me...

189
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,340
would naturally be different from when we were dating.

190
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,340
That's normal, but that...

191
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,680
felt so unfamiliar to me.

192
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,450
It was harder than I thought.

193
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,420
It's okay for you to struggle a little.

194
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,190
I struggled a lot.

195
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,130
Let's talk later.

196
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't sleep today.

197
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,610
Can I make ramyeon and bring it here with kimchi?

198
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,039
I really want to eat ramyeon.

199
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,780
Actually, could you make it for me?

200
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,479
I'll bring cup noodles.

201
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,549
Not cup noodles. Could you make ramyeon?

202
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,449
Could you stay here alone?

203
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,849
I'll get my phone and stay in my room.

204
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,619
I'll go to your room. There are many insects here.

205
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,360
I'll make ramyeon and get you.

206
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,560
Don't touch me.

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,730
Make ramyeon and come to my room.

208
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,529
At least show a bit of such effort.

209
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,370
I'll think about it after that.

210
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
- You have to make it amazingly.
- Amazingly?

211
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes.

212
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,430
(Woo Jin made ramyeon for Ji Yeon.)

213
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,499
- How much did you drink?
- I drank a lot.

214
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,539
How much?

215
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,070
Two glasses of Port wine.

216
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,509
Two glasses?

217
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,240
I drank more than half of the bottle of Port wine there.

218
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,309
Did you drink it alone here?

219
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,310
Yes.

220
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,010
Okay. Go ahead and eat.

221
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:57,480
Let's talk after you eat. You're hungry.

222
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,050
Keep eating.

223
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,819
- You're hungry. Should I hold it?
- You're annoying.

224
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,520
Should I hold it for you?

225
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,759
- Eat.
- You're annoying.

226
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,730
Don't cry. Eat quickly.

227
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,830
Why do you eat so much ramyeon?

228
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,029
Maybe I should have bought Teumse jjamppong.

229
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,270
Right. Go and buy it.

230
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,799
Now?

231
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,170
- Yes.
- Move your finger for a bit.

232
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,340
Go and buy it.

233
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,680
Show me your feelings by buying it.

234
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,320
Should I give you some soup?

235
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,690
Should I give you some soup? Here.

236
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,800
Take a sip.

237
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,430
I'll put it down.

238
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,370
Do you want some more?

239
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll eat when I want.

240
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,740
Why didn't you put an egg in it?

241
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,810
I like ramyeon with eggs.

242
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,810
Why didn't you put in soft-boiled eggs?

243
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,280
I wanted to come quickly to talk to you.

244
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,890
Show me that kind of genuine effort.

245
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,060
Okay.

246
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,390
Be careful. It might splash on you.

247
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,800
It's my shirt. I'll take care of it.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,300
Mind your own business.

249
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,010
All right.

250
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,750
Why are you crying?

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is annoying.

252
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,079
- I'm not eating this anymore.
- Okay.

253
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,650
Cook the spicy ramyeon with cheese for me.

254
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,219
- I'll cook it later.
- Cook it now.

255
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,490
- Now? Okay.
- Yes, I want to eat it now.

256
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,389
I'll be right back.

257
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,930
- Cook it quickly, in five minutes.
- All right.

258
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,569
Is that real?

259
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,970
That's insane.

260
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,840
But she's a bit over.

261
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,939
She's testing him. He's put to the test.

262
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,269
She's doing that intentionally.

263
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,609
- He's put to the test, you know.
- That's sort of...

264
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,379
- She's doing that on purpose.
- She annoys him...

265
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,409
- on purpose.
- For real?

266
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,750
She's watching him completing the mission.

267
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,920
(Going up two steps at a time to move quickly)

268
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,690
(Woo Jin cooks the second bowl of ramyeon.)

269
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,230
Wait. I'll bring the low table.

270
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,200
You know I like my noodles chewy.

271
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,340
(Sighing)

272
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,010
Are you really going to do this?

273
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,580
Isn't it good?

274
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,150
- It's good.
- The taste is fine, right?

275
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,150
You...

276
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,030
Can you heat this up in the microwave for me?

277
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,930
Can you heat this up in the microwave for me?

278
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,630
I'll heat it up for you.

279
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,380
"When I broke up with you,"

280
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,680
"I had a really hard time."

281
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,120
"You should go through the same thing."

282
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,820
I guess I had such a childish thought.

283
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,630
I also said a lot of mean things to him.

284
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,930
Why did I do that again?

285
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,970
(Going up and down the stairs several times tonight)

286
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,430
It's nothing compared to what I did.

287
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,210
When the trip was mentioned,

288
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,939
I thought, "It shouldn't be going abroad."

289
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,350
I hoped it's not going abroad.

290
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,590
What did you feel when you saw that it was going to Japan?

291
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,320
It felt weird.

292
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,359
Even after we broke up, I joked...

293
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,270
that we should be together for the first trip abroad.

294
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,840
As for me...

295
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,710
I thought you'd at least struggle a bit.

296
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,479
I was watching you, and the moment you got the text,

297
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,210
you sent a text right away.

298
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,080
That's what I felt.

299
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,850
Isn't it strange to struggle when I know how I feel?

300
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,660
You shouldn't feel upset about that.

301
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,800
At that time, I was hoping...

302
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,500
to at least get a text or whatever from you.

303
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,400
I thought you'd understand how I felt.

304
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,410
You never tried to understand how I felt, not even once.

305
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,610
When I saw that, I felt upset.

306
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,280
Don't be upset because of that.

307
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,720
You're consistently focused on just one person.

308
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,290
Isn't it better when I honestly tell you how I feel?

309
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,290
I mean,

310
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,700
I thought you'd understand...

311
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,959
my feelings a little.

312
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
I understand you.

313
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,000
I understand you, so I'm eating ramyeon with you...

314
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,200
and talking to you.

315
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,740
Do you like Won Kyu,

316
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,280
as a man?

317
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,349
Why do you keep asking that?

318
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,020
- Because I'm curious.
- Do you think I'm not serious?

319
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,919
No, I'm asking how you feel.

320
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,759
I'm asking if you seriously feel that way.

321
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,460
I always tell you how I feel.

322
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,400
Why do you doubt my feelings all the time?

323
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,670
- It's not that I doubt...
- You always ask, "Are you serious?"

324
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,380
I wonder if you really like him.

325
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,910
(Sighing)

326
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,390
I can ask, can't I? Why do you get so irritated about it, Ji Yeon?

327
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,860
You're asking me the same thing over and over again.

328
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,059
I answer every time you ask, but you go,

329
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,760
"Are you serious? Do you really like him?"

330
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,370
What kind of answer do you want to hear from me?

331
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,900
I won't ask from now on.

332
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,070
I think I'm more serious than anyone else here.

333
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,580
Why do you keep asking me if I'm serious?

334
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,680
It's not because I doubt your feelings.

335
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,780
I wonder if you really...

336
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,380
You're asking me because you doubt my feelings.

337
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,150
I mean, I wonder...

338
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,089
if you truly like him...

339
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,160
(Sighing deeply)

340
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,700
I won't ask you anymore.

341
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,400
You're cutting me off every time I speak.

342
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,400
What can I... Seriously.

343
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,740
I can ask, can't I?

344
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,350
Do you really have to talk to me with that frown on your face?

345
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,150
Do you think it's easy for me to be here?

346
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,790
Do you think it's easy for me to do this with you?

347
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,120
Is it difficult for you?

348
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,400
Then would it be easy, you think?

349
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,139
It's difficult, of course.

350
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,669
You know how I am.

351
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,910
What's difficult?

352
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,350
You're sort of...

353
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,989
I'm talking with all my heart, and it's hard for me to do so.

354
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,660
But it seems you're taking it lightly.

355
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,530
I can understand if you say I'm not enough for you.

356
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,190
I can accept that.

357
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,829
But if you say it like you're ignoring me,

358
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,900
that's not right.

359
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,140
In my perspective,

360
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,070
Ji Yeon, how would you feel if you were in my shoes?

361
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,649
Earlier, I told you that I struggled a lot.

362
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,910
Then you said, "It's been only a day."

363
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,519
Do you think I'm not serious?

364
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,480
Do you think I take it lightly when I talk to you?

365
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,149
Do you think I don't consider that and think,

366
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,619
"I'm jealous. I don't like her hanging out with another man."

367
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,760
Do you think I'm acting this way just because of those feelings?

368
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,459
I don't like it, of course. You're the one I like.

369
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,329
I have lingering feelings for you.

370
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,800
And you rush straight to someone else and don't even look at me.

371
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm upset and having a hard time.

372
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,370
I'm a human being with feelings, Ji Yeon.

373
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,240
You know I have a strong pride.

374
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,350
And when someone like me,

375
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,580
who isn't good at expressing myself,

376
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,350
has made the effort to start expressing my feelings,

377
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,450
you shouldn't doubt it first.

378
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,460
You could have recognized such effort, couldn't you?

379
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,129
You might feel that my heart isn't enough.

380
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,330
I'm not asking you to decide right now.

381
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,470
I at least hope you won't doubt my feelings.

382
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,880
(Woo Jin and Ji Yeon keep sighing tonight.)

383
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,349
- Woo Jin, stop it.
- No more.

384
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,049
- But I feel sorry for Woo Jin.
- I know.

385
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,589
I can see how he feels now.

386
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,519
It seems like Woo Jin...

387
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,259
- is feeling a bit hurried.
- Right.

388
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,059
- Yes.
- He wants to hear...

389
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,469
an answer from her.

390
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,529
- But in Ji Yeon's perspective...
- She can't.

391
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,799
- She can't answer now.
- Yes.

392
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,739
- I know what he's rushing for.
- Yes.

393
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,039
The desire to win someone's heart...

394
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,609
- can't be explained.
- But it's a bit disappointing...

395
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,479
that he talks to her in such an emotional way.

396
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
- I agree.
- Yes.

397
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,720
Come in.

398
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,390
- Are your eyes all right?
- What?

399
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,930
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

400
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,960
I was just wondering if you have started it.

401
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
- You mean packing?
- The girls' night.

402
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,699
We're going to get together after we finish packing.

403
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,970
Downstairs?

404
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,640
Shall we get together downstairs?

405
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,040
- See you later.
- Okay.

406
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,440
What is it?

407
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,450
What's the matter?

408
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,780
Let's go to another room. Come with me.

409
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,430
What's wrong?

410
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,329
My nails are all broken.

411
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,060
- Why?
- I don't know.

412
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,230
I guess someone is hitting me.

413
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,240
Is Hyeon Ji hitting you?

414
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,470
Since things are going well between you two, it seems she's hitting me.

415
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,140
- Since things are going well...
- Be quiet.

416
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,809
I know. I told her to do so.

417
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,080
Hyeon Ji looked like having a hard time, so I told her to date you.

418
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,080
- Hyeon Ji...
- Wipe here again.

419
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,350
- Come here.
- Okay.

420
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,220
- This should be...
- I locked the door.

421
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,090
Where's everyone?

422
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,200
- Can I sit here?
- Have a seat.

423
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,870
- Wipe it.
- Where?

424
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,709
You nose. The other side.

425
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,740
You're annoying me. Don't look at me.

426
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
What's wrong with your eyes?

427
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,180
I guess it's because I'm stressed out.

428
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,049
- It doesn't really show much.
- How come it doesn't show?

429
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,420
It doesn't when I don't look at it carefully.

430
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,959
Why do you make me suffer like this?

431
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,519
What did I do to make you suffer?

432
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,619
You made me suffer.

433
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,929
What did I do?

434
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,860
From the beginning, you decided to ignore me.

435
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,199
How could I possibly act warmly toward you here?

436
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,300
I mean, then...

437
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,540
I don't know.

438
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,510
I'm sorry. Because I selected the text,

439
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,040
I confused you, I guess.

440
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,580
- No.
- But...

441
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,450
It's okay.

442
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,750
But what can I do?

443
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,390
It seems that's the way my heart is.

444
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,590
There's nothing I can do, Yoo Sik.

445
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,829
Can I have a talk here for a minute?

446
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,129
- I just need to enter for a second.
- I see. Okay.

447
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,330
(Woo Jin came to the room.)

448
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,969
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,410
- I just need a second.
- Okay.

450
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,910
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

451
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,540
- There wasn't any empty room.
- Wait a second.

452
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,650
- See you.
- Okay.

453
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,660
- Can we talk here?
- You can sit here.

454
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,630
I'll just sit on the floor.

455
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,300
It's the first time for you to see my eyes like this, right?

456
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,000
- Yes.
- Seriously.

457
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,970
I've never seen my eyes like this before.

458
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,810
You should see the doctor tomorrow.

459
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,050
Go and pack now.

460
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,620
I also need to pack, and...

461
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,460
Don't you have any feelings for me?

462
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,660
That way, I can decide whether to sort things out or not.

463
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,730
Do you want me to be honest?

464
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,640
Are you going to hurt me again?

465
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,510
What do you want? Shall I tell you what you want to hear?

466
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
- Will that help you?
- No.

467
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,080
You must be happy about going to Japan.

468
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,920
Why did you get worried and come here? I misunderstood.

469
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,020
Fine. I won't come anymore.

470
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,659
Why not? You said you'd do whatever your heart wanted.

471
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,800
I'll do whatever my heart wants.

472
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,870
Can't I worry?

473
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,910
Let's end this conversation.

474
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,960
(The conversation that has started with worries ends.)

475
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,800
I'll pack up in five minutes.

476
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,370
- Why?
- Just the clothes.

477
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,670
Really?

478
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,670
(People are busy packing in another room.)

479
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,700
Come in.

480
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,079
- What are you guys doing?
- We're packing.

481
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,909
Are you guys packing? I came because I was bored.

482
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,350
Let's talk as we pack.

483
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,889
Going to Japan makes me so sad.

484
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,689
- I know. It makes me sad too.
- I know.

485
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,120
I couldn't go there because we had broken up.

486
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,760
- I had gone there with him.
- I kept asking my ex...

487
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,060
to go to Japan with me.

488
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,069
I wonder who'll go with my ex.

489
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,169
- What?
- I wonder...

490
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,299
- who'll go with my ex.
- I wonder who her ex is.

491
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,099
- I'm so curious.
- Really?

492
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,139
I thought your ex was the man you went out with today.

493
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,869
- Seriously. I thought that.
- Really?

494
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,639
- Totally.
- You guys...

495
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,409
- look good together.
- Really?

496
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,810
- You guys should date.
- Exactly.

497
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,249
- You guys should date.
- You guys look good together.

498
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,880
- How was it today?
- You guys look so good together.

499
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,520
(She learned that Ji Yeon went on a date today.)

500
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,359
- Oh, no.
- Ji Hyeon is listening.

501
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,059
- She learned about today's date.
- Ji Hyeon is right there.

502
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,189
- After fighting about a T-shirt...
- How...

503
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,460
- did this happen?
- I know.

504
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,830
Ji Yeon!

505
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,530
- Me?
- Yes.

506
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,910
Why?

507
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,010
It's insane. Hey.

508
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,450
Who is it?

509
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,210
It looks nice.

510
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,219
Hey, it's insane.

511
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
What is it?

512
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,920
Kyu bought it.

513
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,290
- Really?
- Kyu bought it.

514
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,590
It's pretty.

515
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,859
- Did you come to show me?
- Yes.

516
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,689
I heard that you were there with him.

517
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,629
Yes, I picked it with him.

518
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,959
I heard that you were there with him.

519
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,700
Yes, I picked it with him.

520
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,699
- What?
- I picked it with him.

521
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,569
- Exactly.
- He came to show off.

522
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,569
He told me that he bought it with Ji Yeon.

523
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,210
- Yes.
- So I came to show her.

524
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,620
Whose is this?

525
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,279
Kyu bought it for me.

526
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,490
Really? It looks cute.

527
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,149
Why did you come upstairs?

528
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,490
To say thank you.

529
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,290
- For picking it together?
- I heard that she was here.

530
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,360
He must've come to show me.

531
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,170
Why does Yoo Sik seem like my younger brother?

532
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,069
- What?
- He seems like my younger brother.

533
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,139
Isn't he younger?

534
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,799
- I mean, my younger brother.
- I see.

535
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,609
He looks like my younger brother.

536
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,769
Really?

537
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,510
He acts like my younger brother.

538
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,340
He just seems like my younger brother.

539
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,770
(She spots Won Kyu in the living room.)

540
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,490
(Beckoning)

541
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,960
People in the beauty industry and such.

542
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,130
There's a variety.

543
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,099
I'll ask later.

544
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,140
Okay.

545
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,060
Did you beckon me over?

546
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,360
Let's talk here.

547
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,600
Why do you do that?

548
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,670
What?

549
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,540
People said that you went on a date with Ji Yeon today.

550
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,340
It didn't start out as a date.

551
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,779
Ji Yeon, Yoo Sik, and I were...

552
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,950
in the living room.

553
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,990
We were talking about how we needed new clothes.

554
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,260
Yoo Sik said that he had ordered some clothes.

555
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,790
I had no clothes to wear.

556
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,430
We were talking about that.

557
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,300
Then Ji Yeon said that she also needed new clothes.

558
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,370
That was how we went shopping together.

559
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,069
Everyone said that you guys went on a date.

560
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,539
If two people go out together, it's a date.

561
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,969
You guys even picked a top for Yoo Sik.

562
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,879
I didn't go out with that intention.

563
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,210
That doesn't matter.

564
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,450
When I heard that upstairs,

565
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,520
I had to come downstairs since I couldn't school my face.

566
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,950
Why do you act this way?

567
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,859
Yoo Sik just came upstairs and went,

568
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,889
- "Thank you for this top." - In that situation...

569
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,430
"I heard that you picked it."

570
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,070
Do you give no thought before doing things with a woman?

571
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,639
It wasn't that kind of a situation.

572
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,740
Can I act that way then?

573
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,040
(Sighing)

574
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,049
Had I come back...

575
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,850
and sent a text to Ji Yeon,

576
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,180
it would've been a problem.

577
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,149
Don't you think that this is a problem?

578
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,989
I mean, this is also... Okay. It can be misunderstood.

579
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,789
But I'm telling you it isn't like that.

580
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,960
Are you toying with me?

581
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,490
Why would I toy with you?

582
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,870
You said that I was ruining your mood,

583
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,970
but I don't do anything other than being in your sight.

584
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,969
Why do you do so many sly things behind my back?

585
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,840
Sly things? Do you think I'm...

586
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,510
I don't know what you're playing at.

587
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,650
Your words and actions don't line up.

588
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,650
- It isn't like that.
- I don't know which is genuine.

589
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,090
My words and actions line up because I sent you a text.

590
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,890
A text that told me to stop drinking coffee?

591
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,490
I see that you didn't like what I wrote.

592
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,460
You said that you had indigestion.

593
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,940
I expressed my thoughts...

594
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,340
in my own way.

595
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,050
I'm getting criticized after sending you a text.

596
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,390
If you're going to be like this, I don't want you to send a text.

597
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,490
You're too much.

598
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,770
Let's go inside.

599
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Go first.

600
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,360
I was in a bad mood.

601
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,260
It was anger, not jealousy.

602
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,630
I was like, "What is he playing at?"

603
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,900
Her suspicion was justified.

604
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,340
Ji Hyeon said it was anger, not jealousy.

605
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,879
I don't think she said those words with hopes that he'd come to her.

606
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,979
Why did Ji Hyeon become so angry?

607
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
- I know.
- She was upset...

608
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,819
because he had asked her out on a date.

609
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,719
It was like, "I don't ask both you and Seung Yong..."

610
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,189
"on a date."

611
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,689
"I only make a move on other people."

612
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,359
"Why do you make a move on another girl and me?"

613
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,389
Is it something like that?

614
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,229
We can get a sense of her underlying thought...

615
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,429
since she always says that he has done something...

616
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,430
behind her back.

617
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,269
- It makes no sense...
- Why is she angry about this?

618
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,269
- to call someone sly.
- I know.

619
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,739
- She shouldn't have called him sly.
- I know.

620
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,040
- He wasn't sly.
- He wasn't sly.

621
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,150
(She tries to soothe her anger with ramyeon.)

622
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,150
I like women who are fair and stuff,

623
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,289
but you can feel the person's vibes at this age.

624
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,729
- That's right.
- That's right.

625
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,090
(He can see Ji Hyeon in the dining area.)

626
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,599
When I didn't know anything...

627
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,070
I'll bring some water.

628
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,070
(They meet again in the dining area.)

629
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,540
Why do you keep...

630
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,239
What? What was that?

631
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,750
You don't need to worry about me.

632
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,850
After the conversation we had,

633
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,850
I realized that this wasn't something to get angry about.

634
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,260
I was out of line.

635
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,729
You should just do what you want.

636
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,400
I'll do...

637
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,070
what I want.

638
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,340
We broke up, after all.

639
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,550
- What was that?
- We broke up, after all.

640
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,390
I guess getting texts from me didn't make you happy at all.

641
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,360
Why don't you work things out with Ji Yeon?

642
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,760
Is that how you really feel?

643
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,830
It looked like things were going well with her.

644
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,930
How I really feel isn't important.

645
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,500
Isn't it important?

646
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,039
Why didn't you treat me well when we were dating?

647
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,610
Why are you doing now that it's over between us?

648
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,840
Come on. I didn't mistreat you when we were dating.

649
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,490
Seriously,

650
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,560
you have a knack for making me angry.

651
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,899
- You have that knack too.
- You really have it.

652
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,030
- You really have that knack too.
- You're legendary.

653
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,100
You're so legendary.

654
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,840
You're so, so, so, so legendary.

655
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,310
They're so childish.

656
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:32,510
- What are they doing?
- "So, so, so, so legendary."

657
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,140
You're so legendary.

658
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,910
You're so, so, so, so legendary.

659
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,420
You do so many things that make me unhappy, okay?

660
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,750
Don't complain when we've broken up. Why do you care?

661
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,360
Why do you complain then?

662
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,860
That was why I gave up.

663
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,560
- I don't care.
- Listen.

664
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,699
You wiped something off...

665
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,200
of his hand.

666
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,770
What's wrong with that?

667
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,340
Isn't that what this place is for?

668
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,110
See? You don't even do this for me.

669
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,410
I was drinking water just now.

670
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,890
Turn it on.

671
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
It's heavy!

672
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,930
Don't discard all the water, okay?

673
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,330
You leave too much water behind.

674
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,370
More?

675
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,070
No.

676
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,540
- Is this good enough?
- Yes.

677
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,510
Where did Yoo Sik go?

678
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,080
I think he's talking to someone downstairs.

679
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,110
- Who?
- I don't know.

680
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,160
You ask me about him directly.

681
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,260
It was just a question.

682
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,230
(Sighing)

683
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,610
(4th floor, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

684
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,940
You can dab it on after washing your face.

685
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,979
Just like this?

686
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,880
- Dab it on the pimple.
- Really?

687
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,519
Thank you.

688
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,550
(Baek Hyun lends Yun Nyeong his pimple ointment.)

689
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,790
When do you want it back?

690
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,560
We're going to Japan together. Give it back in Japan.

691
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,559
- What?
- Okay.

692
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,029
Seriously, I can't believe we're going to Japan together.

693
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,760
We talked about going to Japan together, right?

694
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,600
I've never been to Japan. Seriously.

695
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,969
- It'll be fun.
- I know. It's my first time.

696
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes.

697
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,409
In any case, I'll use it well.

698
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,340
Okay. Use it an give it back in Japan.

699
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,949
A crowd has formed.

700
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,010
- What?
- It's nothing.

701
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,129
(Sighing)

702
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,160
How annoying.

703
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,330
I'm tired.

704
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,210
(Hyeon Ji has showered and is ready for bed.)

705
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,790
(Voices can be heard from Baek Hyun's room.)

706
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,749
All my pants are new.

707
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,750
(They missed the knock from the packing.)

708
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,890
Can I open the door?

709
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,250
- What?
- Yes.

710
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Me?

711
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,870
- Were you packing?
- Yes.

712
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,370
How do you feel?

713
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,469
- What do you mean by that?
- What?

714
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,610
How do I feel about what?

715
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,180
- Are you content? Happy?
- What?

716
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,450
Are you happy?

717
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,680
Trips always make me excited.

718
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,550
What is it?

719
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,420
Do you want to sit down?

720
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,060
Sit.

721
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,500
Gosh, the sun is rising.

722
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,970
I asked if you were happy.

723
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,680
I am. Do you have a problem?

724
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,010
Are you not happy?

725
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,380
Do you not want to go to Japan?

726
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,720
No, I just had a feeling we wouldn't be able to talk anymore.

727
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,830
Honestly, since moving into the house up until now,

728
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,699
I've always had feelings for Baek Hyun.

729
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,770
I put down all my pride...

730
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,269
and decided to express...

731
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,639
what I feel before going to Japan.

732
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,180
That's why I wanted us to talk.

733
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,979
- It's just that...
- Yes?

734
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,380
I can't help but feel sad.

735
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,489
Why do you feel sad?

736
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,560
Sad about...

737
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,930
the choice you made from the beginning,

738
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,960
or your behavior? What is making you sad?

739
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,999
I'm upset that I didn't try to talk to you sooner.

740
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Me?

741
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,210
Either way, I moved in with the possibility.

742
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,150
The possibility regarding our relationship?

743
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,880
- Yes.
- I see.

744
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,949
Although I'm not wishing for it,

745
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,160
if you had really pushed forward,

746
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,690
I would've felt confused.

747
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,030
I could have also wavered.

748
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,440
But that wasn't what I wanted.

749
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,240
We wouldn't get back together simply because I pushed ahead.

750
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,150
And even if we did, our relationship wouldn't have been smooth.

751
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,579
It's not a problem where only my feelings are important...

752
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,050
when a couple that has broken up gets back together.

753
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,020
Remember how I kept asking you?

754
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,790
"Do you want to get back together?"

755
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,730
"Are you interested in anyone?"

756
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,800
What about you?

757
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,429
What about me?

758
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,530
- What about you?
- What about me? What?

759
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,970
Did you not want to get back together with me?

760
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,640
Why do you never answer my question?

761
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,209
Did you have zero feelings?

762
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,250
For you?

763
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,420
Honestly, I was lying when I said...

764
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,749
- I had no feelings...
- I...

765
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,780
during the preliminary meeting.

766
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,189
What did you say when asked about...

767
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,890
meeting a new person and getting back together?

768
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,790
That I didn't want to get back together.

769
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,800
Got it.

770
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,069
I don't want to hurt you,

771
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,870
nor do I want you to hurt me.

772
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,540
With that in mind,

773
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,310
I said I didn't want to get back together.

774
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,110
I had no idea you had said that from the start.

775
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,450
As long as you're happy, it's fine.

776
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,790
I want you to be happy as well.

777
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,990
Don't be too upset.

778
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,100
I didn't know you had such feelings.

779
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,170
No, it's just...

780
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,210
I still like you.

781
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,310
It seems I still do.

782
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,660
Good grief.

783
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,630
This is wild.

784
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,450
I was losing it. Why did she...

785
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,080
suddenly say that?

786
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,150
I was taken aback.

787
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,360
Why now, of all times, before going to Japan?

788
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,870
(Baek Hyun feels conflicted at Hyeon Ji's sudden confession.)

789
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,010
Let's go inside.

790
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,090
What?

791
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,990
What is it?

792
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,860
We...

793
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,660
should never have met.

794
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,030
You're someone...

795
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,470
I should never have met in my life.

796
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,870
How come?

797
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,790
What was it that I liked about you so much?

798
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,790
Why was I head over heels for you?

799
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,660
You weren't the only one. I liked you too.

800
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,069
You and I should've never met.

801
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,700
We should go back to our early 20s.

802
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,009
Hyeon Ji's feelings for Baek Hyun are quite deep.

803
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,339
Mustering up the courage...

804
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,909
to confess your feelings, even if it's small, is nice.

805
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,279
- Before going to Japan.
- Yes.

806
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,719
Eventually, she heard that Baek Hyun had no intention...

807
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,579
of getting back together.

808
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,219
She must feel relieved now, or maybe not.

809
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,359
But either way, Hyeon Ji should try...

810
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,589
to work things out with Yoo Sik.

811
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,259
Things seem to be working out...

812
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,029
- Yes.
- with Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong.

813
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,229
Did he waver?

814
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,599
I doubt he did.

815
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,069
Even if he did waver for a split second,

816
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,339
I think he'll show his interest...

817
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,769
- Yes.
- in Yun Nyeong...

818
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,770
like nothing happened after a good sleep.

819
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,340
- I agree.
- Everything feels fresh after rest.

820
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,010
(The last morning in Pyeongchang-dong)

821
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,590
(The residents are getting ready for the trip.)

822
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,660
Have you been to Japan?

823
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,359
- What?
- Have you been to Japan?

824
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,629
I've been to Tokyo once.

825
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,199
- I think you mentioned it.
- I did.

826
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,499
Where are we going again? Kamakura?

827
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,939
- Kamakura. It'll be my first time.
- Kamakura.

828
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,169
I've never heard of it before.

829
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,110
I've often heard about that place.

830
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,940
What's famous there?

831
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,449
"Slam Dunk?" But I didn't look into it.

832
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,650
- I looked up some images yesterday.
- I see.

833
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,749
It seemed like the place I wanted to stop by...

834
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,989
when I was in Tokyo, after hearing there was...

835
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,059
a pretty train station nearby.

836
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,260
- Really?
- Judging by the images.

837
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:56,960
I should search it up.

838
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,129
(Next to Tokyo,)

839
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,000
(the small city flowing with time)

840
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,600
(Kamakura)

841
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:14,810
(The setting of the movie "Our Little Sister")

842
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,920
(And the sacred place of "Slam Dunk")

843
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:29,090
(Where couples' love begins)

844
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,200
(The new love that'll bloom in Kamakura)

845
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,969
The mood changed completely.

846
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,609
It's a first in EXchange.

847
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,239
- The city...
- Yes.

848
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,679
gives off vibes like those in Japanese animation.

849
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,710
Totally.

850
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,179
Apparently, that's where Japanese couples...

851
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,219
often go on dates.

852
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,420
- Is that so?
- First dates.

853
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,860
We're off to Japan.

854
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,929
(A selfie that's slightly awkward)

855
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,160
Is that all you can do?

856
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,859
What did you do?

857
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,230
What did you do? Show me.

858
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,370
I'm getting excited.

859
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,539
It'd be nice if we could listen to music.

860
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,140
Shall we check if there's any?

861
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,980
I heard there was music.

862
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,250
Turn on "Power Rangers" right away.

863
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,649
(Won Kyu is hyper.)

864
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:29,920
You're excited, aren't you?

865
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,689
Do you feel comfortable around me?

866
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,860
What?

867
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,590
Do you feel comfortable around me now?

868
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,360
Things were a mess, and so was my mind.

869
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,970
But you know those who make you feel at ease just by being with them?

870
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,870
When I'm with Ji Yeon,

871
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,170
I stop thinking about useless things.

872
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,640
It felt new, as if we were really going on a trip.

873
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,140
I got excited.

874
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,609
How about we listen to the music together...

875
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,079
and move from left to right?

876
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,280
- Okay.
- Okay?

877
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,080
Okay. On 1, 2, 3.

878
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,620
(Won Kyu is really into the music.)

879
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,320
Why aren't you moving?

880
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,130
You're like a comedian.

881
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,430
That's absurd.

882
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,800
(Trying to get the rhythm right again)

883
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,770
Hold on.

884
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,069
We might get kicked out.

885
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,170
Should we stop?

886
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,840
Put your sunglasses away, will you?

887
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:34,979
Being with Won Kyu made me feel at ease...

888
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,920
since the flight together.

889
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,490
The fact that we were going on a trip started to sink in.

890
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,490
I looked forward to it.

891
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,559
Now that I look at them, the two look good together.

892
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,860
- They give off newlywed vibes.
- They're like a married couple.

893
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,100
(Haneda Airport, Tokyo)

894
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,239
Number 26. It's that one.

895
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,440
It's right in front of us.

896
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,849
(Impressed)

897
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,280
(Amazed)

898
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,080
Nice.

899
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,750
- Here we go.
- We're off.

900
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,160
I'm already excited.

901
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,929
It's raining ever so slightly.

902
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:20,060
Yes, this amount is perfect.

903
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,060
You're right. It's just right.

904
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,000
Are you happy?

905
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,140
Aren't you happy to be here with me?

906
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
I am.

907
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,849
So? Aren't you hungry?

908
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,150
- I'm hungry.
- Right?

909
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,580
I want sushi.

910
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,550
That's the only thing I can think of.

911
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,390
That alone sounds good.

912
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,389
Sushi is good enough.

913
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,829
We also need to eat pork cutlet.

914
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,130
- Pork cutlet?
- Yes.

915
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,430
And tendon.

916
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,700
Great.

917
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,800
Getting a meal in the rain.

918
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,170
Nice.

919
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,240
Aren't you sleepy?

920
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,410
You are, right? Should we take a nap?

921
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,340
- Yes.
- Talk to me if you can't sleep.

922
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,610
I'll wake up.

923
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,920
(While Won Kyu and Ji Yeon are napping,)

924
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,990
(the weather slowly clears up.)

925
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
Won Kyu.

926
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,370
It's the sea, right?

927
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,540
I'm indeed the weather fairy, right?

928
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,570
- Aren't I?
- You are.

929
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,280
It smells like the sea.

930
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,680
- We're at the sea.
- Yes.

931
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,680
It's great.

932
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,380
Take a photo of this.

933
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,150
Of that?

934
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,820
It's unclear.

935
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,719
Suddenly, I got very energetic.

936
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,130
(Going to today's first destination with excitement and anticipation)

937
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,360
(Where an active volcano near Tokyo breathes)

938
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,569
(Izu Peninsula, where the coast...)

939
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,670
(and nature offer a beautiful healing escape)

940
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,310
(A peaceful seaside town in the east, Ito)

941
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,680
(Tsukino Usagi)

942
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,420
- It has an amazing vibe.
- I know.

943
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,360
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

944
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,830
It looks delicious.

945
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,999
There's everything that you've wanted to eat.

946
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,370
Yes, there's everything.

947
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,440
Shall I take a photo of it?

948
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,710
- Let's take photos.
- Okay.

949
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,750
- Oh my gosh.
- It's so beautiful.

950
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,620
- Let's dig in.
- Shall we eat?

951
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,690
- Shall we dig in?
- Yes.

952
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,390
It looks delicious.

953
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,360
Oh my gosh.

954
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,530
- It looks so beautiful.
- Yes.

955
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,659
That's nice.

956
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:13,000
- The atmosphere totally changed.
- Oh, my gosh.

957
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,339
They're lovers on a trip in Japan. They must be so happy.

958
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,510
- Seriously.
- I'm so jealous.

959
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,540
Oh, my gosh. It looks delicious.

960
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,550
(Humming)

961
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,250
- Are you satisfied?
- Yes.

962
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,590
You always pick good restaurants.

963
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,959
You brought me here because...

964
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,200
- you thought that I'd like it here.
- Yes.

965
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,530
- We promised to eat sashimi.
- Yes.

966
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,070
- It's really good.
- Our start in Japan is good.

967
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:54,010
Wasn't it really pretty at the entrance?

968
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,809
- It looks better with the rain.
- It has a nice vibe.

969
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,510
- It matches well with this place.
- Yes.

970
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,120
Recently...

971
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,959
My room is right in the front.

972
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Right.

973
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:14,429
I heard you guys talked for a long time.

974
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,430
(Won Kyu heard Woo Jin and Ji Yeon's conversation.)

975
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,470
After having that conversation with him,

976
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,570
do you feel more uncomfortable or not?

977
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,250
- It feels more complicated now.
- I see.

978
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,350
I can understand.

979
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,790
- Yes.
- I see.

980
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,890
But I felt that things were...

981
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,120
more complicated for you than me.

982
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,290
- Really?
- Yes.

983
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,629
- But I...
- I thought that things became...

984
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,599
- more complicated for you recently.
- Didn't it seem that way?

985
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,399
Yes, it stood out to me.

986
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,370
Now that I'm here, I'll try to resolve it.

987
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,270
- Here in Japan?
- Yes.

988
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,370
To make it less complicated...

989
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,609
Can you make it less complicated when you put your mind to it?

990
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,180
- No, it's difficult.
- And so?

991
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,180
I will try not to think about my ex.

992
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,720
That's what I thought before coming here.

993
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
Me too.

994
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,830
During my time with you, I will only think about you.

995
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,100
Me too.

996
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,780
When I'm with Won Kyu, it's so much fun. My heart flutters.

997
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,349
My feelings for Won Kyu haven't changed...

998
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,820
since the beginning. I like him.

999
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,120
Now that I had such delicious food with you,

1000
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,420
I won't remember anything else.

1001
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,260
We can eat delicious food again.

1002
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,930
Going to the zoo sounds fun too.

1003
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:01,370
(Located next to Mount Omuro, the background of "Your Name")

1004
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:10,450
(Izu Shaboten Zoo)

1005
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,759
- It will be fun.
- I agree.

1006
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,900
Totally.

1007
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,530
This is the boat.

1008
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,570
- There are fennec foxes, - Oh, my gosh.

1009
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,410
peacocks, and kangaroos.

1010
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,540
Oh, my gosh. Monkeys are running around. Did you see them?

1011
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,710
No, I didn't.

1012
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,580
I will look when we're in the boat.

1013
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:45,910
Okay.

1014
00:59:45,911 --> 00:59:48,580
(They will look around the zoo in a boat.)

1015
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,020
Should I tie it?

1016
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,920
- Do you want me to tie it?
- Yes.

1017
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,360
I will tie yours. We're so affectionate, aren't we?

1018
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,490
Tie mine well.

1019
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,330
One knot is enough, right?

1020
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,000
- Is it good?
- Yes. Okay.

1021
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,039
I've never seen a zoo set up like this.

1022
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,480
We can see the animals up close.

1023
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,910
Flamingos.

1024
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,850
Flamingos?

1025
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,220
- Oh, my gosh.
- They're really big.

1026
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,989
- They're pelicans.
- Goodness.

1027
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,859
- They look scary.
- They do.

1028
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,030
They might eat you.

1029
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,530
I heard that they had huge beaks.

1030
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,470
(Won Kyu takes care of Ji Yeon even during a scary moment.)

1031
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,269
I didn't tie it well before.

1032
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,269
Actually, yours got undone too.

1033
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,310
- Really?
- Yes.

1034
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,210
I guess it can't be helped.

1035
01:00:46,211 --> 01:00:48,079
- Shall we just leave it?
- Yes.

1036
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,809
(Exclaiming)

1037
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,610
Is it angry?

1038
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,779
- He tied it again for her.
- Oh, my gosh.

1039
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,789
They look good together.

1040
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,849
- They look very good together.
- Yes.

1041
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,590
They looked good together from the start.

1042
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,719
(Ji Yeon is surprised.)

1043
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
Is it a monkey?

1044
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:04,060
- It's slightly...
- Monkey.

1045
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,260
It's so peaceful.

1046
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,900
Won Kyu.

1047
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,599
(Exclaiming)

1048
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,900
It's a baby monkey.

1049
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,340
I wish it would come.

1050
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,940
- This way?
- Yes.

1051
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,840
Maybe it will come if we hold something out.

1052
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,580
When will we feed them?

1053
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,319
(They arrive at the place where they feed the animals.)

1054
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,419
Oh, my gosh.

1055
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,660
(Today, they will feed ring-tailed lemurs.)

1056
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,060
I will explain how to feed them.

1057
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,470
Open the feed box.

1058
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,940
I'm scared.

1059
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,910
Nice to meet you. Oh, no.

1060
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,140
(The lemurs are way too active.)

1061
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,810
How many are on me right now?

1062
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,209
- Right now? Let me see.
- I feel quite heavy.

1063
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,319
- There are two.
- Two?

1064
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,320
Yes.

1065
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:06,989
- It will be awful when I open this.
- Oh, my gosh, Won Kyu.

1066
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,060
I'm scared.

1067
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,989
Guys, wait.

1068
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,730
- There's a lemur...
- Wait.

1069
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,569
Guys. Here's one for you.

1070
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,070
- Can you give me one?
- One for each.

1071
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,300
They're so fascinating.

1072
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:23,140
Yes, come up here.

1073
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,040
I like them. Come up here.

1074
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,139
- I want to feed one.
- More of you can come.

1075
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,409
- Can you take a photo of me?
- Where's your mobile phone?

1076
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,380
- It's behind me.
- Behind you?

1077
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,949
- Gosh, Won Kyu.
- Do I look good?

1078
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,950
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

1079
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,520
It's scary.

1080
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,060
They're even posing for the camera.

1081
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,700
Hello.

1082
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,000
They're cute.

1083
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:50,430
- Won Kyu.
- Yes?

1084
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,440
You look much happier than when you were with me.

1085
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,900
They're so cute.

1086
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,970
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1087
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,580
It was my first time seeing such a big smile on his face.

1088
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,550
He kept asking me how many lemurs were on his shoulders.

1089
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,990
I enjoyed seeing him happy.

1090
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,290
Monkeys are my favorite animal at the zoo.

1091
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,320
I was also born in the Year of the Monkey.

1092
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,560
I could feel it every time one of them got on me.

1093
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,500
It felt comfortable and cozy.

1094
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,400
It's a giraffe.

1095
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,900
- It's a giraffe.
- You're right.

1096
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,610
(Exclaiming)

1097
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,270
It's very big up close.

1098
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,040
(Exclaiming)

1099
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,850
- Can you take a photo of me?
- Look at the eyes.

1100
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,320
It took it away from me.

1101
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,490
My goodness.

1102
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,590
Now it's your turn.

1103
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,860
Can you move away for a minute?

1104
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,900
(Exclaiming)

1105
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,070
Gosh. Did you see how it blew from its nose?

1106
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,999
- It looks amazing.
- I never imagined...

1107
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,570
feeding a giraffe in my life.

1108
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,580
- It's my first time.
- Me too.

1109
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,380
It's really fun.

1110
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,050
We had a lot of fun.

1111
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,120
We got very close. We're comfortable around each other now.

1112
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,820
I really enjoyed it.

1113
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,620
I didn't think about my ex at all.

1114
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,059
We fed all the babies.

1115
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:28,500
Now, Won Kyu teases me casually.

1116
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,700
Do you want to touch it? Go ahead.

1117
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,130
Are you crazy?

1118
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,740
I think he can tease me now that he feels at ease.

1119
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:40,410
It makes my heart flutter, and it's fun.

1120
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,780
What about this? Touch it too.

1121
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,280
- Which one?
- That one.

1122
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,780
Gosh, I don't think so.

1123
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,760
I also thought that I was laughing a lot then.

1124
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,990
Gosh, it's Jung Won Kyu with small eyes.

1125
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,030
It's so cute. It's eating like a pig.

1126
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,630
I was closest to Ji Yeon before.

1127
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:06,840
We got even closer now.

1128
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,440
I enjoyed every moment.

1129
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,979
What's wrong? It doesn't feel strange, does it?

1130
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,580
It doesn't feel strange.

1131
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,220
- Gosh.
- You...

1132
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,720
I think it likes you.

1133
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,530
I think it might be the way of showing affection.

1134
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,360
When I try to pull out my foot,

1135
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,430
- it flaps its ears.
- Pull it out again.

1136
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,799
Gosh. It doesn't want it.

1137
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,869
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

1138
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:42,870
There you go.

1139
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,070
- Let's leave.
- Let's go.

1140
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:46,610
Goodness.

1141
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,810
- Can you buy me one?
- Sure, I'll buy you an otter.

1142
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:54,420
What about you? Pick one. I'll buy it for you.

1143
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,750
I like monkeys.

1144
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:57,850
Monkeys?

1145
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,090
Okay, I want this one.

1146
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,760
That's cute.

1147
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,030
Based on how much I enjoyed it,

1148
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,929
it was the most fun date for me.

1149
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,900
(Their date full of joy)

1150
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,799
Ji Yeon was very sad last night.

1151
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,199
- She's gotten much better.
- She isn't sad anymore.

1152
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,839
- She's not sad anymore.
- I'm relieved.

1153
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,139
The effect of traveling abroad is different.

1154
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,339
They don't look like they fought with their exes yesterday.

1155
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,779
- Clearly.
- You're right.

1156
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,079
Suddenly, things became peaceful.

1157
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,609
They will probably get much closer...

1158
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,779
- in Japan.
- Right.

1159
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,419
Won Kyu also told her that he made up his mind...

1160
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,719
before going to Japan.

1161
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,989
They decided not to care about their exes.

1162
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,059
It was nice of him...

1163
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,159
to tell that to Ji Yeon.

1164
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,529
- That he told him directly.
- She needed to hear it.

1165
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,829
It was like they were having a fling at the zoo.

1166
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,159
- Right.
- People can plan their date...

1167
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,769
while watching this show.

1168
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,369
I really want to go there.

1169
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,070
- Me too. It looks really fun.
- I want to go there very much.

1170
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,480
(Haneda Airport in Tokyo)

1171
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,940
- It's much cooler here than Korea.
- It's very...

1172
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,479
- You're right. It's nice.
- Right?

1173
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Right?

1174
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,689
- A trip to Japan?
- It's fun.

1175
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,390
(Their dating spot, Tokyo)

1176
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,890
Are we really in Tokyo?

1177
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,120
It finally feels real now.

1178
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,530
- That we're in Tokyo?
- That we're in Tokyo.

1179
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,930
Do you like rides? Amusement parks?

1180
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,660
- Me?
- Yes.

1181
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:17,570
- Why?
- Can you go on scary rides?

1182
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:20,100
- Definitely.
- Really?

1183
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,769
- What about you?
- I also can.

1184
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:24,809
- Really? I actually like them.
- I see.

1185
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:26,070
Do you enjoy them?

1186
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,010
That's good.

1187
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,680
I was worried that we wouldn't be able to go if it rained a lot.

1188
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,020
- We're going to an amusement park?
- Yes.

1189
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,620
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1190
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,889
Since I was in Seoul, I've been dying to go to an amusement park.

1191
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,660
- Really?
- Yes, I wanted to go.

1192
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,790
At this rate, we're like the same person.

1193
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,360
We even brought the same book.

1194
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,569
I know. We brought the same book.

1195
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,000
It's unbelievable.

1196
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,240
It's fascinating.

1197
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,340
- It gave me goosebumps then.
- Me too.

1198
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,940
We must have similar personalities.

1199
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:03,879
What's your favorite song?

1200
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
My favorite song?

1201
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:09,320
My favorite singers are Colde...

1202
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,849
I love Colde.

1203
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:14,819
I actually went to his concert too.

1204
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,890
No way.

1205
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,590
Thai food versus Vietnamese food.

1206
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:21,060
- I'd choose Thai food then.
- Really?

1207
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,630
People in the house love Southeast Asian food.

1208
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,899
But they all said they'd pick Vietnamese food.

1209
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,539
- But I like Thai food.
- Really?

1210
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,209
- It's more diverse, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

1211
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,739
Like stir-fried crab with curry.

1212
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,080
Gosh, that's so good.

1213
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,479
- Pad Thai.
- I love pad Thai.

1214
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,510
Green curry too.

1215
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,280
I love it. Seriously.

1216
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,949
Have we arrived already?

1217
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,020
Yes. I think so.

1218
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,160
Wait, Seung Yong. That...

1219
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,860
- Do you want me to carry it? Okay.
- Yes.

1220
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,860
That must be it.

1221
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,440
(She hears the screams of excitement.)

1222
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,540
- So the pirate ship first?
- They sound like they're dying.

1223
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,750
- Should we start with that?
- The pirate ship first?

1224
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:13,180
Are you ready?

1225
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,250
I'm always ready.

1226
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,019
- It must be fun.
- Right.

1227
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,689
It's been ages since I've been to an amusement park.

1228
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,189
Same here. Seriously. It's been so long for me too.

1229
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,290
It's been years.

1230
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,160
I'm a bit nervous.

1231
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,399
No way.

1232
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,330
- You know we must wave, right?
- How?

1233
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,300
We have to wave our hands when we reach the top.

1234
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,640
Seung Yong. Ji Hyeon. Let's go.

1235
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:38,510
Let's go.

1236
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,180
Oh, my gosh.

1237
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,490
- This is fun.
- My body is feeling numb now.

1238
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,560
(The pirate ship is going up higher.)

1239
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,930
(Screaming)

1240
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,300
(Screaming)

1241
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,669
Are you scared?

1242
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,300
It feels like I'm levitating. You know what I mean?

1243
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,870
- Right now.
- We're not at the top yet.

1244
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,370
(Their current location)

1245
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,009
You have to raise your hands.

1246
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,420
You must wave at kids below.

1247
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,390
(He quickly waves at them and then grabs the handle.)

1248
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,090
We're going down now.

1249
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,720
Really? Already?

1250
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,460
- This is fun.
- It's fun.

1251
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,599
This was a bit easy.

1252
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,370
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

1253
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,100
He was cute.

1254
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:46,640
He seemed a bit more scared than me.

1255
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,309
(Do you enjoy amusement rides?)

1256
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,880
Yes, I'm good with amusement rides.

1257
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,120
- Gosh, this is so scary. Oh, no.
- Really?

1258
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,379
- Do you want to sit here?
- But...

1259
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,750
- I can only see the Ferris wheel.
- Yes.

1260
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,890
It's so scary.

1261
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:01,690
Wait.

1262
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,960
Hold on.

1263
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:07,330
Isn't it scary?

1264
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,399
Are you okay?

1265
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,300
(Are you okay?)

1266
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,400
Oh, no. Are you okay?

1267
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,309
I'll sing a song. You give me no choice.

1268
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,540
Great. Let's sing some songs.

1269
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:25,010
(He sings a song for Ji Hyeon who's scared to be in the air.)

1270
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,350
Doesn't it go like this?

1271
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:30,150
Doesn't it go like this?

1272
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,859
I didn't know he could dance like that.

1273
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,519
He definitely has a lot of charms.

1274
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,129
- If he's cute on top of everything, - He's cute.

1275
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,289
life isn't fair in my opinion.

1276
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,529
He's the complete package.

1277
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,029
- He's so muscular and fit.
- Right. Exactly.

1278
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:44,200
He's got a nice personality. He's fun to be around too.

1279
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,400
(A familiar melody plays up in the air.)

1280
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:48,870
- Oh, yeah - BLACKPINK

1281
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:52,410
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

1282
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,579
Black then pink, we are pretty savage

1283
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,650
(She's feeling less nervous as they start singing.)

1284
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,350
This spot is less scary, though.

1285
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,120
We'll only go down from here.

1286
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,959
(She can calm her nerves thanks to Seung Yong.)

1287
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,130
It's quite scenic.

1288
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,670
Raindrops are on the window here.

1289
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,670
Going down is a piece of cake. It's not scary at all.

1290
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,709
Let's do this. Going down is nothing.

1291
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,010
At least, I can say that.

1292
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,740
Let me take a picture of you now.

1293
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,080
- Do you think you can do it?
- Yes.

1294
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,280
- Good.
- One, two.

1295
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,320
It's suddenly pouring down.

1296
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,560
Right.

1297
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,960
It will be quite scenic if we ride the merry-go-round here.

1298
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,290
Right.

1299
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,860
- The rain...
- I'm enjoying this now.

1300
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,670
It'd be nice to watch the rain on the merry-go-round.

1301
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,970
Right.

1302
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,240
- There's a song too.
- It's going up and down.

1303
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,140
It's going up and down. My gosh.

1304
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,310
My gosh. This is fun.

1305
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,780
Shouldn't we wave?

1306
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,249
Hello.

1307
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,450
(They relive their childhood and get on the merry-go-round.)

1308
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,819
- That startled me.
- Gosh, hold on. What is it?

1309
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,320
Someone just might pop out from here.

1310
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,590
That got me.

1311
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,290
This is so scary.

1312
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,930
That was so scary.

1313
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,000
(Ji Hyeon and Seung Yong share an unforgettable experience.)

1314
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:26,969
It started to rain again.

1315
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,499
Should we get some coffee? How about going to a cafe?

1316
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,740
- Should we? Okay.
- Should we go to a cafe?

1317
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,470
How's teaching?

1318
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,040
I mean, I'm teaching classes.

1319
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,350
- Okay.
- But it's so abstract.

1320
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,250
I'm realizing that trying to teach my class an abstract concept...

1321
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,790
in a way they can understand is a challenge.

1322
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,759
I'm learning every day that teaching is a hard job.

1323
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,789
I see.

1324
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,760
It must be especially hard for you.

1325
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,629
It's not like solving math questions.

1326
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,530
- It doesn't have a clear answer.
- It doesn't.

1327
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,030
I don't even know the right answer.

1328
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,670
So I'm just teaching them...

1329
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:07,580
what worked for me when I tried out acting.

1330
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,079
In my opinion, the last year of high school is a very important phase...

1331
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,550
- of everyone's life.
- Yes, it's important.

1332
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,350
When my students don't get into the school of their choice,

1333
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,859
- Is it heartbreaking?
- it feels like it's my fault.

1334
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,420
- So I can't sleep.
- I see.

1335
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,260
I can see why you'd feel that way.

1336
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,899
But when they get accepted, it brings me so much joy.

1337
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,930
I see.

1338
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:31,800
You can see their progress then.

1339
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,400
That's interesting.

1340
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,739
Actually, in my social circle, I don't have anyone...

1341
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,870
- who specializes in arts or sports.
- Is it...

1342
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:42,879
So I never had a chance to hear this kind of story.

1343
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,450
It's fascinating for me.

1344
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,219
Ji Hyeon loves...

1345
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,849
her job very much.

1346
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,849
It seems she's passionate...

1347
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:56,860
and has a sense of duty about teaching students.

1348
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:59,459
It was a good chance for me to get to know her better.

1349
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,060
So I really enjoyed my conversation with her.

1350
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:05,470
- Shall we go and eat?
- Sounds good.

1351
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,070
(Hoshinoya Tokyo)

1352
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,270
My gosh, is this the place?

1353
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:13,910
You know the unwritten rules, right?

1354
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,280
I can't wait.

1355
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,989
- Cheers.
- Let's clink our glasses.

1356
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,290
Cheers.

1357
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,400
Gosh, this is good.

1358
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,999
Had I known I was coming to a place like this today,

1359
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,040
What is it?

1360
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,939
I would've dressed up to the nines.

1361
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,470
You still look great. Why?

1362
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,610
My outfit would be better suited in Harajuku today.

1363
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,440
It looks great on you.

1364
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,110
Oh my gosh.

1365
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,220
Is this an art piece?

1366
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:00,420
It's stunning.

1367
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,890
It's dried laver.

1368
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,160
I think they stuffed bamboo shoots with scallop.

1369
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:08,500
- Let's enjoy our meal.
- Sure.

1370
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:21,510
It's tasty.

1371
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
It's savory. I can also smell the ocean.

1372
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:25,510
It's delicious.

1373
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,180
Gosh, the food already tastes so good.

1374
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,290
Right.

1375
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,260
- I'm so happy.
- Right. Gosh, I love it too.

1376
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,760
This is the most satisfying moment.

1377
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:38,830
I love it.

1378
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,959
This looks great.

1379
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,230
(The next dish that will make them happier is served.)

1380
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,100
- It looks so pretty. Right?
- Yes.

1381
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,400
Gosh, it smells divine.

1382
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,770
Let's enjoy it.

1383
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,550
It's so good.

1384
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,650
This can't be real.

1385
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,150
This tastes amazing.

1386
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:06,520
It tastes amazing.

1387
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,060
I'm in trouble.

1388
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,090
How will I go on another date in Japan after this?

1389
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,460
- I'll keep thinking about this.
- Right.

1390
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,229
Do I deserve to enjoy something this luxurious?

1391
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:20,839
- Of course, you do.
- What if...

1392
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,570
other couples say things like, "We had ramen?"

1393
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:25,809
Ramen?

1394
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:26,810
I would be dying...

1395
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:28,810
- to tell them about our meal.
- Totally.

1396
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,480
I learned how to drink wine properly.

1397
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,579
- How do you drink it properly?
- When you clink the glasses,

1398
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,580
you're supposed...

1399
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:37,020
- to look into each other's eyes.
- Oh, really?

1400
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:40,990
Do you want to try it?

1401
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,159
"Here's looking at you, kid."

1402
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,690
- "Here's looking at you..." - "Here's looking at you. Cheers."

1403
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,730
- Cheers.
- Is it...

1404
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,440
I think I'm already a bit tipsy.

1405
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:01,210
- Me? Oh, you?
- Yes, me.

1406
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,939
- Pace yourself.
- I should...

1407
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,080
- I'll finish yours if you can't.
- Really?

1408
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,150
- Are you okay now?
- Yes.

1409
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,220
(Judging by his face, he doesn't look okay.)

1410
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:16,959
Seriously. I enjoyed my meal so much thanks to you.

1411
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,030
Seriously.

1412
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:20,630
Thank you.

1413
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,960
I should be thanking you.

1414
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,930
I'm grateful that you chose me.

1415
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,440
It was crazy timing.

1416
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,669
You lent me your book, "Strong Current."

1417
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:31,740
I see.

1418
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,510
I got this feeling...

1419
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:36,910
that I should talk to you more. So I asked you...

1420
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:39,379
- to have a meal with me.
- Yes.

1421
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,120
Right after that, all of a sudden,

1422
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,680
we were going on a trip and I had to pick someone.

1423
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,150
I thought it wouldn't be...

1424
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,389
boring if I could talk to you during our trip.

1425
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,330
- Really?
- I thought it would be so fun.

1426
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,760
I'm glad.

1427
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:56,199
How would I have survived if I didn't bring "Strong Current?"

1428
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,799
- Seriously.
- I'm grateful...

1429
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,329
to the writer, Jung Dae Gun.

1430
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,100
I love it. I'm so glad you brought it.

1431
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,510
I'm happy to hear that.

1432
01:19:06,511 --> 01:19:08,880
I thought a lot whether or not I should bring the book.

1433
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,080
I'm glad...

1434
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,150
- Right.
- you also brought a book.

1435
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,879
Oh, right. Hyeon Ji brought one too.

1436
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,080
- Really?
- It's a novel. "Stoner."

1437
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,850
I see. Really?

1438
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,020
How interesting. Other people also brought books.

1439
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,359
To be honest, I haven't been...

1440
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,500
on many dates after moving into the house,

1441
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:35,169
but this date feels different from the previous one.

1442
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:38,369
- The depth of conversations...
- Really?

1443
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:40,540
- is a bit different.
- What a lovely thing to say.

1444
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,079
I can feel this date is different.

1445
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,380
(This date is different from his date with Yun Nyeong.)

1446
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:46,250
When I heard that,

1447
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,280
Seung Yong made my heart flutter.

1448
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,819
Compared to the expectations...

1449
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,220
I had of Seung Yong initially,

1450
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,390
I could see that he was much more attractive...

1451
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:58,730
and kinder.

1452
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,659
There were some things we had in common.

1453
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,659
Our conversation went smoothly.

1454
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,669
So I became more interested in her.

1455
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,770
(Seung Young got more interested in her.)

1456
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,899
I'm having a great time thanks to you, Ji Hyeon.

1457
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,270
I had a great day thanks to you.

1458
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,739
They are such a good couple. Their date is perfect so far.

1459
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,749
- They have similar tastes. Yes.
- They have a lot to talk about.

1460
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,779
- Seung Yong is a quiet talker.
- Yes.

1461
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,619
- He makes people feel at ease.
- Right.

1462
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,620
- His reaction is great too.
- Right.

1463
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:26,849
(Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun's pick-a-date in Japan)

1464
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:28,589
- We're going to Japan.
- My gosh.

1465
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,220
Gosh, I'm so excited.

1466
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:31,959
Really? It's my first time...

1467
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,159
going to Japan too.

1468
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,860
- Yes.
- So I'm very happy too.

1469
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:38,430
Do you want some?

1470
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,230
I thought you were going to share.

1471
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:44,240
- You have a bite first.
- No, you go first.

1472
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,179
It's so good.

1473
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,919
(They share the sandwich...)

1474
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,290
(and the coffee together.)

1475
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:02,660
(They also watch a movie together.)

1476
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,730
(Blinking)

1477
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,569
I didn't get any sleep the night before.

1478
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,570
I kept getting sleepy, but I tried so hard to stay awake.

1479
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:20,640
I think I did that because I wanted to remember that moment.

1480
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,510
(He's remembering this moment in dreamland.)

1481
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,590
(She's worried about Baek Hyun, sleeping in an uncomfortable pose.)

1482
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:42,859
Didn't you say you never fall asleep on the plane?

1483
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,160
I was only pretending.

1484
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,540
(Haneda Airport in Tokyo)

1485
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,000
The Japanese taxis are so cute.

1486
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,980
- It's so cute.
- My gosh.

1487
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:59,350
Do you want to take a picture?

1488
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,380
I can't believe we're taking pictures in Japan.

1489
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:11,359
I actually don't take selfies.

1490
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,860
But I wanted to leave a record of it.

1491
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,970
I don't take selfies often.

1492
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,969
I kept asking Yun Nyeong...

1493
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,200
to take pictures and selfies.

1494
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,370
Because I wanted to leave a record.

1495
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,240
You look like a puppy right now.

1496
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,710
- What kind of face do you like?
- Ones that look like puppies.

1497
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,920
You... I'm turning red.

1498
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,660
- Oh, Tokyo Tower.
- Where are we?

1499
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,160
Now it feels like we're in Tokyo.

1500
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,800
It's so romantic.

1501
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,969
Let's eat something really good.

1502
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:02,510
(Sakura, Hilton Tokyo Odaiba)

1503
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,080
It's so pretty outside.

1504
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,250
Did you sleep well last night?

1505
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:14,720
Last night? I slept so well that I was puffy this morning.

1506
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,990
Do I look okay now?

1507
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:21,130
It's meat.

1508
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,870
- It smells really good.
- Yes.

1509
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,070
The meat smells really good.

1510
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,610
This is awesome.

1511
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,540
How hungry are you?

1512
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,749
From 1 to 10.

1513
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,550
- The level of my hunger?
- Yes.

1514
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,950
- Seven or eight?
- Seven or eight?

1515
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,549
You're really hungry.

1516
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,089
What about you, Baek Hyun?

1517
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,960
(What about you, Baek Hyun?)

1518
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,230
What?

1519
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,630
Baek Hyun?

1520
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:01,270
Truly, I am an older brother.

1521
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,710
I've never dated anyone younger than me.

1522
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,440
It was...

1523
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:10,240
the first time to hear like that from someone I like.

1524
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:14,519
I was flustered. I didn't expect it.

1525
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,880
I was like, "Baek Hyun?"

1526
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:21,390
This is why people like to hear like that.

1527
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,760
I've never had that feeling before.

1528
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,900
Will we be able to finish it?

1529
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,670
This is so good.

1530
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,470
It's good by itself.

1531
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:38,640
It's good, right?

1532
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,810
- Thank you.
- For what?

1533
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,880
I get to eat this thanks to you.

1534
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,350
Next time, choose me.

1535
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,250
Of course.

1536
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:54,960
You know only I requested a date until now?

1537
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:58,590
I know.

1538
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,790
You never requested a date.

1539
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,370
Let's go on a date next time.

1540
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,940
I'll request it next time.

1541
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,270
Go on a date with me next time.

1542
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,740
Of course.

1543
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,779
Except for a day or two,

1544
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,550
we kept texting each other.

1545
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,090
I thought that was pretty cool.

1546
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:26,890
How did we do that?

1547
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,830
Maybe we're meant to be.

1548
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,000
I was just attracted to you.

1549
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,570
I texted the one I was attracted to.

1550
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:44,610
Can I ask you what attracted you? I'm curious.

1551
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,010
When we went bowling and teamed up,

1552
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,850
my feelings started to grow, and I wanted to get to know you.

1553
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,279
After bowling, I sat in the passenger seat,

1554
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,450
and we talked about exhibitions.

1555
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,290
(Do you like exhibitions?)

1556
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:00,689
(So much.)

1557
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:02,189
(I normally go alone.)

1558
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,360
(Me too.)

1559
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,660
I think that's when I fell for you.

1560
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,400
Let's go watch Banksy's exhibition next time.

1561
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,130
I mean it.

1562
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:16,800
I hope we go on a lot of dates since we're in Japan.

1563
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,240
With me?

1564
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:19,940
Only with you.

1565
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,749
Really?

1566
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,349
- Baek Hyun.
- He's certain.

1567
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,719
That's only the right thing to do.

1568
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,850
It's tickling.

1569
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,920
Take pictures of me only then.

1570
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,890
- What?
- Take pictures of me only.

1571
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,820
Oh, you...

1572
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,760
- You said you like taking pictures.
- Yes.

1573
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,230
Can you say from now on?

1574
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:44,400
The past is...

1575
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:47,629
- Only your pictures, from now on.
- Me too.

1576
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:49,239
I'll only take pictures of you, Yun Nyeong.

1577
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,700
I'll only take pictures of you from now on, Baek Hyun.

1578
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,370
- Forget the past.
- The past is...

1579
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:55,740
It's in the past.

1580
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:00,750
- Are you done? Shall we go?
- Yes.

1581
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,320
- You may look forward to it.
- Really?

1582
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,650
- May I look forward to it?
- You may look forward to it.

1583
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,800
No way. Really?

1584
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,339
It's the denim workshop.

1585
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,409
- Really?
- Yes.

1586
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,739
(Yun Nyeong picked a denim custom workshop since she likes denim.)

1587
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,769
- Do you love it?
- Awesome.

1588
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,979
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1589
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,010
I told you to look forward to it.

1590
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,980
I was so happy.

1591
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,320
I love denim.

1592
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,019
Yun Nyeong also loves denim.

1593
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:44,160
It was nice to make a...

1594
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:46,630
denim jacket together.

1595
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:48,999
To enjoy something that I like...

1596
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,530
with the person I like.

1597
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:55,440
He was very happy.

1598
01:27:55,540 --> 01:28:00,040
I was proud to see him happy.

1599
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,980
- I'm so happy.
- Me too.

1600
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,920
(Expressing joy physically)

1601
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,450
So funny.

1602
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,519
Why don't we recommend buttons to each other?

1603
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,690
Sure. Sounds good.

1604
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,420
(They decide to decorate each other's jacket.)

1605
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:19,660
What do I do? I really want to do a good job.

1606
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,170
They're all so cute.

1607
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:29,170
Tell me what your theme is.

1608
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,500
- Me?
- Yes.

1609
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:33,540
- I'm going to give it a highlight.
- Highlight?

1610
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:35,080
I'll give it a highlight too.

1611
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,190
(If Baek Hyun picks a red button,)

1612
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,460
(Yun Nyeong also picks a red button.)

1613
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,960
You know it's actually nice when you add just whatever?

1614
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,430
- I...
- Do you need to think?

1615
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,500
I want to make it really nice.

1616
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,940
Me too. I'm the same.

1617
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:12,549
Do you like stars?

1618
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:14,010
- I like stars.
- You do?

1619
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,220
Good.

1620
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:22,120
(Adding a star button to Baek Hyun's jacket)

1621
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,629
(A flower button is added to Yun Nyeong's jacket)

1622
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:32,630
Done.

1623
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,199
Yun Nyeong, I'm so happy.

1624
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,839
- What? You're happy?
- Yes.

1625
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,940
I'm glad to hear that.

1626
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:39,810
I'm really happy.

1627
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,110
Do I deserve to be this happy?

1628
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,710
I like it.

1629
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,180
I love it. I hope you enjoy it.

1630
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,050
I'll wear it every day.

1631
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,060
Oh, my gosh. It's nice.

1632
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:58,730
It's really nice.

1633
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,560
- Try it on.
- It's really nice.

1634
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:05,270
I love it.

1635
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:09,470
I love it. You're pretty good.

1636
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,710
- I...
- Isn't it nice?

1637
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,010
I should wear this outside.

1638
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:18,080
- It's really nice.
- Let's take a picture.

1639
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:21,250
One, two, three.

1640
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,589
- Nice.
- That's pretty.

1641
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:28,659
That's a perfect matching item...

1642
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,119
- for couples.
- Yes.

1643
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,759
- Wear...
- What if they wear it to the hotel?

1644
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,959
Together?

1645
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,059
Hyeon Ji will go crazy.

1646
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,799
They're obviously matching items.

1647
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,799
It's obvious that they like each other.

1648
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,899
- Baek Hyun can't hide it.
- Right.

1649
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,800
I'm starting to see how Baek Hyun feels.

1650
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,170
- Thank you for this.
- So funny.

1651
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,280
Thank you so much. I love it.

1652
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,150
Why don't we wear it for our next date?

1653
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,479
- Sounds good.
- Because they're similar.

1654
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,120
(How do you feel to have the first matching item?)

1655
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:03,890
It felt like we've become a couple.

1656
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:07,259
If I made the way I liked,

1657
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,230
it was the way Baek Hyun liked it.

1658
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,199
If Baek Hyun made the way he liked,

1659
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,130
it was the way I liked it.

1660
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,769
I once again realized...

1661
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,070
that we have the similar taste.

1662
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,070
"Is it okay to have this already?"

1663
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:25,010
That's what occurred to me. But it means so much.

1664
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:28,210
I loved it.

1665
01:31:28,211 --> 01:31:31,890
I was really thankful.

1666
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:38,020
(The day the two with the same taste got matching items)

1667
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,960
It's nice to wear this jacket back.

1668
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:45,400
Yes, I know.

1669
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:48,640
Ta-da. It's a gift.

1670
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:52,240
- Really?
- Yes.

1671
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,640
- What is this?
- It's nothing big.

1672
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:56,810
It's a handkerchief.

1673
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,909
- How did you know?
- Awesome.

1674
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,480
(A gift for Baek Hyun who carries a handkerchief)

1675
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:04,020
- I love it. I mean it.
- Really?

1676
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,720
I'm glad to hear that.

1677
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:08,420
You're driving me crazy.

1678
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,360
- So funny.
- I'll only look forward now.

1679
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,000
Since this is your first time in Japan,

1680
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,040
while you're here, I hope you don't get any painful memories.

1681
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:27,270
When you think about Japan,

1682
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:29,780
I hope it doesn't give you any painful memories.

1683
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,920
(Thank you.)

1684
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,990
(Thank you.)

1685
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,470
Are your pinkies long too?

1686
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,370
(They compare their pinkies.)

1687
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,380
You do have a long thumb.

1688
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,380
- Right?
- Yes.

1689
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,629
They're holding hands!

1690
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:20,629
- See that?
- Yes.

1691
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:21,759
- They're holding hands.
- I told you.

1692
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,760
- It's 100 percent.
- It's 100 percent.

1693
01:33:22,761 --> 01:33:24,859
They locked their fingers.

1694
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:26,829
- They locked their fingers.
- My heart is about to explode.

1695
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:28,269
They've begun.

1696
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,299
- They've begun.
- They've begun.

1697
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,569
They must be excited. That's exciting.

1698
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:34,910
It'll be an unforgettable day.

1699
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:36,910
You do have a long thumb.

1700
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:38,950
- Right?
- Yes.

1701
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,930
Why did you hit me?

1702
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:54,590
Because you suddenly...

1703
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,730
- Your punch hurts.
- Sorry.

1704
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,200
Sorry.

1705
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:02,940
I...

1706
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:08,940
Let's stay like this.

1707
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,420
(She carefully holds his thumb.)

1708
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,150
(EXchange 4)

1709
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,960
(Baek Hyun and I knew.)

1710
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,390
(I couldn't hide it.)

1711
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:27,059
(Is this America?)

1712
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,960
(Were you excited?)

1713
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
(A new story will take place in Kamakura.)

1714
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,129
(The time with the ex is crossed again.)

1715
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:34,870
(Honestly, I want to ruin it.)

1716
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,769
(I think it has only begun.)

1717
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,009
(When I said I was attracted, I was attracted to Min Kyung.)

1718
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:42,179
(I hope I'm the only one in your head.)

1719
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,479
(Do you think I'm the only one at fault for our breakup?)

1720
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,879
(She implied that she wanted to get back with me.)

1721
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,679
(Are you going to try?)

1722
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,720
(Take responsibility for what you said.)

1723
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,320
(Let's stop.)

1724
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,749
(Emotions get tangled,)

1725
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,160
(and the relationships cross.)

1726
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:57,890
(How can you do this to me?)

1727
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:00,189
(I'm going to do my best to sway your heart.)

1728
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:01,929
(This is crazy.)

1729
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:03,600
(Who are you to cheer me on?)

1730
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:05,169
(Stop it.)

1731
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,770
(Park Ji Hyeon.)

1732
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:09,240
(EXchange 4)
