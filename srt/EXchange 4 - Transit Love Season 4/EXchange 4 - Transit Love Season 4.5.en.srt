00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,979
Today, as usual,

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,009
we have guests who love EXchange.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,250
It's S.COUPS and MINGYU of SEVENTEEN. Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,850
Thank you.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,619
- I'm S.COUPS.
- Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,989
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,589
I heard idols like EXchange,

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,629
and you two...

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,129
also like EXchange a lot.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,699
- I look forward to their reunion.
- Reunion?

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,169
- You're Team Reunion.
- Yes.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,370
I'm very upset.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,000
It's just so sad.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,769
I get overly invested.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,369
(Overly invested MINGYU)

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,509
Who do you remember after Hyeon Ji's appearance?

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,839
- Baek Hyun.
- Baek Hyun?

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,139
I was curious about Won Kyu.

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,609
- Won Kyu?
- Won Kyu. I'm also curious.

20
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,949
He's a bit similar to me.

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,519
Won Kyu is my favorite.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,919
- Me too. He's my favorite.
- Isn't Won Kyu charming?

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Me too.

24
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,049
He became the funny character.

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,089
We expected that.

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,319
He has a funny vibe no matter what he does.

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,159
- Right.
- Right from the start...

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,489
- He was for Won Kyu.
- That's right. I supported him.

29
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,860
He said he was a funny person.

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,970
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

31
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,840
(Your ex did not pick you.)

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,070
There are bananas too. Would you like one?

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,540
Right. We bought bananas.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
The sliced ones are here.

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,250
Will you have some?

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,980
- No, it's fine.
- Are those...

37
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,850
Are they from the first day?

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,080
Did we get more?

39
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,690
- I didn't get more.
- Cheese.

40
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,219
- Yes. Cheese.
- Fruit cheese.

41
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,490
It's sweet.

42
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,510
(Baek Hyun's ex will be revealed now.)

43
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,280
- It's happening right away.
- MINGYU.

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,079
- This is it.
- Thank you.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,790
- But this...
- Okay!

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
- So soon?
- Like this?

47
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,689
- So soon?
- As soon as they came...

48
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,729
This is a pattern we've not seen in EXchange.

49
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,559
- From the start.
- Right.

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,999
Why is it making me nervous?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,430
I'm getting goosebumps.

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,829
(One week before moving in)

53
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,970
(Seongsu-dong)

54
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,180
(Baek Hyun is heading to the restaurant.)

55
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,089
(Baek Hyun's ex...)

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,230
(is waiting for him.)

57
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,820
Have you been well?

58
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,590
You look pretty.

59
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,360
(Baek Hyun's ex will be revealed now.)

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,709
(Baek Hyun's ex, )

61
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,650
(Hyeon Ji)

62
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,249
- Yes!
- Yes.

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,790
- That's right.
- Of course.

64
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,990
Of course.

65
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,819
He was looking at her.

66
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,919
- Yes.
- For about two seconds.

67
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,390
Hyeon Ji also scanned him.

68
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,789
They were looking at each other.

69
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,959
There is the energy level...

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,559
of the residents...

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,669
whose exes aren't around. Baek Hyun...

72
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,599
- Right.
- had that energy level.

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,169
- That's right.
- At the beginning,

74
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,399
- he was so relaxed.
- Right.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,969
It showed that his ex wasn't there.

76
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,869
- He was almost unconcerned.
- Right.

77
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,179
They're a really good-looking couple.

78
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,979
- Right.
- They really vibe well together.

79
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,249
A 185cm man and a 173cm woman. Isn't that...

80
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,679
- a scam?
- It is.

81
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,450
It needs to be stopped by law.

82
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,849
- So they can't date.
- By law.

83
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,389
It creates a sense of discomfort.

84
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,789
- Yes. It does.
- It's too...

85
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,489
I think they matched really well even personality-wise.

86
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,389
- Right.
- But Baek Hyun said...

87
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,659
- his relationship was very tough.
- Right.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,629
- Right.
- A hard time, and he didn't forget.

89
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,899
Right.

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,370
I'm curious about their story.

91
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,439
(Baek Hyun's ex, )

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,610
(Hyeon Ji)

93
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,219
- Why that look?
- What?

94
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,660
Why are you looking at me like that?

95
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,990
You look pretty.

96
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,600
My hands are sweating.

97
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,740
They're sweating? Do you want a towel?

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,240
- Do you have one?
- I have a handkerchief.

99
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,640
Really?

100
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,390
- Do you want me to lend it to you?
- Yes.

101
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,909
Why do you carry this around?

102
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,010
This...

103
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,149
- Well...
- Can I use it?

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,350
You can.

105
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,790
It's become a habit.

106
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,920
Thank you.

107
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,260
- Why?
- What?

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,570
Why?

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,370
Why are you staring at me?

111
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,680
It feels awkward.

112
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,549
I thought it wouldn't be awkward at all.

113
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,480
Then I won't look at your eyes.

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,650
I'll look at your forehead.

115
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,850
No.

116
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,190
- Is it too much?
- It is.

117
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,260
Is it?

118
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,129
- His eyes have a different look.
- They're different.

119
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,599
He still looks at her with sweet eyes.

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,499
- Totally.
- I guess he missed her.

121
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,070
Why am I nervous? This is crazy.

122
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,499
They have to get back together.

123
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,199
- Whatever happens...
- Do you want...

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,409
- everyone to get back together?
- He says that at every reveal.

125
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,546
They should all get back together.

126
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,969
Do you think that's cool?

127
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,439
Men who carry handkerchieves?

128
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,579
I think it's cool because it's a handkerchief.

129
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,749
It would be weird if he took out tissues.

130
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,049
Like this.

131
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,849
What is that? Why...

132
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,919
- Are you planning to cry?
- I carry it around.

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,849
- You'll give them to me, right?
- I might pick my nose or something.

134
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,720
- Pick your nose?
- Aren't those for me?

135
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,140
I really carry them around.

136
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,659
- They're useful.
- They are.

137
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,829
He's going to you because you're acting weird.

138
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,000
He's sniffing.

139
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,130
How does it feel to see me after a long time?

140
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,510
When time passes by, and you're in your late 20s,

141
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,439
you could have a glow-down...

142
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,880
after going through some hard times.

143
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,480
But you look the same.

144
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,220
That's nice.

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,690
Your heart isn't fluttering, right?

146
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,620
My heart flutters.

147
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,530
It's beating.

148
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
It's a relief.

149
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,770
You look pretty.

150
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,570
You wore pretty clothes too.

151
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,370
Really?

152
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,740
Seven years? You worked for seven years.

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
I joined the company...

154
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,410
- when I was dating you.
- Yes.

155
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,930
I've worked for a long time.

156
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,390
Since December 2018...

157
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,460
We were together until December 2020.

158
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,589
We met at a gathering...

159
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,300
that celebrated my joining of the company.

160
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,099
I had a male friend...

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,739
who I was in contact with.

162
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,539
He was that friend's friend.

163
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,009
I went there without even taking a shower.

164
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,339
I had just woken up.

165
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,009
I didn't even know there were going to be women.

166
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,480
I had gone there to meet my friend after a long time.

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,480
I regretted it. I should have taken a shower.

168
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,049
I didn't think about that at first.

169
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,090
Things didn't go well, and the gathering ended.

170
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,360
Hyeon Ji didn't talk to me.

171
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,660
It was very disheartening.

172
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,030
I asked my friend for her number.

173
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,400
He was shocked. "You want it?"

174
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,299
My ex was younger than me,

175
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,770
so I only saw him as a younger guy.

176
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,840
I had no feeling at first.

177
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,080
That's why I kept postponing our meetup.

178
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,649
He was persistent on deciding on a date,

179
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,989
so I thought I should just watch a movie with him.

180
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,590
So we rushed to buy tickets and watched the movie.

181
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,689
About 30 minutes after meeting up with my friends,

182
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,530
she suddenly wanted us to watch a movie.

183
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,999
I thought, "I should see her." So after 30 minutes...

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,640
after meeting up with my friends, I said,

185
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,669
"I'll buy fried chicken for you, so eat that."

186
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,269
"I have somewhere to go."

187
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,340
"I'm really sorry, but can you two eat together?"

188
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,409
They asked, "What's going on?"

189
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,010
I couldn't say I was going to meet a girl.

190
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,810
I said, "I have an urgent issue."

191
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,380
"What should I do?"

192
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
I pushed them into a chicken restaurant...

193
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,020
and went to Gangbyeon Station.

194
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,959
At first, he just felt like a young boy.

195
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,230
I didn't expect anything from him,

196
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,660
but he seemed fine.

197
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,529
We watched the movie and came out.

198
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,839
He said he would take me home since it was dangerous.

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,540
That was cute...

200
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,870
and cool. That's what I felt.

201
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,250
I think that's how we started talking a little.

202
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,349
We talked quite often after that day.

203
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,079
They were everyday talks like,

204
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,850
"Did you eat?" or "What are you doing?"

205
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,049
But starting from a point,

206
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,820
her responses came after a longer time.

207
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,090
I kept contacting her.

208
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
I said, "How would I trust you when you're going to the military?"

209
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,160
He said he'd show me.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,939
"But since I can't prove that I like you,"

211
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,710
"I'll write you a letter every day while I'm in the military."

212
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
I couldn't show her my heart.

213
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,210
Writing a letter was a tool that could express my heart.

214
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,880
I wanted to show her my true heart.

215
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,650
He wrote me a letter every day.

216
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,760
He was quite romantic.

217
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,490
- Really?
- Really?

218
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,259
- Really?
- Baek Hyun?

219
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,629
He's very romantic.

220
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,559
There's something moving...

221
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,469
- about handwritten letters.
- Yes, there is.

222
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,299
- That's right.
- I think I'd feel happy.

223
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,169
He'd have nothing to write about if he wrote every day.

224
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,669
He could have written about what he did that day like in a diary.

225
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,439
- "I did this today." - Like in a diary.

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,779
Handwritten letters are the only timeless classic.

227
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,179
- That's right.
- It's the only thing left.

228
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
It feels good when you get it.

229
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:49,249
Have you ever received a handwritten letter like that?

230
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,619
I have.

231
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,479
- That often?
- That's not easy.

232
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,049
You wrote and received as well?

233
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,619
Like an exchange diary.

234
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,489
- Like an exchange diary.
- Exchange diary.

235
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,160
It was very similar.

236
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,389
We did that...

237
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,859
when my boyfriend was in the military.

238
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,699
- Right.
- I think...

239
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,070
that would stick with her very significantly.

240
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,739
It would be significant for Baek Hyun as well.

241
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,969
Say you have someone you love,

242
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,169
and that person asks you to keep writing letters for her.

243
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,239
I can write to her every day.

244
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,639
You can? What about S.COUPS?

245
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,940
I can't write every day.

246
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,919
- You're practical.
- I can't write every day.

247
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,649
- It would be hard.
- It's not easy to write every day.

248
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,149
- You run out of words.
- Right.

249
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,519
(Did you write a reply every day?)

250
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,320
I couldn't.

251
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,359
I wrote to him a few times, but not all the time.

252
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,290
Even if I didn't send him a reply,

253
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,130
he kept sending me.

254
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,560
That was really nice.

255
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,470
If he had a chance to call someone once a day,

256
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,500
he always used that on me.

257
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,869
I was moved by that.

258
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,510
I thought he was crazy about me.

259
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,279
I want to confess to you.

260
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,519
(The day he confessed)

261
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,890
Lilies symbolize unchanging love.

262
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,560
The only thing I have...

263
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,560
is my love for you.

264
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,460
(Would you be my girlfriend?)

265
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,170
People say being in the military is really hard,

266
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,900
but I was really happy.

267
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,570
I didn't think it was tough.

268
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Your posture is really funny right now.

269
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,309
It's still funny.

270
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,450
(Baek Hyun on military leave)

271
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,049
You ate a lot.

272
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,919
(The day Hyeon Ji went to visit him in the military)

273
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,620
Why are you eating so much?

274
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,189
You're always hungry even if you eat in the military.

275
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,360
Really?

276
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,130
Since I was a soldier,

277
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,729
we dated like a regular couple.

278
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,199
We ate together, went to cafes,

279
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,630
(Han River ramyeon date)

280
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,369
or went to bookstores.

281
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,370
(Bookstore date)

282
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,370
(Lotte World date)

283
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,610
Amazing.

284
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,310
This is amazing.

285
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,249
It wasn't much,

286
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,180
but that day was the most memorable one.

287
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,580
I was happy.

288
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,620
They were babies.

289
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,819
- They look good together.
- They really look good together.

290
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,859
- They look so good together.
- Really.

291
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
They look good together.

292
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,030
We didn't use to come to Seongsu-dong...

293
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,729
so often.

294
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,830
- Us?
- Yes.

295
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,730
Not only Seongsu.

296
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,640
We didn't go anywhere...

297
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,440
because I couldn't walk.

298
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
That's true.

299
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,650
I'm sorry that we didn't get to travel abroad.

300
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,449
I know. We didn't even go to Jeju Island.

301
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,390
We never got on a plane together.

302
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,620
Where did you want to travel with me?

303
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,929
I just thought...

304
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,059
When I was younger,

305
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,059
I dreamt of traveling abroad with my boyfriend.

306
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,500
You haven't done it yet?

307
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,030
I have.

308
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,770
That's good.

309
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Same here.

310
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,080
Of course I have.

311
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,150
While serving in the army, I seriously injured my leg.

312
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,660
I had to receive a medical discharge.

313
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,389
I underwent major surgery,

314
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,690
so I couldn't walk at all.

315
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,199
He couldn't go outside...

316
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,269
when he just started a relationship with me.

317
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,629
Since he was discharged from the army,

318
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,109
his parents said, "You two can stay together at our house."

319
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,579
So I had meals with his family at their house...

320
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,779
and almost lived with them like I was a family member.

321
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,850
That remains as a very nice memory for me.

322
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,679
Spending time with him...

323
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,490
after he was injured and while he had a hard time...

324
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,490
makes me feel a tender affection.

325
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,360
After work, she visited me all the time.

326
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,160
When she didn't have enough time, she commuted from my place.

327
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,829
Even when I look back now,

328
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,640
it was the toughest time in my life.

329
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,340
While she cared for me,

330
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,970
I was greatly comforted.

331
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,479
While he was serving in the army?

332
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,339
He received a medical discharge.

333
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,749
He surely was severely injured.

334
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,849
She stayed with...

335
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,679
- Baek Hyun's family.
- That's right.

336
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,879
I thought they didn't see for a long time...

337
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
because he served in the army.

338
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:20,989
- I know.
- But that was not the case.

339
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,249
They dated even more seriously.

340
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,559
You can't forget someone who stayed by your side through tough times.

341
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
- I mean it.
- That's right.

342
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:28,089
I suppose that was huge.

343
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,929
However, from Hyeon Ji's perspective,

344
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,459
- It must've been tormenting.
- she waited for him,

345
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,259
- She waited for him.
- and then he was injured,

346
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,729
so she stayed with his parents.

347
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,730
- Right.
- Those things...

348
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,399
might not have been nice when she was dating in her early 20s.

349
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,569
That's why Baek Hyun felt very sorry...

350
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,740
- Yes.
- all along.

351
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,010
Are they doing all right?

352
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,510
Yes, they're quite well.

353
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,850
I never imagined I'd be here.

354
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,249
I know.

355
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,120
I never imagined we'd end up like this either.

356
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,229
I think it was the most passionate relationship...

357
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,629
I could have in my 20s.

358
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,670
Every moment, we argued passionately,

359
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,770
and every moment, we loved passionately.

360
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,539
He wrote letters to me...

361
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,739
and was very sweet to me.

362
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,280
However, after he was discharged from the army,

363
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,919
there were reasons I felt more disappointed.

364
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,449
He wasn't well that he couldn't go outside,

365
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,689
but I enjoyed my hobby and hung out with friends.

366
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,819
Then he couldn't get a hold of me...

367
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,789
and told me he felt upset.

368
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,599
"Why do you have to be upset about this?" When I said that,

369
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,830
we started arguing for things like that.

370
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,299
If it ended as an argument only, it would have been fine.

371
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
But as we got worked up,

372
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,310
it led to big fights.

373
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,510
I felt that we liked each other very much,

374
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,949
but when we had a conflict,

375
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,649
our solution was inadequate.

376
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,550
Therefore, one conflict led to another.

377
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,990
We fought so many times, but we couldn't let go of each other.

378
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,730
(The relationship they expected to be only happy...)

379
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,289
Every time I argued with him,

380
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,960
it was because of what we said.

381
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,430
We once argued about how to fold a towel.

382
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,640
He was folding towels so neatly.

383
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,569
"Can't I just fold it this way?" When I asked him that,

384
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,310
he said, "Folding it this way makes it look nice."

385
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,039
"Why do you have to fold it like that?"

386
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,380
That made us argue again.

387
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,980
I feel so ashamed to say this.

388
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,090
We once argued on the street.

389
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,590
It was after my leg surgery...

390
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,420
that I was on crutches.

391
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,630
It made me feel so small.

392
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,800
I had to grab a taxi to leave and all.

393
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,499
Once, I dressed up for a date...

394
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,570
and told him, "I look nice, right?"

395
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,679
Then he said, "Many people in Garosu-gil look nice."

396
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,209
So I told him, "Do you really have to say that?"

397
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,850
And then...

398
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,650
we couldn't have a date that day.

399
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,550
It was Christmas Day.

400
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,390
I was working at a company back then.

401
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,059
I planned to have a meal and go to a pub.

402
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,899
Since I wasn't familiar with the area, I looked at a map,

403
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,630
but I took the wrong way.

404
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,700
It was a cold day, so she was irritated, I guess.

405
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,770
She bluntly said, "Do you know where we're going?"

406
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,409
I felt so upset at that time.

407
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,740
So, after all, we argued at the pub.

408
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,649
My ex is very clean and neat.

409
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,220
Once, he said he'd clean my bathroom.

410
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,719
We had to go out for a date,

411
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,589
but he applied chlorine bleach...

412
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,090
and cleaned the bathroom alone.

413
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,429
I felt thankful,

414
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,799
but I wanted to go out and have a date.

415
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,229
So I told him, "Aren't you going to go outside?"

416
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,199
He went, "I'm cleaning your bathroom now."

417
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,270
He asked me what was wrong with me, so we argued again.

418
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,746
We argued even when we weren't dating.

419
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,680
I was actually so stressed out...

420
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,710
that I couldn't sleep for about four days.

421
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,450
I didn't get a wink of sleep.

422
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,079
Back then, when we argued,

423
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,720
we always got worked up,

424
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,620
and we immediately went home.

425
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,489
Since we both wanted to maintain our pride,

426
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,659
we didn't call each other for a week,

427
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,900
and every day, I cried after I went back home.

428
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,830
Then I felt...

429
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,940
that I loved him so much.

430
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,669
They were a couple who fought a lot.

431
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,809
They were too sensitive.

432
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,239
But you can't help it. Every couple argues about those things.

433
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,039
- They argue about minor things.
- That's right.

434
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,779
I think lovers need to talk especially nice to each other.

435
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,119
Right. Talking nicely is very important.

436
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,349
- That's not healthy.
- That's wrong.

437
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,689
- That's a battle of egos.
- They're incompatible...

438
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,059
if they are not speaking for a week.

439
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,719
That's a huge emotional drain.

440
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,629
Right. Not speaking to each other for a week...

441
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,630
is torturing, isn't it?

442
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:59,199
- They need to resolve it quickly.
- Right. They should do it quickly.

443
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,229
That's right.

444
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,969
Couples who argue every time they talk...

445
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,369
are probably not compatible.

446
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,509
But they don't break up either. That's the problem.

447
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,469
Some people believe that's love.

448
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,239
They confirm their love when they argue.

449
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,779
They might think that arguing...

450
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,340
- is part of love.
- Part of love, yes.

451
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,619
We repeated breaking up and reuniting over and over.

452
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,690
We did it so many times.

453
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,889
When we couldn't get through to each other while arguing,

454
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,859
we had to think about how to work it out.

455
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,919
Instead, we said, "Let's break up," and "Okay."

456
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,059
"No, we need to get back together," and "Right."

457
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,230
Both of us were like that.

458
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,659
Since we were emotionally immature,

459
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,299
when one of us suggested a breakup...

460
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,269
and the other held onto that person,

461
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,669
we thought we loved each other.

462
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,309
Although we argued,

463
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,439
I never thought...

464
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,040
that he fell out of love with me.

465
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
I guess I loved him very much.

466
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,079
As we kept arguing, I thought...

467
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,550
that I need to end this relationship at some point.

468
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,019
We were hanging on to a relationship that was on its last legs.

469
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,530
I realized that, however I tried,

470
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,260
we were not able to be in a healthy relationship.

471
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,200
That's why I decided to end it.

472
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,809
"Your relationship with me is emotionally tough..."

473
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,070
"and exhausting."

474
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,180
"I hope you find a happy relationship from now on."

475
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,479
"I wish you would meet someone better than me and date."

476
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,520
When I sent her a text saying this...

477
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,120
was when I emotionally reached my limit.

478
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,620
And I felt lonesome.

479
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,360
As I remember,

480
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,599
back then, I was hanging out with my friend,

481
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,499
and since we were arguing,

482
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,269
we were talking over text.

483
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,809
He kept calling me as I wasn't reading his texts.

484
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,479
That made me emotionally tired.

485
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,209
It was repeated so many times,

486
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,779
and I thought it was time to end it.

487
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,820
I felt so sad...

488
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,650
but I said, "It's the right thing to end this relationship."

489
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,820
What do you think it'd be like?

490
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,430
I guess you'll be very popular.

491
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,830
I mean it.

492
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,770
Maybe I'll be jealous.

493
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,730
- You?
- Yes.

494
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,309
It will be fun to go play in the water together.

495
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,669
We can enjoy water sports together,

496
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,910
riding a banana boat and all.

497
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,839
Do you want to do something...

498
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,980
- with me again?
- No.

499
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,510
No, it's not like that.

500
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,580
I mean,

501
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,450
it will be fun if we do that together.

502
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,720
I thought that it would be fun.

503
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,260
It's because I don't know who else is there.

504
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,729
- I mean, all of us together.
- All of us.

505
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,160
All of us should go together. That will be fun.

506
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,970
See you soon.

507
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,070
- All right.
- Yes.

508
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,240
- Here.
- Okay.

509
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,650
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

510
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,820
You can make a mobile payment.

511
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,790
Take care and stay healthy.

512
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,320
I'll see you again.

513
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,690
See you then.

514
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,269
I didn't think about this back then.

515
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,440
Looking back now, I think...

516
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,870
that I could have talked more nicely.

517
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,439
If I had appreciated what he did for me...

518
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,910
and understood him more,

519
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,309
we would have argued less and had a better relationship.

520
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,520
Now I think so.

521
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,889
It's true that she's the one I loved the most in my life.

522
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,190
I never loved anyone like I loved her.

523
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,360
It was a relationship I regret the most...

524
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,800
among all my relationships.

525
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,899
People often think like this.

526
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,299
"If I met that person after I got older,"

527
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,839
- "I would have been different." - Right.

528
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,569
"I was too young." You feel this for some relationships.

529
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,609
We all did that...

530
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,639
- when we were young and immature.
- That's right.

531
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,239
- Have you done that?
- What?

532
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,626
Haven't you been in such a relationship?

533
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,210
Are we going to dig each other's grave?

534
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,620
- Two of you can go ahead.
- Yes.

535
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,190
I don't remember anything.

536
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,689
I've once thought like this.

537
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,260
"Why didn't I take her side on that matter back then?"

538
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,299
Now, the same situation wouldn't upset me at all.

539
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,499
Back then, why did I get upset about such a trivial thing?

540
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
I think about these things.

541
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,629
It's because we were younger.

542
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,069
- We were younger.
- It's because we were immature.

543
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,769
- Right.
- We didn't know how to handle it.

544
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,339
I think it was the same with Hyeon Ji and Baek Hyun.

545
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,079
You need to feel that at that time...

546
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,179
- So that you won't do that later.
- Exactly.

547
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,449
- You grow up...
- Right.

548
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,579
- and think about not doing it.
- Exactly.

549
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,149
It's only possible when you're young.

550
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,949
- At such a young age.
- Only at such a young age.

551
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,149
I think they were...

552
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,750
- in a passionate relationship.
- Right.

553
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,070
(Before moving in, time room)

554
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:15,180
(Time to express true feelings before moving in)

555
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,460
(Brown represents reunion, and stripes a new relationship.)

556
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,980
I wasn't sure about my feelings.

557
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,320
So I made it exactly half and half.

558
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,060
I really don't know.

559
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,930
I want to meet someone new. That's how I feel.

560
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,270
So I dialed it to all stripes, meaning no lingering feelings.

561
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,180
From now on, if someone asks me...

562
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,270
to be in such an emotionally tiring relationship,

563
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,650
I won't be able to, even if I could get a vast fortune.

564
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,490
(12 o'clock for Baek Hyun, 6 o'clock for Hyeon Ji)

565
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,730
(Baek Hyun doesn't want to reunite, and Hyeon Ji is on the fence.)

566
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,659
- What?
- Are you serious?

567
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,900
- What?
- Is it 12 o'clock?

568
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,529
Does he have no intention to reunite?

569
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,599
Everyone thought he was more interested in...

570
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,199
- reuniting with his ex.
- He had that mood.

571
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,499
I didn't see that coming.

572
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,869
It was so unexpected.

573
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,209
Perhaps he doesn't want to repeat his past mistake.

574
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,039
- He thinks it'll happen again.
- They fought too many times.

575
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,579
You know, couples who break up because of such reasons...

576
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,809
reunite and break up again...

577
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,279
- because of the same reasons.
- That's right.

578
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,879
They broke up and got back together multiple times,

579
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,779
so he probably doesn't even want to talk to her.

580
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,850
Even if you begin with that mindset,

581
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,089
- anything can happen.
- That's right.

582
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,759
- You never know.
- They don't know how they feel.

583
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,089
I think he'll get very jealous.

584
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,359
- He'll get very jealous.
- He seems like the jealous type.

585
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,889
He seems like the jealous type. His eyes seemed to say,

586
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,060
"Go ahead and do your best."

587
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,970
Back then, there was a big emotional rift between us.

588
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,440
To be honest, I couldn't let go.

589
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,670
It has been five years since we broke up.

590
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,710
Time did heal.

591
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,250
(Baek Hyun and Hyeon Ji, December 2018 to December 2020)

592
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,920
(The first day of moving in)

593
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,590
Is everyone here?

594
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,720
She didn't enter.

595
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,420
Since my ex isn't here,

596
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,730
I can be comfortable. But once my ex comes,

597
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,600
I might become a bit apprehensive.

598
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,330
I really hope my ex comes late.

599
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,200
(And today)

600
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,940
Hello.

601
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,109
- She came.
- It really was someone new.

602
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,610
- My goodness.
- It's this way.

603
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

604
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,190
My ex stayed very calm...

605
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,240
and did a good job of pretending not to know me.

606
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,800
(The two of them face each other once again.)

607
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,680
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

608
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,690
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

609
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,690
(Park Ji Hyeon)

610
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,519
(Kim Woo Jin)

611
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,289
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

612
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,189
(Jung Won Kyu)

613
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,890
(Hong Ji Yeon)

614
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,910
(EXchange 4)

615
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,750
(Episode 5: Restless Night)

616
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,850
(The balance game continues.)

617
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,890
(Won Kyu asks Yun Nyeong a question.)

618
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,629
Dates where you always eat spicy food...

619
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,630
versus dates where you always eat sweet food.

620
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,930
Isn't it obvious?

621
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,239
- What's your answer?
- Sweet food?

622
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Yes!

623
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,710
That's right. It's pretty obvious.

624
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,260
(Hyeon Ji gets a question.)

625
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,029
An overly emotional lover...

626
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,860
versus an overly realistic lover.

627
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,799
(The biggest reason behind their breakup)

628
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,270
The two opposites.

629
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,509
- It's a good question.
- That's...

630
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,610
- The reason behind the split.
- That's the reason.

631
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,820
I think a realistic lover is better.

632
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,550
Right.

633
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,150
- What was your answer?
- A realistic lover.

634
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,390
That's better?

635
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,560
(He thinks about the meaning of Hyeon Ji's answer.)

636
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,670
Well,

637
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,010
I think I should give this to a man.

638
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,580
- Me?
- Yes.

639
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,470
It's my first time receiving one.

640
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,200
Your lover drinks with her ex until 2am...

641
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,099
versus your lover goes to a cafe with a friend...

642
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,870
of the opposite sex at night.

643
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,269
He is someone who can't allow either one.

644
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,840
I know. I should get rid of both.

645
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,340
Seriously.

646
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,610
Here.

647
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,210
Did you pick one for him?

648
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,879
How sweet.

649
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,490
(The person Baek Hyun is curious about)

650
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,260
(Baek Hyun chooses Yun Nyeong.)

651
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,459
A person who is professional at his job...

652
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,270
versus a person who puts love before work.

653
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,840
A person who is professional at his job all the way.

654
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,840
(Is there someone your ex is interested in?)

655
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,640
Yes, it's Yun Nyeong.

656
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,940
Across from me...

657
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,210
were my ex and Yun Nyeong.

658
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,980
The two of them were very affectionate.

659
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,419
They became absorbed in...

660
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,690
their own conversation.

661
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,230
They talked by themselves.

662
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,069
Seeing them do that right before my eyes...

663
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,740
put me in a bad mood.

664
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,080
Totally. Yes.

665
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,379
- Really? Since then?
- Yes.

666
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,680
(Her ex's affection is directed at another person.)

667
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,059
He felt it.

668
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,529
I guess it's obvious.

669
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,829
Does he really not care?

670
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,129
- Wouldn't he begin caring now?
- Right.

671
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,229
When he didn't hear her,

672
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,230
- he went, "What was your answer?" - That's right.

673
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,669
- That's right.
- He hid his face.

674
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,729
- He continued to do this.
- Seriously.

675
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,639
Maybe he's annoyed.

676
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,809
- That's right.
- Like the time they fought...

677
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,209
Maybe he's doing this because he's annoyed.

678
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,069
- "Is that a jab at me?" - That's right.

679
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,409
- That's so...
- Since Hyeon Ji is right there,

680
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,409
- He might be doing it on purpose.
- he's being affectionate...

681
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,049
- with Yun Nyeong on purpose.
- That might be the case.

682
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,979
It looks like Hyeon Ji is more hung up on him.

683
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,750
MINGYU and S.COUPS,

684
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,749
are you guys emotional or realistic?

685
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,889
- I'm emotional.
- I'm emotional too.

686
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,829
Out of 13 members in the team, only 1 is a thinker.

687
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,459
- Only 1.
- Only 1 is a thinker?

688
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,489
Only one. Everyone else is a feeler.

689
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,729
- Out of 13 members?
- Yes.

690
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,429
- How did that happen?
- Isn't it fascinating?

691
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,929
When do you become emotional?

692
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,269
- I think I'm always emotional.
- Always?

693
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,839
I don't think love itself is realistic.

694
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,769
That's what I think.

695
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,009
- Love itself isn't realistic.
- It isn't realistic.

696
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,980
- That's a cool saying.
- It was nice.

697
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,109
It hit me hard.

698
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,480
To be honest, I'm emotional about the things I like...

699
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,349
and realistic about the things I don't like.

700
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,720
- That's...
- You're realistic about work.

701
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,089
- Having a balance is nice.
- That's right.

702
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,660
Someone who is overly emotional or overly realistic is too much.

703
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,600
I'm going to retire to my room.

704
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,359
- I came here after work, so...
- Then...

705
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,430
Good night.

706
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,070
- See you upstairs.
- Okay.

707
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,340
Do you have pajamas?

708
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,210
- Pajamas.
- Do you want to use mine?

709
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,710
- Good night.
- Bye.

710
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,079
I should clean this up, right?

711
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,049
- Leave it. We'll do it.
- We'll clean it up.

712
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,319
- No.
- No.

713
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,620
- No.
- Leave it.

714
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,860
I know my ex's job.

715
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,160
She looked very tired,

716
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,770
so I was worried. I didn't think that I'd get worried.

717
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,210
It felt very strange.

718
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,280
It felt very strange.

719
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,350
I could be comfortable when my ex wasn't around.

720
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,150
I began worrying about her the moment she walked in.

721
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,130
Do you want to use these slippers?

722
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,730
It's okay.

723
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,070
Use these slippers.

724
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,670
Use these slippers.

725
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,169
"It's okay."

726
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,579
- She used a casual tone, right?
- Yes.

727
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,479
- "It's okay." - "It's okay" is so funny.

728
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,080
- They can't act.
- No.

729
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,180
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

730
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,820
(Yoo Sik is busy looking for slippers.)

731
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,720
Your feet will get cold.

732
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,530
The floor is cold.

733
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,630
What?

734
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,530
(She's scared of getting caught because of Baek Hyun's words.)

735
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,769
- Seriously, please put them on.
- It's okay. They'll bring them.

736
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,339
- Please put them on.
- They'll bring them.

737
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Please. I'm really okay.

738
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,509
- I'll wear the new ones.
- I don't need them.

739
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,910
This won't do.

740
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,640
- Seriously.
- I'll go barefoot.

741
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,950
I'll go barefoot. For goodness' sake.

742
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,220
Please put one on.

743
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,050
Okay. Let's put one on each.

744
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,320
Hold on.

745
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,919
- Hold on.
- What?

746
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Okay.

747
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,060
Left foot.

748
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,690
One, two.

749
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,759
We put on slippers, so we're fine.

750
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,800
We're fine.

751
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,770
Oh, no. They'll bring slippers.

752
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,899
- All right.
- They'll bring slippers.

753
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,010
Let's put one on each.

754
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,580
I thought...

755
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,480
he'd struggle to adjust.

756
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,550
But he had become best friends with Yoo Sik.

757
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,690
It was unexpected.

758
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,219
You can put it there.

759
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,530
- I'm going to take some water.
- Okay.

760
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,700
- I have something to ask.
- Yes?

761
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,470
Well...

762
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,439
(Baek Hyun's entrance cuts off the conversation.)

763
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,570
- Please hold on.
- Okay.

764
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,110
Excuse me.

765
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,590
(Baek Hyun lingers by Hyeon Ji's side.)

766
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,949
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

767
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,959
(They see each other's reflection in the mirror.)

768
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,460
I got this one.

769
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,960
Put it here.

770
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,129
Baek Hyun doesn't know that they had a date.

771
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,529
He doesn't know. No one knows.

772
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,069
But he expected Yoo Sik to be Hyeon Ji's ideal type,

773
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,440
- so he's worried.
- Yes.

774
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,450
- Can we...
- What?

775
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,320
Can we talk for a second?

776
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,390
Okay.

777
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,960
(She asked Yoo Sik for a talk after much struggle.)

778
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,590
Come and see me for a second afterward.

779
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,670
It's so funny that there are no slippers.

780
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,609
Let me get my phone.

781
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,840
(Yoo Sik leaves naturally.)

782
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,410
(Yoo Sik heads straight to the front door.)

783
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:09,390
(He gets slippers for Hyeon Ji.)

784
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,620
- I...
- Yes?

785
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,640
These...

786
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,370
- Hold on. Give me these.
- Okay.

787
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,339
(They get the slippers back.)

788
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,209
But... Never mind.

789
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,780
Why are these so wet?

790
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,620
Hold on.

791
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,820
- What?
- I'm sorry.

792
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,970
(He makes Hyeon Ji laugh before going into the room.)

793
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,790
It's because I washed my feet.

794
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,290
Is that so? I see. I'm sorry.

795
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,870
When can we talk?

796
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,770
Shall we go to the terrace? The terrace is over there.

797
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Shall we go downstairs?

798
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,950
(Baek Hyun follows them again.)

799
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,360
Hold on.

800
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,430
(Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji go separate ways.)

801
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,100
(There's a strange air in the house.)

802
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,109
- Why does he keep following them?
- Hold on.

803
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,580
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

804
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,849
- What's wrong with him?
- Is he a surveillance camera?

805
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,179
He said the clock was at 12 o'clock.

806
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,319
Don't mind him!

807
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,349
And why is even Hyeon Ji walking on eggshells?

808
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,720
Can't she just go?

809
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,800
(Changing direction to the 4th floor where Hyeon Ji went)

810
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,800
2am.

811
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,900
What? 2am?

812
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,209
Outside.

813
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,769
- Where was my phone again?
- Over there.

814
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,010
(They successfully make plans.)

815
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,390
When my ex came, Yoo Sik...

816
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,260
took great care of her.

817
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,700
He even carried her luggage...

818
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,400
and brought her slippers.

819
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,500
But to think Yoo Sik would go that far.

820
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,909
Even the things I thought I would take care of,

821
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,579
he was already on top of them.

822
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,880
Watching Yoo Sik look after her,

823
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,319
I began to wonder...

824
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,489
(Yoo Sik might have...)

825
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,119
if he might have feelings for my ex.

826
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,790
(feelings for my ex.)

827
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,590
I seriously thought it wouldn't affect me.

828
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,870
But seeing that scene with my own eyes,

829
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,330
experiencing those moments firsthand,

830
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,570
I felt a mix of emotions.

831
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,339
My feelings were in a whirlpool,

832
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,279
impossible to put into words.

833
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,079
Even though...

834
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,480
I want to explain them,

835
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,259
these feelings were unlike anything I had felt before.

836
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,129
(He's confused by these new feelings.)

837
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,260
I really don't understand.

838
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,300
Next time.

839
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,000
Don't do it.

840
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,869
(Baek Hyun, who is usually calm, breaks a plate.)

841
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,170
Hold on. I will...

842
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,610
Wait.

843
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,579
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

844
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,540
Oh, no. Don't use your bare hands.

845
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,010
What about my bare feet?

846
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,349
(Covering the embarrassing moment with a joke)

847
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,150
- You're not hurt, right?
- No.

848
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,749
- We have a broom.
- Don't use your hands.

849
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,190
- There should be a broom.
- Stop.

850
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,359
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

851
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,330
Really, this is why I need to stay focused.

852
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,590
Thanks.

853
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,100
I can't see the pieces. This is bad.

854
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,360
Where do I leave this again?

855
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,070
(Leaving the kitchen after studying Baek Hyun's face.)

856
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,580
(For some reason, Baek Hyun can't seem to leave the kitchen today.)

857
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,680
Shall we go outside?

858
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,690
- Won't you be cold?
- No, I'm fine.

859
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,160
- About our date.
- Yes?

860
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,290
I'm going to tell the others.

861
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,030
When should we do that?

862
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,500
Do it after you get used to things and feel comfortable.

863
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,800
Right.

864
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,870
How long will it take for you to adjust?

865
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,840
"Adjust?"

866
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,409
- I don't know.
- But isn't everyone nice?

867
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,080
Yes, for real.

868
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,050
Okay, I'll just tell everyone...

869
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,250
that I knew you were joining us that day.

870
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,890
That's the most natural way.

871
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,030
Tell me when you think it's okay for me to tell the others.

872
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,570
I'm fine with any time.

873
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,539
Have you already adjusted?

874
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,870
Not really.

875
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,469
- You must be tired.
- Yes. I'm drained.

876
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,040
That's why I couldn't focus on...

877
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,010
what the others were saying.

878
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,680
So you're tired, right?

879
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,980
Everyone is going to hang out downstairs.

880
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,919
Are they going to hang out more?

881
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,260
Did you stop by the living room on the first floor?

882
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,289
- There's one downstairs.
- The living room downstairs?

883
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,329
The small one.

884
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,060
Is everyone going to hang out there?

885
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,900
I think they already are.

886
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,370
But I haven't showered yet.

887
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,969
I want to take a shower. You will too, right?

888
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,000
Yes.

889
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,469
- Are you exhausted?
- Sorry?

890
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,810
If you are, go to bed early today.

891
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,480
Got it.

892
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
You must be cold.

893
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,420
You first.

894
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,190
Go in first. I'm going to stay outside for a bit.

895
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,059
Gosh, quite a handful of people...

896
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,689
will get shocked if they hear about it.

897
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,959
- For real.
- Ji Hyeon, Min Kyung,

898
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,330
Baek Hyun,

899
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,969
- and who else?
- It'll go wild.

900
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,840
Many of them will get shocked.

901
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,399
Two more glasses will break.

902
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,639
(At least 2 more glasses will break.)

903
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,909
That conversation just now was heart-fluttering.

904
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,309
- Same here.
- Right?

905
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,209
It seems like everyone is open about...

906
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,620
sharing their dates.

907
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,089
And I feel like the residents are already quite close...

908
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,460
- Yes.
- to each other.

909
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,059
(After escorting Hyeon Ji inside, )

910
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,960
(Yoo Sik heads to the outdoor yard.)

911
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,870
(He looks inside the house from the outside.)

912
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,780
(She stops.)

913
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,890
(He can't help but smile at Hyeon Ji's sight.)

914
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,390
(He spots Hyeon Ji's reflection in the mirror.)

915
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,500
(And Yoo Sik returns right after.)

916
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,400
- What is it?
- Still...

917
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,570
What's wrong?

918
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,870
No, it's nothing.

919
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,650
Are we leaving the plates here?

920
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,310
Should we put them back?

921
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:25,779
There aren't any places to put them.

922
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,849
(The house feels different today.)

923
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,180
Where were they originally?

924
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,290
I'm really upset today.

925
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,490
How come?

926
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,060
Because of your ex?

927
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,770
- Or because of the new girl?
- I don't know. It's everything.

928
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,100
So when I was washing my face earlier...

929
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,430
Did you cry?

930
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,030
No, I didn't cry.

931
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,030
But you suddenly got upset?

932
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,440
Yes.

933
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,340
Today again...

934
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,679
- You felt something different?
- I feel like...

935
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,880
I have three hearts right now.

936
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,250
Why?

937
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,920
My ex, the new girl, and the new girl's ex.

938
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,840
- Those three...
- Do you have an idea who the ex is?

939
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,520
- Yes.
- You do?

940
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,259
I've constantly been making guesses.

941
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,060
When it comes to me,

942
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,630
- I don't make guesses.
- Mine are quite logical.

943
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,569
Honestly, I don't want to make guesses.

944
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,599
But you just do, right?

945
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,070
- I don't, but it's obvious.
- But...

946
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,669
- No.
- You have a bad hunch.

947
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,739
(Ji Hyeon thinks Yoo Sik's ex is Hyeon Ji.)

948
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,909
- Ji Hyeon has a bad hunch.
- Just don't.

949
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,679
Yoo Sik rushed out...

950
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,209
- when Hyeon Ji arrived.
- True.

951
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,079
That must be where her guess comes from.

952
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Since they went on a date,

953
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,179
- Yes, the date.
- it's natural to be suspicious.

954
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
Exactly.

955
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,250
Me too.

956
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,719
The ex of the guy I'm interested in...

957
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,929
I don't care about the other exes.

958
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,529
- I'm not even making any guesses.
- Same.

959
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,500
- I don't even try to guess.
- I don't either.

960
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,470
- But I can tell who she is.
- Me too.

961
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:51,770
Really?

962
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,400
I can kind of guess who his ex is.

963
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:59,810
But I'm trying my best not to let it bother me.

964
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,909
I don't care about my ex either.

965
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,250
The only person I care about is my new guy.

966
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,989
Say that things work out for your ex.

967
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,649
I'd rather like that.

968
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,720
I hope that happens.

969
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,059
Do you think you won't feel anything?

970
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,389
I used up all my emotions...

971
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,399
while dating my ex.

972
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,170
Rather than using them all up,

973
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,700
I believe...

974
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,810
there's no getting back together after breaking up.

975
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,179
That's why I do a lot of thinking...

976
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,210
before breaking up.

977
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,810
I call it the end.

978
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,380
That's why getting back together with my ex...

979
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,990
isn't one of...

980
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,720
- Your options?
- my options.

981
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,759
I'm worried about that too.

982
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,359
I have feelings for someone new,

983
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,060
but his ex is right here with us.

984
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,000
She's watching everything.

985
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,770
I feel bad about that.

986
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,039
I'm going to put in all my effort not to let it...

987
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,970
- bother me.
- That's the right thing to do.

988
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,010
I'll only focus on my own feelings.

989
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,479
- I may...
- You'll be loyal to your feelings?

990
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,079
I may sound selfish.

991
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,349
- No.
- But I'm here to stay true...

992
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,689
to my feelings.

993
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,760
I see.

994
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,430
I'll leave after expressing everything without any regrets.

995
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,700
That way, you won't have any regrets.

996
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:35,500
(There's no time to hide my feelings.)

997
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,269
(Baek Hyun made the kitchen squeaky clean.)

998
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,340
This is wild.

999
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,280
The kitchen is finally on par with the house's class.

1000
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,580
How do you feel about a messy girl?

1001
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,479
- What?
- Someone who is bad at cleaning...

1002
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,950
and is dirty.

1003
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,060
- What is it that's dirty?
- Her house.

1004
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,519
- What?
- Her house.

1005
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,520
Her house?

1006
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,489
A girl who doesn't organize things?

1007
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:58,660
How bad?

1008
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,900
You can see collected dust.

1009
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,429
Collected dust?

1010
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,930
She's just that filthy.

1011
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,600
I personally like cleaning.

1012
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,010
As long as...

1013
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,680
she doesn't live with cockroaches.

1014
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,610
- Can you clean for her every day?
- Clean for her?

1015
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,949
Either way, I clean my house every day.

1016
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,250
Can you even marry her?

1017
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,090
Only dating?

1018
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,759
- Is there more to do?
- No, we're done.

1019
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,960
What do you think? It's a masterpiece by us three.

1020
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,160
You didn't even look.

1021
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,130
How tense was he to ask such a question?

1022
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,799
Things look good between Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji.

1023
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,269
He practically became...

1024
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,739
- best friends with Yoo Sik...
- Right.

1025
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,509
And felt like he could trust him.

1026
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,109
But he still hates the idea, even if he's a friend.

1027
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,709
Of course, once you actually see it.

1028
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,179
It's annoying once you see it upfront.

1029
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,949
Baek Hyun is currently 12 o'clock, right?

1030
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,809
- His time will tick, right?
- It's already ticking for sure.

1031
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,849
- For sure.
- Yes.

1032
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,879
- Trust me.
- It'll tick.

1033
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,880
- There's no way it won't.
- Exactly.

1034
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,589
It'll go from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock.

1035
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,989
12 o'clock to another 12 o'clock?

1036
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,619
- From 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
- A new 12 o'clock.

1037
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,890
- To a new 12 o'clock.
- Oh, my gosh.

1038
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,630
- Is everyone sleeping upstairs?
- Yes.

1039
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,400
Is there any beer left?

1040
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,469
There isn't one.

1041
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,800
- Really?
- Let's share.

1042
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,740
(Yoo Sik goes to find beer.)

1043
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,740
- Yoo Sik.
- My hands are sweaty.

1044
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,940
Yoo Sik, you won't find any beers.

1045
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,139
I'm sure I took the last one.

1046
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,739
Can't you bring us a bottle of wine?

1047
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,079
We should take a bottle of wine with us.

1048
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,249
- What wine? We only have big beers.
- I'll share my beer.

1049
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,720
- We do?
- Big ones.

1050
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,790
Let's go with red wine. I want red wine.

1051
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,519
I'll get the wine opener.

1052
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,789
Where did I leave it again?

1053
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,819
I left it in here. Right here.

1054
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,260
(Ji Yeon goes downstairs first.)

1055
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,300
(Knocking)

1056
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
Yes?

1057
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,870
Yes?

1058
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,740
Are you going to sleep?

1059
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,079
- Has everyone gathered?
- Yes.

1060
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,209
- Really?
- Yes.

1061
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,640
They're all gathered downstairs.

1062
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,810
Are you going to sleep?

1063
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,520
- Sleep.
- I was contemplating.

1064
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,320
- To come upstairs or not?
- Yes. Aren't you tired?

1065
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,919
I bet you're tired.

1066
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,489
- I'm tired.
- Right?

1067
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,530
Yes.

1068
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,630
I left early...

1069
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,900
- and...
- You came...

1070
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,800
when I was just about to leave for bowling.

1071
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,739
I had to leave.

1072
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,840
(The two couldn't see each other the whole day.)

1073
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,340
Are you excited to hang out with me?

1074
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,039
(Ji Yeon asked Won Kyu out on a date.)

1075
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,680
- You see, - Yes?

1076
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,620
I know all the guys are really nice and I want to get to know them.

1077
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,350
But right now,

1078
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,359
I want to get to know you the most.

1079
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,790
- I see.
- That's why...

1080
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,089
I thought long and hard about whether I should ask you...

1081
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,930
out on a date today.

1082
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,029
After all,

1083
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,130
you need to get to know others too.

1084
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,269
Going on a date...

1085
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:58,169
on both the 1st and 2nd day felt kind of wrong.

1086
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,680
- Right, and...
- Yes.

1087
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,309
- It's only the beginning.
- Exactly.

1088
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:05,049
I thought a lot about whether to talk to you...

1089
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,480
or not.

1090
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,080
How shall I put it?

1091
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,059
I was wondering if it was okay to ask you out.

1092
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,620
I have the most fun with you.

1093
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,190
- Really?
- Yes.

1094
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,829
- His heart must flutter.
- Seriously.

1095
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,260
- Gosh.
- That voice.

1096
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,199
I bet she acts cute very often.

1097
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,999
- Definitely.
- That's incredible.

1098
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,140
- She's definitely an MZer.
- Right.

1099
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,709
I'm afraid that I was thinking...

1100
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,170
about my own feelings without considering yours.

1101
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,180
I would like...

1102
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,880
to get to know everyone.

1103
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,450
Get to know everyone first.

1104
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,720
That's what I'd like for you.

1105
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,730
You should also get to know everyone.

1106
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,430
I'm also trying to get to know everyone.

1107
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,230
That's what I'm doing,

1108
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,039
but we spent time with each other today.

1109
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,070
Tomorrow...

1110
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,980
Anyway, I have the most fun with you.

1111
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,040
Really? That's fascinating.

1112
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,180
I bet you have the most fun with me.

1113
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,990
- Once you get to know everyone, - Yes.

1114
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,420
This is what you'll think.

1115
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,820
"I had the most fun with Ji Yeon."

1116
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,130
- Really?
- Yes.

1117
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,159
- You're so confident.
- That's what you'll think.

1118
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,570
So go ahead and spend time with everyone else.

1119
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,870
After that, come to me.

1120
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,040
- Okay.
- Yes.

1121
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,410
Let's hang out tomorrow.

1122
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,889
As time passes by,

1123
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,859
I'm not interested in others' occupation or age.

1124
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,830
I wasn't interested from the start. It doesn't matter to me.

1125
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,730
Are they important?

1126
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,380
What's important is that I like the person.

1127
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,830
However, when we play games,

1128
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,570
I don't want my friend to peel shrimp for my girlfriend.

1129
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,040
Wouldn't that be crossing the line?

1130
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,480
When that happens, I don't say anything to my girlfriend.

1131
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,580
I go up to my friend and say,

1132
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,520
"Let me have a word with you."

1133
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,790
- That's scary.
- "Let me have a word with you."

1134
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,290
Do all of you get jealous easily?

1135
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,930
I don't think so.

1136
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,970
Jealous? You don't get jealous?

1137
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,170
I don't get jealous very easily.

1138
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,439
It's not that I get jealous.

1139
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,640
In a romantic relationship,

1140
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,480
there should be respect between us.

1141
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,279
Let's say that my friend peeled shrimp for her.

1142
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,820
That could happen.

1143
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,390
My girlfriend should refuse it.

1144
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,620
If she thanks him and accepts it,

1145
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,760
it wouldn't make me jealous but angry.

1146
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,060
That's not right.

1147
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,670
I don't think I get jealous,

1148
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,100
but I trust her completely.

1149
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,070
I trust her 100 percent.

1150
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,740
When she breaks that trust,

1151
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,280
the trust gets broken.

1152
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,910
There won't be any respect between us.

1153
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,420
When I was a child, I got jealous easily.

1154
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,620
I became jealous very easily.

1155
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:34,120
As I grew up and became an adult,

1156
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,130
I became very flexible.

1157
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,329
When did you have your first relationship?

1158
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,759
My first relationship? What do you mean by relationship?

1159
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,100
- I mean...
- My first love?

1160
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,146
- The definition of 1st love...
- It's unclear what 1st love is.

1161
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,939
When you hear the word "first love,"

1162
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,970
don't you think of someone?

1163
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,009
Someone for whom you wanted to risk everything.

1164
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,279
You wanted to dedicate everything to her.

1165
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,280
Someone who made you think...

1166
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,950
that you wanted to live for her.

1167
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,790
Is there someone?

1168
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,630
- The definition? First love?
- My first love?

1169
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,240
There is someone like that.

1170
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,269
Isn't it someone you'd do anything...

1171
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,070
to protect no matter what it takes?

1172
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,700
Is that what you consider your first love?

1173
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:27,010
It could be the first person whom you wanted to protect.

1174
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,420
I want to fall madly in love once again.

1175
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,050
When were you madly in love?

1176
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,860
It's been a long time.

1177
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,630
It's been a long time?

1178
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,760
I wasn't in a relationship for a long time.

1179
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,800
Really?

1180
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,839
(Can you fall in love again with someone you really want to protect?)

1181
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,339
There has been some subtle tension.

1182
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,979
- Baek Hyun is...
- He was relaxed for the two days,

1183
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,849
- but he's no longer relaxed.
- Right.

1184
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,179
He's not relaxed at all.

1185
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,819
After breaking a plate,

1186
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,819
- he seems very nervous right now.
- Right.

1187
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,449
For both Baek Hyun and Yoo Sik, wasn't their ex their first love?

1188
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,089
- I think so.
- Right.

1189
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,219
I think so too.

1190
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,789
What is the definition of first love for you?

1191
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,700
The person you think of when you hear the word "first love."

1192
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,030
Is there someone you think of?

1193
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,000
I have someone too.

1194
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,900
- Do you?
- What's wrong with you today?

1195
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,139
"What's wrong with you today?"

1196
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,669
There could be first love for everyone.

1197
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,670
Of course.

1198
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,320
(Hyeon Ji came to the 3rd floor dining room with the first aid kit.)

1199
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,759
While opening lotion that I bought recently, I cut my hand.

1200
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,670
I needed a Band-Aid, so I came down to the third floor.

1201
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:02,770
Then I heard people talking.

1202
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,939
When I heard the voice of my ex,

1203
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,910
it bothered me.

1204
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,949
So I thought, "Should I get ready..."

1205
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:20,220
"and go downstairs?" But I couldn't go downstairs.

1206
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:26,400
I just decided to go to bed, and I closed my eyes.

1207
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,310
However, I couldn't fall asleep.

1208
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,019
(Her first night after moving in, which was unfamiliar)

1209
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:54,590
(Hyeon Ji tossed and turned a lot before falling asleep.)

1210
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,430
Why are you staying up so late today?

1211
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,400
I don't know. I don't feel sleepy today.

1212
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,330
What time do you usually go to bed?

1213
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,999
I usually go to bed around this time.

1214
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,569
You usually go to bed around this time?

1215
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,569
- Me too.
- Seriously?

1216
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,986
Usually, I go to bed earlier than now.

1217
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,010
Really?

1218
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,680
Doesn't your ex bother you?

1219
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,950
- I don't care.
- Really?

1220
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,720
You don't care about your ex?

1221
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,990
I really don't care.

1222
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,490
Gosh.

1223
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,290
I'm more important than my ex.

1224
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,499
I don't care even if my ex doesn't choose me.

1225
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,070
What's important is the person I want to be with.

1226
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,969
Let's say that things are going well...

1227
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,040
between your ex and someone else.

1228
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,510
- I support it.
- Really?

1229
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,040
I'd like her to support me as well.

1230
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,280
I will go my way.

1231
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,589
- I...
- You will go your way?

1232
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,590
You go your way.

1233
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:01,590
Here is one thing.

1234
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,490
If I cry at this place,

1235
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,460
I wouldn't be able to bear it.

1236
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,270
That would be when I should go home.

1237
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:17,210
None of this would matter. I wouldn't be able to handle it.

1238
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,910
I don't know because I haven't experienced it yet.

1239
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:26,990
All of a sudden, I feel stressed out.

1240
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:32,020
(Th night deepens with a restless heart.)

1241
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:33,930
Didn't you say that you were sleepy?

1242
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,760
I don't feel sleepy anymore.

1243
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,750
Are you going to stay awake?

1244
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,370
I'm going to bed first.

1245
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,240
- What time is it now? It's 5:20am.
- Is it 5:20am?

1246
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,840
See you later.

1247
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,809
- Good night.
- Okay.

1248
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,610
- Good night? Good morning.
- Good night?

1249
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,680
Will you be okay tomorrow?

1250
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,080
- What?
- Will you be okay?

1251
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,719
I should go to bed soon...

1252
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,190
for tomorrow.

1253
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,690
Right.

1254
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,530
- Are you going to bed?
- Yes.

1255
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,729
Sleep well.

1256
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,259
- Sleep well.
- Have a good night.

1257
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,500
(The party is over downstairs.)

1258
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,770
(Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room on the 4th floor)

1259
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:35,519
(From the closet, )

1260
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,990
(he took out the introduction from his ex.)

1261
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:00,710
(However, it's hard for him to read it.)

1262
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,839
There was a feeling inside me...

1263
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,810
that I couldn't put into words.

1264
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,580
I didn't want anyone to find out about it.

1265
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,850
And so...

1266
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,590
I waited for everyone to fall asleep.

1267
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,000
- He's crying.
- Is he crying?

1268
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,529
Oh, no.

1269
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,700
Goodness.

1270
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,999
- I feel bad for him.
- He's not stopping.

1271
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,669
- I feel really bad for him.
- He must feel so frustrated.

1272
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,840
It's hard to describe how he feels.

1273
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,349
If he's having such a hard time, why does he hide it?

1274
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,849
What he thinks is different from how he feels.

1275
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,019
Logically, he knows what to do,

1276
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,690
- He can't do it.
- but he can't do it.

1277
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:27,559
- It must be so frustrating.
- It's impossible.

1278
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,790
He still likes her, but he knows that he shouldn't.

1279
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,029
The ones who try to be strong are often the weakest...

1280
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,500
- Right.
- when they break down.

1281
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,009
(When my ex falls in love, he doesn't calculate...)

1282
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,809
(and generously give everything that he has.)

1283
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,120
(He treated me as someone precious and special.)

1284
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:07,599
(Hyeon Ji's introduction of him)

1285
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,130
(He faces who he was back then.)

1286
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,750
It was a weird feeling.

1287
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,690
I saw Yoo Sik taking care of my ex.

1288
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,930
There were some things I said to Yoo Sik.

1289
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:40,330
Because I meant everything I said, I wanted to keep my word.

1290
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,460
But despite everything I said,

1291
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,000
I felt conflicted.

1292
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,640
When I actually saw her interact with another guy,

1293
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,580
I couldn't...

1294
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,880
support her wholeheartedly. So...

1295
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:11,029
(A swirl of tangled emotions...)

1296
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:16,060
(spills out as tears.)

1297
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,670
This is crazy.

1298
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,060
I sorted out my feelings...

1299
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:46,760
that morning.

1300
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:53,399
There were things I had in mind.

1301
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,270
And I want my ex to be happy.

1302
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,670
So I'm going to respect her decision.

1303
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:06,450
I thought to myself that I should control my emotions,

1304
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,819
and I shouldn't express them.

1305
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:15,490
I shouldn't let anyone see how I felt.

1306
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:29,170
(Baek Hyun pulled himself together once again.)

1307
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,439
He chose to struggle alone.

1308
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,139
- What a fool.
- Well, I can understand that.

1309
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,179
He kept acting all tough when they were drinking.

1310
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,009
- Right.
- That's because he's weak.

1311
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,496
- He didn't want to fall apart.
- Right.

1312
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,049
I could see that he was hiding his feelings...

1313
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,320
and pretending to be tough.

1314
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,319
But he was overwhelmed with his feelings.

1315
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,359
So he needed some time alone to process everything.

1316
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,359
He was acting tough to cover up his feelings.

1317
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,459
I feel bad for him.

1318
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,659
He couldn't help but cry...

1319
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,259
because he couldn't control his own emotions.

1320
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,259
He must have felt that he wasn't himself.

1321
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,969
How could he handle that in the house?

1322
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,899
- Exactly.
- No one can.

1323
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,169
Here's what I think.

1324
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,599
This is the real first day for Baek Hyun.

1325
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,869
- That's true. It's his first day.
- It's just getting started for him.

1326
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,579
So it's the same feeling other residents felt.

1327
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,540
- He's just feeling it now.
- Right.

1328
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,320
(He leaves the living room as dawn breaks.)

1329
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,630
(He goes to the dining room, not his bedroom.)

1330
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:49,850
(Baek Hyun skillfully prepares the ingredients.)

1331
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,789
(No one is in the kitchen this early in the morning.)

1332
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:01,229
(He quietly cooks...)

1333
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,630
(curry on his own.)

1334
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:16,710
(He covers up the pot of curry instead of eating it.)

1335
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,960
(He writes down the names of the residents in order.)

1336
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:36,330
(Then he writes down Hyeon Ji's name last.)

1337
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:44,770
(Today's menu: Curry)

1338
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,620
(7:20am: Baek Hyun goes to sleep.)

1339
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,459
He went to sleep after cooking curry?

1340
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,229
- So they can have it for breakfast?
- My gosh.

1341
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:05,829
Was it Hyeon Ji's favorite dish?

1342
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,059
- Right. That's possible.
- That's highly likely.

1343
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,399
- Then it's some kind of message.
- My gosh.

1344
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,729
- Gosh, no way.
- They spent a lot of time...

1345
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,029
at his house.

1346
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:14,999
- I bet they cooked together a lot.
- That's for sure.

1347
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,939
He cooked as soon as Hyeon Ji moved in.

1348
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,109
- Right.
- But he said...

1349
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,270
he pulled himself together.

1350
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,280
(9:30am: Hyeon Ji wakes up.)

1351
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,620
Did you sleep well?

1352
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,350
I'm up.

1353
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,890
(9:50am: Won Kyu wakes up.)

1354
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,059
I'm hungry.

1355
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,560
Me too. I'm going to eat pasta.

1356
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,329
- That sounds so good.
- Let's eat together.

1357
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,730
I'll cook it for you.

1358
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:48,740
I think I can sort of match people with their exes.

1359
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,770
- You can?
- Sort of.

1360
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:55,100
Then can you tell who my ex is? I won't tell you who it is.

1361
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,479
I won't tell you.

1362
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,780
But can you tell?

1363
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,080
- From my point of view?
- Yes.

1364
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,800
You're the hardest one to figure out.

1365
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:07,219
- I succeeded then.
- Here's why.

1366
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,759
I'm getting a feeling that you're an organized type.

1367
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,459
- I see.
- Your emotions...

1368
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,359
Is someone drinking coffee over there?

1369
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,329
Why do you ask? Can you smell coffee?

1370
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,529
- Wait.
- What?

1371
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:18,170
- What's this?
- You're right.

1372
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,970
Who's that?

1373
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,300
I think that's Won Kyu.

1374
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,269
(Slurping)

1375
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:27,340
- I guess everyone is up.
- Right.

1376
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,609
- That's Won Kyu's zone.
- I knew it.

1377
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:32,579
- The garden man, Jung Won Kyu.
- He's alone too.

1378
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,480
He had a banana too?

1379
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,580
He's such a charming guy.

1380
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:37,766
- He's an attractive guy too.
- Yes, he's a charming guy.

1381
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:38,950
Hello.

1382
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,490
Hello.

1383
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,360
I saw you sunbathing over there earlier.

1384
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,529
Yes. It was so nice over there.

1385
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,330
- Right? This house is amazing.
- Yes.

1386
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:50,700
Did you have breakfast?

1387
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:51,930
I had cereal.

1388
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,069
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1389
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,240
You're so productive.

1390
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,670
(Dripping)

1391
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,010
What's that? Doenjang stew?

1392
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,980
(Dripping)

1393
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,010
What's that?

1394
01:13:07,011 --> 01:13:08,756
- I don't know what it is.
- Did someone make stew?

1395
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,080
Are you having breakfast?

1396
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,349
- Eggs...
- This is amazing.

1397
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,189
- I don't know what this is.
- I bet Chef Baek made this.

1398
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,219
- Really?
- Right.

1399
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,140
- He mentioned curry yesterday.
- This is crazy.

1400
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,859
(They went to a supermarket after bowling last night.)

1401
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,530
That's a lot.

1402
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,600
- What are you doing, Baek Hyun?
- We should make curry.

1403
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,130
Do you know how to cook curry?

1404
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,669
It's pretty simple.

1405
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,939
Really?

1406
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,316
(Baek Hyun bought ingredients for curry at the supermarket.)

1407
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,169
The curry smells amazing.

1408
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:34,410
- Should we have some?
- Yes.

1409
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,880
That smells so good.

1410
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:37,679
I'm going to boil eggs too.

1411
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,720
Oh, that sounds great. I love boiled eggs.

1412
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,919
Hello.

1413
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,289
- Did you sleep well?
- Hello. Good morning.

1414
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:47,090
- Look at this.
- What's that? Who made this?

1415
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,759
- Our talented chef.
- Who's that?

1416
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,159
- Royal Chef Baek.
- Royal Chef Baek.

1417
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,260
Really? Where did he go?

1418
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,130
(Royal Chef Baek is sleeping due to fatigue.)

1419
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,530
Royal Chef Baek...

1420
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:02,039
- He went to sleep after cooking.
- In the morning?

1421
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,499
- Did he make this at dawn?
- I think that's what happened.

1422
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,609
- No way. I love it.
- Last night, Yoo Sik, Baek Hyun,

1423
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:09,910
- and I stayed up until 6am.
- Yes.

1424
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:11,480
- Why? Were you drinking?
- Really?

1425
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,979
- We were just talking.
- Really?

1426
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,349
- Yes. And he cooked this afterward.
- Were you guys the last ones?

1427
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,219
- Yes. I was the last one.
- Gosh, Yun Nyeong.

1428
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,019
That's crazy. Are you not tired?

1429
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,059
I'm fine. I had four hours of sleep.

1430
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,659
More importantly, I hung out with them too.

1431
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,990
- Really?
- You did.

1432
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:26,960
Everyone likes to eat here.

1433
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,530
I'll boil ten for now.

1434
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,330
My glutes hurt.

1435
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,270
- Yesterday...
- From bowling?

1436
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,670
Don't your glutes hurt?

1437
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,740
(Hyeon Ji comes down after getting ready.)

1438
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

1439
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,080
You guys haven't left yet.

1440
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:49,150
Baek Hyun cooked curry before going to sleep.

1441
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:54,660
(The roommates have breakfast for the first time together.)

1442
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,230
This is a date. It's nice and cozy here.

1443
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,190
Seriously. It's the date with roommates.

1444
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:05,429
The curry tasted so good.

1445
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,376
- Really? I like curry.
- I checked the seasoning.

1446
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,400
Me too.

1447
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,770
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1448
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,950
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1449
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,620
- This is insane.
- Really?

1450
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,320
- This is such good curry.
- I know, right?

1451
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,319
Did he add meat?

1452
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,459
Yes. The meat tastes so good.

1453
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,489
- Gosh. Really?
- This is crazy.

1454
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,000
(Thanks to the curry, their morning is off to a happy start.)

1455
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,740
(11am: Won Kyu leaves.)

1456
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,240
(11:20am: Ji Hyeon leaves.)

1457
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,649
I met everyone...

1458
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,350
- for the first time yesterday.
- Yes.

1459
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,219
Since it's just the two of us here,

1460
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,619
- I can tell you this.
- Okay.

1461
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,289
When everyone is here,

1462
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,030
- I'll tell them again.
- Okay.

1463
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,499
Before I moved in yesterday,

1464
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,470
- Yes.
- I went on a date with Yoo Sik.

1465
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:12,700
- Really?
- Yes.

1466
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,640
How...

1467
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,409
- My gosh.
- Why her, of all people?

1468
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,009
- Gosh, will it end with Min Kyung?
- Why Min Kyung?

1469
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,609
- Why her?
- I mean...

1470
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,610
Of all people, how did Min Kyung end up...

1471
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,210
- as the first one to find out?
- Gosh, that's...

1472
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:26,909
- This is...
- The timing is crazy.

1473
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:28,749
But Yoo Sik was going to tell everyone.

1474
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,179
- Right.
- That's what they discussed.

1475
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,089
After waking up in the morning, she got hit twice...

1476
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,119
- while having curry.
- Oh, no.

1477
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,319
She heard Yoo Sik stayed up late to hang out with them...

1478
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,419
- Right.
- and that Hyeon Ji...

1479
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,560
went on a date with him.

1480
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:40,729
Before I moved in yesterday,

1481
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,629
- Yes.
- I went on a date with Yoo Sik.

1482
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:44,930
- Really?
- Yes.

1483
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:47,770
How...

1484
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,470
No. You don't have to tell me anything.

1485
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:54,640
- Well, - Okay.

1486
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:58,310
I didn't know who was going to be on my date.

1487
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,080
I didn't pick him for my date.

1488
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:04,149
Then I wonder how you got matched with him.

1489
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:07,220
- I'm curious. Okay.
- I know how it happened.

1490
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:11,560
I'm not sure if I can tell you that. Anyway, I know how it happened.

1491
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,099
So you can't tell me, right? Don't tell me then.

1492
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,400
I'm not sure.

1493
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,530
This is interesting.

1494
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:22,840
So did the date go well?

1495
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,939
He was so nervous.

1496
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,539
- Who was nervous?
- Yoo Sik.

1497
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,609
Really?

1498
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:30,610
I'm shy and get nervous...

1499
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:32,380
- when I first meet people.
- Yes.

1500
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,619
But he was a lot more nervous than me.

1501
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:39,020
On top of that, he must have felt pressured to lead.

1502
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,590
- Anyway, - Yes.

1503
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,959
I feel most comfortable...

1504
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,200
- with him for now.
- You do? I see.

1505
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,300
Anyway...

1506
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,069
Why her, of all people?

1507
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:57,809
Hyeon Ji is telling everything to her because she doesn't know.

1508
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,869
Because Min Kyung doesn't know how they got matched,

1509
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,379
- she'll get the wrong idea now.
- Right.

1510
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,479
Min Kyung might think Yoo Sik chose...

1511
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,149
- to go on a date with her.
- "Did he pick her?"

1512
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,379
- Right.
- Hyeon Ji said she didn't pick him.

1513
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,779
Right. Exactly.

1514
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,379
She didn't tell Min Kyung how their date was set up.

1515
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,726
Here's a hypothetical for you guys. What would bother you more?

1516
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,619
Knowing who your ex went on a date with...

1517
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,119
or not knowing?

1518
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,489
- I'd rather not know.
- You'd rather not know?

1519
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,529
I'd rather not know anything.

1520
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,429
- I'd rather know who it is.
- You'd rather know how it is?

1521
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,999
- I'll find out at some point.
- I see.

1522
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,199
- It will come out at some point.
- Right.

1523
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,799
It's not that. I'd rather know when it happens.

1524
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,829
That'd be better.

1525
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:28,369
But I just don't want to find out like that.

1526
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,539
- Not like that?
- In the middle of breakfast.

1527
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,840
- Right.
- She was having tasty curry.

1528
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,480
- Hi. I didn't know you were here.
- Hello.

1529
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,319
I overslept.

1530
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,349
Did you eat?

1531
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,819
I don't need to eat.

1532
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:44,989
- Really?
- Yes.

1533
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,219
Sit with us. This isn't a girls' night, though.

1534
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,220
- A girls' night...
- Oh, hey.

1535
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:51,729
- Hello.
- Hello.

1536
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

1537
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,129
Thank you for the curry. It's delicious.

1538
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,670
- I didn't cook this.
- Who did then?

1539
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,300
I don't know.

1540
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:03,221
(Baek Hyun hides the fact that he cooked curry.)

1541
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,270
- What?
- What?

1542
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,940
(Utterly confused)

1543
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,696
- Why would I do that? It wasn't me.
- Someone made curry?

1544
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,790
Who cooked it then?

1545
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,000
We spent all morning complimenting your culinary skills.

1546
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:26,929
- What?
- We thought you made this.

1547
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,200
We were only complimenting you, Baek Hyun.

1548
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:30,460
It wasn't me.

1549
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:34,940
I passed out after drinking downstairs last night.

1550
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:38,910
I like it.

1551
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:40,209
- I like it.
- Who is it?

1552
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,210
(He keeps hiding that he made curry.)

1553
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:43,309
Why? Is there a reason he wants to hide it?

1554
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,349
Does he not want to get caught that he cooked?

1555
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,079
- By Hyeon Ji?
- Probably.

1556
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,949
- But why...
- Just admit it. Don't be like that.

1557
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,750
- He's like a baby.
- Why is he saying no?

1558
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,290
Everyone calls you Chef Baek.

1559
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:00,290
Maybe him? The one who had coffee this morning?

1560
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,629
It could be him.

1561
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,099
The one who woke up in the morning...

1562
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,580
(The curry mystery Baek Hyun started)

1563
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,040
Someone started that rumor.

1564
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,770
But it really wasn't me.

1565
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,670
I'm curious.

1566
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,810
Was it Cho Yoo Sik?

1567
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,980
Who did it?

1568
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,449
- The situation's going weird.
- Exactly.

1569
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:19,609
Is it going that way?

1570
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:21,290
One misunderstanding leads to another one.

1571
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,550
Who's good at cooking?

1572
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,790
Woo Jin. Is it Woo Jin?

1573
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:30,690
Is there curry?

1574
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:31,829
Yes, someone made it.

1575
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,659
I was going to make it.

1576
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,199
- You should eat it.
- Really?

1577
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,660
Yes, there's so much.

1578
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,169
- Someone said it was you.
- Hello.

1579
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,369
- Hello.
- Hello.

1580
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:47,510
Did you make curry?

1581
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,809
- Me? No, I just got up. What?
- Did you?

1582
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:51,810
It wasn't me.

1583
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:55,410
- No way.
- Who's the culprit?

1584
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,650
Who's the culprit?

1585
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:01,819
Thanks to whoever made it.

1586
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,060
Who made it?

1587
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:07,900
It's really good.

1588
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,430
I know. Who did it?

1589
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,300
Where are your beds?

1590
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,400
In the middle.

1591
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,809
- Are they both in the center?
- Yes, in the center.

1592
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,080
- You got the big room.
- Yes.

1593
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,810
I went to visit it yesterday briefly.

1594
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,079
- I was surprised.
- It's so nice.

1595
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,280
- My room?
- Yes.

1596
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:28,520
- Ji Hyeon wanted to...
- Yes.

1597
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,189
- check out each other's rooms.
- Really?

1598
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,220
After cleaning my room,

1599
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:33,730
I went to check it out briefly.

1600
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,360
You even have a vacuum in your room.

1601
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:36,689
(Everyone sits around and enjoys breakfast together.)

1602
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:37,789
Do you want to borrow it?

1603
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:38,989
- We already did yesterday.
- We borrowed it yesterday.

1604
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,860
(Everyone sits around and enjoys breakfast together.)

1605
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:49,900
(Why did you make curry?)

1606
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,610
My ex...

1607
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,440
suddenly joined.

1608
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:59,080
And she joined us belatedly.

1609
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:02,980
I thought it'd take some time for her to get used to it.

1610
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,350
She'd be very shy.

1611
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,690
I wanted her to have a meal with everyone...

1612
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,090
and get to know them soon.

1613
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,090
Actually,

1614
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,600
I never cooked after I moved in.

1615
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,999
But I suddenly make curry...

1616
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,839
after my ex joins?

1617
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,870
That's strange.

1618
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,810
I thought other people might know...

1619
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:29,010
that she was my ex.

1620
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:33,180
So I made the curry alone in secret in the morning.

1621
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,120
It's something everyone likes.

1622
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,150
My ex also likes curry.

1623
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:42,359
I wanted her to talk to everyone...

1624
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,059
(Since the curry is easy for everyone to share, )

1625
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,529
with a delicious breakfast.

1626
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,610
(he hopes it'd help his ex get along with everyone.)

1627
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,660
- This is very tasty.
- Really?

1628
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,299
(Just as Baek Hyun wished, )

1629
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,699
Yun Nyeong keeps saying I'm older.

1630
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,700
(Hyeon Ji shared the curry with everyone.)

1631
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:55,770
Ma'am.

1632
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,570
I can't do anything...

1633
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:02,079
He made it for her...

1634
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,139
- to get along with everyone fast.
- Yes.

1635
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,949
That was his big picture. Nice.

1636
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,679
That's why he made it in secret early in the morning.

1637
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,379
This is why you need to listen to them.

1638
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,900
It totally made sense when he said it.

1639
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:12,189
No one expected his big picture.

1640
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,319
He's very thoughtful.

1641
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,889
- Too thoughtful.
- Way too thoughtful.

1642
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,790
I can never understand his mind...

1643
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,230
because he's so thoughtful.

1644
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,659
Although we didn't get to try it,

1645
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,129
I'm sure the curry tasted very deep too.

1646
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,599
- Yes.
- It must've been delicious.

1647
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,376
It was probably the best curry in their lives.

1648
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,199
(Has your ex ever made you curry?)

1649
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,070
Yes, he's good at cooking.

1650
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,810
He likes cooking.

1651
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,609
I don't remember...

1652
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:38,450
if it tasted the same.

1653
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:41,049
(Do you think your ex made the curry?)

1654
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,120
No.

1655
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,079
The women said,

1656
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,419
"Baek Hyun made this."

1657
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,889
"This is amazing. This is so good."

1658
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,390
They complimented him so much.

1659
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,089
So I was thinking,

1660
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:54,460
"Oh, look at him."

1661
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,260
But then...

1662
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,000
he was like, "I didn't make it."

1663
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:03,600
I knew he meant it. It wasn't him.

1664
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,340
(Hyeon Ji didn't realize it to the end.)

1665
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:11,880
I'm glad I got to have breakfast.

1666
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,750
Someone cooked.

1667
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:19,750
Let me write a thank you here.

1668
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:21,820
Thank...

1669
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,390
Someone wrote my name here.

1670
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:26,330
I know. Who wrote that?

1671
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:28,059
"Thank you."

1672
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,660
(Today's menu)

1673
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,199
"You're very diligent."

1674
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,940
(It was yummy. Thank you. You're very diligent.)

1675
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:52,450
Where are you going?

1676
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,850
I'm not going anywhere.

1677
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,559
- Wait.
- What?

1678
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,960
Can we...

1679
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:05,330
Can we talk downstairs?

1680
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,970
- Why?
- Why?

1681
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,499
Okay.

1682
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:13,370
(Min Kyung requests Yoo Sik a secret chat.)

1683
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,790
Why do you only sleep for four hours?

1684
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,100
You usually sleep for more than four hours.

1685
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:37,970
I've been sleeping for four hours lately.

1686
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,700
Why?

1687
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:46,310
You normally sleep a lot. Why?

1688
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,300
- I haven't been sleeping a lot.
- I was curious.

1689
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,890
Because you've been sleeping less lately?

1690
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,390
Yes.

1691
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,990
I'm bewildered.

1692
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,170
From what I know, my ex sleeps a lot.

1693
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,870
Near our breakup,

1694
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:19,510
he asked me if he could sleep for a bit in the cafe.

1695
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:22,139
He often asked me...

1696
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,280
if he could sleep for half an hour.

1697
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,510
From my room,

1698
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,280
I can hear the voices of people downstairs.

1699
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:34,050
And my ex is always among them.

1700
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:39,759
(Min Kyung the light sleeper...)

1701
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,230
(heard what people were saying while drinking at night.)

1702
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:44,830
- There's more beer?
- The big one.

1703
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,870
(Min Kyung tossed and turned all night long.)

1704
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:57,310
I want them to keep it down just a little bit.

1705
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,510
Why are they doing that?

1706
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,420
I think my ex is enjoying his time here the best.

1707
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,190
I was mostly angry.

1708
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,719
Even on the day they broke up,

1709
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,519
- Yoo Sik?
- he was sleeping in the cafe,

1710
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,360
so they had a fight.

1711
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:13,729
He usually sleeps a lot...

1712
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,529
Is she saying, "Do you want to play that much?"

1713
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,229
- Right.
- That's it.

1714
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:18,469
It's the same context.

1715
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,129
"Why are you pretending to be family-oriented?"

1716
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,839
- Right.
- It must be annoying.

1717
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,799
He always dozed off when he was with her.

1718
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,909
But now he stays up that late?

1719
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:26,970
Right.

1720
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:30,810
Is it that fun...

1721
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,680
Are you having that much fun?

1722
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,890
Is that why you drink so late?

1723
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,660
I just stay awake without drinking.

1724
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,670
I'm not really that happy to see you...

1725
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,970
spending your time as if nothing happened.

1726
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,710
I have trouble sleeping...

1727
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:08,080
because I'm bugged.

1728
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,520
Get it?

1729
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,720
Will you go to bed early?

1730
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,490
How would you feel?

1731
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,829
I'm with Baek Hyun anyway. What's the problem?

1732
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:21,360
Who you're with isn't the problem.

1733
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,569
It doesn't matter who you're with.

1734
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,800
- Okay.
- It bugs me.

1735
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,840
Let me sleep in peace.

1736
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,249
It bugs me...

1737
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,079
when I keep hearing voices from downstairs.

1738
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,150
I said, okay.

1739
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,390
Go upstairs. Everyone is there.

1740
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,130
(Sighing)

1741
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:56,960
I got the feeling that he wanted to avoid talking to me.

1742
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:02,540
I didn't feel confident about talking to him anymore.

1743
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:06,340
So the conversation ended soon.

1744
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,110
"Will you go to bed early?"

1745
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,709
She feels like a stranger.

1746
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:15,819
If Yoo Sik had no regrets,

1747
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,849
he could go, "Why do you care?"

1748
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:19,589
If he wanted to tell the truth,

1749
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:22,320
he could've said he wanted to talk to other people,

1750
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,889
and he just wanted to get along with everyone...

1751
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:26,589
- and say sorry.
- He's giving excuses.

1752
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,090
"I'm with Baek Hyun."

1753
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,859
That's funny.

1754
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,359
- He wants to get away.
- That's what I mean.

1755
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,769
Min Kyung's just giving an excuse...

1756
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,699
to sleep in peace.

1757
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,299
Min Kyung definitely has feelings left for him.

1758
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,139
If they broke up after dating for nine years,

1759
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,769
there must be a reason.

1760
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:41,909
Do you think she'd still have feelings left for him?

1761
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,809
She wouldn't have feelings for him, but she'd be annoyed.

1762
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:44,810
- She's annoyed.
- She's annoyed.

1763
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:47,409
Aside from her feelings, he might be an eyesore.

1764
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:49,179
- She just hates to see it.
- Yes, she hates to see it.

1765
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,949
She's basically telling him to stay out of her sight.

1766
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,319
But what do you think would have happened...

1767
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,859
if you were one of them?

1768
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,060
I'd be curious.

1769
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,719
She used to sleep a lot,

1770
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,159
but why isn't she sleeping?

1771
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,699
That'd stress me out, so I'd ask her.

1772
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,229
- At least once?
- Out of worries?

1773
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:04,399
It's not out of worries, is it?

1774
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,829
Probably half worried, half annoyed.

1775
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:07,910
She always dozed off when we were in a relationship.

1776
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,060
I think she doesn't want to see me...

1777
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,600
getting along with others.

1778
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:40,070
(Why did you stop talking?)

1779
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:44,770
Because I don't want to change her mind.

1780
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,650
I just...

1781
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:04,990
want her to be happy.

1782
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:10,160
Sorry.

1783
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:27,880
(Yoo Sik couldn't leave for a while.)

1784
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:34,620
(EXchange 4)

1785
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:36,490
(The residents receive a letter.)

1786
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:40,390
"You may reveal your occupations."

1787
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:41,730
I'm getting nervous.

1788
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:42,960
I am...

1789
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,799
I thought that was cool.

1790
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,269
I was surprised.

1791
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,000
It was crazy.

1792
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,400
It bugged me.

1793
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,440
Are you going somewhere?

1794
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,909
Maybe later.

1795
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:54,979
- Really?
- Yes.

1796
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,339
Do you want to join us?

1797
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,479
Sure.

1798
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,509
Okay. Come here.

1799
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,050
What were you talking about?

1800
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:02,850
What's that supposed to mean?

1801
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,590
(The distance from her ex grows in the same space.)

1802
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,959
I was curious about the ex introduction the most.

1803
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,219
- I know.
- I don't have one.

1804
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,390
- What?
- Where did you put it?

1805
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,790
I threw it out.

1806
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,299
Really?

1807
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,529
Oh, my gosh. Your ex could be...

1808
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,330
- here right now.
- That's crazy.

1809
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:22,900
Is he doing that on purpose?

1810
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:26,340
What happened when I wasn't here?

1811
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:27,710
What did he do?
