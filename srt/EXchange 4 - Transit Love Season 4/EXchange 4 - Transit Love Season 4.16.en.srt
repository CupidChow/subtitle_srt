1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,019
Like last week,

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,619
we have actor Noh Sang Hyun with us today.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,520
(Noh Sang Hyun, Actor)

4
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,720
There was a dopamine rush last week, wasn't there?

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,689
What scene gave you a dopamine rush?

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,960
I'll have to say it was the scene at the end.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
- It was with Won Kyu...
- Is it what I think it is?

8
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:31,659
- "Park Ji Hyeon!" - Yes.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,699
- "Hey, Park Ji Hyeon!" - "Park Ji Hyeon."

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,069
- That's right.
- Why do we like fights?

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,769
We like watching fights.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,839
- It's the most fun.
- It's the most fun.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,669
Seriously. The emotions were intense...

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,909
and overwhelming.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,910
I guess it can't be helped.

16
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,879
The lines were crazy too.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,879
- Right.
- "Park Ji Hyeon. Let go."

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,979
"Are you serious?"

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,120
- "I'm serious." - "I'm serious."

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,819
- That line.
- It was crazy.

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,849
Which couple will give us a dopamine rush today?

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,950
Is there a couple you're expecting from?

23
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,359
- Ji Hyeon and Hyeon Ji.
- Hyeon Ji.

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,889
Both of them. Yes.

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,659
- My first pick is you.
- Hyeon Ji's expression...

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,860
of her feelings for Yoo Sik.

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,270
(Hyeon Ji hasn't fallen asleep yet.)

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,040
What are you doing?

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,310
You startled me.

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,010
- Are you going to sleep now?
- I should sleep.

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,680
Do you want to talk for a bit?

32
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,050
Where do we talk?

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Outside.

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,250
It's okay.

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,759
There's no one.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,290
(He puts Hyeon Ji's breakup package inside.)

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Shall we talk here?

38
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,830
(Seung Yong and Hyeon Ji came to the lobby.)

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,840
I wrote the things...

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,580
I wanted to say to you today.

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,910
Here's what it is.

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,449
Isn't this their first talk?

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,789
- It's their first 1-on-1 talk.
- Right.

44
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,989
He wrote the things he wanted to say?

45
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,420
(They're having their first conversation after moving in.)

46
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,760
Of course. He's the hard-working romantic.

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,299
To begin,

48
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,430
(Seung Yong confesses his feelings to Hyeon Ji for the first time.)

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,900
the most significant context in which we fight...

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,700
is when you're...

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,670
- suddenly very emotional.
- When I'm upset.

52
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,710
- I also react to that emotionally, - Yes.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,310
- so things escalate.
- Yes.

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,220
I thought about that.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
I think...

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,520
I wasn't trying to understand you.

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,589
When I can't understand...

58
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,890
why you're mad according to my standards,

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,559
- I also react emotionally.
- Yes.

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,999
- That ends up in a fight.
- Right.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,429
Then you think...

62
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,540
I don't consider the emotions you feel.

63
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,040
When it comes to human relationships,

64
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,010
who's right or wrong isn't what matters most.

65
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,679
Did you just realize that?

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,949
You always judged what was right and wrong.

67
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,450
You always had to understand what was wrong...

68
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,150
to move on.

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,060
As I wrote to you in the letter before,

70
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,199
I think people can change.

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,700
- Right.
- People can change.

72
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,439
The changing process...

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,740
- may take a while, - Yes.

74
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,980
But I'm positive that change will happen someday.

75
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,649
If someone recognizes their mistakes...

76
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,980
and understands what direction...

77
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,950
they need to work toward,

78
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,260
I think they can still change.

79
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,790
I also don't think...

80
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,700
it's a problem only you have to fix.

81
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,030
I think there are things I should improve as well.

82
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,569
Until the end,

83
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,439
I tried a lot to fix my issues,

84
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,079
and I think I showed you that.

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,140
- Okay.
- But...

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,749
I think you said a lot of things about that...

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,850
that hurt me more than necessary.

88
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,960
I explained to you...

89
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,959
why I was so emotional,

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,199
but you couldn't accept that.

91
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,499
You said, "You're someone who snaps at people."

92
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,469
"You're someone who doesn't change."

93
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,139
"That's why I can't marry you."

94
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,739
You made that certain.

95
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,769
If you thought I was such a person,

96
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,939
I thought I couldn't be in a relationship without respect,

97
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,009
so I thought we wouldn't have any chance.

98
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,849
So I tried to respect that even when you came here,

99
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,950
no matter what choice you made.

100
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,690
We had our preliminary meeting.

101
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,329
I met you after meeting Baek Hyun.

102
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,330
I didn't have any lingering feelings for him,

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,300
and I had no romantic feelings for him.

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,470
But I saw how he treated me there.

105
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,310
I was someone who could hear such nice words,

106
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,410
but I heard lots of hurtful words from you.

107
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,449
I asked how you felt after we broke up.

108
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,090
The moment you said you felt a sense of liberation,

109
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,660
I just...

110
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,890
- It was shocking.
- Okay.

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,700
So, in many ways,

112
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,570
I've sorted out my feelings a lot.

113
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,340
Do you want to say that you've moved on?

114
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,520
I came here thinking...

115
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,450
there was little chance of us getting back together.

116
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,220
But...

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,860
I still want us to get back together more than anything.

118
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,759
You should have thought about that a bit earlier and told me.

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,770
I really...

120
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,199
- Back then, I was also...
- I really made an effort with you.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,070
You really tried to hold me.

122
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,880
But now you're saying...

123
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,580
you've realized that. It's quite...

124
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,980
(The emotional temperatures of the two had a bad timing.)

125
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,619
She said her thoughts about us getting back together...

126
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,790
reduced a lot after what I said at the preliminary meeting.

127
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,499
Of course, I don't feel cheerful...

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,370
or happy.

129
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,070
But I've made up my mind...

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,140
to wait for her until she decides.

131
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,340
The phase "sense of liberation" really hit Hyeon Ji hard.

132
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,079
Do you think there's a chance of things changing...

133
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,280
even if Seung Yong makes an effort?

134
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,379
I don't think so.

135
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,149
He's a hard-working romantic.

136
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,619
Hyeon Ji has feelings for someone else now.

137
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,990
- She has feelings for Yoo Sik.
- Yes.

138
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,630
(The first night in Japan passes.)

139
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,790
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik are still sleeping.)

140
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,600
(The hanger woke Won Kyu up.)

141
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,179
(It's a heavy morning for Won Kyu.)

142
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,809
Why do things like that always happen to only Won Kyu?

143
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,950
He's talented in making people laugh.

144
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,250
I was sleeping,

145
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,920
and this crashed down.

146
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
What?

147
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,800
What happened? Did I do that?

148
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,000
No. You didn't do it.

149
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,770
It just fell down.

150
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,470
I was having a good sleep.

151
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,439
I know, right?

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,670
(Won Kyu's lucky morning)

153
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,010
(Seung Yong came to meet Hyeon Ji again.)

154
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,920
Who is it?

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,519
It's Seung Yong.

156
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,750
Is Hyeon Ji up?

157
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,420
- Yes?
- It's Seung Yong.

158
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,790
- Are you going to have breakfast?
- I will.

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
- I'll make it if you'll eat.
- I'll eat.

160
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,930
- Will you eat it here?
- No. I'll go downstairs.

161
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,160
Okay.

162
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,570
(He prepares breakfast for Hyeon Ji.)

163
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,620
What are you making again?

164
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,690
Hyeon Ji said she's going to eat something.

165
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,350
- Who?
- Hyeon Ji.

166
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,460
Hi.

167
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,730
Did you sleep well?

168
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,159
Yes, I slept well. I just woke up.

169
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,299
Your eyes got really puffy.

170
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,770
- My whole face got puffy.
- My eyes got puffy too, right?

171
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,700
- Yes, a bit.
- It's because I cried last night.

172
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,069
- What's going on?
- Did you sleep well?

173
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,469
Did you sleep well... What happened to your voice?

174
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,610
Gosh, I feel tired.

175
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,939
Woo Jin, do you want some toast?

176
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,080
I'd love to.

177
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,319
(Residents gather, except for Hyeon Ji.)

178
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,319
My face is all puffy. What shall I do?

179
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,889
I think we're all in the same boat.

180
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,090
Shall I bring it to the table?

181
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,919
Whose is this? Is this yours?

182
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,390
- It's for Hyeon Ji.
- It doesn't matter. Bring them all.

183
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,799
- All right.
- That's for Hyeon Ji.

184
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,830
This is for Hyeon Ji.

185
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,730
For Hyeon Ji.

186
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,700
(Hyeon Ji's plate is ready.)

187
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,840
This is for Hyeon Ji. Why isn't she coming?

188
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
- She said she'd come down.
- Did she?

189
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,309
Hyeon Ji! This is yours.

190
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,480
- Thank you.
- I didn't make it.

191
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,949
- You're welcome.
- I...

192
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,650
just prepared your spoon and chopsticks.

193
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,989
- Here's jam.
- This is for you,

194
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,889
- and this is for Min Kyung.
- Did they go out?

195
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,220
- Yes.
- At what time?

196
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,830
- Around 10:30am?
- Okay.

197
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,559
About 20...

198
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,860
- Did you cook all of these?
- Twenty...

199
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,070
Yes.

200
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,040
You're an early bird. When did you get up?

201
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,840
It was around 11:30am.

202
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,149
I thought Seung Yong wasn't good at expressing his feelings.

203
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,679
But I realized he put in an effort in his own way,

204
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
even when I told him that I'm interested in someone else.

205
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,389
He was trying to change himself a lot...

206
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,860
and putting a lot of effort, I thought.

207
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,729
Woo Jin, what happens if I put bacon in this?

208
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,530
It tastes good, but you need to fry bacon first.

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,700
Grease will come out when bacon is fried.

210
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,300
So much grease.

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,910
- Why?
- Nothing.

212
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,180
I'm in big trouble because I can't hide my facial expressions.

213
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,480
- That's not true.
- If everyone is going out late,

214
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,580
would they come back very late?

215
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,220
I guess so.

216
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,350
I will give you

217
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,520
- Stop it.
- Why?

218
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm bored.

219
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,690
I thought you did that only when you were with me.

220
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,160
It's such a surprise.

221
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,700
- What do you mean?
- What?

222
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,099
- What do you mean?
- I thought...

223
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,470
you did those things only when you were with me.

224
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,680
- Pardon?
- Want to enjoy the moody vibe?

225
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,340
- It's because there...
- Do you want to give them space?

226
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,750
I think I should step aside.

227
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,390
You should fix these stray hairs.

228
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,890
- I'm going to stay at home.
- What?

229
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,230
- I'm going to be at home.
- Still.

230
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,960
You looked good in the video.

231
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
In the preliminary meeting...

232
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,430
- What?
- I looked terrible.

233
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,130
No, you looked good.

234
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,370
How come I smiled so awkwardly?

235
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,740
I thought I smiled very naturally.

236
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,440
Was it a forced smile, back then?

237
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,080
When you smile, you go like this.

238
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,580
It's kind of...

239
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,180
Yes, it's this look.

240
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,090
You go like this.

241
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,020
I could not help making such a facial expression.

242
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,890
Why?

243
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,360
(He shouldn't have brought that topic.)

244
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,429
Didn't you go to bed late last night, Woo Jin?

245
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,770
- I went to bed late.
- Right.

246
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,070
Yesterday, everyone...

247
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,610
had pent-up frustration when they talked.

248
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,880
Since I'm acting emotionally here,

249
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,780
my ex seems to get emotional as well, so I felt sorry.

250
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,450
I feel that I'm making her emotional.

251
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,320
As for me,

252
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,990
things went pretty much sideways with my ex.

253
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,899
Indeed, our emotions ran high and then cooled off.

254
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
I see.

255
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm not saying that things are settled, though.

256
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,870
Go have a good time today.

257
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,410
Everyone is having a hard time.

258
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,250
Things are so unpredictable here.

259
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,490
It's a very nice place.

260
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,160
- Definitely.
- Isn't it?

261
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,160
I don't think I'm fully enjoying this situation.

262
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,729
Though it's very nice place.

263
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,360
(Their hearts get more confused in this trip.)

264
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,440
(Sung Baek Hyun)

265
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,210
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

266
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,380
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

267
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
(Park Ji Hyeon)

268
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,180
(Cho Yoo Sik)

269
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,080
(Park Hyeon Ji)

270
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,980
(Kim Woo Jin)

271
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,150
(Kwak Min Kyung)

272
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,820
(Jung Won Kyu)

273
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,620
(Hong Ji Yeon)

274
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,520
(Shin Seung Yong)

275
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,640
(EXchange 4)

276
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,480
(Episode 16: The Breakup Lingering in My Throat)

277
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,279
(Ji Hyeon and Yoo Sik's pick-a-date)

278
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,380
Hi.

279
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,310
Have you ever driven on the right side?

280
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,179
- Once.
- Really?

281
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,020
I'm counting on you, Yoo Sik.

282
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,090
Today, I'll treat you.

283
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,250
What are you saying?

284
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,020
I decided to treat you today.

285
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,190
Count on this big sister.

286
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,800
Still, I'm glad that I'm your first date.

287
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,670
Don't you feel tired?

288
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,309
No. You'd get tired...

289
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,710
- on the second date.
- I'm not tired... I see.

290
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,410
I wanted to buy Yoo Sik something delicious.

291
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,550
And with the excuse of buying him something delicious,

292
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,050
I wanted to have a date with Yoo Sik in Japan.

293
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,330
It slightly felt awkward,

294
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,190
but I was also glad.

295
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,430
She's been on my mind.

296
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
You cried right away last night.

297
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
What do you mean?

298
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,440
- When?
- The moment it began...

299
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,970
- You mean revealing the ex?
- Yes.

300
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,280
You were quite a crier, Yoo Sik.

301
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,950
You looked like a male lead in a youth film.

302
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,050
This is really driving me crazy.

303
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,720
By the way, dating for 9 years since you were 17 years old.

304
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,120
You've only dated Min Kyung so far, I guess.

305
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,890
- No?
- That's right.

306
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,830
Min Kyung was the one who had a chat with me.

307
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,970
- The truth is revealed now.
- What chat?

308
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,399
Did girls have a chat?

309
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,540
- Yes.
- I see.

310
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,310
For me, your ex,

311
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,449
based on our chat back then,

312
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,180
seemed to be Hyeon Ji.

313
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,750
Why? How was she in the chat?

314
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,250
(While having a conversation, they arrived at the date spot.)

315
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,360
Thank you for the ride.

316
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,230
I'll tell you after we get off.

317
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,170
It's amazing!

318
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,510
- What's this?
- Where?

319
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,010
This place looks crazy, doesn't it?

320
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,980
Why?

321
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,680
So, why did you think that it was Hyeon Ji?

322
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,350
I asked her what kind of dates she had,

323
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,489
Yes.

324
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,720
And she said she's done pretty much everything.

325
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,160
I asked if she played sports for a date,

326
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,060
and she said she did everything except for golf.

327
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,100
I thought, among four female residents,

328
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,070
- no one was good at sports.
- Right.

329
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,210
- They all said they didn't play.
- Everyone was beneath you?

330
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,139
And she said, "A heavy drinker."

331
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,310
- Who is?
- The girl is.

332
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,610
- She said so herself?
- Yes.

333
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,149
- But it could have been a lie.
- Right.

334
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,150
(Min Kyung's confidence makes him smile.)

335
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,589
I thought there might not be an ex of yours here.

336
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,620
Because no one seemed to be the perfect match.

337
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,490
Then Hyeon Ji joined the show on the third day,

338
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,300
and she said that she recently started playing golf,

339
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,400
- She liked drinking.
- and she liked drinking.

340
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,140
So I thought, "Hyeon Ji must be his ex."

341
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,740
I wonder why Min Kyung said so. She can't drink much.

342
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,810
We said those in the chat.

343
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,080
We even went to the Talking Room.

344
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,720
There were many people.

345
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,690
- Me? What do you mean?
- Yes.

346
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,059
On the phone.

347
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,300
(When they called you from the Talking Room)

348
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,900
Were you there too?

349
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,599
Why?

350
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,770
I thought you were not there.

351
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,000
I might not have been there.

352
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,439
I might just have heard that there were many people.

353
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,510
I see.

354
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,750
You know, at first,

355
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
I thought...

356
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,250
- it was Yoo Sik and Jae Hyeong.
- Yes.

357
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,090
I thought it was two people,

358
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,420
and one person said he wanted to get closer to me.

359
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,689
I'm close with everyone. Jae Hyeong is the only one...

360
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,060
I'm not close to.

361
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,970
So I thought it was Jae Hyeong and Yoo Sik.

362
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,770
But Won Kyu said...

363
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,210
he was the person in the Talking Room.

364
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,270
He said it was him.

365
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,350
So I realized I had misunderstood.

366
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,150
So it was Won Kyu and Jae Hyeong, not Yoo Sik.

367
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,089
Then why did Yoo Sik give me the note?

368
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,860
Was that a coincidence?

369
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,230
That's what I thought.

370
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,790
- Is that so?
- Were you there?

371
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,870
There weren't two people.

372
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,639
I thought there were two.

373
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,900
- Really?
- Yes.

374
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,770
I'm sure there were three.

375
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,379
Really? Hold on.

376
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,410
Did you just realize that?

377
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Yes.

378
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,250
(She finally got to know the truth of that day.)

379
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,190
It felt nice.

380
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,959
Coming to the Talking Room in itself...

381
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,460
was an expression of interest.

382
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,430
"Does he still have feelings for me?"

383
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,830
I think I was curious about that.

384
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,940
Really?

385
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,470
Why did you come to the Talking Room?

386
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,010
Am I not allowed there?

387
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,510
Why did you come?

388
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,550
I was curious. I went because I was curious.

389
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,160
I was also hoping you'd come.

390
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,390
- Yes.
- But it didn't turn out like that.

391
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,430
So I thought you wanted...

392
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,930
to get to know someone else more than me.

393
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,200
So I asked you that.

394
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,900
You agreed as well.

395
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,410
So...

396
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
I see.

397
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,050
Actually, I was really sad.

398
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,480
Did you say, "Hello. I'm Park Ji Hyeon?"

399
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,220
"Hello. I'm Park Ji Hyeon."

400
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,460
No way.

401
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,260
I felt so miserable all by myself.

402
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,800
Why were you miserable?

403
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,199
I told you.

404
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,670
My greatest weapon is being honest.

405
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,470
I say everything I feel.

406
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,420
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

407
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,120
- I had a good meal.
- I had a good meal.

408
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,019
Yoo Sik certainly goes well with Hyeon Ji.

409
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,289
Yes. The vibe is different.

410
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,859
They're surely different.

411
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,159
There's no excitement.

412
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,199
There's no hiding the face with the cushion.

413
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,699
- Right. There's no twisting.
- That kind of vibe.

414
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,729
- There's no such vibe.
- He's confident in front of her.

415
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,729
I think he's trying to draw a line.

416
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,499
Right. I don't think he's opening up.

417
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,139
He's saving his words.

418
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Yes.

419
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,840
- The meal was nice, right?
- Yes.

420
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Thank you.

421
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,779
You're back early.

422
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,390
Right. They're back early.

423
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,089
They're already back.

424
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,159
(The exes came back from their dates.)

425
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,220
- There's toast?
- Do you want some?

426
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,260
We ate. We also bought some things.

427
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,900
When did you both get up?

428
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,969
I woke up at noon.

429
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,070
- I...
- Aren't you going on the date?

430
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,170
I'll be going after a while.

431
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,210
Where did you go?

432
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,180
It was at the sea. At the end.

433
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
- It was near the port.
- That's so nice.

434
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,250
Goodness. Madam.

435
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,990
The only comfortable black shoes I have are slippers.

436
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,619
You'll be going by car.

437
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,190
I only brought comfortable shoes here.

438
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,260
Right. You may have to walk for a long time.

439
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,129
The shoes...

440
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,430
(Won Kyu feels uncomfortable being with Ji Hyeon and Ji Yeon.)

441
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,669
Your eyebrows are well-groomed.

442
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,840
- Are they?
- Yes. I used to do it often.

443
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,469
- Really?
- What do you mean by "often?"

444
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,910
I did.

445
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,909
- This is too much.
- Stop it.

446
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,709
- Stop fighting.
- Stop it.

447
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,080
Why is it so spicy here?

448
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,580
Stop it, really.

449
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,449
I'm not doing any activities today.

450
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,350
That's why I dressed like this.

451
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,459
What did you do?

452
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,489
We went to the zoo. We rode a boat as well.

453
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,659
- Yesterday?
- A monkey sat here as well.

454
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,029
- Yesterday?
- Yes. We walked around so much.

455
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,099
That must have been nice. You like monkeys.

456
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,699
- The monkeys were fun.
- You know,

457
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,639
he didn't look happy when we were eating.

458
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,139
- The monkeys.
- He didn't look happy,

459
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,469
- but after seeing the monkeys, - He likes monkeys.

460
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,939
- he smiled.
- Right.

461
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,510
His nickname is monkey.

462
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,210
He's Won Kyu.

463
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,090
I'll get going.

464
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,300
She's even talking about such things.

465
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,000
They told her to stop.

466
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,629
The conversation here makes me dizzy.

467
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,229
I think this is the real beginning of EXchange.

468
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,599
- After the exes are revealed.
- Totally.

469
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,739
- That's right.
- Really.

470
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,439
- This is so exciting.
- It's so exciting.

471
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Right.

472
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,980
It's so nice.

473
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,410
- Can I open the window a little?
- Yes.

474
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,380
(Ji Yeon and Won Kyu's pick-a-date)

475
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,820
(Staring)

476
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,760
I can see that you're feeling worse and worse.

477
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,810
I had the most fun at the beginning.

478
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,610
It seems so.

479
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,110
I only cared about my feelings that time.

480
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,249
(He didn't get a message from Ji Yeon yesterday...)

481
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,620
(for the first time.)

482
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,759
It's not been long since you broke up.

483
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
That's right.

484
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,630
Anyway...

485
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,470
I didn't want...

486
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,640
to talk about my ex in front of you.

487
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,350
I really want to focus only on my feelings.

488
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm trying to focus only on my feelings.

489
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,060
I just thought I should have fun with him...

490
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,360
without thinking too much.

491
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,230
(She pulls herself together and sets out for their date today.)

492
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,669
- Things don't seem so good.
- Right.

493
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,769
It's because the texts...

494
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,239
- got crossed, right?
- That's right.

495
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,309
- I think there's a bit of that.
- There's a bit of tension.

496
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,109
There's a subtle tension.

497
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,179
Right. They look a bit awkward.

498
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,050
Someone should just be forward.

499
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
It's so beautiful.

500
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,120
This really looks like Japan.

501
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,890
Those flowers are everywhere.

502
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,589
Right. There are hydrangeas everywhere on this side.

503
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,860
- Right?
- Yes.

504
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,860
There's so much nature.

505
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,499
The path is so pretty, isn't it?

506
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,140
Yes. The path is so pretty.

507
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,140
- Are you okay walking up?
- Yes.

508
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,580
Will you carry me if I say I'm not fine?

509
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,779
Would you let me carry you if I offered?

510
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
No.

511
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,449
It feels like I'm going to another world.

512
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,450
I know.

513
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,290
It's here.

514
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,990
(Kitakamakura Takaranoniwa)

515
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,870
- It's nice.
- Yes.

516
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,169
It's a proper one already.

517
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,170
(They came to a pottery studio in the forest.)

518
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,370
What are we doing?

519
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,340
It looked like that before.

520
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,040
We're...

521
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,550
I don't know either. Let's just do it.

522
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,320
- Excuse me?
- Why?

523
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,850
You said you've done this before.

524
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,990
- Won Kyu.
- Okay.

525
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Are you tired?

526
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,230
No. This is nice.

527
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,330
I think it's become softer.

528
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,460
I'm going to make a really good one.

529
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,469
Me too. I'll make it better than you.

530
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,630
I did better last time.

531
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,499
You're done.

532
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,640
(The kneading process to soften the dough is finished.)

533
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
Which one is better?

534
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,410
This.

535
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,349
You did go to an art school.

536
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,380
Of course.

537
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,850
You're good, Ji Yeon.

538
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,060
With affection.

539
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,629
It's hard to make it flat.

540
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,130
- Right. It leaves marks.
- Yes.

541
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,170
You need to do it evenly.

542
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,070
(Wobbling)

543
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,240
- Ji Yeon.
- Yes?

544
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,770
Why is mine this large?

545
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,440
It's almost a serving bowl.

546
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,110
How is it?

547
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,420
Did you check it?

548
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,779
(Won Kyu's plate seems to have a problem.)

549
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,750
I think it's very thin.

550
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,989
(After checking the plate. the owner looks perplexed.)

551
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,120
Very thin?

552
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,130
- Very thin!
- Very thin.

553
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,200
What shall I do?

554
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,770
"What shall I do?"

555
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,269
Do you want to retry?

556
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,070
- Retry.
- Okay.

557
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,670
Please check...

558
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,380
- the size.
- Okay.

559
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,310
I did as she said, but why did it come out like this?

560
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,050
(Won Kyu is given new clay.)

561
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,220
Teach me.

562
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,689
- First, - Only the center?

563
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,690
Only the center.

564
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,890
Just the center.

565
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,130
Only one spot.

566
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,430
- Okay.
- I should hit the center.

567
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,840
Ji Yeon helped me with almost all the parts.

568
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,809
I kept tapping the plate like this,

569
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,240
and Ji Yeon kept turning the plate.

570
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,550
At that time, I felt very comfortable...

571
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
and thankful.

572
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,550
I liked that.

573
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,989
- Shall we just pluck them?
- Yes.

574
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,990
(They came to get some leaves for making patterns on the plates.)

575
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,060
Does it break your heart?

576
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,770
- Here...
- It feels like picking lettuce.

577
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,970
- Doesn't it?
- It does.

578
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,409
- I'm done.
- I'm done, too.

579
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,510
Let's go.

580
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,940
- This is fun, right?
- Yes.

581
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,680
It feels so amazing.

582
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,950
The vibe is what matters.

583
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,720
I really want to make this nice.

584
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,830
Okay. I'm moving on to the next.

585
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,029
- I'll apply the glaze.
- Okay.

586
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,370
(Ji Yeon applies the glaze first.)

587
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
This is bold.

588
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,509
You did a good job.

589
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,739
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

590
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,349
- I'm glad.
- You certainly did a good job.

591
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,350
- I did a good job?
- Yes.

592
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,860
Very good!

593
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,630
- It's a compliment.
- How is it?

594
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,059
After drying, I'll fire these...

595
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,669
and send them to Korea.

596
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,569
- It will take a long time.
- So,

597
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,840
Then we'll get the plates definitely after this show is over.

598
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,240
- It might feel strange.
- I know.

599
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,410
What would we be doing then?

600
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,080
- Curious, right?
- Right.

601
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,620
It felt a bit strange.

602
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,519
By the time we receive the plates,

603
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,560
we must have made the final decision.

604
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,759
It would be nice if we left the show together...

605
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,260
and used them together.

606
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,400
I wonder if we could use the plates together when we receive them.

607
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,700
What would I be doing then?

608
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,600
I wonder what we are doing then.

609
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,979
I think, definitely, either Won Kyu or Ji Yeon...

610
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,879
Now, they should be...

611
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,209
straightforward with their feelings.

612
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,519
- Right.
- But they are not doing it.

613
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,920
- Their relationship hit the brakes.
- Right. It hit the brakes.

614
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,260
- Who is it?
- It's me.

615
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,860
Come in.

616
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,630
Hi.

617
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,500
Can I come in?

618
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,330
How come it's so nice here?

619
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,830
- Is it nice?
- Yes!

620
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,170
I shouldn't keep doing this, but I can't help turning to you.

621
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,880
- Same here.
- Goodness.

622
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,980
I should stop this.

623
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,209
Yoo Sik also said...

624
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,619
that it's a total twist of fate.

625
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,190
I know. It doesn't make sense.

626
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,820
(Yoo Sik comes to the room, like a twist of fate.)

627
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:14,000
(He hears the voice of Min Kyung in the room.)

628
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
Come in.

629
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,640
Who is it?

630
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,340
The lens case.

631
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,740
Who's that?

632
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,750
This is the lens case.

633
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,720
- To whom?
- To Hyeon Ji.

634
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,120
Why did you keep this?

635
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,160
On the plane,

636
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,290
my lens solution leaked out, so I borrowed hers.

637
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,000
Who is it?

638
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,300
It's Yoo Sik, and he told me to give this to you.

639
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,870
I see.

640
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,340
Gosh.

641
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,940
Goodness gracious.

642
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,910
Oh, gosh.

643
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,220
It's really tough.

644
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,989
It's not that I'm not mindful of you, Min Kyung.

645
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,050
I know.

646
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,730
- I can't help but care about you.
- I know for sure.

647
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,130
(Baek Hyun is ready to go on a date with Yun Nyeong.)

648
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,070
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes! I slept well.

649
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,380
You have pants that matches the jacket.

650
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,680
They are so similar.

651
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,909
- They are, right?
- Yes.

652
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,050
They are a perfect match.

653
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,320
You got me this yesterday, Yun Nyeong.

654
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,790
I did? You mean the handkerchief.

655
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,719
But the size isn't good for you.

656
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,030
- I washed it.
- I'll buy you another one.

657
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,190
Why?

658
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,960
As I see, it looked rather small for Baek Hyun.

659
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,599
But he loved it...

660
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,669
and took it with him today as well, so I appreciated it.

661
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,740
I truly appreciated it.

662
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,609
This car is so cute!

663
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,810
(Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun's pick-a-date)

664
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,909
Where are we going?

665
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,449
You told me to look forward to today.

666
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,210
- You really should.
- I will.

667
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,290
Let's head northeast!

668
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,790
I can't believe I'm driving in Japan.

669
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,230
I'm so curious about what we're going to do.

670
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,099
Since you planned our date yesterday,

671
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,370
I'll plan it this time.

672
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,769
So, I have sky-high expectations right now.

673
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,839
You'd better.

674
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,339
I do have sky-high expectations because you told me to.

675
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,310
Keep your seatbelt fastened. You need to stay buckled up.

676
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,480
- Shall I? I got it.
- Yes.

677
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,289
(Under the Palmo, Hayama Marina)

678
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,460
This place is wonderful.

679
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,999
- And two red wines, please.
- Red wine?

680
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

681
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,370
I'm having pizza, at last.

682
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,470
It looks so beautiful over there.

683
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,280
Baek Hyun, look at that.

684
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,649
- It's so beautiful.
- The sun is high in the sky.

685
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,050
That's what I'm saying. What?

686
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,849
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

687
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,950
So suddenly?

688
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,090
Yes. Open it.

689
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,490
So out of the blue?

690
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,830
- What is it?
- What's that?

691
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,260
What's inside?

692
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,299
- It's so beautiful.
- The sun is high in the sky.

693
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,600
That's what I'm saying. What?

694
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,529
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

695
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,700
So suddenly?

696
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,870
Yes. Open it.

697
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,210
So out of the blue?

698
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,139
- Open it.
- Can I open it?

699
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,240
You'll like it.

700
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,879
- I've wanted to gift you something.
- So did you prepare this?

701
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
- Yes.
- Is that true?

702
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,480
I've been thinking about it, but you gave me a gift first.

703
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,620
- That's incredible.
- So I thought we felt the same way.

704
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,390
I really wanted to give this to you because I thought you'll like it.

705
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,130
Oh, my!

706
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,960
My goodness. This is amazing.

707
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,240
Seriously.

708
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,170
- They had this in denim color.
- This is so...

709
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,950
I broke one...

710
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,049
I didn't know they had it in this color, though.

711
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,079
This is so pretty.

712
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,979
- I planned to get the black one, - I see.

713
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,189
So I was going to buy it,

714
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,690
I see. Does it fit my vibe?

715
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,790
- Yes.
- I truly appreciate this.

716
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,659
You're actually such a sweet guy.

717
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,899
The handkerchief feels so modest now.

718
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,669
No, that's not true.

719
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,730
Not at all.

720
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,000
- Comparing it is meaningless.
- You remembered that I wanted it.

721
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,599
Right. You just mentioned it casually.

722
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,910
- Yes.
- And you broke one at home.

723
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,479
(One day in Seoul)

724
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,779
I find that clock so nice...

725
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,779
since I moved in. There's another one in the living room.

726
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,220
- That star?
- Yes.

727
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,820
(The next night)

728
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,719
Oh, no. What do I do?

729
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,090
- Did it break?
- What was it?

730
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,060
I left it here, but...

731
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,230
- Don't touch it. I'll do it.
- How did it happen?

732
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,729
Thank you so much.

733
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,499
It's beyond my imagination.

734
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,839
I told you it'd surprise you.

735
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,799
Seriously, like for real.

736
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,070
I knew you'd like it.

737
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,380
I love how it's in denim.

738
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,749
It really suits you today.

739
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,510
- Right?
- It wasn't intentional,

740
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,150
but we ended up making denim jackets today.

741
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,549
And I wanted us to wear similar outfits.

742
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,850
Even the present is in denim.

743
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,790
You like denim, don't you?

744
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,060
Really.

745
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,830
That was out of this world.

746
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,629
It was...

747
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,970
"I'm at a loss," was what I thought.

748
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,510
"What do I do?"

749
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,579
That was what was in my mind. I was speechless.

750
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,310
It was just that moving.

751
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,150
"What is up with this guy?" was also what crossed my mind.

752
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,019
He was totally cool.

753
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,220
I fell for him again.

754
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,920
"Unbelievable."

755
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,489
Thanks. Thanks for liking it.

756
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,289
- I was really moved.
- Really?

757
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,589
Yes, for real.

758
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,760
- I promised to make you happy.
- Right.

759
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,399
- I'm happy.
- Are you?

760
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,429
Yes.

761
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,730
Dig in. You must be hungry.

762
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,499
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

763
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,570
Go ahead.

764
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,219
- Are you fine with the cheese?
- Yes.

765
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,890
It's okay.

766
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,959
Is it Jae Hyeong?

767
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,229
(Female residents, recommend a date for your ex.)

768
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,269
(However, you cannot choose yourself.)

769
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,070
- Is it your ex?
- As if.

770
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,009
"I'm relieved. I can recommend a date now."

771
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,780
"Jae Hyeong will finally go on a date."

772
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,540
It only took me two seconds.

773
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,650
As soon as I read the message, I sent, "Hyeon Ji."

774
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,580
(Picked her ex's date)

775
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,990
Actually, your gift...

776
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,690
If our exes were revealed,

777
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,130
our feelings could've changed.

778
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,199
And if we had talked with our exes,

779
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,960
we might have grown feelings for them.

780
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,370
I...

781
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,040
If your feelings had changed...

782
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,539
- My feelings?
- Yes.

783
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,340
I was going to use that as a big gun to turn your feelings around.

784
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,180
"This is it."

785
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,880
"A change of heart? Okay."

786
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,050
"Return to me." That was my original intention.

787
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,260
The date in Japan will stick in my memory for a long time.

788
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,799
Thank you so much.

789
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,399
- Don't mention it.
- The gift.

790
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,040
(A happy memory engraved in both)

791
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,069
Baek Hyun's feelings...

792
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,809
- are set on Yun Nyeong.
- Totally.

793
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,409
- That's setting it in stone.
- Yes.

794
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,909
- It seems like it.
- Right?

795
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,239
- Didn't they hold hands?
- A situationship.

796
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,249
- They held hands.
- Yes.

797
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,379
- They held hands for a second.
- Yes.

798
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,449
And normally, you remember...

799
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,919
and gift something to the person you're interested in...

800
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,219
when you want...

801
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,589
- to make them yours.
- Exactly.

802
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,889
- After keeping it in mind.
- Yes.

803
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,559
"That's how much..."

804
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,759
"I thought about and took care of you,"

805
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,329
- is the meaning behind the gift.
- Yes.

806
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,429
- He's sweet.
- Baek Hyun is good.

807
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,430
Right.

808
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,870
Let's go.

809
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,600
- I feel like I'm the one driving.
- Right?

810
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,309
It's like I should drive.

811
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,640
- Let's go.
- Okay.

812
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,979
- The place we're going to today.
- Yes?

813
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,150
We're going to make soba ourselves.

814
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,850
We'll even eat it.

815
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,150
- Eat the noodles we make.
- Okay, I'm totally in.

816
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,790
Soba, udon, and more.

817
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,219
By the way, how did you feel...

818
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,390
on the day my ex was revealed?

819
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,560
- I spotted you two...
- Yes?

820
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,830
Having...

821
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,399
- a serious conversation...
- I see.

822
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,069
- on the terrace.
- Right.

823
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,299
I sort of...

824
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,070
- knew it'd be you two.
- Is that so?

825
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,539
- Honestly, you've mentioned...
- Yes?

826
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,309
How long the relationship...

827
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,039
was quite a few times.

828
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,880
- Right, it was a long relationship.
- Yes.

829
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,709
I asked about your standard...

830
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,609
- for a long relationship.
- That's why...

831
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,619
I guessed that you had a long relationship.

832
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,650
Right.

833
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,419
The years...

834
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,519
didn't really shock me.

835
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,919
To be frank, I did think it'd be 5 to 6 years.

836
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,060
- Really? We lasted for years.
- Yes.

837
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,729
Now that everything...

838
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,100
- has been disclosed, - Yes?

839
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,630
I have become more discreet...

840
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,730
and started to think more.

841
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,000
But I think that's only natural.

842
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,569
I don't want to become sad...

843
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,769
when we've come...

844
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,980
- all the way to Japan.
- True.

845
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,139
For now...

846
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,450
- Let's have fun today.
- Okay.

847
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,349
You're right.

848
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,249
- We'll hang out and...
- Why are you all gloomy?

849
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,250
- Me?
- Yes.

850
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,420
No, I'm not.

851
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,919
- No being gloomy.
- I'm not.

852
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,189
- Totally.
- I'm excited to hang out with you.

853
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,360
Okay, let's stay happy and bright.

854
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,030
- The houses are all so cute.
- Nice?

855
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,930
- Isn't the street pretty?
- Yes.

856
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,430
- How pretty.
- It's gorgeous.

857
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,440
What's this?

858
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,270
- Interesting. Let's go up.
- Interesting.

859
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,649
(A place where they can make and even eat soba)

860
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,779
How do I do it?

861
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,480
I'll help you with the apron.

862
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,620
- Blue? Brown?
- Any.

863
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,460
- Do you need help?
- Please tie it for me.

864
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,030
- Good?
- Yes.

865
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,470
There, all set.

866
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,870
The bandana.

867
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,809
(The bandana goes on after the apron.)

868
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,080
- The head?
- The forehead?

869
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,279
- Is this correct?
- Is this how to wear it?

870
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,880
It looks weird.

871
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,650
It's weird.

872
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,290
Like this.

873
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,919
- Fix it to your forehead.
- Okay.

874
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,219
(Woo Jin helps with Min Kyung's bandana.)

875
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,290
Okay.

876
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,899
- How is it?
- Good.

877
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,100
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

878
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,799
Why doesn't it cover my head?

879
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,770
(This time, Min Kyung helps tie Woo Jin's bandana.)

880
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,270
This looks wrong.

881
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,410
- Do I tie it?
- Tie it for me.

882
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,039
- Does it look good?
- Yes, just like that.

883
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,439
- It should look like this.
- Is this okay?

884
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,910
Yes, the ends need to go in.

885
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,810
- Good?
- Yes.

886
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,020
Okay.

887
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,089
(They start making the dough.)

888
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,890
- The color is becoming soba-like.
- Yes.

889
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,330
- It's lumping up.
- Right?

890
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,899
In one lump?

891
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,570
- Lump it together.
- Okay.

892
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,800
- You're good at it.
- Right?

893
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,700
Have you made one before?

894
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,439
- No, not even once.
- Really?

895
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,909
I've made macarons before.

896
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,080
Macarons?

897
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,109
Is it similar to how you make this?

898
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,249
Yes.

899
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,580
Okay.

900
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,149
In my early 20s,

901
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,260
I went to make macarons with Yoo Sik.

902
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,559
How to make soba was quite similar to it.

903
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,300
That's why it reminded me of Yoo Sik more.

904
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,670
- It's like I'm making pizza.
- Right?

905
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,470
Nice.

906
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:37,309
(They take turns spreading the dough thinly.)

907
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,570
- You're good at it.
- Right?

908
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,810
Let's cut it.

909
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,810
(Make soba noodles by cutting the dough.)

910
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
- Here I go.
- Okay.

911
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,220
- You're doing well.
- Right?

912
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,790
Nice.

913
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,959
- You're good.
- I know.

914
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,130
(Cutting it with the support from Woo Jin's compliment)

915
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,700
I give up.

916
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,300
- Should I do it?
- Yes, I give up.

917
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,410
(Woo Jin's cutting sound has a constant rhythm.)

918
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,880
- Good, aren't I?
- Yes.

919
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,179
- They look uniform.
- What?

920
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,310
The noodles are uniform.

921
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,190
You're really good at it.

922
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,590
(The soba noodles they made together are complete.)

923
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,759
I hope it's served soon.

924
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,900
You're hungry, right?

925
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,670
Let's dig in.

926
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,240
Bon appetit.

927
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,409
I don't think it's the noodles we made.

928
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,849
- No, I'm wrong.
- Isn't it what we made?

929
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,080
It looks weird.

930
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,720
- They're not uniform.
- It's weird.

931
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,420
You're right.

932
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,790
Who made this?

933
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,690
- Who made this?
- Probably me.

934
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,630
What?

935
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,570
(Woo Jin is enjoying the soba.)

936
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,209
- Is it tasty?
- Yes, it's very refreshing.

937
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,769
- Is it tasty?
- What?

938
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,840
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

939
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,280
Is there language of our own?

940
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,290
- Do you want onions?
- No.

941
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,160
- It filled us up, right?
- It was a nice meal.

942
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,260
Let's go.

943
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,760
Okay. Shall we go?

944
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,229
We're seeing a lot of water.

945
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,230
I know.

946
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,229
- We're making good memories.
- Seriously.

947
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,339
I really enjoyed painting too.

948
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,840
The water gun painting?

949
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,970
Shall we sit down?

950
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,010
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

951
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,949
Our outfit colors suit the sea.

952
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,779
- I know.
- It's like that for both of us.

953
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,849
- Right?
- We ended up with similar colors.

954
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:02,850
I know.

955
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,259
In any case, I talked to you first...

956
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,530
- at the airport.
- Right.

957
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,200
I felt like...

958
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,500
we should have more dates in Japan...

959
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,309
and check how we feel...

960
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,840
- about each other.
- I see.

961
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,710
To be honest, what weighs on my mind is this.

962
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,919
I don't think...

963
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,480
I'm entirely over my ex.

964
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,220
So I can't help but keep thinking...

965
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,089
whether it's right to meet someone new...

966
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:44,490
and open my heart so easily.

967
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,030
But I'm sure it's same for you.

968
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
You're right.

969
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,969
When I heard your words...

970
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,640
at the airport...

971
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,940
We had many dates together.

972
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,879
I enjoyed them and had fun.

973
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,949
I thought that it'd be nice...

974
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,910
to have more dates with you in Japan.

975
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,150
But on our last day in Pyeongchang-dong,

976
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,120
my decision became pretty firm.

977
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,259
Had I told you ahead of time,

978
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,329
you might've attempted...

979
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,900
to get to know someone else...

980
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,000
when you decided to open up to other men.

981
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,739
That weighed on my heart a bit.

982
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,840
- Right.
- Right.

983
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,909
My decision is...

984
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,950
- pretty firm.
- You want to get Ji Yeon back.

985
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,349
That way, I won't have any regrets.

986
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,760
So I made up my mind.

987
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,500
- Did you receive a text?
- I don't know.

988
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,999
(Female residents, recommend a date for your ex.)

989
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,140
(However, you cannot choose yourself.)

990
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,010
Hold on.

991
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,380
To be honest,

992
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:13,920
there was a woman I had on my mind since yesterday.

993
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,589
Yoo Sik seemed to be struggling a bit,

994
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,889
so I thought,

995
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,289
"I hope he enjoys his date with her..."

996
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,490
"and becomes comfortable."

997
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,700
(She finishes choosing a date for her ex.)

998
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,100
What do you want to do?

999
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,309
I think it'll be nice...

1000
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,010
to talk to Yoo Sik more.

1001
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,780
I don't know.

1002
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,050
I don't know yet. And...

1003
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,989
- It's hard.
- That's right. I think it's hard.

1004
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,020
I think it's hard. Seriously.

1005
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,859
I hope things work out. Seriously.

1006
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,860
That's right.

1007
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,789
But I can say this with certainty.

1008
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:02,329
I had fun when I was with you.

1009
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,270
- I felt the most relaxed.
- I see.

1010
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,940
- And...
- I was the same.

1011
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,409
If we end up going on a date again, let's have fun.

1012
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,410
That goes without saying.

1013
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,209
In any case, I root for you. I'm serious.

1014
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,210
Of course.

1015
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,280
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1016
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,990
The date definitely let us know about each other's positions...

1017
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,520
regarding whom we were after...

1018
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,190
and what thoughts we had.

1019
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,130
The date let us know about such things.

1020
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,199
My feelings for my ex...

1021
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,700
were buried in a corner of my heart.

1022
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,570
Talking to him...

1023
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,470
helped me ease those feelings.

1024
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,540
I felt relieved...

1025
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,680
and relaxed.

1026
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,350
In that case...

1027
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,049
- Now, they'll become friends...
- Yes.

1028
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,479
- who root for each other.
- Exactly.

1029
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,650
For goodness' sake.

1030
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,520
A high five wrapped it up.

1031
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,220
It's too bad.

1032
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,290
I hoped their hearts would flutter in Japan.

1033
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,700
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik's pick-a-date)

1034
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,369
(Kamakura goldsmith studio)

1035
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,139
Make a ring in Japan?

1036
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,180
I'm excited.

1037
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,879
I'm excited too.

1038
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,580
(They came to a studio where they can make couple's rings.)

1039
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,480
Shall I pick this one?

1040
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,590
- This one?
- Yes.

1041
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,359
Okay. These two.

1042
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,389
(They pick the ring designs they'll make today.)

1043
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,759
- Let's make one for each other.
- Okay.

1044
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,930
- It's for each other.
- Okay. Thank you.

1045
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,269
This is very thin.

1046
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,170
(They make the ring pattern first.)

1047
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,170
It's getting squished.

1048
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:52,410
(Hammering without hesitation)

1049
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,480
You're... You're strong.

1050
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,620
Watch your hands.

1051
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,720
What?

1052
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,190
Did it break?

1053
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,590
No.

1054
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,060
Don't we need to make sure it goes in?

1055
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,530
- Really?
- No?

1056
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,230
(The ring became as thin as a hairpin.)

1057
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,770
Aren't you too strong?

1058
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,370
Why does the ring look so small?

1059
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,400
Yours is much smaller, big sister.

1060
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,670
Why do you keep calling me "Big sister?"

1061
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:26,680
Yours is much smaller.

1062
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,819
I think it's becoming broader.

1063
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,950
It has become a lot broader.

1064
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,260
(Yoo Sik holds it so that Hyeon Ji won't get hurt.)

1065
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
What?

1066
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,270
It's in place.

1067
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,470
- Ready?
- Yes.

1068
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,570
Is it finished?

1069
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,409
- Finished.
- Finished? Okay.

1070
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,650
Let's see how well you made it.

1071
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,050
Here you go.

1072
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,580
Is it done?

1073
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,080
- Shall I open it?
- Open it.

1074
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,089
They're cute. Shall we take a photo?

1075
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,529
This is so funny.

1076
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,589
(The ring Hyeon Ji made is a bit crooked.)

1077
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,730
(Yoo Sik's ring Hyeon Ji made, Hyeon Ji's ring Yoo Shik made)

1078
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:22,800
This is...

1079
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,070
- They look similar.
- Really?

1080
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,540
Is the case for ours to take? Do we need to take out the rings?

1081
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,050
Maybe it won't go in. I see.

1082
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,979
- Does it fit perfectly?
- Yes.

1083
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,980
(They put on the rings they've made together.)

1084
00:53:39,981 --> 00:53:41,250
You made it well.

1085
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,420
Isn't it okay if you look at it like this?

1086
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,160
- Did I make it well?
- Yes.

1087
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,660
You made it well.

1088
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,860
I made it well.

1089
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,400
I liked it.

1090
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,170
Both Yoo Sik and I were...

1091
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,710
much more comfortable with each other.

1092
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,380
They were like couple's rings.

1093
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,350
It felt a bit strange.

1094
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,250
Among the studio dates I've been on...

1095
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,990
where I made things, this one was...

1096
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,660
the most meaningful.

1097
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,220
It was very nice.

1098
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,459
- Shall we go and eat?
- You're hungry, right?

1099
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,460
Yes.

1100
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,429
- They're pretty.
- They did a good job.

1101
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,699
On their ring fingers?

1102
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,499
On their ring fingers of their left hands?

1103
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,769
While making the couple's rings is impactful,

1104
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,379
I don't know if they'll wear them...

1105
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,609
back in the hotel...

1106
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,279
in front of other people.

1107
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,250
Hyeon Ji was wearing many rings...

1108
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,179
- Really?
- on her fingers.

1109
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,289
I don't think those rings stand out much.

1110
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,789
Their exes would know.

1111
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:52,790
"What's that ring?"

1112
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:54,589
- Their exes are bound to know.
- Yes.

1113
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,829
Sang Hyun, what would you do?

1114
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,929
Would you take it off on your way back because of your ex?

1115
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,329
Would you keep it on?

1116
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,299
I'd keep it on.

1117
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,970
That's why I can't wait for them to go back.

1118
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,740
Seriously, the couple's rings are intense.

1119
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,980
What did you do today?

1120
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,280
We had a meal and drank coffee together.

1121
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,520
What did you eat?

1122
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,750
The two of us? That came out wrong.

1123
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,060
We had Western cuisine.

1124
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,789
(Hyeon Ji is curious about Ji Hyeon and Yoo Sik's date.)

1125
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,260
You must be tired from having multiple dates.

1126
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,200
No.

1127
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,530
I came back early and lay down.

1128
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,980
(Glancing over)

1129
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,250
(Glancing over)

1130
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,090
She seemed to be a bit jealous.

1131
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,920
It didn't make me unhappy.

1132
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,899
"How was your date with Ji Hyeon? What did you eat?"

1133
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,800
I kept asking him such questions.

1134
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,830
Yoo Sik was a bit flustered.

1135
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,980
Yesterday, around 5pm,

1136
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,350
I was so out of it.

1137
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,749
It seemed that way.

1138
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,380
"What am I doing?"

1139
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,090
You kept avoiding my question.

1140
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,820
That was... Back then...

1141
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,630
What was that? You only asked me a question.

1142
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,330
I didn't mean to avoid your question.

1143
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,400
I'll answer it.

1144
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,000
I didn't know when I was in Seoul.

1145
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:50,509
There's someone I'm curious about,

1146
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,370
and there's someone who makes my heart flutter.

1147
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,410
I thought about whom I should choose.

1148
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,480
I think my heart is...

1149
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,690
with someone who makes my heart flutter.

1150
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,190
- Really?
- Yes.

1151
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,190
He's very careful,

1152
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,259
so I think it's possible to be like that.

1153
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,430
I don't have qualms about it.

1154
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,570
I'm waiting because he promised to tell me.

1155
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,610
(WeBase Kamakura Restaurant Kou)

1156
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,949
Did you see the writing inside?

1157
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,990
- No, I didn't.
- It's so tiny.

1158
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,060
I wanted to say something just now.

1159
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,700
We should read it when we go home.

1160
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,769
- What?
- We should read it when we go home.

1161
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:55,799
(Yoo Sik is curious about Hyeon Ji's introduction from her exes.)

1162
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,510
Read what?

1163
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,270
What else is there to read?

1164
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,680
Together?

1165
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,350
- You can call over other people.
- Are you curious?

1166
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,510
Yes.

1167
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,420
I'm curious too.

1168
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,550
About what?

1169
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,389
Other people's introductions?

1170
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,420
No, yours.

1171
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,920
Mine?

1172
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,730
Two letters?

1173
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,770
I'm so curious.

1174
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,940
I'm so curious too.

1175
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,339
You kept telling me that you were curious.

1176
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,410
About what?

1177
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
My introduction from my exes.

1178
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,180
I'm curious about what kind of person you are.

1179
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,650
So of course, I was curious.

1180
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,080
Not many days remain.

1181
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,590
Not many days remain?

1182
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,020
Are you confused?

1183
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,360
Is it because the one who makes you curious...

1184
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,729
and the one who makes your heart flutter are different?

1185
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,600
I hope I'm not making a verbal blunder.

1186
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,900
Get it together, Yoo Sik.

1187
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,900
Get it together before you speak.

1188
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,270
Did you stay up all night yesterday?

1189
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,840
I was joking.

1190
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,180
Hold on. Give me a bit of time to think.

1191
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,879
Let me talk for 20 seconds.

1192
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,920
I mean, let me think for 20 seconds.

1193
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,830
Have 20 seconds passed?

1194
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,260
What? I don't know.

1195
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,600
Talk to me when you want.

1196
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,339
- She's different from Ji Hyeon.
- I know.

1197
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,369
- She's totally different.
- The energy is different.

1198
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,009
- She's very different.
- The vibe is different.

1199
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,269
- He likes this one.
- They don't meet eyes very often.

1200
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,309
They can't look each other in the eye.

1201
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,539
- Are they embarrassed?
- It looks like...

1202
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,609
they're focusing on each other. They don't care about other people.

1203
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,319
- Totally.
- My heart flutters...

1204
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,480
when I watch them.

1205
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,090
(Kamakura House)

1206
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,889
- Hi.
- Hi.

1207
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,030
- Hi.
- Who do we have here?

1208
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,330
Hello.

1209
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,130
Hey.

1210
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,899
What did you guys eat?

1211
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,999
(The two who stayed home are curious about the date.)

1212
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,739
We had pizza and other things.

1213
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,639
Did you eat near Kamakura?

1214
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,209
It was 15 minutes from here.

1215
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,440
- By car?
- Yes. It was close.

1216
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,210
Well done.

1217
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,879
Did you have a talk with Hyeon Ji yesterday?

1218
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,950
Yes, I did.

1219
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,049
I just...

1220
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,449
(Baek Hyun is curious about Hyeon Ji and Seung Yong's talk.)

1221
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,489
I just told her to make a decision she'd be happy about...

1222
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,389
even though I couldn't root for her.

1223
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,830
- What did she say?
- What?

1224
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,230
She said okay.

1225
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,300
Hyeon Ji will hate it if the two of us become close.

1226
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,740
Did you ask her if she wanted to get back together with me?

1227
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,579
- I didn't ask her that.
- No?

1228
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,410
We just talked about ourselves.

1229
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,909
I need to have a talk with her too.

1230
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,749
There's something we need to go over for sure.

1231
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,280
- Like what?
- Well...

1232
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,120
I want to ask her if she wants to get back together...

1233
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,560
with me.

1234
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,200
A yes or no answer will finish things.

1235
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,439
If she gives me an unclear answer...

1236
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,800
(Baek Hyun is curious about Hyeon Ji's thoughts.)

1237
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,439
How did you and Hyeon Ji meet?

1238
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,479
I went on a trip...

1239
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,050
to Japan.

1240
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,920
My friend was Hyeon Ji's friend.

1241
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,920
They weren't best friends.

1242
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,520
Hyeon Ji was in Japan for fun.

1243
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,429
My friend asked Hyeon Ji to drink with us.

1244
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,829
That was how we met.

1245
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,999
You guys met in a very romantic way.

1246
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,269
- What?
- You guys met in a romantic way...

1247
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:44,270
during a trip.

1248
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:45,900
That's right. We met during a trip.

1249
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,839
I bet she was very shy back then.

1250
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,910
That's right.

1251
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,279
I fell for that side.

1252
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,640
- The shy side?
- Yes.

1253
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,749
"How could she be so coy..."

1254
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,410
"and feminine?"

1255
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,080
"How could there be someone like her?"

1256
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,389
She's very pretty too.

1257
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,420
That's right. She has great looks.

1258
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,360
It looks like...

1259
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,560
You always drink tea.

1260
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,900
You lead a very structured life.

1261
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,830
I'm guessing that you're very neat.

1262
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:19,430
But Hyeon Ji is very easygoing.

1263
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,400
The state of her house?

1264
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,670
You understood what I meant right away.

1265
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,710
She's easygoing. In that sense,

1266
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,049
did you guys get along?

1267
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,409
I ignored those things.

1268
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,050
I told her to clean up,

1269
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,579
but she found it hard.

1270
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,020
Is her vanity the same?

1271
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,550
Does her vanity get crazy?

1272
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,560
It isn't just the vanity. It's the entire room.

1273
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,130
You understand right away.

1274
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,930
Easygoing? The state of her house?

1275
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,230
I just called her easygoing.

1276
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,530
You were like, "The state of her house?"

1277
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,070
- Have you met her mom?
- Yes.

1278
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,310
- Have you met her dad as well?
- Yes.

1279
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,650
Did you want to marry her as well?

1280
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,380
Yes, of course.

1281
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,420
If you get back together with her and marry her...

1282
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,790
What?

1283
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,830
It'll be fascinating.

1284
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,929
When I actually saw you...

1285
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,069
I wanted to get back with Hyeon Ji,

1286
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,239
so I worried that I'd go berserk...

1287
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,639
and make some kind of a mistake upon seeing you.

1288
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,970
I thought about that a lot.

1289
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,680
Gosh, she's like a drug.

1290
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,219
- This is fun.
- Seriously.

1291
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,889
- They look comfortable.
- Seriously.

1292
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,620
I've never seen a conversation like that.

1293
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,530
I'll need to hang out with Yun Nyeong soon.

1294
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,860
Me?

1295
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,970
It has been too long.

1296
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,300
- You're right.
- Right?

1297
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,400
Shall we hang out tonight?

1298
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,770
Sure.

1299
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,740
Now... What's this?

1300
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,349
(Female residents, take turns...)

1301
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:16,020
(and recommend a date for your ex right now.)

1302
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,369
Which way should we go?

1303
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,370
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1304
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,170
- The ones at the end should.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1305
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,140
- Why? What are they doing?
- Which way?

1306
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,080
Why? What are we doing?

1307
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,480
I'll go first.

1308
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,550
We had to pick your dates.

1309
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,020
What?

1310
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,060
They had to pick their dates, the opposite of yesterday.

1311
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,220
Directly?

1312
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:01,060
(My date picked by my ex)

1313
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,200
Baek Hyun...

1314
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,310
Baek Hyun gets to go with Yun Nyeong.

1315
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,440
(Baek Hyun's date is Yun Nyeong.)

1316
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,580
Hyeon Ji chose my date.

1317
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,320
And her picking my date...

1318
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:25,990
felt strange.

1319
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,420
At first,

1320
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,260
it was heartbreaking that his date wasn't me.

1321
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:36,060
And watching the two together wasn't easy.

1322
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,370
But Baek Hyun sticking to one person...

1323
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,340
made me think he was cool.

1324
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,970
That was why I chose Yun Nyeong for Baek Hyun.

1325
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,279
- What?
- Really?

1326
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,209
That gave off the vibe, "I'm over you."

1327
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:51,209
- Yes, exactly.
- If anything.

1328
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,879
- Right, well done.
- Nice.

1329
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,120
- Will things finally settle?
- Yes.

1330
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,390
Seung Yong...

1331
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,790
gets to go with Ji Hyeon.

1332
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,890
(Seung Yong's date is Ji Hyeon.)

1333
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,670
Rather than feeling grateful,

1334
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,339
it felt like she chose Ji Hyeon...

1335
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:22,809
because Hyeon Ji hopes things will work out between us.

1336
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,010
So that made me think,

1337
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,020
"Does she really not want to get back together?"

1338
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,790
Woo Jin's date...

1339
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,940
will be Yun Nyeong.

1340
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,570
That's who I picked.

1341
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:56,180
(Woo Jin's date is Yun Nyeong.)

1342
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,050
- What?
- Gosh.

1343
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,319
Goodness.

1344
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,620
My gosh.

1345
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,149
Are Ji Yeon's true feelings toward Woo Jin?

1346
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,859
If she was over him...

1347
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,219
- and didn't care, - Gosh.

1348
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,889
Ji Yeon would've picked Min Kyung.

1349
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,659
- Min Kyung is an eyesore to her.
- She has feelings for Woo Jin.

1350
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,730
Right?

1351
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,270
It was hard to decide at first.

1352
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:25,240
But letting him go on a date with Min Kyung...

1353
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:27,940
felt wrong.

1354
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,210
That was why I picked Yun Nyeong.

1355
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,480
It didn't make me happy.

1356
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,550
(Yun Nyeong has two dates tomorrow.)

1357
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,630
For Yoo Sik's date, I picked...

1358
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,829
"Will Min Kyung pick me?"

1359
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,240
That was what I wondered about more.

1360
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,740
- Yun Nyeong.
- What?

1361
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,550
Yun Nyeong.

1362
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,850
Is Yun Nyeong going on three dates?

1363
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,560
Yun Nyeong.

1364
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,190
She's going on breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates.

1365
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,330
As Hyeon Ji was someone I was concerned about,

1366
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:28,570
I was sure not to pick her.

1367
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,410
The same goes for Ji Hyeon.

1368
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:34,079
When I thought of someone...

1369
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,739
I didn't mind,

1370
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,750
it was Yun Nyeong.

1371
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,750
As I'm still attached to Yoo Sik,

1372
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,320
I didn't want things to work out...

1373
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:47,060
with someone he was getting along with.

1374
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,820
That's another reason I picked Yun Nyeong.

1375
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,069
I clearly realized that Min Kyung...

1376
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,270
was bothered by me...

1377
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,570
quite a lot.

1378
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,640
It made me more uncomfortable.

1379
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,010
You're going to be busy, Yun Nyeong.

1380
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:15,050
Seems like you’ve got breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates lined up.

1381
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,679
- What?
- Does Yun Nyeong have three dates?

1382
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,250
- Yes, three.
- Three?

1383
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,720
I'm relieved.

1384
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:25,760
I heard Yun Nyeong couldn't go on dates with the others.

1385
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,799
By going on those dates,

1386
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
she won't mention something similar again.

1387
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,300
Either way, Min Kyung didn't pick me out of good intentions.

1388
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:39,940
It was so that we'd simply hang out and have fun.

1389
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,279
Three dates in one day?

1390
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,080
It's not something I will experience elsewhere.

1391
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,750
"I'll just have fun," was what crossed my mind.

1392
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,490
(This time, it's Yun Nyeong's turn to pick.)

1393
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:56,320
As Jae Hyeong's date, I pick...

1394
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,890
Hyeon Ji.

1395
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:04,700
(Jae Hyeong's date is Hyeon Ji.)

1396
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,040
I was happy and grateful.

1397
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,880
(Ji Hyeon is the last to pick.)

1398
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,680
As...

1399
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,350
Won Kyu's date, I pick...

1400
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,460
Min Kyung.

1401
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,070
Who?

1402
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,270
- Min Kyung.
- Me?

1403
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,580
Baek... Who?

1404
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,840
- Won Kyu.
- With Won Kyu?

1405
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,909
(Won Kyu's date is Min Kyung.)

1406
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:53,050
You're going skiing.

1407
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,250
Are you going skiing?

1408
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,520
For real?

1409
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:06,760
(The decisions contain feelings that can't be hidden.)

1410
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,700
It was a shocker.

1411
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,030
I let her have a date with the guy she wanted.

1412
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,470
But why did my ex choose Min Kyung out of the blue?

1413
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:21,310
I found myself unable...

1414
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:24,280
to send him off with Ji Yeon.

1415
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,520
It made me uneasy.

1416
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,550
I think it's jealousy.

1417
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,919
If the Ji Hyeon I know made such a decision,

1418
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,820
she must have felt...

1419
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,500
The lingering feelings...

1420
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,860
I don't know. I can't talk right now.

1421
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:56,140
(All the dates have been decided.)

1422
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,109
I... Everyone.

1423
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,910
Why are guys and girls so different?

1424
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,719
- You see...
- The male residents...

1425
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,720
picked the dates...

1426
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:04,119
- the females wanted.
- They did.

1427
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,349
You're right.

1428
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,019
- Would you do it?
- I would.

1429
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,589
- Pick someone he wants?
- The date he wants.

1430
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,219
- And you, Yura?
- If I'm not over him,

1431
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,959
then a flat no.

1432
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,929
Yes, exactly. That's why it turned out that way.

1433
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:14,959
You're right.

1434
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,169
I guess the female residents...

1435
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,929
were somewhat honest about their feelings.

1436
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,899
- True.
- They put aside loyalty...

1437
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,869
and chose based on their feelings.

1438
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,010
Nice.

1439
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,979
- I don't know.
- How about a 3-on-1 date?

1440
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,380
I'm okay with it.

1441
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,379
- Right? That's why...
- I don't want that.

1442
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,609
- In Italy...
- Then I'll go on...

1443
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:33,850
a 2-on-1 date with Woo Jin.

1444
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,450
How about getting some gukbap?

1445
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,620
- What?
- Get some gukbap.

1446
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,620
I'm in.

1447
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,419
- Gukbap...
- We can have gukbap and soju.

1448
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,020
Shall we? Okay.

1449
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,519
How about a 3-on-1?

1450
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,890
And then a separate one.

1451
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:47,730
That's hilarious.

1452
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,069
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

1453
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,539
(Let them know via text.)

1454
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,140
(Your text will be delivered with your name.)

1455
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:03,610
(The day was filled with mixed feelings.)

1456
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,979
(The only one...)

1457
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:13,450
(who made my heart flutter today)

1458
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,690
(All messages have been sent.)

1459
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:21,199
- Hold on a minute.
- What is it?

1460
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,759
At this rate, Woo Jin...

1461
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,269
has to send it to Ji Yeon again.

1462
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,299
- Of course.
- No doubt.

1463
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,869
She left some room.

1464
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:28,969
Once again, Ji Yeon...

1465
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,669
- Today is important.
- Calmly...

1466
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,009
- It's critical.
- Yes.

1467
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,610
I'm also curious about Yoo Sik's text.

1468
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:38,109
I hope my date isn't early in the morning tomorrow.

1469
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:39,150
What?

1470
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,320
You should just go for it.

1471
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,220
No, I don't care.

1472
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,150
(Baek Hyun)

1473
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:46,919
(I like being with you, Oppa.)

1474
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,089
She's driving me nuts.

1475
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,930
(The message is from Choi Yun Nyeong.)

1476
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,100
"Oppa."

1477
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,010
Yes, I like it.

1478
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,040
That title makes my heart flutter.

1479
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,739
"Oppa" doesn't mean much.

1480
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,980
I even have a little sister, but it feels different.

1481
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,750
I feel like I'm someone important.

1482
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,850
I couldn't understand my friends before.

1483
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,620
I thought, "What's so nice about being called oppa?"

1484
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:27,160
Yun Nyeong challenges many of my preconceived notions.

1485
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,800
(Yun Nyeong)

1486
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:35,969
(I hope this trip in Japan leaves you with great memories.)

1487
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,610
(The message is from Sung Baek Hyun.)

1488
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,550
(As always, the two exchanged messages with each other.)

1489
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:01,830
(Your ex picked Sung Baek Hyun.)

1490
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,370
(Your ex picked Choi Yun Nyeong.)

1491
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,640
You two take so many photos.

1492
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,180
Yun Nyeong also has a bunch of photos on her phone.

1493
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:24,220
(Hyeon Ji)

1494
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:25,949
(Let's talk before going to bed like we did yesterday.)

1495
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:26,950
(Get ready to have fun tomorrow.)

1496
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,860
(The message is from Lee Jae Hyeong.)

1497
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,060
I sent a text to Hyeon Ji.

1498
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:35,630
(Jae Hyeong sent a text to Hyeon Ji two days in a row.)

1499
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,629
(Hyeon Ji)

1500
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,200
- No, that's not it.
- No?

1501
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,699
(The new Mario Kart by Nintendo just came out.)

1502
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,869
(I want to play it with you.)

1503
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,240
(Your ex picked you.)

1504
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,109
And the queen...

1505
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,110
When we were in a relationship,

1506
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:52,880
we often made bets when we played games.

1507
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:57,749
We usually made bets by playing Mario Kart.

1508
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:01,259
I wanted to bring back some memories.

1509
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:04,490
I also sent it, hoping that...

1510
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,800
it'd make her smile a little.

1511
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,370
I was surprised to get a text from Seung Yong.

1512
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,340
I told him that I was interested in Yoo Sik.

1513
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:19,369
"Seung Yong is making a lot of effort."

1514
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,640
That's what I thought.

1515
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,579
(Seung Yong's text leaves a lot on her mind.)

1516
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,550
At night...

1517
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,280
Are you all right?

1518
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,990
Will you be able to get up at 7am today?

1519
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,690
- Why are you crying?
- What?

1520
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,730
I'm not crying.

1521
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:39,690
You were crying a lot.

1522
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,060
- That wasn't me.
- You looked pretty while crying.

1523
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,160
- What?
- You looked pretty while crying.

1524
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:44,230
That wasn't me.

1525
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,399
Min Kyung, let's eat something delicious tomorrow.

1526
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,669
- I'm so excited.
- Is it tomorrow?

1527
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,999
What if you cry again?

1528
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,439
- What?
- What if you cry again?

1529
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,170
Don't be ridiculous. Be quiet.

1530
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,640
- Won Kyu.
- What?

1531
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,580
- Did you cry?
- I never did.

1532
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,179
- I never cried.
- Seriously?

1533
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,480
Never mind. It was in my dream.

1534
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,450
Really?

1535
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,120
It won the Academy Award.

1536
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,760
(Let me know if you want ramyeon later.)

1537
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:12,960
(Your ex picked you.)

1538
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,129
- It's Mr. Ramyeon.
- Gosh.

1539
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,069
- My goodness.
- No, it's the Lamen Boy.

1540
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,869
Is making ramyeon all you can do?

1541
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,599
- Ramyeon.
- Goodness.

1542
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,540
It changed from ramyeon to lamen.

1543
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,139
No, it changed to ramen.

1544
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,309
You're doing the right thing, Woo Jin.

1545
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,180
It's really heartbreaking.

1546
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,750
(Let me know if you want ramyeon later.)

1547
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,950
(Your ex picked you.)

1548
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,260
(She got a text from her ex again today.)

1549
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:58,840
(To whom Ji Yeon sent her text)

1550
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,310
This is really important.

1551
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,739
- It's very important.
- Who could it be?

1552
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,779
This is very important.

1553
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:04,950
Didn't she send it to Woo Jin?

1554
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,320
(Woo Jin)

1555
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,050
(Won Kyu)

1556
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,019
(Do you like the plate this time?)

1557
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,859
(The message is from Hong Ji Yeon)

1558
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,889
But anyway...

1559
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:20,690
Today, my heart is pointing at Won Kyu.

1560
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,830
So I sent him a text.

1561
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,000
Won Kyu gets better the more you get to know him.

1562
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,870
Also, we get along very well.

1563
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,010
(Ji Yeon sends a text to Won Kyu after a day.)

1564
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:41,449
(I support you!)

1565
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,150
(The message is from Kwak Min Kyung.)

1566
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,949
(Woo Jin received a message from Min Kyung.)

1567
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:49,490
It's really...

1568
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,590
(Your ex picked Kim Woo Jin.)

1569
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,570
(Your ex picked Jung Won Kyu.)

1570
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,470
I found out that she picked Won Kyu.

1571
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:10,840
"She must still have feelings for Won Kyu."

1572
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,880
That's what I thought.

1573
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:20,690
(Their hearts are pointing in different directions every day.)

1574
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:28,029
(Ji Hyeon)

1575
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,500
It's better to keep it.

1576
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,270
(What's going on?)

1577
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:36,640
(Your ex picked you.)

1578
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,580
(Won Kyu sent a text to Ji Hyeon.)

1579
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:47,080
For her, I picked the person she wanted for her date.

1580
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,850
I thought, "Why is she interfering with my date?"

1581
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,159
(Again today, )

1582
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,660
(Ji Yeon and Won Kyu missed each other.)

1583
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:08,240
(Yoo Sik)

1584
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,999
(Did you get an answer?)

1585
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,739
(Have a good time with your date tomorrow.)

1586
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,770
(Thank you for coming to my Talking Room. From Ji Hyeon)

1587
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:19,750
(He got a text from two people.)

1588
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,460
(Hyeon Ji)

1589
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,429
(It's you.)

1590
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:42,400
(The message is from Cho Yoo Sik.)

1591
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,280
- What?
- Cho Yoo Sik?

1592
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,450
"It's you."

1593
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,849
- What?
- Gosh, my heart.

1594
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,979
- You made my heart flutter.
- It's you.

1595
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:59,219
Yoo Sik is the youngest among all the residents.

1596
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,789
- Right.
- It's intense to call...

1597
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:02,589
- an older woman like that.
- "It's you."

1598
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:05,559
- Here's why it feels powerful, - Guilty Cho.

1599
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,130
And it makes our hearts flutter.

1600
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,429
- There's certainty in the text.
- That's right.

1601
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,069
It clearly shows his feelings.

1602
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:13,169
That's why it could make her heart flutter.

1603
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,599
The text shows that...

1604
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,399
- Right.
- he'll go after her.

1605
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,769
Yoo Sik is guilty.

1606
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,270
Yes, he's Guilty Cho.

1607
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,509
(It's you.)

1608
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:27,350
(The message is from Cho Yoo Sik.)

1609
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:38,029
I wanted to express my feelings in the text.

1610
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,960
I thought that...

1611
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,730
it would be clearer that way.

1612
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,170
That's why I wrote, "It's you."

1613
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,210
Those words made...

1614
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,070
my heart flutter.

1615
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:56,079
For him to point it out clearly...

1616
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,010
when he's someone who doesn't show his feelings.

1617
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:13,690
"It's not me."

1618
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:16,300
He's guilty.

1619
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:18,230
He's Guilty Cho.

1620
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,769
- What?
- What?

1621
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,609
- I just said that.
- What? Guilty Cho.

1622
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:26,640
Guilty Cho.

1623
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,149
- Goodness.
- The meaning is different.

1624
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,179
What?

1625
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,609
- The meaning is different, - Guilty Cho.

1626
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:34,720
But she called him Guilty Cho.

1627
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,850
- He made our hearts flutter.
- That's so funny.

1628
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:38,249
- That's why he's Guilty Cho.
- That's why he's guilty.

1629
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,689
- She meant it differently.
- He did something wrong.

1630
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:40,849
He didn't send her a text, so he's Guilty Cho.

1631
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:41,889
- He's guilty of something else.
- Guilty Cho?

1632
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,920
We thought the same.

1633
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,890
Guilty Cho sounds so funny.

1634
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:51,600
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1635
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,470
- What?
- Nothing.

1636
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,710
(Your ex picked Park Hyeon Ji.)

1637
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,750
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1638
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,089
(Someone's happiness is...)

1639
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,560
(unpleasant tonight.)

1640
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,000
(They found out each other's honest feelings again today.)

1641
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,100
Why did you make that decision?

1642
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,239
I'll make it short.

1643
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,810
(Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon came in to have a talk.)

1644
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:39,180
I didn't want to set you up with Ji Yeon.

1645
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:40,850
You went on many dates with her already.

1646
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,180
But I picked the one you wanted.

1647
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:48,190
- I didn't want to.
- Goodness.

1648
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,659
You don't even...

1649
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:54,559
bring up the subject of getting back together.

1650
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,000
So why are you trying to interfere?

1651
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,429
If I had picked Ji Yeon,

1652
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,100
would you have felt better?

1653
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:02,499
No, I'm just curious.

1654
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,170
I'm wondering why you made that decision.

1655
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,070
I don't know why.

1656
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:09,079
You say that you like someone else...

1657
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,040
while getting in the way of my date.

1658
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,620
I asked whom you wanted for your date.

1659
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,249
I didn't have time to ask you.

1660
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,989
Okay, that's true.

1661
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:21,259
We were told to pick right away.

1662
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,689
That's true, but...

1663
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,160
I didn't want to set you up with her.

1664
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,789
You never send me a text,

1665
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:28,900
and you want to get in my way?

1666
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:34,429
We had a huge fight yesterday.

1667
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:37,039
If I say that I like you today,

1668
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,809
wouldn't that make me strange?

1669
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,139
It was only a question.

1670
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:42,110
Even after our fight yesterday, I sent you a text.

1671
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,140
You sent it to complain.

1672
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,079
Why would I send it just to complain?

1673
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,610
I could've complained by talking to you.

1674
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,749
Why would I send you a text...

1675
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,020
just to complain...

1676
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,950
and make Ji Yeon feel bad?

1677
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,160
Why would I send you a text without a reason?

1678
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,490
Then why did you send it to me?

1679
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:00,630
I still have feelings for you.

1680
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,469
He ended up confessing his feelings.

1681
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:09,739
- What happened to you, Won Kyu?
- "I still have feelings for you."

1682
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,269
Why did he sound so sweet when saying that?

1683
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:14,339
Why do you find that attractive?

1684
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,979
There's a certain energy...

1685
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,879
- between them.
- I agree.

1686
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,879
- There's something mature.
- There's something mature.

1687
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,649
Why is Won Kyu...

1688
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,049
so insistent about Ji Hyeon?

1689
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:26,589
- It's just...
- He just likes her.

1690
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:29,859
Even if you don't get along, you can't help being...

1691
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:30,860
- Right.
- attracted to him.

1692
01:25:30,861 --> 01:25:32,659
- He has always liked her.
- Yes.

1693
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,229
He should make it work with Ji Yeon instead.

1694
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,700
By the way, no...

1695
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:38,830
(I still have feelings for you.)

1696
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:42,700
You show your interest in Yoo Sik.

1697
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,910
And I have to witness that.

1698
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,740
I just thanked him for coming to my Talking Room.

1699
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:51,710
That's nothing.

1700
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,179
You told me not to send useless texts,

1701
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,350
and you do the same?

1702
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,250
Yoo Sik told me today that he came...

1703
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,790
into my Talking Room.

1704
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,720
It made me happy and thankful.

1705
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,730
I didn't think that he was there.

1706
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:09,200
Oh, really?

1707
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:14,230
I thought that I was interested in Yoo Sik,

1708
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,870
but I'll stop myself from now on.

1709
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:22,040
That doesn't mean that you're interested in me now.

1710
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,710
I don't know about you, but here's how I feel.

1711
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,080
You showed interest in someone else.

1712
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,950
You made it...

1713
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,720
obvious at times.

1714
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,260
You even told me that you were interested in someone.

1715
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,960
That didn't make me feel good.

1716
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,460
And...

1717
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,870
on top of that,

1718
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:48,239
you never said that you wanted to get back together.

1719
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,670
You didn't even send me a text,

1720
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,270
but you interfered with my date.

1721
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,810
I don't have to want to get back together...

1722
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:00,710
or send you a text in order to get in your way.

1723
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:02,279
No, you don't have to.

1724
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,350
So what is it that you want?

1725
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:06,719
- Without doing those things...
- Then...

1726
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,960
let me explain the timeline of my feelings.

1727
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:20,730
I just found out Yoo Sik's feelings through text.

1728
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,240
What did you find out?

1729
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,710
I think Yoo Sik is interested in Hyeon Ji,

1730
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:28,240
so I'll stop...

1731
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,810
I wish him happiness.

1732
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,180
You wish him happiness but not me?

1733
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,620
- I know.
- It feels like this.

1734
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,729
Now that things are over...

1735
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:46,890
between you and him, you care about me.

1736
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:48,500
That's not true.

1737
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,029
I cared about you before things ended with him...

1738
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:53,400
according to my timeline.

1739
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,340
I didn't pick Min Kyung...

1740
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,970
after finding out...

1741
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:00,770
that Yoo Sik chose Hyeon Ji,

1742
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,480
In other words,

1743
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:07,780
it's true that I was interested in Yoo Sik.

1744
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:12,320
If Yoo Sik says that he's interested in Hyeon Ji,

1745
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:16,060
I'd be happy to let him go.

1746
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,660
I'm not sure.

1747
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,160
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how I feel exactly.

1748
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,670
I'm very sorry.

1749
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:31,770
I didn't keep my manners.

1750
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:34,440
You wanted to...

1751
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:39,080
decide the direction after checking who he sent the text to.

1752
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:43,420
I didn't want to lie to your face.

1753
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:45,920
About what?

1754
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,390
All of a sudden,

1755
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,560
I can't say, "No, I wasn't interested in Yoo Sik."

1756
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,790
That's not what I mean.

1757
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:54,830
I knew.

1758
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,800
I knew that you were interested in him. You made it obvious.

1759
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,470
Even today...

1760
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:00,170
That's not true.

1761
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:03,899
I'm saying this to make the timeline clear.

1762
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,970
The fact that you sent him a text today...

1763
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:09,439
I wanted to send a text to Yoo Sik today.

1764
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,810
I didn't know how he felt.

1765
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:13,880
About deciding the date for my ex,

1766
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:17,319
I got the notice much before sending the text.

1767
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:20,249
The reason why you wanted to send him a text...

1768
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,319
I understand that it bothered you...

1769
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,890
to set me on a date with Ji Yeon.

1770
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,030
You sent a text to Yoo Sik...

1771
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,299
because you thought...

1772
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,399
that Yoo Sik could still be interested in you.

1773
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,529
I thought that he was interested in me.

1774
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:33,699
Yes, that's why you sent it.

1775
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,799
I didn't have a doubt about it.

1776
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,540
After sending him a text,

1777
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,170
you didn't get any in return.

1778
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:42,679
If things work out between you and Yoo Sik,

1779
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,149
you would be happy. That's what you wanted.

1780
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:46,650
And you wanted to get in my way too.

1781
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,550
Isn't that true?

1782
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,660
I won't deny it.

1783
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,430
Okay.

1784
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,100
Is our talk over?

1785
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,499
What more can I say after hearing this?

1786
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,300
(Won Kyu doesn't continue talking with her.)

1787
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,440
Here's what I found...

1788
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,180
very strange in our conversation.

1789
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,810
My ex sent a text to Yoo Sik.

1790
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,149
She thanked him for coming into her Talking Room...

1791
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,550
in the text.

1792
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,990
I don't get why she feels thankful for that.

1793
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:32,390
She sent him a text to show her interest in him.

1794
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,760
As she didn't get a text in return,

1795
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,929
she didn't feel interested in him as much as before.

1796
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,130
That's how I interpreted it.

1797
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:44,569
Despite that, she even got in the way...

1798
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:45,710
of my date.

1799
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,479
I thought that it was odd.

1800
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,640
(My ex's behavior was odd.)

1801
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,250
(Room 205, Yellow Room, Ji Yeon and Hyeon Ji's room)

1802
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,990
(Glancing)

1803
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,800
(Two introductions of her exes that she hasn't read caught her eyes.)

1804
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:22,180
I thought that I should read them alone when I have time.

1805
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,540
Yoo Sik sent me...

1806
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:31,350
a message that made his feelings clear.

1807
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:33,820
A weight was lifted off my chest.

1808
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:39,390
(She hesitated to read them until she felt relieved.)

1809
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,700
(She reads the introduction written by Seung Yong first.)

1810
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,969
(In a word, my ex is like a child. She's so honest with...)

1811
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:56,039
(her feelings that she doesn't confuse the other person.)

1812
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,179
(At first, she's shy, quiet, and avoids eye contact.)

1813
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,209
(When you get to know her, she talks a lot and acts cute.)

1814
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:02,120
(She tends to act silly and cute without reserve.)

1815
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,759
(A small gift or letter makes her happier than any other present.)

1816
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,130
(What she wanted the most was affection, interest, and empathy.)

1817
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,559
(My ex is innocent and honest like a child.)

1818
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,930
(She can also be mature. She's an attractive person.)

1819
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,140
(She also reads her introduction written by Baek Hyun.)

1820
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,889
(If I had to love someone in this world, )

1821
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:41,689
(I'd love one with pure eyes, and my ex had pure eyes.)

1822
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,659
(I still can't forget the day I met her for the first time.)

1823
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,289
(My ex had pure eyes and a beautiful smile.)

1824
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:46,729
(She more than deserved my love.)

1825
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,599
(When I was going through the hardest time of my life, )

1826
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,699
(I was most comforted by my ex's warmth.)

1827
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,530
(She taught me how to accept comfort when I struggled to lean on anyone.)

1828
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:56,770
It felt a little weird.

1829
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:02,009
When I dated Baek Hyun,

1830
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,380
I was in my early 20s.

1831
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:08,010
It brought me old memories from those days.

1832
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:12,490
Thinking about those days makes me feel sentimental.

1833
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,289
(My ex is warm-hearted by nature. That's why I want her...)

1834
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,059
(to meet someone of similar nature and be happy with him.)

1835
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,729
(There were times when my ex and I fought endlessly.)

1836
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:20,889
(We hurt each other by saying mean things to each other, )

1837
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,300
(and in the end, we decided to break up.)

1838
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,899
(The symbol of hydrangeas is sincerity.)

1839
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:28,069
(I want my ex to have only happy days here...)

1840
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:30,799
(from the bottom of my heart like the symbol of hydrangeas.)

1841
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,469
(Hydrangeas are her favorite flower.)

1842
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:36,280
(Hydrangeas are her favorite flower.)

1843
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:44,980
(The introduction transports her back to their relationship.)

1844
01:33:53,090 --> 01:34:00,500
(A short letter awakens the memories of their past.)

1845
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:12,850
(She checks the farewell package.)

1846
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:30,559
(The farewell package...)

1847
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,200
(comes in a strangely shaped box.)

1848
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,780
(Exhaling)

1849
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:11,240
(The farewell package from Baek Hyun, crutches)

1850
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:20,009
(She only stares at them...)

1851
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:23,750
(as she can't bring herself to take them out.)

1852
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:27,090
Oh, no.

1853
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:53,479
The moment I saw the crutches in the package box...

1854
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,250
broke my heart.

1855
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,989
When Baek Hyun was dating me,

1856
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:02,160
he injured his legs, so he had to use crutches.

1857
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:04,989
Someone whom I really cared about...

1858
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,830
went through a very difficult time when we dated.

1859
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,799
So it brought back old memories.

1860
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,199
(With the farewell package...)

1861
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,869
It was heartbreaking to see them.

1862
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:15,170
(the memories of enduring the pain rushed back.)

1863
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,870
I'm sure dating me...

1864
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,410
must have been tough on Hyeon Ji...

1865
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:24,080
because I couldn't walk for long since I was on crutches.

1866
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,750
She kept my side when I was in pain.

1867
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,290
So I was really grateful.

1868
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,489
- Gosh, he gave back the crutches.
- My gosh.

1869
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:39,429
- The crutches...
- That's crazy.

1870
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:41,329
- That's crazy.
- They were crutches.

1871
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:42,599
- Why did he give them back?
- Gosh, the crutches.

1872
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,599
He sent back their moments together.

1873
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,700
To Baek Hyun, the crutches must mean a lot.

1874
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,499
- Right.
- When he was injured,

1875
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,700
- she stayed by his side.
- She kept his side.

1876
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:53,139
He doesn't want her to forget about him then.

1877
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,939
- That has to be it.
- Right. Sending them back...

1878
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,840
- doesn't mean, "Forget me." - Right. Exactly.

1879
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:00,350
That's just crazy.

1880
01:37:12,490 --> 01:37:18,160
(There's one more item at the bottom of the box.)

1881
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,540
He gave back the keyring.

1882
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,640
Seung Yong made it for me.

1883
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:29,640
The keyring had my picture on it.

1884
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:44,960
I thought, "The keyring? Why did he want to give this back?"

1885
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,360
We used each other's pictures for the keyrings.

1886
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:54,330
Hyeon Ji kept 1, and I kept 1 too.

1887
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:57,170
Actually, the thing is,

1888
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:01,810
I used the keyring for my car key.

1889
01:38:01,870 --> 01:38:04,280
So I always had it with me.

1890
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:09,280
The keyring had Hyeon Ji's face on it.

1891
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:16,620
But...

1892
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:34,310
I no longer...

1893
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:39,480
needed that. So...

1894
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,780
I returned it to her.

1895
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:01,399
(She takes another look at the keyring...)

1896
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,870
(that is no longer a pair.)

1897
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,730
We talked late last night.

1898
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:27,559
She wanted you back at first.

1899
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,960
(She wanted you back at first.)

1900
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:30,900
Really?

1901
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,540
But she didn't express what she wanted to me at all.

1902
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,199
Well, I don't know.

1903
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,010
- I wouldn't know that much.
- Really? She wanted me back?

1904
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:43,010
Right. When she moved in, she wanted to get back together...

1905
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:45,710
with you, Baek Hyun.

1906
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:50,150
She wanted to get back together with you in the beginning.

1907
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:54,520
She was honest with you and told you she wanted me back.

1908
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:56,320
You know?

1909
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,530
Don't get mad. Come on.

1910
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,630
I told her she was honest.

1911
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:13,169
I don't know what she's honest about, though.

1912
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,240
Is that so?

1913
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:17,839
Well, she wears her heart on her sleeve.

1914
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,950
When she's around you?

1915
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,380
She opens up about her emotions.

1916
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,919
So she expressed her interest in you openly?

1917
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,980
Yes.

1918
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,089
Maybe, she should just stick with that.

1919
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,860
Why is she trying to do that to me too?

1920
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,920
But I thought I was clear about my intention in Seoul.

1921
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,390
I told her I was sure about myself. I said, "You know how I am."

1922
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,700
It was our last night in Pyeongchang-dong.

1923
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:40,969
I was packing. All of a sudden,

1924
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,100
Hyeon Ji wanted to talk.

1925
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,510
She was honest with me that day and told me she had feelings for me.

1926
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,370
- She said she liked me.
- What did you say?

1927
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,540
- She said she had feelings for you?
- Yes.

1928
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:52,680
She said, "I still like you."

1929
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:58,580
This is why it's frustrating me too.

1930
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,090
She should just stick to one person.

1931
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,220
This is confusing.

1932
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:07,829
- So you want to ask her now?
- Yes. "Did you make up your mind?"

1933
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:08,930
By the way,

1934
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,730
I'm curious too.

1935
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,769
- I wasn't going to pay attention...
- You also said...

1936
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,770
- to anything you said to me.
- you had questions too.

1937
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,340
That's what I was going to do, but now, I'm curious.

1938
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,380
I'm bringing this up for a reason. I'm not some crazy guy. Seriously.

1939
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:27,309
On our last night in Pyeongchang-dong,

1940
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:29,620
you kept saying you didn't want to lose me.

1941
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:34,020
Let's go if you're curious. What about it?

1942
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,890
This is nice.

1943
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:39,790
Maybe we shouldn't go.

1944
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,960
I feel like I don't really want to hear it.

1945
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,560
No?

1946
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:46,700
- Here?
- Yes.

1947
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,670
- Who is it?
- Me.

1948
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,010
- What?
- Ddoong.

1949
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,950
What's up?

1950
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:01,679
- Can I come in?
- What's that?

1951
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,650
I brought some water in case you're thirsty.

1952
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:08,250
Whose room is this? Do you use it alone?

1953
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:10,320
No, Ji Yeon and me.

1954
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,630
- Really?
- Yes.

1955
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,130
- A boot case?
- What's up? What's going on?

1956
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:17,360
I know. What are you doing here?

1957
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:19,130
- Are you feeling uncomfortable?
- No.

1958
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:21,169
He's here too.

1959
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:23,599
- Yes, I saw him. Have a seat.
- She saw you.

1960
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,100
- Really?
- Yes. Have a seat.

1961
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,310
Seriously.

1962
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:38,020
Hyeon Ji, come outside for a second.

1963
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:45,990
Is it soundproof?

1964
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,389
- Why? Are you going to yell?
- I'll let you know if I hear you.

1965
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,430
Okay.

1966
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,930
Why are you glaring at me?

1967
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:56,600
I'm doing everything you want.

1968
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:59,340
I never complained about that.

1969
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,440
But?

1970
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,780
Don't you think I might have questions?

1971
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:08,480
Tell me what your questions are.

1972
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:15,150
- What are you having?
- It's water.

1973
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:20,490
Can you sit here? I can't see.

1974
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:21,890
No, I'm leaving.

1975
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:24,300
I'll be in my room.

1976
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,730
I'll go with you. I'm leaving.

1977
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:36,080
(For Baek Hyun and Hyeon Ji to talk, they return to their rooms.)

1978
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,350
What kind of questions do you have?

1979
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:46,489
You said you weren't planning to get back.

1980
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:47,890
- It was half and half.
- Yes.

1981
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,320
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

1982
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,660
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1983
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:52,190
Okay.

1984
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:54,790
Did I say I wasn't planning to get back with you?

1985
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:00,299
- You said you didn't.
- No.

1986
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,300
- That's all that matters.
- I never said no.

1987
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,239
Ever since the preliminary meeting,

1988
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,040
I never said I didn't want to get back with you.

1989
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,140
Never?

1990
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:11,709
You said that in the Talking Room.

1991
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:13,209
- Yes.
- You said you never said that.

1992
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:14,510
Exactly.

1993
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:16,980
I never said I didn't want to get back with you.

1994
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,290
Not even in the Talking Room.

1995
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:21,720
You said you didn't want to get back with me.

1996
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:24,320
When did I ever say that?

1997
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:26,060
That's what Yoo Sik heard too.

1998
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:28,430
You said you didn't.

1999
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:30,829
I wasn't mistaken.

2000
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:32,800
So I was angry to hear that.

2001
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:35,769
That was the first time...

2002
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,540
- we talked on the terrace.
- Yes.

2003
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:40,209
You acted like you wanted to get back with me.

2004
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:42,609
You didn't exactly say you did.

2005
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:44,680
But the way you acted seemed like...

2006
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,179
you wanted to get back with me.

2007
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,050
To be honest,

2008
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,549
- I had a lot on my mind.
- I'm here...

2009
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:51,980
- with a possibility to get back.
- Don't stop me. Just listen.

2010
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:53,350
Okay.

2011
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:55,620
That's what I was thinking.

2012
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,690
So I was confused back then.

2013
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:01,929
I was disturbed.

2014
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:03,499
So I went to the Talking Room,

2015
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,060
and you said you weren't planning to get back with me.

2016
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,770
After that, you said,

2017
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:12,170
"It depends on how my ex behaves."

2018
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:14,569
That's what you said. What does that mean?

2019
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:15,810
That means you're not planning to get back with me.

2020
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:18,339
How does that mean I'm not planning to get back with you?

2021
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:21,380
Who would think that sounds like you want to get back with me?

2022
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:25,020
I didn't say I didn't want to get back with you.

2023
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,349
Are you saying that we're mistaken?

2024
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,619
I didn't say that.

2025
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,590
That's what I heard.

2026
01:45:29,591 --> 01:45:31,260
You think I'm a fool...

2027
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,389
to be upset about hearing "It's half and half?"

2028
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,230
Hyeon Ji? Me?

2029
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,899
If you said you were half and half about getting back with me,

2030
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,870
I would've contemplated even more.

2031
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,000
- No?
- You're right.

2032
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:44,600
That's what you said.

2033
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,169
You said there was a man you were interested in.

2034
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:48,169
You said you expressed your feelings to him.

2035
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:49,339
I said there was a man I was interested in,

2036
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,379
- and I texted...
- Listen to me.

2037
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:51,409
- I texted him too.
- Listen to me.

2038
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,610
- Don't stop me.
- Okay.

2039
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:54,950
- Okay?
- Okay.

2040
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:56,920
So I got angry.

2041
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,790
I'm confused too.

2042
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:04,119
Since I'm not getting enough sleep here,

2043
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,860
am I getting confused and having trouble remembering?

2044
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,629
From the way I see it, you look like you want to get back with me,

2045
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:12,500
but you say you don't.

2046
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,329
You kept saying,

2047
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:16,739
- "It depends on how he behaves." - Yes.

2048
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:19,370
Are you saying I need to try?

2049
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:21,539
That's not what I meant.

2050
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:23,810
- That's how I perceived it.
- Okay.

2051
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:27,679
And you said...

2052
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:28,909
there was someone you were interested in.

2053
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:30,719
And I got the text...

2054
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,080
that my ex didn't choose me.

2055
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,090
Then how am I supposed to understand that?

2056
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:36,390
- Right?
- Yes.

2057
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:40,160
Because you confused me,

2058
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:43,459
I became firm.

2059
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:44,699
"I have someone I'm interested in."

2060
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,100
"I'm going to work things out."

2061
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,029
"I'm firm."

2062
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:50,700
"When you say that, I become more firm."

2063
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,770
That's why I said that.

2064
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:55,410
Okay.

2065
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,979
Right? If it really was half and half,

2066
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,480
and you were open to it,

2067
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,010
you wouldn't have said that.

2068
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:07,290
The reason I'm here is...

2069
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:09,119
to ask you this...

2070
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,120
because there isn't much time left.

2071
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,689
I'm curious if you've made up your mind.

2072
01:47:14,690 --> 01:47:16,130
Why are you curious about that?

2073
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,869
I'm asking because I'm curious about how you feel.

2074
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,499
Why are you talking about how I feel again?

2075
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,040
What matters is how you feel.

2076
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:27,039
So your heart will change depending on how I feel?

2077
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,269
You think my heart won't change...

2078
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,739
depending on how you feel?

2079
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:32,779
That's how everyone here feels.

2080
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,380
But how you feel matters too.

2081
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,349
Of course, it does. It did.

2082
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:37,619
- So I'm asking how you feel.
- That's why...

2083
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,249
I clung to you and cried.

2084
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,919
You know how I feel.

2085
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,220
How do you feel?

2086
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,190
- Don't you know?
- That you like her?

2087
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:47,530
You already know.

2088
01:47:47,531 --> 01:47:49,699
So I'm curious about how you feel.

2089
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,130
That you like her?

2090
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,129
That you've been interested in her from the start?

2091
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:56,400
- I like her.
- Okay.

2092
01:47:58,070 --> 01:48:00,940
Okay. So I'll end it here.

2093
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,079
Then why don't you support me?

2094
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,079
I am supporting you right now.

2095
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,209
Why do you keep asking me to talk...

2096
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:09,550
and sway me by saying that you like me?

2097
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,420
Did that sway you?

2098
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,590
You think it wouldn't?

2099
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:17,190
If my ex that I still like says that?

2100
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,559
- I...
- If that was your intention,

2101
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,329
you might as well support me...

2102
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:22,760
and root for me like I do.

2103
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,970
I can't be like you.

2104
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:29,599
- That's your choice.
- It's not like I have no regrets...

2105
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,400
- like you.
- Right. You...

2106
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:34,070
I told you. I regret it.

2107
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:36,339
I couldn't support you before,

2108
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:39,479
but whatever I do now,

2109
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,949
you're so firm.

2110
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:42,310
So I'll end it.

2111
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,550
I told you. I can't get back with you alone.

2112
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,290
If I liked you, I would've pushed it.

2113
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,990
But that's not the case. We broke up.

2114
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:53,930
I can't do it alone.

2115
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:56,829
I said it yesterday, and even today...

2116
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,660
You said you can't get back by yourself.

2117
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:00,300
And that you want to get back with me.

2118
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,099
You want to get back with me...

2119
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,740
I'm here with a possibility to get back.

2120
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,440
What's that supposed to mean? Am I the weird one?

2121
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,540
So you're open to getting back with me,

2122
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:13,449
but it's not that you want to get back...

2123
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:16,680
I'm not here to get back with you no matter what.

2124
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:19,849
So that means you're not here to get back with me.

2125
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:22,050
That doesn't mean that you want to get back with me.

2126
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:28,529
Is that your problem right now?

2127
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:30,230
That is not my problem.

2128
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,360
We're not talking about my problem.

2129
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,170
So you don't understand why I'm acting like this?

2130
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:44,079
You probably have your stance...

2131
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,980
and the reason for your action.

2132
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,619
- You...
- I just don't get it.

2133
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:51,849
Why don't you get it? Put yourself in my shoes.

2134
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:54,119
Do you know how I felt...

2135
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,619
for a few days after moving in?

2136
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:59,019
If I were here from the start, I would've met everyone new...

2137
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:01,390
and tried to get back with you.

2138
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:03,260
Or meet everyone new...

2139
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,499
- and find someone I like.
- Even the one who came late...

2140
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:05,500
says the same thing, like Jae Hyeong.

2141
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:08,230
"I don't plan to get back with my ex."

2142
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:10,900
They finished talking already.

2143
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:13,510
What did you do when I talked to you?

2144
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:14,870
We didn't even talk.

2145
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:17,180
We didn't even talk, and how did you treat me?

2146
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:26,119
I don't get what you're saying. This conversation is going nowhere.

2147
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:28,920
(The conversation is getting chaotic.)

2148
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,260
Seriously.

2149
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:32,829
Let me make it clear.

2150
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:34,760
I was here with a possibility to get back with you.

2151
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:37,459
- But since the first day, - Yes, I was firm.

2152
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:39,260
You were interested in someone.

2153
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,000
And the way you treated me...

2154
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,569
I acted like I wasn't planning to get back with you.

2155
01:50:42,570 --> 01:50:44,739
Right. You weren't planning to get back with me.

2156
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:48,240
On top of that, I felt that you didn't respect me.

2157
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,910
But it turned out it was a misunderstanding.

2158
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,610
So that's why...

2159
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:57,250
I decided to move on.

2160
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:00,749
I couldn't express what I wanted to you.

2161
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:02,250
Then why did you express your feelings to me?

2162
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,760
- What do you mean? Yes.
- You said you moved on.

2163
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,589
But why did you suddenly tell me you liked me?

2164
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:11,129
Afterward, you expressed your feelings to me.

2165
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:13,029
- Afterward... Do you know?
- Because we cleared things up?

2166
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:16,199
- It was right before we came here.
- Yes.

2167
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,870
- Until then, - Yes.

2168
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,139
I thought text messages...

2169
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,639
- were important.
- Okay.

2170
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:23,779
I had given it some thought.

2171
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:26,849
I didn't know what I wanted back then.

2172
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:28,609
I wasn't sure if I still had feelings for you...

2173
01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:30,749
or if this was just jealousy. I didn't know why I was so upset.

2174
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,590
If I were to text you when I didn't know what I wanted,

2175
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:37,620
I would be standing...

2176
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:39,859
- in the way of your happiness.
- Okay.

2177
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,659
So I didn't text you the whole time.

2178
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:45,459
But after thinking about this and observing you in the house,

2179
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:47,729
it made me wonder if I didn't text you...

2180
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:49,000
out of pride.

2181
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:50,599
So that's exactly what you were doing.

2182
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,069
You didn't text me because of your pride.

2183
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:53,470
- Right.
- So?

2184
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:55,640
So it crossed my mind that...

2185
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:58,310
I should be more honest about my feelings...

2186
01:51:58,610 --> 01:52:00,010
and let go of my pride.

2187
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,520
That's why I told you.

2188
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:06,080
That I liked you.

2189
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:09,120
So I told you that on our last day in Pyeongchang-dong.

2190
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:11,060
- I see.
- Yes.

2191
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:14,559
You could've been confused...

2192
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,059
by my actions because even I wasn't sure...

2193
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:18,529
what I wanted.

2194
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:20,770
But this was all a misunderstanding.

2195
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,800
Honestly, I thought I was being considerate of you.

2196
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,769
By not texting you,

2197
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:27,739
- I thought I was being considerate.
- Really?

2198
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:29,169
Right. But...

2199
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:31,439
- you... Right.
- I thought texting you...

2200
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,480
- when I was 100 percent sure...
- Yes.

2201
01:52:33,610 --> 01:52:36,079
Was being polite to you, so I didn't text you.

2202
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,820
I can understand you when I hear your side of the story.

2203
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:42,149
If I were to look at your action without any explanation,

2204
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:44,159
I wouldn't be able to understand your intention.

2205
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:45,719
- I didn't text you...
- You know?

2206
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,529
Even after the way I behaved around you.

2207
01:52:47,530 --> 01:52:48,859
- Right You said...
- And hearing what I said...

2208
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,359
- you didn't have feelings for me.
- in the Talking Room...

2209
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,030
So naturally, I was confused.

2210
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:53,630
And...

2211
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:57,969
I know I shouldn't do this. But I'm only human.

2212
01:52:57,970 --> 01:53:00,340
There's a girl I'm interested in, and you're my ex.

2213
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:03,309
I spend time talking to you.

2214
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:06,410
I also spend time with the girl I'm interested in.

2215
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:10,519
I know I shouldn't do this. But the more time I spend with her,

2216
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,620
I can't help but compare the two of you.

2217
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:15,849
She gives me a sense of security.

2218
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:17,359
But you keep confusing me.

2219
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,759
It would've been nice if we had discussed this.

2220
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,400
But we couldn't do that due to our circumstances.

2221
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,169
If I were in her position,

2222
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:30,040
I could give a sense of security to the guy I'm interested in.

2223
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,540
Of course.

2224
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:35,169
You're my ex. That's why I can't do that.

2225
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:37,180
Now that I hear your side of the story, I get it.

2226
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:41,679
Of course, I said this before. But I naturally assumed...

2227
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,949
you weren't interested in getting back together.

2228
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:45,620
But something didn't sit right with me.

2229
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:48,590
Remember what I always told you when we were dating?

2230
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:51,820
"This might not be who you are, but situations shape people."

2231
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:55,890
Our situation is affecting us.

2232
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:03,039
(Room 102, Red Room: Baek Hyun and Woo Jin's room)

2233
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,700
- By the way, - Yes.

2234
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,910
- could you sit over there?
- Sure.

2235
01:54:08,670 --> 01:54:10,140
- I'm not sick.
- Are you uncomfortable?

2236
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,080
I just want to lie down for a bit.

2237
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:15,510
Could you dim the lights? They're too bright.

2238
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:20,190
(He's on the move as soon as she speaks.)

2239
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:23,090
This is perfect.

2240
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:40,069
- Do you want the letter?
- What?

2241
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:41,970
- Do you want the letter?
- Did you write a letter?

2242
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:48,810
(Woo Jin came back to his room after the text message session.)

2243
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:56,889
I wanted to express my sincere feelings to my ex.

2244
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:58,190
So I wrote her a letter.

2245
01:54:58,990 --> 01:55:00,230
For her...

2246
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:03,859
to decide to get back together,

2247
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:05,560
it seemed that...

2248
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,829
a big part of her lacked confidence in me.

2249
01:55:08,830 --> 01:55:11,270
I wanted to express my sincerity about us getting back together...

2250
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:16,040
in a heartfelt letter. So I wrote one.

2251
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:22,080
- A letter?
- Really?

2252
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,579
- He wrote it?
- Woo Jin is amazing.

2253
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:26,049
He's doing everything to get her back.

2254
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:28,019
Yes, Woo Jin.

2255
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:29,320
Right. That's it.

2256
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:42,670
(He finishes up the letter he couldn't finish earlier.)

2257
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:49,470
Woo Jin, you can't give me a letter like this.

2258
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,080
Seriously.

2259
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:56,850
You're not the sweet type.

2260
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:04,820
That's my thought...

2261
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:07,430
on your answer.

2262
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:09,190
A reply, if you will.

2263
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:16,639
(You told me to write you a letter, explaining how I'll behave.)

2264
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,699
(You said only that would change your mind, but I can't do that.)

2265
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,510
(So I'll tell you how I really feel in this letter instead.)

2266
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:26,309
(I pretended not to want you back during the preliminary meeting.)

2267
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:29,009
(But that wasn't how I really felt.)

2268
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:33,689
(I won't be so sensitive even when I'm busy in the future.)

2269
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:38,920
(I won't make you feel lonely.)

2270
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,059
(I couldn't stop thinking how I wanted to come here with you.)

2271
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:45,660
(I'll only think about you.)

2272
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,669
(When you said you didn't want to get back together, )

2273
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:55,839
(I was so miserable and heartbroken.)

2274
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:56,979
(But I thought I would regret a lot...)

2275
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:58,279
(if I didn't even try to change your mind.)

2276
01:56:58,280 --> 01:57:02,609
(Whatever decision you make, I won't blame you.)

2277
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:07,720
(I'll respect your decision.)

2278
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:13,960
(I'll always root for you from the bottom of my heart.)

2279
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:19,970
I wrote it wholeheartedly.

2280
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:25,699
I've gotten letters from you for the first time...

2281
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:26,839
only after getting here.

2282
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:28,310
Like the introduction you wrote for me.

2283
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:30,940
The introduction...

2284
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:40,219
Woo Jin is doing absolutely everything he can now.

2285
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:43,390
- Right.
- But it's working really well.

2286
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:44,819
Because he means it.

2287
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:46,219
- Right.
- He means every word.

2288
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:48,689
- I want her to take him back.
- Yes.

2289
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:50,299
Don't make Mr. Ramyeon wait long.

2290
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:51,300
Or he'll get soggy.

2291
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,830
Can I have some water too?

2292
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:12,050
Why did you fold the introduction I wrote you? Are you mad?

2293
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:16,319
No. I was going to read it with Yoo Sik.

2294
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,920
- You didn't read it at all?
- What?

2295
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:20,489
I read both.

2296
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:21,730
Why would you read it with Yoo Sik?

2297
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:23,159
He said he was curious.

2298
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,930
He was curious about the introduction I wrote for you?

2299
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:26,260
He was curious about both.

2300
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:28,970
I was curious about his too.

2301
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:33,240
You wrote me a simple introduction.

2302
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:39,379
How come you didn't even write that I was the person...

2303
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:40,810
you loved the most?

2304
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:43,750
It says it here.

2305
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,349
Where?

2306
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:47,219
"She more than deserved my love."

2307
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:48,620
Come on. Seriously?

2308
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:50,460
What?

2309
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:54,430
I don't remember what I wrote for you.

2310
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:55,990
You wrote a good one.

2311
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,460
It was heartfelt.

2312
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:06,770
You were truly beautiful.

2313
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:12,340
We were crazy in love. But I'm not sure...

2314
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:16,280
how it'd be if we get back together. We're the same people.

2315
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,750
What if we hurt each other the same way as before?

2316
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:33,200
I think about you from time to time just when I'm about to forget you.

2317
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,600
I don't know who I am anymore.

2318
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,079
Don't ask me to make things clear for you...

2319
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:47,850
or say you're my ideal type for a lifetime.

2320
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:52,780
Seriously.

2321
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,320
Come on, seriously.

2322
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:59,060
Yun Nyeong stole you from me.

2323
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:06,530
What do you mean she stole me?

2324
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:08,400
She didn't steal anything from you.

2325
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:11,870
You let me go. Right?

2326
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:17,840
Right?

2327
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,540
Did she steal me from you?

2328
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,080
No, you let me go.

2329
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:38,600
I don't know.

2330
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,330
I feel like I'm a bad guy after coming here.

2331
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,039
- You?
- Yes.

2332
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,070
Yes.

2333
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:49,840
- Really?
- Yes.

2334
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,980
I was horrible back then.

2335
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:58,150
Why? You're the one I used to love.

2336
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,260
Gosh.

2337
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:43,060
It's annoying.

2338
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,770
Let me go home. It's annoying.

2339
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:55,870
Why?

2340
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,480
Blow your nose.

2341
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:10,760
Hyeon Ji.

2342
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:12,720
Let's meet in the next life.

2343
02:02:20,130 --> 02:02:21,330
I'm sorry.

2344
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,770
I'm sorry about what I did back then.

2345
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:28,610
And even now.

2346
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:32,740
Let's meet in the next life.

2347
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:37,650
Why next life?

2348
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:38,980
What?

2349
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:40,650
Why next life?

2350
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:42,520
I'll be born as you in the next life.

2351
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:45,390
- Why?
- You can be born as me.

2352
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,560
And let's get back together.

2353
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:06,280
Where are you going?

2354
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,350
Where are you going?

2355
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,960
I don't know. It's not me.

2356
02:03:30,030 --> 02:03:31,540
- Hyeon Ji.
- Yes?

2357
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:34,370
Are you still talking?

2358
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:36,270
No, you can come in.

2359
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:40,350
Get inside.

2360
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:44,519
- What?
- I hate to.

2361
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,019
I'll go down this way.

2362
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,690
Why? Walk out this way.

2363
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:50,520
What's wrong?

2364
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:52,860
Does it show?

2365
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:55,559
No, it doesn't.

2366
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,860
Don't ever tell anyone.

2367
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,060
Okay.

2368
02:03:58,830 --> 02:03:59,860
Get inside.

2369
02:04:02,170 --> 02:04:04,170
- Why did you cry?
- What are you saying?

2370
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:09,870
- Hi. Bye.
- Hi.

2371
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:12,440
- Okay.
- Bye.

2372
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:13,750
- Are you drunk?
- No.

2373
02:04:14,710 --> 02:04:15,980
I'm sober.

2374
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:20,920
How can you send this?

2375
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:24,990
What on earth are you thinking?

2376
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:26,120
What?

2377
02:04:27,690 --> 02:04:29,060
It's the sign of my gratitude.

2378
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:30,830
What do you mean?

2379
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,900
When I was most grateful.

2380
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:36,629
Go to bed. You must be tired.

2381
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:37,700
Okay.

2382
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,640
Bye.

2383
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:41,040
This feels strange.

2384
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:49,750
"Bye" sounds strange. Why does it feel familiar?

2385
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:52,680
Bye.

2386
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:55,820
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

2387
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:04,060
It's annoying.

2388
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:07,230
Seriously.

2389
02:05:09,170 --> 02:05:12,940
Until yesterday, I hated Hyeon Ji so much.

2390
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:16,570
After all, I used to date her.

2391
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:20,580
I truly wish her happiness.

2392
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:26,820
When we were dating, it was painful.

2393
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:35,430
When I texted her for the last time,

2394
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:41,030
I said, "Since going out with me was so tough,"

2395
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:49,240
"I want you to stop this tough relationship and be happy."

2396
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:51,640
It's still the same.

2397
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:57,720
Even if we get back together,

2398
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:01,690
our relationship wouldn't be so nice.

2399
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:05,790
I can't stop thinking about how tough I was to handle.

2400
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:11,700
I want her to date someone else and be happy.

2401
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:13,100
If she...

2402
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:15,700
keeps thinking about...

2403
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,140
If she's reminded of the wrong relationship she had...

2404
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:04,050
I want to stop.

2405
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:07,990
This is crazy.

2406
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:13,360
This is crazy.

2407
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,700
I don't know what I want.

2408
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:28,770
Misunderstandings keep building, and I misunderstand her.

2409
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:32,140
I don't even know if I only heard what I wanted to hear.

2410
02:07:41,990 --> 02:07:45,590
I really want her to be happy, but at the same time,

2411
02:07:48,860 --> 02:07:51,429
when the old memories come back...

2412
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:52,800
My goodness.

2413
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:56,699
That's what I think.

2414
02:07:56,700 --> 02:08:00,670
But one thing is clear. I want Hyeon Ji to be happy.

2415
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:04,510
I mean it.

2416
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:12,150
(EXchange 4)

2417
02:08:12,450 --> 02:08:15,520
I want to talk to Yoo Sik.

2418
02:08:15,650 --> 02:08:17,020
Sure. Talk to him.

2419
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:18,990
Enjoy talking to him.

2420
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,530
It felt like she was piercing my heart.

2421
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:26,400
Does she not want to retrieve this relationship?

2422
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:28,030
I became hasty.

2423
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,239
Honestly, this is how I feel.

2424
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,269
Things are going well between Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji.

2425
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:35,910
But honestly, I want to ruin it. I want to interrupt them.

2426
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:38,379
If you want to get back with him...

2427
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:39,579
Is it better to interrupt them together?

2428
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:42,879
I thought it'd be better to sway them together.

2429
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:43,980
I see.

2430
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:47,790
You wanted to get married soon.

2431
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,420
If you date Yoo Sik, when are you going to get married?

2432
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,860
Is this what you do?

2433
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:54,130
What?

2434
02:08:54,390 --> 02:08:56,330
Think down to earth, Hyeon Ji.
