1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,569
This week again,

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,469
we're together with Loco and CODE KUNST.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,239
(Loco, singer)

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,149
It's the fifth day in Japan.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,149
Last week, we had Seung Yong who cleverly started shaking...

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,279
his ex's heart.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,719
Min Kyung, Yoo Sik's ex,

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,219
has also started to move along with Seung Yong.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,989
- That's right.
- I don't know how it'll turn out...

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,599
in the last episode,

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,229
but will this be the trigger...

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,769
that brings Min Kyung and her ex back together...

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,169
as CODE KUNST said?

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,739
- It has started.
- Right. It has started.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,740
- It has started.
- Also,

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,569
the fact that Yoo Sik hid his stomach pain...

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,940
is evidence of love.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,820
(A cloudy and rainy morning)

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,770
(Blue Room: Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,050
(He starts writing something as soon as he gets up.)

21
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,140
(After writing for a long time, )

22
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,880
(he gets ready to go out.)

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,589
- A letter? A note?
- I don't think it's a letter.

24
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,659
That's right.

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,189
- It's a poem.
- That's right.

26
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,529
- A poem?
- He wrote it down.

27
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,600
It starts with "you."

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,269
Wouldn't he give it to Ji Hyeon?

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,230
He might give it to Ji Yeon.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,639
(Ji Yeon is eating alone.)

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,910
Hi.

32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,010
I keep meeting you whenever I come here to eat.

33
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,009
It's delicious.

34
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,150
- Is it good?
- It is.

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,220
You know,

36
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,320
I share a room with Hyeon Ji.

37
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,890
But...

38
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,360
she also knows about the T-shirt.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,160
- Hyeon Ji?
- Yes. So,

40
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,899
that came into my mind then,

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,770
so I thought about it again.

42
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,340
Ji Hyeon put an apron on me that day because I was wearing white.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,210
Do you remember that? I was cleaning the dishes.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,079
When she asked me, "Is that Won Kyu's?"

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,650
and even when you were sitting next to me,

46
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,789
I think I made some jokes saying,

47
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,889
"I shouldn't get food on this."

48
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,259
- "It's a cute T-shirt." - Right.

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,260
Right?

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,089
I think I said...

51
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,600
so many things I shouldn't have.

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,300
But that's...

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,700
my fault.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,809
"Why did I do that?"

55
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,139
(Woo Jin came to the communal area.)

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,809
That thought kept popping up.

57
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,849
I see.

58
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,179
(He quietly walks past them.)

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,250
Right.

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,420
I see.

61
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,050
- Hi, Woo Jin.
- Hi.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,490
Hi, Woo Jin.

63
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,169
I think I hurt many people...

64
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,000
without my intention.

65
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,069
(Woo Jin leaves the area.)

66
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,210
But you really didn't intend to do that.

67
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,350
Are you concerned about Ji Hyeon?

68
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,150
I wasn't concerned about her at all,

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,590
but after knowing who she was,

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,160
there are things that add up.

71
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,959
As far as I could tell,

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,630
Ji Hyeon was really considerate of me.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
Weren't you concerned about Woo Jin when he just came?

74
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,739
When Woo Jin came?

75
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,669
Woo Jin didn't look happy.

76
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,239
He always has a bad expression.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,810
He's like that even when he's with me.

78
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,240
He really seems upset today.

79
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,579
He's always like that. I don't know.

80
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,680
Normally,

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,750
he would have greeted us first.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,450
I think he left because he didn't want to disturb us.

83
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,400
I don't know what Hong Ji Yeon is thinking.

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,270
Goodness.

85
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,470
I think she wants to get back with you.

86
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,869
- What?
- I think...

87
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,170
she wants to get back with you.

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,980
Does she still have feelings for Won Kyu?

89
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,279
I felt bad because I saw them...

90
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,420
as soon as I woke up.

91
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,089
That's why I just drank some water and came out...

92
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,660
without greeting them.

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,880
Am I taking things the wrong way?

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,340
(Won Kyu came back to his room after eating with Ji Yeon.)

95
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,400
- You were here.
- Yes.

96
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,340
When did you get up?

97
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,610
Me? Around 11am.

98
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,750
Where are you going?

99
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,020
- Where am I going?
- Yes.

100
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,220
I'll go see Ji Hyeon...

101
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,960
I'll get going.

102
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,500
(He takes something with the paper he wrote in the morning.)

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,380
(He even puts on some perfume and leaves the room.)

104
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,390
- Who is it?
- It's me.

105
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,460
Are you okay?

106
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,230
- What's okay?
- Your condition.

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,990
I was wondering if you're okay.

108
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,900
- What is this?
- It's a gift for you.

109
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,370
- Really?
- Really.

110
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,630
Open it later.

111
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,469
What is it? It's a perfume.

112
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,940
Yes. It's the one I use.

113
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,240
What? When did you buy it?

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Some time back.

115
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,149
When?

116
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,050
- When you got the hoodie?
- No.

117
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,620
Why did you get it?

118
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,950
To give it to you.

119
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,789
Her expression was like,

120
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,730
"Why is he giving this to me now?"

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,170
It felt like she was trying to keep some distance.

122
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,840
So I was a bit disappointed.

123
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,409
It looked like she was glad.

124
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,239
I guess he wanted her to react more.

125
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,479
I think she looked glad.

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,650
"Really? This is amazing." Something like that.

127
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,479
- Right.
- Right.

128
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,800
- He shouldn't expect that.
- That's what I wanted to say.

129
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,959
(Sung Baek Hyun)

130
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,689
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

131
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,859
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

132
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,069
(Park Ji Hyeon)

133
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,699
(Cho Yoo Sik)

134
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,599
(Park Hyeon Ji)

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,499
(Kim Woo Jin)

136
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,639
(Kwak Min Kyung)

137
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,309
(Jung Won Kyu)

138
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,239
(Hong Ji Yeon)

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,150
(Shin Seung Yong)

140
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
(EXchange 4)

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
(Episode 18: A Sleepless Night with Rain)

142
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,599
Right.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,700
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik's casual date)

144
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,540
(Yoo Sik will be driving today.)

145
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,310
Are you comfortable with driving?

146
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,210
- Here?
- Yes.

147
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,580
It's the same.

148
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,010
- It's the same?
- Yes.

149
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,950
- That's interesting.
- Why?

150
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,020
I think it would be difficult and confusing.

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,049
(Exclaiming)

152
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,120
Why?

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,389
It's just fascinating.

154
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,260
It's my first time moving by car in Japan.

155
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,099
I don't know why,

156
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,940
but I found Yoo Sik driving really cute.

157
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,240
It...

158
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,180
It was just...

159
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,810
Maybe it's because he's younger than me.

160
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,680
It's like an amusement park ride.

161
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
He seemed cute.

162
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,319
The magic that makes him start to look...

163
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,519
- like a baby?
- I know, right?

164
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,460
After hearing the practical things?

165
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,699
- No way.
- Suddenly?

166
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,129
Please don't do that.

167
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,469
Come to think of it,

168
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,099
I don't think she finds him cute in a bad way...

169
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,199
because of what Seung Yong said.

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,869
I think he would seem cuter in a good way...

171
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,410
and more attractive.

172
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,379
But when you think a man is cute, it can't be helped.

173
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,080
Right. I guess she really finds him cute.

174
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,250
It's nice.

175
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,250
We're going to have pastries.

176
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,719
- Pastries?
- A cafe with pastries.

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Pastries? That's nice.

178
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,590
Is it because I said...

179
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,090
- I wanted to have pastries?
- Yes.

180
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,390
(Yoo Sik prepared the course for Hyeon Ji.)

181
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,300
- I guess it's this place.
- Yes.

182
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,770
It's a high-end bakery.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,570
Is there anything you want?

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,310
There is.

185
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,110
Should I have this? One of the two.

186
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,750
- Shall we have this?
- Yes.

187
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,950
I want one canele.

188
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,830
Here?

189
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,760
It's so nice.

190
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,600
It's so nice. Amazing.

191
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,670
It's so...

192
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,700
It's so open.

193
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,439
Right.

194
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,209
(They came to a cafe with an open view of the forest.)

195
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,380
It's so pretty.

196
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,150
It feels so relaxing here...

197
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,250
because it's open.

198
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,050
Why?

199
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,890
Why?

200
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,459
- It's too uniform.
- Too uniform?

201
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,559
- It's...
- I wanted to make it like this.

202
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,470
How did I make it? Let me see.

203
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,009
I didn't want to make it look like dots.

204
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,639
I wanted them to be big like this.

205
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
It's because my fingers are thick.

206
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,380
You said they would get wider.

207
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,949
But they didn't.

208
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,420
Isn't this the widened version?

209
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,920
It's certainly wider.

210
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,120
Here you go.

211
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,230
Oh, it was French toast.

212
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,970
You talked a lot yesterday.

213
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,230
With who?

214
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,140
With Seung Yong.

215
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,970
We talked during the day.

216
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,980
- I wanted to make it clear to him.
- Your hair.

217
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,520
I said I was going on a date with you today.

218
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,290
I didn't think he'd tell her.

219
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,860
I don't really mind people knowing.

220
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,260
Be it Seung Yong or Baek Hyun...

221
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,330
or others.

222
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,570
But...

223
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm quite concerned because it's Min Kyung.

224
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,570
Me or you?

225
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,310
I'm concerned because you might be concerned.

226
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,190
Min Kyung seemed to really want to get back with him,

227
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,399
and he's been talking to Min Kyung...

228
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,860
a lot lately.

229
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,230
I think his heart could be shaken a little.

230
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,269
I thought it was possible.

231
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,839
You've met for a long time,

232
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,610
and if you kept talking,

233
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,050
your heart might change. I thought that was possible.

234
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,950
I'm not saying that's weird.

235
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,689
Honestly, I can't say...

236
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,659
I'm not at all bothered...

237
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,200
by her struggles,

238
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,600
but I have feelings for someone else now.

239
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,500
I keep telling her that,

240
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,370
but she becomes emotional.

241
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,640
No matter what she thinks, what happens after that...

242
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,220
has to be left to her choice and freedom.

243
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,950
(He expressed how he feels to Hyeon Ji.)

244
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,890
Go on and eat now. Eat while they're warm.

245
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,830
It's already dark.

246
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,170
I wish it wouldn't get dark.

247
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,139
You said...

248
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,109
you feel at ease recently.

249
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,380
- Me?
- Yes.

250
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,609
But you don't seem comfortable these days.

251
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,310
When did I say I felt comfortable?

252
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,219
I have to meet many people...

253
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,520
when I get home.

254
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,560
- This?
- Yes.

255
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,759
Here.

256
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,080
(They go for a drive to have some peaceful time together.)

257
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,570
I should go slowly.

258
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,930
What's that?

259
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,000
What's that?

260
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,469
Isn't that an amusement ride?

261
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,010
- It looks fun.
- But I...

262
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,139
- I thought I saw it wrong.
- Me too.

263
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,279
(They're captivated by the interesting monorail.)

264
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,510
- Amazing.
- I wonder what they're thinking.

265
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,750
It's so fascinating.

266
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,690
It's raining a lot.

267
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Right.

268
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:00,160
Would we be able to walk by the sea?

269
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,690
Have you been to the sea?

270
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,430
I didn't go to the sea per se.

271
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,370
What?

272
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,040
I did have a view of the sea.

273
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,400
Where?

274
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,370
I don't know where it was.

275
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,680
When?

276
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,910
The day before yesterday.

277
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,849
Why are you saying that so softly?

278
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,090
(He didn't do anything wrong, but he feels like he did.)

279
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,190
So you had brunch at a place with a view of the sea.

280
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,360
You ate at a nice place.

281
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,300
You went to the aquarium.

282
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,730
Yes.

283
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,900
I just saw the water. I didn't see the sea creatures.

284
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,840
(She received jealousy for jealousy.)

285
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,740
We'll see the sea now.

286
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,950
So this is the seaside.

287
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,650
It's raining now, right?

288
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,850
No.

289
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,850
- There's a sea here?
- Over there.

290
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,220
It really is open.

291
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,059
I'm starting to feel relaxed.

292
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
That's what I'm saying.

293
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,759
Didn't you say that you like to watch the sea?

294
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,130
Yes, I like to watch the sea.

295
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,330
Hold on.

296
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,170
It's raining.

297
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,410
It must have been nicer if the weather had been fine.

298
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,579
We had excellent weather yesterday.

299
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,340
- That's true.
- Yesterday in the afternoon.

300
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,849
- Where is the rain coming from?
- Aren't you in the rain?

301
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,320
- I'm fine. Where is it coming from?
- I'll stay here.

302
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
- Okay.
- I won't be in the rain here.

303
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,090
- Are you in the rain?
- Do you want me to be?

304
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,429
Come here, to the right.

305
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,960
The rain is coming from here.

306
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,800
My shoulder is wet here, though.

307
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,630
- What? It's fine.
- It's wet here.

308
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,969
- You got so wet!
- Well...

309
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,640
The rain hit me from the side.

310
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,780
- I covered myself, though.
- Seriously.

311
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,850
We get to see the sea properly while we're in Japan.

312
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,749
They say we'd stay near the sea,

313
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,349
but we might not have seen the sea...

314
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,620
- and left.
- I know.

315
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,450
Watch out.

316
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,390
- Oh, no. You got too wet.
- Sorry?

317
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,099
- You're too wet.
- I'm fine.

318
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,160
Not here?

319
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,270
No, you're all wet.

320
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,370
It's because of how it rained.

321
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I'd have gotten wet anyway.

322
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,510
One of his arms was soaked in rain.

323
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,050
I didn't know he was that wet.

324
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,380
I felt thankful.

325
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,020
(On the way back)

326
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,589
- Do you feel cold?
- No, I'm fine.

327
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,590
Did your clothes dry off?

328
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,390
It's getting dry.

329
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,839
Yes, that's nice.

330
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,639
That's nice.

331
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,579
Both of them are trying to go home as late as possible.

332
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,849
It just looks like a real date between lovers.

333
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,379
- I know.
- It looks like a date...

334
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,879
between people who have already become lovers.

335
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,019
That's dangerous.

336
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
(CODE KUNST supports Min Kyung, so he feels a sense of crisis.)

337
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:18,389
Since they came to Japan, the first one to apply a casual date...

338
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,459
- is Yoo Sik.
- Right.

339
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,230
That shows his feelings for Hyeon Ji are growing.

340
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,959
I don't feel that his heart wavers because of Min Kyung.

341
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,800
I don't think Yoo Sik's heart would waver.

342
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,646
- What do you think?
- What do you think about that?

343
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,500
Shall I change my mind now?

344
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,810
(Kamakura House)

345
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,910
Did you see the gift?

346
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,750
It seems to have a letter inside. Am I right?

347
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,950
I don't know.

348
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,390
What is it? Tell me.

349
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,640
You can just look at it yourself.

350
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,630
I seriously went back to when we broke up and thought about it.

351
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,899
I couldn't help but think that you have every reason...

352
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,000
to hate me.

353
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,840
When did such a thought come to you?

354
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,410
Just while we were talking about what happened so far,

355
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,580
when I really took the time to look back on that moment.

356
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,160
You know I was at my part-time job when you told me it was over, right?

357
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,360
I was at work too.

358
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,529
At that time, I thought I should stop dating someone...

359
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,459
in a way that I sincerely love him...

360
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,930
and think about marrying him.

361
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,840
I was a fool to believe in love.

362
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,010
I think you must have felt so.

363
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,909
So, although you came here and showed...

364
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,520
an attitude that you want to get back together,

365
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,190
if I accept that instantly,

366
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,320
I'd feel so sorry for my past self.

367
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,700
Back then, I was...

368
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,410
not solid as a person.

369
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,969
Since I was like that,

370
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,010
I feel that I wanted that quality even more from the one I dated.

371
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,180
Then how do you feel now?

372
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,150
It's only been a year. Are you more solid now?

373
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,619
I'd feel ashamed to say that I'm more solid,

374
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,720
so I can't say so.

375
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,130
But about why you behaved so at that time,

376
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,529
although I didn't like that,

377
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,500
and why you couldn't help behaving so,

378
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,770
I think now I can understand.

379
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,280
Actually, you're not doing anything wrong.

380
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,180
But since I think you're doing wrong,

381
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,920
I got to tell you it was over, after all.

382
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,850
Thinking back now, you didn't do anything wrong.

383
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,290
It was the first time for you, so it was hard for you.

384
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,960
You didn't know it well, and you were in the process.

385
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,669
But I only thought from my own standard...

386
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,376
and thought that you were just different from me.

387
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,899
I considered being different to be wrong,

388
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,460
and I thought so about too many things.

389
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,710
I told her I had the wrong idea about her when we broke up.

390
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,320
I told her she was different, not wrong.

391
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,360
I just told her about what I felt.

392
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,300
(That's how their conversation ended.)

393
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,070
(Ji Hyeon comes back to her room and takes out Won Kyu's gift.)

394
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,620
There were song lyrics written like a poem.

395
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,690
When we were dating,

396
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,360
we used to listen to the song together since we liked the meaning.

397
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,470
The memory about the song...

398
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,710
and the thoughts we had back then...

399
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,010
flooded in at once.

400
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,779
(You become my little world)

401
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,849
(You make me dream a dream I've never dreamed of)

402
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,919
(Even if this is my illusion)

403
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,159
(Hold me in your arms just for today)

404
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,659
(My little heart came to you)

405
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,229
(I want to travel that long road with you)

406
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,860
(Even if this is my illusion)

407
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,669
(Even if this is my illusion)

408
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,710
(Hold me in your arms just for today)

409
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,880
When I first started dating him,

410
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,450
I kept asking him to write me a poem.

411
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,149
Back then, he said he could never write a poem...

412
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,620
and wrote me a letter instead.

413
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,190
However, all of a sudden,

414
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,820
he writes something for me himself...

415
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,530
and says he bought a perfume thinking about me.

416
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,430
He's trying to express more...

417
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,700
and is changing, I thought.

418
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,669
I remember the scene...

419
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,440
of listening to the song together.

420
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,339
We were just lying, looking at the ceiling,

421
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,340
and talking to each other with music on.

422
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,280
Back then, singing along with the song felt very funny.

423
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,950
I remember we were singing as we laughed.

424
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,190
What?

425
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,229
It's very nice.

426
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,700
(You said you'd believe in me)

427
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,640
(That's a deep love)

428
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:14,480
(Their little world, made of only two of them, disappeared.)

429
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,480
(Nothing but longing remains in that place.)

430
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
I held so much yearning for the song.

431
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,090
However, you can't just get back together by yearning.

432
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,570
I felt both happy and anxious.

433
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,030
I had such ambivalent feelings.

434
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,909
(You become my little world)

435
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,439
(You make me dream a dream I've never dreamed of)

436
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,979
(Even if this is my illusion)

437
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,480
(Hold me in your arms just for today)

438
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,949
Won Kyu is good.

439
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,249
Won Kyu is trying to swallow his pride and give in.

440
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,149
It's nice to see that he admits.

441
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,989
It seems that he actually realized things.

442
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,459
- Right. I agree.
- Yes. He realized.

443
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,529
Just that little effort can open her heart that wide.

444
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,759
- Right.
- It just melts her heart.

445
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,799
He did a good job.

446
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,469
- I support Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon.
- It was the right timing.

447
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,700
It wasn't too late.

448
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,499
Handwriting expresses his sincerity.

449
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,909
Right. He wrote the song lyrics they liked together.

450
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,539
Their conversation and the lyrics in the gift...

451
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,239
- Right.
- connect really well.

452
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,849
And sitting on the couch earlier and talking to Ji Hyeon,

453
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,979
all of those...

454
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,649
made her cold heart melt away.

455
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,579
He used to think that she was wrong,

456
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,889
but he began to admit that they are different.

457
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,620
Then I see a hope that they won't fight.

458
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,589
How about you? Have two of you, like Won Kyu,

459
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,759
prepared a romantic event before?

460
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,029
Those who create music...

461
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,159
- can do it.
- We write lyrics.

462
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,999
- We all did it at least once.
- I record the song...

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,299
and let her listen, you know.

464
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,000
- Do you do that?
- Yes, I did.

465
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,399
- Surprising.
- Amazing.

466
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,970
The song is not to be released.

467
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,739
- I write it for one person...
- Only for one.

468
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
And give it.

469
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,449
- Seriously.
- Right.

470
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,310
- I mean it.
- Come inside.

471
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,220
- Isn't the rain splashing inside?
- No.

472
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,966
- It's raining a lot.
- Are you okay sitting there?

473
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,490
I'm fine.

474
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,890
You can turn your chair a bit like this.

475
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,629
- Why aren't they coming back?
- What?

476
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,959
- Why aren't they coming back?
- Why aren't they coming, you asked?

477
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,700
(Min Kyung is bothered that Yoo Sik hasn't come back.)

478
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I guess there's a traffic jam because of the rain.

479
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
What am I supposed to do if I get vicious?

480
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,739
- You didn't yet?
- No.

481
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,309
I mean, not very seriously.

482
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,409
You can. It's going to be okay.

483
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,909
But I don't want to.

484
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,349
Right. Yoo Sik doesn't like it when people get emotional.

485
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,749
- He doesn't.
- Because Yoo Sik...

486
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,430
doesn't like it when people get emotional?

487
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,230
This is really beautiful. This one.

488
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,530
Come here.

489
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,130
I wanted it to look neat,

490
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,699
so I ripped it all apart.

491
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
(Baek Hyun puts the bracelet on Yun Nyeong.)

492
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:54,000
I added the silver color too.

493
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,980
- It looks good on you.
- I like it.

494
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,080
I'm returning it.

495
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,020
- I'll give it to you later.
- Okay.

496
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,550
Wait. What is this?

497
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,026
Did you say the rain isn't splashing in?

498
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,390
It is. It's splashing in a bit now.

499
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,466
- Bring it inside.
- What's wrong with the rain?

500
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,729
- Shall we go inside?
- Can we?

501
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll get inside with Yun Nyeong.

502
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,999
- Get inside.
- Okay.

503
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,369
Three of you can get some rain here.

504
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,830
Yes, we can get some rain.

505
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,640
Let's get inside.

506
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,870
It feels comfortable, even before I lie down.

507
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,239
- Where?
- Here.

508
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,980
- Is this your bed?
- Yes.

509
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,650
You look even more beautiful looking up from below.

510
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,220
Since I have single eyelids,

511
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,596
I look better when looked up, rather than when looked down.

512
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,530
So photos taken from below are all the better.

513
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,300
Then I saw it correctly, right?

514
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,130
Yes, that's right.

515
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,899
Don't you feel sleepy now? Why do I, all of a sudden?

516
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
You can sleep.

517
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,410
I'm not going to because someone might tell me I got puffy.

518
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,250
Yun Nyeong, you already slept earlier.

519
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,020
What are you saying, seriously?

520
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,689
- Didn't you sleep?
- I slept for only a bit.

521
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,719
- For a bit?
- Yes.

522
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,159
For a bit, but you slept.

523
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,629
- About ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

524
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,630
Yes.

525
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,489
(A brief moment shared just between the two of them)

526
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,960
Didn't you just feel like it was ten minutes?

527
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,199
- I really slept for ten minutes.
- All right.

528
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,239
It took 40 minutes to go, so...

529
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,109
- So you slept in the car?
- Right.

530
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,170
- Then you didn't sleep.
- No.

531
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,550
- Who is it?
- It's me.

532
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,350
- Kim Woo Jin?
- Yes.

533
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,989
- I was putting on makeup.
- What are you doing?

534
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,150
There's no one else.

535
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,920
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

536
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,430
- Are you transforming?
- Yes.

537
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,829
I had something to tell you, actually.

538
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,900
What is it?

539
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,840
Have a seat and wait. I'll tell you a bit later.

540
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,179
I'll tell you what I was going to.

541
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,210
Okay.

542
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,779
This morning, I was in the front yard with Won Kyu.

543
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Yes.

544
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,290
But you didn't even greet us.

545
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,920
I felt that you weren't feeling good for some reason.

546
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
I could see that.

547
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,830
I guess Won Kyu saw that too.

548
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,460
He said, "Woo Jin looks so upset."

549
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,199
From your perspective, you didn't want to disturb us,

550
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,770
so you avoided us intentionally and gave us some space.

551
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,009
But when other people saw you,

552
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,639
they might not think the same way,

553
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,580
even when you're not that kind of person.

554
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,849
- Right.
- I'm not criticizing you.

555
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,490
I'm telling you this because I'm worried.

556
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,450
You think that I'm being very rude...

557
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,859
to Won Kyu.

558
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,589
I didn't say that you are rude.

559
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,200
- Yes, but...
- I mean, it shows.

560
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,970
And I hope it doesn't.

561
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,140
Here, it's supposed to be like that.

562
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,210
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

563
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,610
Okay.

564
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,660
(Woo Jin left, and Min Kyung has come to Ji Yeon.)

565
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,360
Ji Yeon.

566
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,169
- May I come in...
- Who is it?

567
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,669
- It's me. May I come inside?
- Sure.

568
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,670
I'm coming in.

569
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,869
Have a seat here.

570
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,510
- Okay.
- Whose is this?

571
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,740
- I was so troubled.
- Why?

572
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,050
(Sighing)

573
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,850
Yoo Sik hasn't come back yet.

574
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,120
- What?
- Yoo Sik isn't back yet.

575
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,860
Is he on a date?

576
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,830
I'm so angry about his not getting back.

577
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,330
(Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik are back from their date.)

578
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,140
- You're back.
- Hi.

579
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,039
- Hi.
- Where are you going? You're back.

580
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Is everyone downstairs?

581
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,639
No. Did you bring something tasty?

582
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,439
- We've been to a convenience store.
- A convenience store? Sounds good.

583
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,479
Nothing special happened. There were not so many people.

584
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,160
- Really?
- Do you want to go to the room?

585
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Who is it?

586
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,290
He's back. I'm leaving.

587
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,830
Hi, Hyeon Ji.

588
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,660
We were having a talk.

589
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,200
I'm tired. I'm sleepy.

590
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm going to leave.

591
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,870
- See you later.
- Okay.

592
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,040
- Are you going to go downstairs?
- Yes.

593
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,819
(Blue Room: Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

594
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,690
You must be tired.

595
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,890
- Me?
- Yes.

596
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,359
(Min Kyung visits Yoo Sik.)

597
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,430
Yes?

598
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,860
I don't think someone should enter right now.

599
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,770
- Because of Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

600
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,440
Yoo Sik is changing right now.

601
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,980
May I enter?

602
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,679
- He's changing.
- I'll wait here.

603
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,750
Okay.

604
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,629
Shall we head out?

605
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,760
- Shall we do that?
- Yes.

606
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,360
It's okay.

607
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,970
What? It's okay.

608
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,600
Won Kyu and I were going to head out anyway.

609
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,499
It's okay.

610
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,300
We can talk at the doorway.

611
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,769
Talk comfortably in the room.

612
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,840
Won Kyu and I were going to head out anyway.

613
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,610
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

614
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,150
- It's intense.
- I know.

615
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,620
What are they going to do?

616
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,620
(My goodness)

617
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,660
Where have you been?

618
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,660
To a cafe.

619
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,700
My feelings...

620
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,850
Why are you crying?

621
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,490
Why did you come back so late?

622
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,060
Why did you wait?

623
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,089
Yoo Sik, you went out on a date.

624
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,289
I knew with whom you went. You didn't come back until late.

625
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,560
Of course, it got on my nerves.

626
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,830
You know, I...

627
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,370
I just came back.

628
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,970
How did you know that I was here?

629
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,780
I was with Ji Yeon.

630
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,110
- Ji Hyeon?
- Ji Yeon.

631
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,250
And?

632
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,380
I left the room since Hyeon Ji came back.

633
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,779
Min Kyung, you're being too much.

634
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,789
Why?

635
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,219
You stayed in Hyeon Ji's room. When Hyeon Ji returned,

636
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,889
you came straight to this room...

637
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,290
and drove out two people to talk to me.

638
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,800
- For goodness' sake.
- You had it all planned out.

639
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,500
I'm Type J.

640
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,930
I mean...

641
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,770
Hold on.

642
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,179
- Hold on.
- Stop with that MBTI!

643
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,779
- You know, that's...
- How cute.

644
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,839
- "I'm Type J." - "I'm Type J."

645
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,879
That shouldn't be cute, but...

646
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,979
- Seriously.
- MBTI is something else.

647
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,479
- It can explain everything.
- My goodness.

648
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,849
I can't believe she used MBTI in that situation.

649
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,849
But it made us speechless.

650
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,489
- Seriously.
- I see.

651
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,489
Even Yoo Sik found it cute.

652
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,689
- Of course.
- I know.

653
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,930
It was cute and funny.

654
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,159
You stayed in Hyeon Ji's room. When Hyeon Ji returned,

655
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,799
you came straight to this room...

656
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,230
and drove out two people to talk to me.

657
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,770
- For goodness' sake.
- You had it all planned out.

658
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,470
I'm Type J.

659
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,940
I mean...

660
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,450
Right now, this is the only thing I can do.

661
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,280
Hanging around in front of you is the only thing I can do.

662
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,949
Talking to Won Kyu is the only thing I can do.

663
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,790
What did you say to Won Kyu?

664
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,990
I told Won Kyu...

665
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,660
I'm the most relaxed around Won Kyu.

666
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,610
There's a big age gap. Why do you feel that way?

667
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,130
He's practically your uncle.

668
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,340
I'm the most relaxed around Uncle Won Kyu.

669
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,540
Won Kyu is a good man.

670
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,210
In any case, I don't want to talk about Won Kyu.

671
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,809
Can I ask you what you've done?

672
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,010
- We went to a cafe.
- What did you guys do?

673
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,480
We had a brunch with bread...

674
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,080
and drank coffee.

675
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,020
For five hours?

676
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,520
We went somewhere far in a car.

677
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,190
Did you drive?

678
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,200
Was I supposed to make Hyeon Ji drive?

679
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,270
Why do you call her "Hyeon Ji?" She's older than you.

680
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,860
Was I supposed to make Big Sister Hyeon Ji drive?

681
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,750
You must be happy about becoming an official couple.

682
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,080
The two of you were the only ones who weren't home today.

683
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,749
Does it look like I'm being egotistical?

684
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,780
No.

685
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,020
Then what?

686
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,190
You can be egotistical or not.

687
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,960
I want to be honest with my feelings.

688
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,990
I want to get back together with you.

689
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,030
I want you to come back.

690
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,000
Having someone who expresses her interest in an honest way...

691
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,110
helped me open up.

692
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,610
I have feelings for her.

693
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,850
To be honest, I lean more toward her than you right now.

694
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,490
Did you erase me?

695
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,160
I didn't say that.

696
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,190
Give me hope.

697
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,030
It'll be harder for you if I give you hope.

698
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,700
Don't you think about how hurtful those words are?

699
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,870
Let's say...

700
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,399
I don't have much interest in getting back together with you.

701
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,840
Let's say I'm interested in someone new.

702
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,810
Do you still want me to get back together with you?

703
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,350
Wouldn't that be more hurtful?

704
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,180
I feel so betrayed.

705
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Why does this make you feel betrayed?

706
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,820
Just how terrible do you want to make me look?

707
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,460
Honestly speaking... Do you want me to lie?

708
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,470
Have I ever told you the words you wanted to hear...

709
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,430
or white lies?

710
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,870
Even if it was a bit hurtful, I always spoke honestly.

711
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,340
Do you think they'll change?

712
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,190
I'm talking about your feelings.

713
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,380
Right now, I don't know.

714
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,290
What do I need to do?

715
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,920
What do I need to do?

716
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,130
When can you tell me for sure?

717
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,500
- What?
- When will you make up your mind?

718
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,929
Not much time remains.

719
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,000
Okay.

720
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,339
If you get another chance to go on a date,

721
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,210
will you choose Hyeon Ji?

722
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,540
What's the percentage?

723
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I can't express it in numbers.

724
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,649
Do you think you'll be happy if you date Hyeon Ji?

725
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,649
Just as you said,

726
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,550
I'm being honest with my feelings.

727
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,429
You're about to open your heart to someone else,

728
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,159
and I'm asking you to come back.

729
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,059
If my plea doesn't work,

730
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,860
there's nothing I can do.

731
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,299
I just think I should be honest with my feelings.

732
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,409
During the remaining time,

733
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,670
you'll definitely get a chance to go on a date.

734
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,209
If you go on another date with her, your heart will open up even more.

735
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,950
I never said that you weren't on my mind whatsoever.

736
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,380
Then go on a date with me.

737
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,920
Then can you not go on a date...

738
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,090
with someone else?

739
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I won't.

740
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,200
Don't avoid me. Even if you do, I'll hang around in front of you.

741
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,139
Can I take this?

742
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,200
Take it.

743
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,910
(Sighing)

744
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,510
(Thoughts rain down.)

745
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,960
Let's have a meal.

746
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,130
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

747
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,860
Meat on a rainy day?

748
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,230
It fits the mood.

749
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,300
The mood.

750
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,240
I feel lucky.

751
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,940
Shall we eat beef first?

752
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,540
Shall we eat pork first?

753
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,709
Shall we start grilling meat?

754
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,979
Not everyone is here.

755
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,010
Start grilling.

756
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,279
- Start grilling.
- Shall we start grilling?

757
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,519
- Yes.
- Start grilling.

758
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,720
All right.

759
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,850
Shall we put all the meat on the grill?

760
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,419
- That way...
- But not everyone is here.

761
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,889
- Here? Everyone is here.
- Everyone is here.

762
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,130
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

763
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
The meat...

764
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Not everyone is here.

765
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,829
- Really?
- Yes.

766
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,800
You put oil on the grill on purpose...

767
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,399
so that meat wouldn't stick.

768
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,500
Doesn't this one work?

769
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,610
(Hyeon Ji joins the group.)

770
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,580
Everyone has gathered around already.

771
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,619
Yun Nyeong, we're wondering if we should pour in water.

772
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,119
Ramyeon? What is it?

773
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,919
- It's really tasty.
- Isn't it mala hot pot?

774
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,689
It's incredibly tasty ramyeon. I love it the most.

775
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,760
I'm curious.

776
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,200
- We bought so many ramyeon bags.
- That's right.

777
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,080
At what time did you come back today?

778
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,640
Just a moment ago.

779
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,709
Right before this.

780
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,909
You have something on your lips.

781
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,780
You should look in the mirror.

782
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,780
What did you do today?

783
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,850
Today? We just went to a cafe.

784
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,090
What did we do? We just enjoyed the drive.

785
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,060
(I see.)

786
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,300
(Glancing over)

787
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,659
It smells good.

788
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,620
(Min Kyung and Yoo Sik are in her line of sight.)

789
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,640
- Have you tried it?
- Not yet.

790
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,810
I'm sorry.

791
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,210
It's hot.

792
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,629
- She saw it.
- She really saw it.

793
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,659
She saw it, right?

794
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,559
It does look strange.

795
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,229
She's watching them with Seung Yong.

796
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,959
I know. Are they watching a show or something?

797
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,840
- It's weird.
- What's up with the two of them?

798
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,670
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

799
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,910
Did something happen to put you in a bad mood?

800
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,780
- Why?
- You look down.

801
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,780
No, it isn't like that.

802
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,880
Shall I grill it?

803
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,150
No.

804
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,649
Oh, instead of me?

805
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,319
Yes. I'll do it.

806
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,459
Is it hot?

807
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,989
(Uncle Won Kyu reads the room and gives them space.)

808
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,030
- It isn't hot, right?
- Beef doesn't disappoint.

809
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,620
- Beef is tasty. Yes.
- Beef doesn't disappoint.

810
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,329
Min Kyung, hand them over...

811
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,669
- and help the others inside.
- Why? I...

812
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,640
Don't stay near the fire.

813
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,299
I have tongs.

814
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,570
Where should I put these tongs?

815
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,210
Just give them to Baek Hyun.

816
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,410
(The liquor of the day is soju.)

817
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,679
Ji Yeon, will you drink soju?

818
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,620
We brought out soju.

819
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,179
- Somaek sounds good too.
- Ji Yeon.

820
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,450
- Yes?
- Drink with me today.

821
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,890
That sounds good.

822
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,989
Big sisters, let me join.

823
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,390
- Okay. Everyone can join.
- Big sisters, let me join.

824
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,230
Why does it feel so awkward to call them "Big sisters?"

825
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,130
Jae Hyeong, you should start using the polite tone.

826
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,669
- Call me, "Big sister." - Jae Hyeong.

827
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,139
- Don't be like that.
- It feels so awkward.

828
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,510
Jae Hyeong, call me "Big Sister Ji Hyeon."

829
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,540
You know,

830
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,680
I need to... I'll tell you later.

831
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,150
- What?
- I need to buy you a meal.

832
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,019
- I need to buy you a meal?
- I need to buy you a meal.

833
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,119
- Why?
- Stop.

834
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,650
We went to that restaurant together.

835
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,860
I didn't know...

836
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,959
that you had paid for the date.

837
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,469
It doesn't matter.

838
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,400
Still, I'll buy you something tasty.

839
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,839
Still, thank you.

840
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,600
(The two of them make a secret appointment.)

841
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,849
Are we done grilling meat?

842
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,209
Yes. Let's move it to a plate.

843
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,410
Let's stop here.

844
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,050
It looks tasty.

845
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,220
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

846
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,290
- Let's have a drink together.
- Okay.

847
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,929
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

848
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,160
DFO!

849
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,560
- What was that?
- DFO.

850
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,799
It comes back endlessly.

851
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,330
DFO.

852
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,270
Drink your fill without overdoing it.

853
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,769
I learned it...

854
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,330
about two days before joining the show.

855
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,580
- It's tasty, Ji Hyeon.
- I know.

856
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,689
You're eating rice with gusto.

857
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,570
- You didn't eat at all, right?
- That's right.

858
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,189
It looks nice.

859
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,230
- It's so nice.
- Jae Hyeong is on a mono diet.

860
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,700
You lost a lot of weight.

861
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,269
- I realized that from here.
- Really?

862
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,539
- You lost a lot of weight.
- He lost a lot of weight.

863
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,879
- He gets skinnier by the day.
- Woo Jin...

864
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,940
gets handsomer by the day.

865
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,149
This is a therapeutic day.

866
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,150
- I know.
- Really?

867
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,589
- Why?
- Ji Yeon.

868
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,690
That was a loaded question.

869
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:47,200
(Her two exes are sitting across from her.)

870
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,110
You eat with gusto.

871
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,140
What?

872
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,460
Hold on. What's up with our socks today?

873
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,760
That's insane. What's this?

874
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,390
What's up with this man?

875
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,560
- Seriously. What's this?
- What's up with this man?

876
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,070
What's up with this man?

877
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,869
- It's like a parallel universe.
- I know.

878
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,230
(The two of them make a fuss about wearing the same socks.)

879
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,439
(Sighing)

880
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,540
For goodness' sake.

881
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,540
I bet it feels strange to see them like that.

882
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,180
- I'm glad that they get along.
- I see.

883
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,220
Don't you drink soju?

884
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,919
- I usually drink soju more often.
- I see.

885
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,659
- I bet you can hold your liquor.
- But...

886
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,730
it has been a while since I drank soju.

887
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,329
You said you could drink two bottles of soju.

888
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,600
- What are you saying?
- You told me that.

889
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,490
You told me that you could drink two bottles of soju.

890
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,770
- I did?
- Yes.

891
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,209
You told me that you could drink 1 to 2 bottles of soju.

892
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,380
That doesn't equal two bottles.

893
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,050
Hyeon Ji? She can drink more than me.

894
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,370
- That's right.
- Hyeon Ji can drink two bottles.

895
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,420
That's right.

896
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,390
Seeing the two of them say it is so...

897
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,560
- They're sitting together too.
- It's so funny.

898
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,160
You should sit in the middle.

899
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,360
(Glaring)

900
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,699
I can't hold my liquor these days.

901
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,200
It has been a while since I drank.

902
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,270
Really?

903
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,680
There's a season when I drink and one when I don't.

904
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,000
It's like we're at someone's birthday party.

905
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,880
At like Popeyes?

906
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,509
- Popeyes.
- Delicious.

907
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,650
Pizza Hut.

908
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,949
(The doorbell suddenly rang.)

909
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,450
That scared me.

910
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,959
I'll get it.

911
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,360
(The sound made everyone nervous.)

912
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,830
I'm scared.

913
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,430
I'm opening it.

914
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,809
"Tomorrow is a mutual date."

915
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,379
"Only the matched partners will go on a date."

916
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,479
"Send a text at this moment..."

917
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,049
"with the name of the person you want to go on a date with,"

918
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,650
"excluding your ex."

919
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,459
(Tomorrow is a mutual date.)

920
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,919
(Only the matched partners will go on a date.)

921
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,389
(Send a text at this moment with the name of the person...)

922
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,966
(you want to go on a date with, excluding your ex.)

923
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,489
The partners must match,

924
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,529
- It's a must, right?
- excluding the exes.

925
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,659
- Excluding the exes?
- Then...

926
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,629
- Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik.
- Yoo Sik.

927
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,639
Would that include whether he keeps his word...

928
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
to Min Kyung or not?

929
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,039
- No.
- You're right.

930
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,639
- But that's an official date.
- It's an official date.

931
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,409
- The thing is...
- He said he wouldn't pick her,

932
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,079
- didn't he?
- Min Kyung...

933
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,109
- He did, right?
- But that was for unofficial dates.

934
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:45,150
Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik will pick each other for sure.

935
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,380
Right now?

936
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,350
Excluding my ex?

937
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,120
"Only the matched partners will go on a date."

938
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,870
"I'm going to text Baek Hyun's name."

939
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,499
"We'll go on a fun date tomorrow."

940
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,030
That had already crossed my mind.

941
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,930
I'll go on a date with Yun Nyeong. I need to spend time with her.

942
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,070
I got my hopes up.

943
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,910
I had a feeling Yoo Sik would choose me too.

944
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,850
All I thought was, "Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji will go on a date again."

945
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,750
I didn't give it a second thought.

946
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,030
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

947
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,160
(Sung Baek Hyun)

948
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,900
(Kwak Min Kyung)

949
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,940
(Kim Woo Jin)

950
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,369
Woo Jin and I talked about...

951
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,609
getting something really delicious...

952
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,240
on a date before.

953
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,410
I recalled that and chose Woo Jin.

954
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,349
If we were to go on a date,

955
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,290
I thought he'd choose me as well.

956
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:59,459
If not, I'd be at home.

957
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,790
That was all I thought.

958
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,590
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

959
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,060
If my ex saw me go on a date with someone else,

960
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,899
she might think,

961
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,070
"Is he not being serious about me?"

962
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,140
(He chose a partner so as not to go on a date.)

963
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,680
So if we don't match, there's no date?

964
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,680
No.

965
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,490
(Cho Yoo Sik)

966
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,620
(Everyone has sent a text with the name of the mutual date partner.)

967
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,229
What do you want to do tomorrow?

968
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,360
I've already done everything I wanted to do tomorrow.

969
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,100
- Really?
- Yes.

970
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,370
I want to go to a theme park.

971
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,239
I really wanted to go to one.

972
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
Universal Studios.

973
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,739
I went there.

974
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,170
- You did?
- Really?

975
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,180
But the theme park was inside the Tokyo Dome.

976
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,250
It wasn't like Disneyland.

977
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,780
- Really?
- I went with Seung Yong.

978
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,300
I heard you went to the haunted house.

979
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,720
The haunted house was the real deal.

980
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,090
It was odd.

981
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,589
- Is that so?
- Odd and scary.

982
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,059
I hope everyone gets a chance to go there.

983
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,820
- It's that bad.
- I hate the thought of it.

984
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,100
I'd just walk in and out of the place.

985
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,860
Bluffing.

986
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,399
What? What did she just say?

987
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,399
- "Bluffing." - And she didn't continue.

988
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,870
I bet you'd close your eyes.

989
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:20,970
Totally.

990
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,439
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

991
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,609
(Let them know via text.)

992
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,410
(Your text will be delivered with your name.)

993
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:37,720
(The time has come once again, even today.)

994
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,730
(Dear feelings they only send to one person)

995
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,060
(Everyone has sent their text.)

996
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,030
You're sitting in the best seat.

997
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,330
So it happened.

998
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,139
Did he just say, "So what?"

999
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,399
- So it happened.
- "So it happened."

1000
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,439
"So it happened."

1001
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,169
Why would I say "So what?"

1002
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,810
- I was taken aback.
- Like I would.

1003
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,880
I thought you said, "So what?"

1004
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:03,780
Where's my phone?

1005
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,150
(Baek Hyun)

1006
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,650
(It'd be nice if we could go on a date tomorrow. From Yun Nyeong)

1007
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,919
How nice it would be if we could...

1008
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,220
- work out together.
- Right?

1009
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,030
(Yun Nyeong)

1010
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
I want to go home.

1011
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:21,500
(Nyeong, let's talk about what to wear tomorrow. From Baek Hyun)

1012
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,399
The match result wasn't even out,

1013
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,520
but he wanted to talk about our outfits for tomorrow.

1014
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,899
It was hilarious.

1015
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,070
How could he be so certain?

1016
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,510
Even before getting the mutual date text,

1017
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,750
that was what I sent.

1018
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,560
(Their feelings have connected even today.)

1019
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,820
What do you carry around?

1020
00:52:48,821 --> 00:52:50,560
Wait. It's mine.

1021
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,659
- Mink?
- Mint.

1022
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,699
(Thanks for looking out for my behaviior.)

1023
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,399
I was wondering why everyone carried one around.

1024
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,829
I know, right? Same here.

1025
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,469
(Your ex picked you.)

1026
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,770
"Thanks for coming."

1027
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,239
"What a relief that he took it well." That was what I thought.

1028
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,840
- Are you opening the wine?
- No.

1029
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,080
How come?

1030
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:11,649
For real?

1031
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,780
(Woo Jin)

1032
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,650
(There aren't many days left now.)

1033
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,320
(Your ex picked you.)

1034
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,530
"Because we don't have much time..."

1035
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,860
"or things to talk about now,"

1036
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,770
"let's do our best." Wasn't that what it meant?

1037
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,240
(The two sent each other texts just like yesterday.)

1038
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,739
I have the room to myself.

1039
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,740
- Right now?
- Right.

1040
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:43,109
- It's comfortable.
- I heard you wanted to be alone.

1041
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,510
Listen. It's comfortable,

1042
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,820
but now, I want a roommate.

1043
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,319
Come to our room.

1044
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,549
- Yes.
- Yours is next to mine.

1045
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,450
- Next to mine?
- No, it's not next to hers.

1046
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,089
- What?
- Are you two next door?

1047
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,219
(Your ex picked you.)

1048
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,359
- What's our room number?
- You two are next door.

1049
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,889
- Aren't we in room 204?
- Yes.

1050
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:58,990
Sending me that text...

1051
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,230
might mean that she is expressing her feelings for me.

1052
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,100
But the text itself...

1053
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,710
wasn't all about positive feelings.

1054
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,109
Her feelings aren't deep enough...

1055
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,710
to go all in on me.

1056
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,849
The thing is, I'm not sure how to further express...

1057
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:20,920
my feelings.

1058
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,019
I've already conveyed everything...

1059
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,250
I possibly could to her.

1060
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,389
What a secretive flirtation.

1061
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,260
(Ji Hyeon)

1062
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,600
(I hope you don't stress out too much. Don't get sick.)

1063
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,299
We were roommates.

1064
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
(Your ex picked you.)

1065
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,970
He's the main source of my stress.

1066
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,870
We're constantly stressing each other out.

1067
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
What was that?

1068
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:51,480
(They passed on their complex feelings to each other.)

1069
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,120
I don't shave. My beard doesn't grow much.

1070
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,120
(Hyeon Ji)

1071
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,419
(I didn't get to see you all day. Let's hang out for long today.)

1072
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,520
(From Jae Hyeong)

1073
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,019
(Let's talk again later with ice cream. From Seung Yong)

1074
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,460
I got laser treatment twice.

1075
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,930
What I felt after receiving the texts was different.

1076
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,730
To Jae Hyeong, I felt grateful.

1077
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,740
To Seung Yong...

1078
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,340
Should I say I was bothered?

1079
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,009
Yoo Sik, are you drinking?

1080
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,019
- Drinking?
- Yes.

1081
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,380
I'm drinking buckets.

1082
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,819
- Is that so?
- Yes, why?

1083
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,489
- Just asking.
- Do you want some?

1084
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,620
I'm already drinking.

1085
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,190
I didn't empty it alone.

1086
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,460
(Yoo Sik)

1087
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,389
(I had fun thanks to you today. The sweater looks good on you.)

1088
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,630
(From Hyeon Ji)

1089
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,359
- Got it.
- Digital complex.

1090
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,370
No, please.

1091
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,700
- Guro Digital Complex?
- Digital.

1092
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,770
(Hyeon Ji)

1093
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,110
(It would've been really pretty had it not rained. From Yoo Sik)

1094
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,880
Of course, it made me happy.

1095
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,760
(The two shared their feelings with each other today as well.)

1096
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,240
(Yoo Sik)

1097
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,969
(Our Japan trip was fun. I miss it.)

1098
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,210
- Got it.
- No, please.

1099
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,279
Digital.

1100
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,540
(Your ex picked you.)

1101
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:37,320
(He received a text from Min Kyung in 4 days.)

1102
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,359
"I still have lingering feelings for you."

1103
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,730
"I like you."

1104
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,730
I wanted to convey my feelings to him.

1105
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,400
How strong.

1106
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,780
- People might be blown away.
- Exactly.

1107
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:06,479
At this rate, Ji Yeon and Min Kyung might get blown away.

1108
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,550
I know, right?

1109
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,319
The lightest two girls.

1110
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,560
(Your ex picked Park Hyeon Ji.)

1111
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,519
I clearly knew that he went on a date...

1112
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,530
with Hyeon Ji that day.

1113
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,559
I also knew that Yoo Sik's feelings...

1114
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,430
for Hyeon Ji were quite big.

1115
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,369
So the text that said he picked Hyeon Ji...

1116
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,230
didn't really shake me up.

1117
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,110
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1118
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,680
(Your ex picked Cho Yoo Sik.)

1119
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,309
The fact that my ex...

1120
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,150
keeps choosing Yoo Sik...

1121
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,390
is telling me the two are set in stone.

1122
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,660
It breaks my heart.

1123
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:56,260
(Their different feelings have been passed on.)

1124
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Keep trying.

1125
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,869
- I hope he keeps trying.
- It's not over yet.

1126
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,139
If Seung Yong keeps trying...

1127
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,799
- Yes.
- in his own way,

1128
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,310
- Right?
- he might...

1129
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,679
I don't know. Things are too certain...

1130
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,279
- between Hyeon Ji and Yoo Sik.
- Yes.

1131
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,849
There's no chance with Yoo Sik.

1132
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,949
But Hyeon Ji has some openings.

1133
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,420
- Really?
- You mean Hyeon Ji?

1134
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,779
- Is that so?
- So Seung Yong...

1135
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,649
could try to sway her.

1136
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:17,719
Attack her with reality.

1137
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,989
Yes, attacking with reality.

1138
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,259
- It won't work.
- Reality?

1139
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,519
My thoughts are the opposite.

1140
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,189
I think there's an opening with Yoo Sik.

1141
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,029
- Really?
- Not with Hyeon Ji.

1142
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,859
- Same here. He doesn't...
- With Yoo Sik?

1143
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,600
Make things certain.

1144
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,129
- Like doubts?
- I can feel it.

1145
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,800
It seems like Yoo Sik...

1146
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,000
can't act all cruel toward the person...

1147
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,070
who was with him for a long time.

1148
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,980
Watching Yoo Sik so far,

1149
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,479
he's the type who can't say...

1150
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,780
- anything mean.
- Totally.

1151
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,220
I was like him back when I was young.

1152
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,220
I really couldn't say it.

1153
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,720
I only realized it after being severely scolded by someone.

1154
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,660
I can tell who it was.

1155
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,029
(Blue Room: Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

1156
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,230
What do you two talk about?

1157
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,699
- Well...
- We don't have a set topic.

1158
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,900
- We just...
- When we feel like it,

1159
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,760
- We talk.
- we drink in our room.

1160
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,369
Like back then?

1161
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,110
- Yes.
- Like when we drank in your room?

1162
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,580
About that mutual date text.

1163
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,310
Did you get the result via text?

1164
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,150
- No.
- Me neither.

1165
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,050
I asked, wondering if I didn't get the mutual date.

1166
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,020
- I didn't get it.
- Same here.

1167
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,419
I might not have been matched.

1168
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,860
(Everyone wants to know the result.)

1169
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,860
Won't we get the text regardless of the result?

1170
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,930
Is it our room?

1171
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,400
- Yes.
- Yes?

1172
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,300
Can I come in?

1173
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,199
- What?
- Why?

1174
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,570
Weren't you talking with Hyeon Ji?

1175
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:42,940
She disappeared.

1176
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,540
You're going to drink, right?

1177
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,310
Yes.

1178
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,750
Have you talked about that with your ex?

1179
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,780
The girls made unexpected choices for the pick-a-date by the ex.

1180
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,320
I did. My date was with Min Kyung.

1181
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,849
- Yoo Sik's date was unexpected too.
- Mine was...

1182
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,560
- with Yun Nyeong.
- Exactly.

1183
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,890
It was my first ever date with Yun Nyeong.

1184
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:07,100
Yun Nyeong has a great personality.

1185
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,999
- How do you feel, Yoo Sik?
- About what?

1186
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,500
About Min Kyung.

1187
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:13,340
Min Kyung?

1188
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:18,040
Why did you two break up, Yoo Sik?

1189
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,710
Our priorities in our current realistic situation...

1190
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,920
and the future we imagined were different.

1191
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,690
The future you two imagined.

1192
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,760
Was it something serious, like marriage?

1193
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,529
Marriage was one of the few.

1194
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,830
- Really?
- Yes.

1195
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,729
If two have totally different perspectives,

1196
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,529
it's hard to be together.

1197
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,169
You can't picture the future together.

1198
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:48,669
Were your thoughts about it that different?

1199
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,340
Personality-wise, I'm someone...

1200
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,139
who can't say anything...

1201
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,309
- that I don't mean.
- I see.

1202
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:58,150
Min Kyung always brought it up.

1203
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,149
Even when she did as a joke or in a playful way,

1204
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,689
I told her not to in a serious tone.

1205
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:04,819
- About marriage?
- Yes.

1206
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,120
Like, "Let's get married?"

1207
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,189
She was like, "We should get married."

1208
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,790
But every time she said that,

1209
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,329
I treated the situation seriously.

1210
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,330
How?

1211
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,900
"Don't say things like that."

1212
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:18,000
- Really?
- Yes.

1213
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,900
Nice.

1214
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,539
He brought it up first.

1215
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,739
- What a way to ask secretly.
- Seung Yong...

1216
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,510
- For real.
- He's a strategist.

1217
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,239
That's great information.

1218
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,709
He's figuring out his enemy.

1219
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:30,710
Hold on.

1220
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,149
- Yes?
- May I come in?

1221
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,920
(Another person has come.)

1222
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,449
- It's Woo Jin.
- What are you doing?

1223
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,490
- Hi.
- Chatting.

1224
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,359
Have you seen Hyeon Ji?

1225
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,759
Hyeon Ji? No.

1226
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,490
- May I join?
- Of course.

1227
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,800
In the end, everyone has gathered.

1228
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,029
We were asking about Yoo Sik's life.

1229
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:52,799
I took a shower. I was dying to wash up.

1230
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,640
Say that Min Kyung...

1231
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,240
is understanding of it now.

1232
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,640
Would your feelings change?

1233
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,009
- If Min Kyung were to understand...
- Yes.

1234
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,150
- my situation?
- Correct.

1235
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,250
She'll accept the situation...

1236
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:09,919
- and even go along...
- Work together.

1237
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,190
With the direction you're going.

1238
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,720
Min Kyung might say that...

1239
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,290
she'll understand my situation right now.

1240
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,299
But you can't trust her.

1241
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,929
Right. "Will she really?"

1242
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:24,570
No. Beyond that,

1243
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,670
at the end...

1244
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:30,000
of a long-term relationship is marriage.

1245
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:34,110
But I'm not sure if I want to get married yet.

1246
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,250
- Right, you're too young.
- You're young.

1247
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,480
(New dilemmas pile up as the time to choose nears.)

1248
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,049
That talk just now was...

1249
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,050
- Right?
- I know.

1250
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,419
Seung Yong is smart.

1251
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,959
- Come on.
- No wonder he's a doctor.

1252
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,589
He set up a trap, and Yoo Sik fell for it.

1253
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,829
- He fell for the trap.
- Imagine how Seung Yong...

1254
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,259
will pass that on to Hyeon Ji.

1255
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,659
- Right?
- Exactly.

1256
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:54,729
Imagine how he'll exaggerate it.

1257
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,869
- Exaggerate it a little...
- Add a bit to it and...

1258
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,669
- Just a tad bit.
- It only needs a tiny bit.

1259
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,000
He'd win an award right away.

1260
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,669
- Award?
- An award?

1261
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,070
Exaggeration is all it needs.

1262
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,239
(Purple Room: Min Kyung and Yun Nyeong's room)

1263
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,039
Who did you choose today?

1264
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,480
I chose Won Kyu.

1265
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,779
- What about you, Min Kyung?
- How honest.

1266
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:17,549
Last time I talked with Woo Jin,

1267
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,819
I said, "If we go on another date, let's eat something really good."

1268
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,090
- So I picked Woo Jin.
- You picked Woo Jin?

1269
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,459
- Right.
- It was the last time.

1270
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,099
I don't think Woo Jin chose...

1271
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,220
To be considerate of you, he wouldn't have chosen me.

1272
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,830
- You mean, Woo Jin?
- Yes.

1273
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,369
- Because it has to be reciprocal?
- That's possible.

1274
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,740
Yes, it has to be reciprocal.

1275
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,270
But I've told him once.

1276
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:42,280
"Let's eat something really good."

1277
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:44,780
You get to go out only when it's reciprocal.

1278
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:47,450
- When will the result be out?
- Your date is confirmed.

1279
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,950
I talked to him a moment ago.

1280
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,389
- Did you talk to Yoo Sik?
- Yes, I did.

1281
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:58,529
I think his interest in her grows the more he sees her.

1282
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,929
- I see.
- So...

1283
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,630
the date with your ex remains.

1284
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,429
We still have a chance to go on a date with someone else.

1285
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,639
I asked him, "After our date,"

1286
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,839
"if you go on a date with Hyeon Ji again,"

1287
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,609
"will you fall for her even more?"

1288
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,140
The more he sees her, his interest in her grows.

1289
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,380
Yoo Sik answered,

1290
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,650
"Then I won't go on a date with her."

1291
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,219
He must still have feelings for you.

1292
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,990
- He's not completely over you.
- Based on his answer.

1293
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,359
The fact that they went out today affected me a lot.

1294
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,959
- Right.
- It couldn't be helped.

1295
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,360
Everyone else was home.

1296
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,129
- Everyone else was home.
- Only the two of them went out.

1297
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:36,029
Right. It felt like...

1298
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,200
they went on an official date.

1299
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,300
It affected me very much.

1300
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:44,139
I haven't expressed my feelings...

1301
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,470
to someone else.

1302
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,979
I don't know how the mutual date will turn out.

1303
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,549
- Right, the mutual date...
- It'd have a huge impact.

1304
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:54,179
If he doesn't go on the mutual date...

1305
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,049
Hyeon Ji definitely picked Yoo Sik.

1306
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,520
I think so too.

1307
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,149
- I don't know whom Yoo Sik picked.
- Yoo Sik's choice...

1308
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,720
Exactly.

1309
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,590
Based on what he told me,

1310
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:07,600
I don't think he picked her.

1311
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,959
Later,

1312
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,969
everyone could get together...

1313
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,600
and take a look at the results.

1314
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,439
If you find out that Yoo Sik is...

1315
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,110
going out on a date with Hyeon Ji...

1316
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,279
Yoo Sik that I know wouldn't have done that.

1317
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,310
Right.

1318
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:26,480
He said that he wouldn't.

1319
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,220
You should've picked Baek Hyun instead.

1320
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,590
Then you could have stayed at home with Yoo Sik.

1321
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,520
I won't get to go out with Woo Jin.

1322
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,159
- You never know.
- You don't know that.

1323
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,640
- Woo Jin has no one to choose.
- You suggested him something.

1324
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,030
You should've picked Baek Hyun instead.

1325
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,430
I should've done that.

1326
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,129
Until now,

1327
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,339
I sent a text to someone different every day.

1328
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,440
Really?

1329
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,210
I never sent one to Yoo Sik ever since we came here.

1330
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,009
You should send him a text if you want to get back with him.

1331
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,949
I told her to forget about her sense of pride.

1332
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,479
She needs to forget about her sense of pride.

1333
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,319
I sent a text to him today.

1334
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,720
(Today, she sent a text to Yoo Sik.)

1335
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,920
Forget about your sense of pride if you want to get back together.

1336
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,530
What if I have to go out with Woo Jin?

1337
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,759
It'd be ridiculous if you went out...

1338
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,670
- while Yoo Sik stayed home.
- Right.

1339
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,540
What if you go out while Yoo Sik stays home?

1340
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,210
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not crying. Wait.

1341
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,510
That didn't cross my mind.

1342
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:34,249
- Goodness.
- What is it?

1343
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,420
- My goodness.
- After brushing my teeth...

1344
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,749
We got a message.

1345
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,319
Is it about who failed to be matched?

1346
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,559
- Did people get matched?
- No.

1347
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,190
- Hey.
- The ones who are going out...

1348
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,189
Who are they? Tell me.

1349
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,589
- What is it?
- Lee Jae Hyeong, Park Ji Hyeon.

1350
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:47,259
Sung Baek Hyun, Choi Yun Nyeong. Jung Won Kyu, Hong Ji Yeon.

1351
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,559
Cho Yoo Sik, Park Hyeon Ji.

1352
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,670
(The mutual date result)

1353
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,940
(Yoo Sik will go on a date with Hyeon Ji.)

1354
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,110
My gosh.

1355
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,650
He told me that he wouldn't go out.

1356
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,219
- Oh, no.
- Yoo Sik and Hyeon Ji?

1357
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,019
- Wait a minute.
- Goodness.

1358
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,189
- I knew he'd cause trouble.
- Oh, no.

1359
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:17,190
I thought so too.

1360
01:07:17,191 --> 01:07:18,659
- He misunderstood.
- My goodness.

1361
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,059
The words were so confusing that...

1362
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,159
- we almost asked them to replay.
- It's a misunderstanding.

1363
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,229
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

1364
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:26,569
Both Ji Yeon and Yun Nyeong look shocked.

1365
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,069
- I know.
- This is real.

1366
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:30,240
Oh, no. Even I'm walking on eggshells.

1367
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,010
Goodness.

1368
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,079
Once, I've gone around to enter.

1369
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,150
- Did you go around here?
- Yes.

1370
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,179
(The mutual date result)

1371
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:42,579
(Park Ji Hyeon and Lee Jae Hyeong, Hong Ji Yeon and Jung Won Kyu, )

1372
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,319
(Choi Yun Nyeong and Sung Baek Hyun, Park Hyeon Ji and Cho Yoo Sik)

1373
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,096
(Four couples have been matched for the date.)

1374
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,560
(The match result was also delivered to the men.)

1375
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,730
- What is it?
- No way.

1376
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,900
- What?
- They sent this via text?

1377
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:06,840
- Gosh.
- Isn't it so cruel?

1378
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,480
So other people weren't matched?

1379
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:12,050
Still, there are four couples.

1380
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,680
Who are the remaining people?

1381
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,290
Woo Jin and...

1382
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,589
- Min Kyung.
- And Seung Yong?

1383
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:20,896
(Min Kyung, Woo Jin, and Seung Yong will remain.)

1384
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,960
Gosh.

1385
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,390
He told me that he wouldn't go out.

1386
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,300
Gosh, I will be back.

1387
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,000
Okay.

1388
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,640
Isn't he out of his mind?

1389
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,590
It's so windy. Do you see the palm trees moving?

1390
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,160
- Let's have a drink.
- Shall we have a drink?

1391
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,319
- Aren't you drinking?
- Wait.

1392
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,290
Let me check something with Hyeon Ji.

1393
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,139
Here's a thought I had...

1394
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,740
right after receiving the text.

1395
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,439
I can't be interested in multiple people.

1396
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,440
Okay.

1397
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:18,680
I couldn't think of anyone I wanted to go out on a date with,

1398
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,519
so I picked Yun Nyeong.

1399
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,080
- She wouldn't pick me anyway.
- Right.

1400
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,890
But everyone else got matched.

1401
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,836
Do you want to go out on a date when you want to get back together?

1402
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,019
I really want to know. It's not because I'm upset.

1403
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,430
- Can I respond first?
- Yes.

1404
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:34,000
You and I have talked the most.

1405
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,200
It's not that I don't want to get back with her.

1406
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,400
Yes?

1407
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,380
Is Yoo Sik here?

1408
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,510
Yoo Sik.

1409
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,450
You said that you wouldn't go out.

1410
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,859
- Right.
- You said that you wouldn't go out.

1411
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,530
I told them that I wouldn't go out.

1412
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:13,330
When I told you that I was worried, you said you wouldn't go out.

1413
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,999
You said that you'd think about it instead of going out,

1414
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,110
but why are you going out?

1415
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,980
Are you happy to make a fool out of me?

1416
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,440
You won't go out on a date?

1417
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,880
Did I apply to go out?

1418
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,950
You're really awful.

1419
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,390
You never think about me.

1420
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,220
You never did.

1421
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,690
Are you happy to make a fool out of me?

1422
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,829
How did I make a fool out of you?

1423
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:42,030
- You keep making a fool out of me.
- What do you mean?

1424
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,170
You promised not to go out.

1425
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,840
Do we have to go this far?

1426
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,070
Is that our relationship?

1427
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,750
What is it that you don't understand?

1428
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,779
Did I treat you so badly?

1429
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,420
During our preliminary meeting, did I complain to you?

1430
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:10,220
You've been treating me this way because you're going with the flow.

1431
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,690
I wasn't going with the flow.

1432
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:17,099
You thought that I had no feelings for you anymore.

1433
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,930
- You had no feelings for me.
- How would that be possible?

1434
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,670
What did you say during the interview?

1435
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,370
- That I wanted to meet someone new.
- Right!

1436
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:28,939
Anyone can say that at first.

1437
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,480
Yes, I understand that anyone can say that at first.

1438
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,780
You're really terrible.

1439
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,220
Is this why you came on the show?

1440
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,450
To abandon me like this.

1441
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:43,990
To see me get ruined.

1442
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,230
Then why did you come on the show?

1443
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,830
Obviously, I wanted to meet someone new.

1444
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,669
It was also to be with you.

1445
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,599
If we ended things badly, I wouldn't be here.

1446
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,769
Did I ever say that I don't care about you at all?

1447
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,710
But that's how you behave!

1448
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:05,410
You keep telling me that you have feelings for me.

1449
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,479
- When did I say that?
- You said I wasn't nothing to you.

1450
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,549
Right, how can I not care about you?

1451
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:10,989
Exactly. I mean something to you.

1452
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:13,019
Then what are you doing with Hyeon Ji?

1453
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,790
Should I have picked you instead?

1454
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,789
It said that it wasn't allowed.

1455
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,360
There's something you told me a while ago.

1456
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:23,330
Is that why you didn't respond until the last moment?

1457
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:24,700
What do you mean?

1458
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,329
What did I not respond to?

1459
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,469
You kept giving me hope.

1460
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,140
Hope for what?

1461
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,309
You said that you might want to get back with me.

1462
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,310
I can't ignore you completely.

1463
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,540
Then go out with Hyeon Ji.

1464
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:40,380
If those nine years were nothing, go out with her.

1465
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,949
- You've always been like this.
- What about you?

1466
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,590
As those nine years were nothing to you,

1467
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,989
did you want to meet someone new?

1468
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:48,059
Is that why you said during the interview...

1469
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,529
that you wanted to meet someone who treats you better than me?

1470
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,060
As those nine years were nothing to you, you got over me?

1471
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:57,199
Think about what you said before.

1472
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,200
That's funny.

1473
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,840
Who made me break up with you?

1474
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,139
Do you want me to give up everything and be with you again?

1475
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,209
What would you give up?

1476
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:09,979
Do you want me to stop everything including work?

1477
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,409
Did I ask you to give up your work?

1478
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:13,209
Then what should I give up?

1479
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,919
- Did I ask you to give up?
- What do I do other than work?

1480
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,149
- Did I ask you to give up?
- Then what?

1481
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,549
All I asked was to care about me a little more.

1482
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,019
- Wasn't it because...
- All you had to do was apologize.

1483
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,089
Wasn't it because we weren't spending enough time together?

1484
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,629
You could've said, "I'm sorry,"

1485
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,089
"I'll take better care of you."

1486
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:27,160
Is this what you want?

1487
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,070
Stay in the same situation and get back together...

1488
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,240
while you get hurt by me? Is that what you want?

1489
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:36,739
I've told you many times that I don't want to lose you.

1490
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:37,810
Exactly.

1491
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:41,810
You've gotten hurt by me a lot.

1492
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:43,579
That's why we broke up.

1493
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,050
Do you want us to be together under the same circumstances?

1494
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,490
So you have no intention to make things better?

1495
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,089
- For us to get back together, - You don't want to be with me.

1496
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,890
What do I have to give up?

1497
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,289
I just need you to care about me a little more.

1498
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,000
Did I not care about you when we were in a relationship?

1499
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,400
I worked hard and cared about you,

1500
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,870
but we couldn't spend much time together.

1501
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,939
Do you want us to spend more time together?

1502
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,010
Then shouldn't I give up my work?

1503
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,909
- I didn't ask you that.
- Then what?

1504
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,179
I just want you to care more about me.

1505
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,110
How can I care more about you?

1506
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,110
Isn't it spending more time with each other?

1507
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,319
Even when I went on dates with other people,

1508
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,089
I didn't forget about our time together.

1509
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,089
- And I forgot?
- You already forgot.

1510
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,499
- I already told Hyeon Ji about it.
- You forgot about it.

1511
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,729
- I told Hyeon Ji about it.
- Yoo Sik, you forgot about it.

1512
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,230
A period of nine years isn't short.

1513
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:41,739
I can't say that I don't care about Min Kyung.

1514
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,900
It's not short?

1515
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,540
- It's half of your life.
- It's long.

1516
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:46,840
It's long.

1517
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:49,140
It's long for me too.

1518
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,280
You're precious to me too.

1519
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,079
- But...
- I didn't say...

1520
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,950
that I didn't care about you.

1521
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:02,820
Come back here.

1522
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:08,399
Come back. You're getting wet from the rain.

1523
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,800
Let me go.

1524
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:13,000
I don't want to talk here.

1525
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
Let me go.

1526
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,260
(Yoo Sik comes back with some tissue.)

1527
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:42,630
Wipe off your tears.

1528
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,470
Once I leave here, I'll never see you again.

1529
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,080
I refuse to see you.

1530
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:01,980
Will that be okay?

1531
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,889
What did I do so wrong?

1532
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,020
Come here and talk.

1533
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,829
I didn't say that you did something wrong.

1534
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:15,099
What did I do so wrong...

1535
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,899
- that you fall for someone easily?
- That's not what I'm saying.

1536
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,229
When did I fall for someone easily?

1537
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,930
It seems that way to me.

1538
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,500
It seems like you fell for someone easily.

1539
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,109
That's what you think, but it's not true.

1540
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,440
That's how I see it.

1541
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,640
Just say no.

1542
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,049
- "I don't like you." - Why would you say that?

1543
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,950
"I don't like you anymore. Go away."

1544
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,620
Say that to me instead.

1545
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,489
We were together for nine years. Do you think...

1546
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:40,719
that I can say that so easily?

1547
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,060
You say that to me every day.

1548
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,289
Hyeon Ji wants to get married.

1549
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,830
What do you think about marriage?

1550
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,050
You said that it's impossible with me.

1551
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,280
Have you guys talked about that?

1552
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,870
Am I here to get married?

1553
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,810
That's part of the reason why we broke up.

1554
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,980
Have you ever imagined a future with me?

1555
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,250
- I have.
- Like what?

1556
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,280
Why didn't you tell me?

1557
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,879
Why should I tell you about a future...

1558
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,090
that I'm not sure about?

1559
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:16,620
What if things don't turn out the way I imagine?

1560
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,090
What if you get hurt later?

1561
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,659
I've already been hurt.

1562
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,129
I've been hurt too.

1563
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:25,200
How did I hurt you?

1564
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,870
Tell me what I did so wrong.

1565
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:35,840
I really want to know.

1566
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:39,110
You didn't do anything wrong.

1567
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,410
Then?

1568
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,050
It's my fault.

1569
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:57,160
(The knot gets tangled up even more.)

1570
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:01,740
My lips are getting dry.

1571
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:06,010
Why isn't their conversation going anywhere?

1572
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,780
Why aren't things working out for them?

1573
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,410
I think he still has feelings for her.

1574
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,850
- Do you mean Yoo Sik?
- Yes.

1575
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:15,619
Even if it isn't love, he might feel confused.

1576
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,479
Is it love...

1577
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,389
or is he just attached to her?

1578
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,989
- Or lingering feelings.
- Right.

1579
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:23,420
I don't think...

1580
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:26,389
he's able to say easily how he feels.

1581
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:28,829
There must be a world between them that we don't know about.

1582
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,529
They've been together for a long time.

1583
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:33,369
They're learning how to break up...

1584
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,299
- on the show.
- I think so too.

1585
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,170
Neither of them know how to break up.

1586
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,439
- Let me start.
- Okay.

1587
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,556
(The three of them are still talking.)

1588
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,209
At first, I thought about who to pick for a long time.

1589
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,450
I couldn't pick my ex.

1590
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,579
Then there was Ji Hyeon.

1591
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,650
Before sending the text,

1592
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,020
she said that she was grateful to me and wanted to buy me a meal.

1593
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,619
We talked about eating together, so I picked her.

1594
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,660
I see.

1595
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,359
- What about you?
- Me?

1596
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,599
Isn't the question really for me?

1597
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,829
- Is that not it?
- I'm wondering if I'm strange.

1598
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,469
- Really?
- I wanted to know about you too.

1599
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,740
- I...
- Okay.

1600
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,639
First of all, she and I...

1601
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,480
hardly got to talk lately.

1602
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,179
- But you did. Like yesterday.
- Who?

1603
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,340
- Well, we talked a bit.
- Didn't you guys talk today?

1604
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,449
But it wasn't a proper conversation.

1605
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,449
She just happened to be there when I went down for some food.

1606
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,489
- That's it.
- Are you talking about Ji Hyeon?

1607
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,890
- No, Ji Yeon. My ex.
- Ji Yeon.

1608
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:30,360
The vibe I'm getting from her now...

1609
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,060
is different from before.

1610
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:37,930
And I'm getting close to making up my mind.

1611
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,429
But I didn't get to have...

1612
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,499
a serious conversation with her about that yet.

1613
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,739
- I absolutely think you should.
- Yes. I must.

1614
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,440
I'm not telling you this because I'm mad at you or anything.

1615
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:49,840
I was just questioning myself.

1616
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,249
I'm just seeking advice.

1617
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,879
- I...
- I'm not upset or anything.

1618
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,279
- I thought I should talk to her.
- I see.

1619
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,656
You guys haven't talked about it yet.

1620
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,390
- I...
- I thought you already did.

1621
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:03,820
You have to understand that I saw you two talk yesterday...

1622
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,490
and today.

1623
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

1624
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,439
- What's going on?
- Do you want to come in?

1625
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,839
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure. Come in.

1626
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,870
Who's here?

1627
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,520
- It's the three of us.
- It's us. It's Jae Hyeong and me.

1628
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,610
Oh, thanks.

1629
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,786
There are only men here. You don't mind if I join you guys?

1630
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:26,950
- It doesn't matter.
- Sure.

1631
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:29,749
Anyway, so that's where you stand.

1632
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,979
Yes, that's where I stand.

1633
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,826
- Where do you stand?
- I thought I was the weird one.

1634
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:34,759
I cleared everything with her.

1635
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,860
So that explains my thinking process.

1636
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,706
- Actually...
- I thought I was being weird.

1637
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,630
You're more interested in getting back with your ex.

1638
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,400
That's why you could do that.

1639
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:44,670
- Is that so?
- That's why.

1640
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,000
Isn't it weird how they revealed the matching results in a text?

1641
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:52,910
- Right?
- Yes.

1642
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:54,810
At this point,

1643
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:56,439
- there are no secrets.
- Right. It doesn't matter.

1644
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,849
- What? About our feelings?
- So it's out in the open.

1645
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,209
No. I mean, yes. That too.

1646
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:00,449
- I'm talking about messages too.
- Right.

1647
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,479
No one's hiding their feelings now.

1648
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,719
- Right.
- Everything...

1649
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,820
I've never shared my feelings.

1650
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:13,430
You've never shared your feelings. I have no idea how you feel.

1651
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,030
I'm sorry.

1652
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,929
My goodness. I should go...

1653
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:19,930
- and talk to my ex too.
- I'm sorry. Don't leave.

1654
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:21,570
My gosh.

1655
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,739
I'll step out for a moment.

1656
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:29,080
(Everyone is confused by the news of their ex's date.)

1657
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,660
(He feels awkward around his ex and her date.)

1658
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,360
Pretend I'm not here. You guys can just talk.

1659
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,050
- What? No.
- That's unnecessary.

1660
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,260
I'm going on a date with Jae Hyeong tomorrow.

1661
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,560
Right.

1662
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,399
You guys can talk. I'll leave.

1663
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,130
- Why don't you leave?
- Okay.

1664
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,910
- Why are you really leaving?
- I'm serious. Go on and talk.

1665
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:00,839
By the way, whose room is this?

1666
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,880
It's mine.

1667
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:09,019
Hold on. Is Baek Hyun talking...

1668
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:10,180
to Yun Nyeong?

1669
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,890
- Probably. You have no place to go.
- Right?

1670
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:15,690
And Woo Jin went to talk to her.

1671
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,559
(Even if he leaves, he has no place to go.)

1672
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,630
I have no place to go.

1673
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,429
But once Jae Hyeong and I start talking,

1674
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,800
you'll find out about our secret.

1675
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,239
- What?
- If you listen to our conversation,

1676
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,970
you will hear...

1677
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,240
about what happened between us before coming here.

1678
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,080
- What happened between you two?
- Yes.

1679
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,850
- What happened between us?
- Yes.

1680
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:42,320
- Well, it doesn't matter.
- We...

1681
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,920
It doesn't matter? My gosh. You must be so open-minded.

1682
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,260
You don't mind hearing about Ji Yeon and me, right?

1683
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,889
- Actually, I don't want to hear it.
- Really?

1684
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:53,260
I'm very jealous.

1685
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,560
I get jealous too.

1686
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,499
Okay. So I get it. Where should I go now?

1687
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,400
I don't know. I'll go and wander around. Go on.

1688
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:10,510
(Won Kyu steps out while leaving them in the room.)

1689
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:12,750
Cheers.

1690
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,850
I wasn't...

1691
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:23,689
interested in getting back with my ex when I moved in.

1692
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:24,690
Right.

1693
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,299
I was hoping that they wouldn't be so focused on their ex.

1694
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,300
Same here.

1695
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,699
But I'm getting the feeling that they're a lot more focused...

1696
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,799
on getting their ex back than I anticipated.

1697
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,940
I see.

1698
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,340
You should've moved in early, actually.

1699
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:43,940
What about you? Where do you stand on getting back with your ex now?

1700
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,650
Cheers.

1701
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,250
No comment?

1702
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,460
Getting back together with my ex...

1703
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,590
is tough.

1704
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:02,359
Of course.

1705
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,630
Getting back together with my ex means...

1706
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,470
considering a lot more things than starting a new relationship.

1707
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,569
When I first moved in,

1708
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:16,580
- I expressed my interest in you.
- Yes.

1709
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:19,080
We talked and went on a date.

1710
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:23,050
Afterward, I thought I should take more initiative.

1711
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,950
Then that's when they informed us that we were going to Japan.

1712
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:31,020
I see. But for my date, I chose...

1713
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,660
You chose Seung Yong.

1714
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,360
- Right.
- When that happened,

1715
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,600
I was disappointed.

1716
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:40,700
That was all.

1717
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,370
This is why timing is important.

1718
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:46,010
Totally.

1719
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:53,710
It's been a while since Ji Hyeon and I talked.

1720
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:58,020
I will have to talk to her more and go on more dates with her...

1721
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:01,620
to see if I can develop more romantic feelings for her.

1722
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,060
But despite that, she's special to me.

1723
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:09,229
I thought things might change if she and I talked one more time.

1724
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,830
And I hoped that it would.

1725
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:17,270
(They carefully try to align their missed connections.)

1726
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,280
(Won Kyu braves through the storm and comes out.)

1727
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:29,150
(He's visiting Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong.)

1728
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,050
(Can I come in?)

1729
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:33,049
Come on in.

1730
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,550
(He gets permission to enter.)

1731
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:41,730
Right. Appearance draws attraction.

1732
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:42,999
I was drawn to you.

1733
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,030
Really?

1734
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,899
- If you say I'm not your...
- I'm not sure if I can join you.

1735
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:48,369
- Come on in. Please sit.
- Sure.

1736
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:49,539
(They warmly welcome Won Kyu who has no place to go.)

1737
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:50,570
I was drawn to you.

1738
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,910
But you said I wasn't your ideal type.

1739
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:57,079
When I told you my ideal type, I was just really detailed.

1740
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,749
I don't think I should sit next to you guys.

1741
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,679
(He shamelessly sits next to the happy couple.)

1742
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,750
Who were you with until now?

1743
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,570
It was the three of us. Jae Hyeong, Ji Hyeon, and me.

1744
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,619
You thought you shouldn't be there, so you left to join another group.

1745
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,119
Yes. I just left the room.

1746
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,589
Why? You left Ji Hyeon and Jae Hyeong alone?

1747
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:13,260
- Yes. I just...
- Ji Hyeon...

1748
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:14,330
Ji Hyeon...

1749
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:17,600
Exactly.

1750
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:26,310
(At the same time, Woo Jin came to Ji Yeon's room.)

1751
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,740
It's hard to understand everyone's feelings.

1752
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,050
Then why did you pick Won Kyu...

1753
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,880
when you texted me?

1754
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:40,750
On tomorrow's date, I'm going to tell Won Kyu...

1755
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,360
that I want to focus my time and energy on figuring out...

1756
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:49,130
whether I can or even want to get back together with you.

1757
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,859
You guys still haven't had that talk yet?

1758
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,900
- No.
- I see.

1759
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:57,770
I'm going to stay here.

1760
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,560
Isn't it raining outside? Isn't it humid there?

1761
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,470
Do you want to sit here? So you're comfortable?

1762
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,870
So you're going on a date tomorrow to have that talk?

1763
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,599
I wouldn't say that's the only reason.

1764
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,610
Okay.

1765
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,839
- Won Kyu was the only one...
- I...

1766
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,710
I could pick other than you.

1767
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,449
But you texted me yesterday...

1768
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:40,450
- and today.
- Yes.

1769
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:42,820
You've been spending time with me.

1770
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:46,019
So I assumed...

1771
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,649
you would either get back together with me...

1772
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:49,260
- or not date anyone else.
- I see.

1773
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,829
- But I wanted...
- You...

1774
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:54,490
to go on a date with him, so I could end everything.

1775
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:56,429
- So I find that ridiculous.
- I wanted to say goodbye.

1776
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,100
I can't understand that.

1777
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:01,599
Ji Yeon, when you told me that I wanted to talk to Min Kyung,

1778
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,600
you said I didn't need to go on a date to do that.

1779
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,569
You said I could easily talk to her.

1780
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:06,709
- You...
- You told me...

1781
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:08,509
you were certain that you wanted to get back together with me.

1782
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:09,840
- Yes.
- Right.

1783
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,179
Aren't you going to have that talk because you're certain too?

1784
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,949
I'm certain now, so I'm going to talk to him.

1785
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:16,449
Right. Then do you have to go on a date to have that talk?

1786
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:19,790
Let's say you're certain about me and want to tell him how you feel.

1787
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,089
It doesn't have to be a date.

1788
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:23,519
You can even tell him tonight...

1789
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,859
or tomorrow morning. There are many ways to go about it.

1790
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,460
I didn't think that far.

1791
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:30,200
- I... Yes.
- That's what you told me.

1792
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:32,399
But your actions tell a different story.

1793
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,700
I thought you wouldn't go on a date.

1794
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,170
But you went on the date too.

1795
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,539
Right. So I told you I didn't think it through.

1796
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,410
I apologized to you.

1797
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,579
I thought going on a date with her...

1798
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,280
I mean, I told you that because it didn't cross my mind.

1799
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,749
But going back to what happened today,

1800
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,390
if you seriously wanted to consider getting back together with me,

1801
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:53,690
you should spend more time with me.

1802
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:56,530
Isn't that the way to find out if this is what you want?

1803
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,860
- I understand your point.
- Yes.

1804
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,160
I get it. But that didn't occur to me.

1805
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,399
- I've been telling you that.
- Okay.

1806
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,199
So in my opinion, you have double standards.

1807
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,899
- Yes. I think I was wrong.
- Yes.

1808
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,340
- I do have double standards.
- Yes.

1809
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:12,870
- Are you mad that I brought it up?
- No, I'm not mad.

1810
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,310
It sounded like you were mad.

1811
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:19,879
Part of me thought that...

1812
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,580
she might be going on a date to have that talk.

1813
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,850
But she could've done that in the house.

1814
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:28,420
Was going on a date necessary?

1815
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:34,960
(Woo Jin comes out alone to the communal area.)

1816
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:51,210
All the tough moments I had to deal with alone...

1817
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:54,880
since moving into the house in Pyeongchang-dong came over me.

1818
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,230
I'm sorry.

1819
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,430
I shouldn't have done that.

1820
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:16,640
Gosh, this is so annoying.

1821
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,510
Come on.

1822
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,280
Go away, please.

1823
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:32,690
Could you leave me alone, Ji Yeon?

1824
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,060
I'll stay next to you.

1825
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,620
But I won't look at you.

1826
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:55,680
(It's not easy to calm his emotions.)

1827
01:30:57,110 --> 01:31:00,310
(And the conversation between Yoo Sik and Min Kyung isn't over.)

1828
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:04,050
Just tell me why you wanted...

1829
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,890
to go on a date with her after the conversation we had.

1830
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:14,060
You said you wouldn't go on a date. Why did you pick her?

1831
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,830
I naturally thought that you wouldn't pick her.

1832
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,800
Okay. I'm sorry about that.

1833
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,170
Why did you do that?

1834
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,170
- I just did.
- So why?

1835
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:28,410
I just thought I should since it said I couldn't pick you.

1836
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:30,840
But let me be honest with you.

1837
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:34,010
If I could pick you for the date, I would have picked you.

1838
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,050
You didn't think that I would be bothered by it?

1839
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,420
Don't you remember our conversation?

1840
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:43,560
Yes? Yoo Sik.

1841
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,759
When we were having that conversation earlier,

1842
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,960
if you said no...

1843
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,129
and you would do what you wanted,

1844
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,799
I wouldn't have said anything to you now.

1845
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,770
But you said you wouldn't.

1846
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,639
You wouldn't have said anything?

1847
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,340
Even if I said no,

1848
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:01,040
you wouldn't have moved until you got the answer you wanted.

1849
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,540
You always say this to every decision I make.

1850
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:07,309
"Had you done that, I would've done this."

1851
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:08,390
That's what you always say.

1852
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:11,079
If I told you not to intervene with my decisions,

1853
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,490
you would've let me?

1854
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,950
You would've been okay with that?

1855
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,790
That's not you.

1856
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,799
After what you promised me earlier,

1857
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,900
you should follow through on your promise.

1858
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,800
You said you wouldn't go on a date, but why did you pick her?

1859
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,310
Why did you do that?

1860
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:36,010
You knew I would find out.

1861
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,750
- Yes.
- Why did you do that?

1862
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,950
I told you earlier.

1863
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:46,150
You clearly expressed how you felt.

1864
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:49,160
And I clearly told you where I stood.

1865
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:52,590
But we keep talking about the same thing over and over again.

1866
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:57,460
So I asked you to give me some time to think it over more seriously.

1867
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,039
But you're going on a date tomorrow. Will you have time to think?

1868
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,070
I will.

1869
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:08,369
I'm curious about why you chose to go on a date with Hyeon Ji...

1870
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,080
after everything you told me earlier.

1871
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:14,380
Why did you pick Hyeon Ji?

1872
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:24,360
(The two of them are getting tired of repeating the same conversation.)

1873
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:28,060
When are you leaving tomorrow?

1874
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:30,360
At 9am.

1875
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,130
Good for you. You have time to go on a date.

1876
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:36,640
Min Kyung, stop it.

1877
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,540
Stop what?

1878
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,710
I feel so sorry for myself.

1879
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,579
That's why I can't help but ask you repeatedly...

1880
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,480
what I did so wrong.

1881
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,080
You didn't do anything wrong.

1882
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,849
What have I done so wrong that...

1883
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:55,719
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- you're pushing me away?

1884
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,160
You really didn't do anything wrong.

1885
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:59,630
Tell me.

1886
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,670
I'll wait until you give me an answer.

1887
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,070
An answer about what?

1888
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,680
About what you want to tell me.

1889
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:16,080
I told you earlier. I needed time to think about this.

1890
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:20,580
I kept your side for all these years.

1891
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,550
But you met her only a week ago.

1892
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,320
So think about if it even makes sense to compare me to her.

1893
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:32,290
I told you I would seriously think about that.

1894
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:36,530
Besides, this act of dedication wasn't one-sided.

1895
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:39,530
- What?
- I also kept your side too.

1896
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:42,546
- I'm grateful for that.
- This was our relationship.

1897
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:44,199
- Thank you for that.
- This relationship of nine years...

1898
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,400
- wasn't one-sided.
- I told you I was grateful for it.

1899
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,309
Because I'm very grateful to you,

1900
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,439
I can't move on from you.

1901
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,780
I get it. You told me about your feelings...

1902
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,250
over the past few days now. So I get it.

1903
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,550
If you let go of my hand,

1904
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,990
it really is over.

1905
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:10,100
All that time we spent together will go in vain.

1906
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:15,340
I want you to be sorry for the rest of your life.

1907
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,440
Let's end it.

1908
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:45,330
(Just like that, their conversation ended.)

1909
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:50,270
Why did you tell Min Kyung that I was going on a date yesterday?

1910
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,000
Right.

1911
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:55,510
- Well... I can't?
- Don't tell anyone.

1912
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,739
I was only telling her...

1913
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:59,509
Just do your best and mind your own business.

1914
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:01,480
Why would you tell Min Kyung?

1915
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,749
- "They're going out." - That will upset her.

1916
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,470
I only said, "I heard they were going out."

1917
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:09,660
- Is Jae Hyeong outside?
- Yes.

1918
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:11,160
Where did Jae Hyeong go?

1919
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:13,389
- He's in another room.
- What?

1920
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:14,590
He's in a different room.

1921
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,560
(Green Room: Seung Yong and Jae Hyeong's room)

1922
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:20,769
So? How do you feel?

1923
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:22,500
You didn't look so happy earlier.

1924
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,540
Why can't I hide that I'm upset?

1925
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:29,180
Why? Something happened?

1926
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,709
- Then why?
- Nothing happened.

1927
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:34,179
I just have a lot on my mind.

1928
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,700
What's bothering you? Can you tell me?

1929
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:38,020
- Seriously.
- What?

1930
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:40,049
You want to choose Yoo Sik,

1931
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,090
but he won't give you reassurance?

1932
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,030
So I'm pretty bothered.

1933
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:48,730
- Like what?
- The things you said.

1934
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:52,800
- The practical matters?
- He's not open enough...

1935
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:55,300
to talk about them.

1936
01:36:55,670 --> 01:36:58,740
So I can't talk to him about it.

1937
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:02,110
You should've talked to him indirectly.

1938
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:04,879
Talk to him about what indirectly?

1939
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,250
About the details. Like...

1940
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,119
Whatever's on your heart.

1941
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,720
For example, "When do you plan to get married?"

1942
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:14,350
Even if I say that indirectly...

1943
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:16,090
Why?

1944
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:19,330
You do have a point though.

1945
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:20,790
But...

1946
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:23,400
the problem is solved if you get married late.

1947
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:29,500
I like someone who gives me reassurance.

1948
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,169
It's hard.

1949
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:33,940
So I'm making myself clear.

1950
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,780
But I don't like it when you put it like that.

1951
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,950
- Like what?
- Like now.

1952
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:43,349
- The way you talk.
- As if I'm showing off?

1953
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:44,880
No, the way you talk.

1954
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:46,420
What's wrong with the way I talk?

1955
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,990
You're not soft.

1956
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:51,490
I'll talk softly.

1957
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:56,830
It wasn't...

1958
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,630
exactly what I expected.

1959
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:02,240
I can tell that you thought about it a lot.

1960
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:03,300
Okay.

1961
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:07,170
But I'm not sure if you'd change.

1962
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:15,180
I'm different from who I used to be.

1963
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:18,079
I wonder if that's possible...

1964
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,590
I think it is.

1965
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,450
How long is that going to last?

1966
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:25,590
If I give you a hard time, you might change again.

1967
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:27,430
This is what I think.

1968
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:29,629
You admit...

1969
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:32,130
that I'm an endeavoring romanticist.

1970
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,429
But can you do that?

1971
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,170
Why not? It's simple.

1972
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:38,700
I couldn't do it. But if you think about it,

1973
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:41,539
it can be resolved.

1974
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:42,740
Will you look me in the eyes?

1975
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:47,780
It's true that I didn't express myself enough.

1976
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,550
If I expressed myself...

1977
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,889
and embraced you,

1978
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:54,590
this wouldn't have happened.

1979
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,059
That's what I said.

1980
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,590
Why didn't you express it when it didn't cost money or time?

1981
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:02,329
At the time, I wasn't aware...

1982
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:05,230
of the essence of the issue.

1983
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,830
From your perspective,

1984
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,200
I might be late.

1985
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,710
But you're capable of endeavoring?

1986
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,070
I told you.

1987
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,240
One can change.

1988
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:21,550
I can still afford to make an effort.

1989
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:26,219
I'm sorry, but let me use the restroom.

1990
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:28,050
- Of course.
- Go ahead.

1991
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:29,760
Let's talk outside.

1992
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:32,829
- No, I'm going out. One second.
- Okay.

1993
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:34,060
You can stay.

1994
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:39,299
(Hyeon Ji and Seung Yong move to the 1st floor.)

1995
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,230
- Do you want to talk here?
- Let's talk here.

1996
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:49,040
This roll cake is really good.

1997
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,439
There's one more. Do you want more?

1998
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,510
There's one more?

1999
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:56,580
(The endeavoring romanticist gets up immediately.)

2000
01:39:57,850 --> 01:40:00,190
(Ji Yeon and Woo Jin are still in the lounge.)

2001
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,660
(He quickly covers his tears when he hears someone walking.)

2002
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:17,240
(Rushing himself as it seems serious)

2003
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:32,050
(Escaping quickly)

2004
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:42,860
What's the blanket for? Are you cold?

2005
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,329
No, I grabbed it from the room.

2006
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:46,830
In case you were cold.

2007
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:48,329
- Okay.
- I'm not cold.

2008
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:49,369
(Showing her what he learned)

2009
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,470
Is that the one?

2010
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,510
- Look.
- You were this witty?

2011
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,670
What?

2012
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,580
This is unbelievable.

2013
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:00,680
I thought about what I could do for you.

2014
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,480
Then I came up with this.

2015
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,720
(The born romanticist appears.)

2016
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:21,030
Are you going to tell Yoo Sik again?

2017
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:28,240
Why are you down all of a sudden?

2018
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,240
What?

2019
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:33,650
Is Yoo Sik bothering you? Do you want to go up?

2020
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:35,580
Why go up?

2021
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:37,620
- To the room.
- Why?

2022
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,560
Why would I go up when he's bothering me?

2023
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:43,960
To show him that you stopped talking to me.

2024
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,629
I'm going to talk to him.

2025
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:47,730
To Yoo Sik?

2026
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:51,460
When he sees this, he'll be bothered.

2027
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,400
I wouldn't be bothered.

2028
01:41:55,670 --> 01:41:57,670
He looked bothered.

2029
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,170
So...

2030
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:13,350
Let's go. Let's see what time we have to leave tomorrow.

2031
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,790
Is Jae Hyeong sleeping?

2032
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,000
- It's hot.
- Gosh, that's too much.

2033
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,939
Seung Yong is doing his best.

2034
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,679
- He's trying everything he can.
- Yes.

2035
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,079
He admits what he lacks.

2036
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,679
- That's a new type.
- I know. That's new.

2037
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,149
- On EXchange.
- He sticks to his plan.

2038
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:46,019
But is Hyeon Ji swayed?

2039
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,819
If there is more time and composure,

2040
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:51,089
I'd say she'll definitely be swayed.

2041
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:52,789
I think it's the perfect timing.

2042
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:55,059
- I know.
- She saw Yoo Sik...

2043
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,299
- feeding Min Kyung meat.
- Right.

2044
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,229
- Yes.
- She saw it.

2045
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:01,029
The wit and kind act...

2046
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:02,369
- Is her standard too low?
- Hyeon Ji mentioned...

2047
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:05,139
He can overcome that hurdle with effort easily.

2048
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:07,039
But it's hard to stick to the basics.

2049
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,409
Unless you're aware of it,

2050
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:09,639
you don't know you have to do that.

2051
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,880
- Right. Because you don't know.
- That's why it's hard.

2052
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:17,749
- Hyeon Ji, is that you?
- Yes, but I'm leaving again soon.

2053
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:19,120
To do what?

2054
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,719
What?

2055
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,720
You don't need to leave.

2056
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,559
- What are you going to do?
- I want to go out.

2057
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,859
- If you're wandering around...
- I want to talk to Yoo Sik.

2058
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:29,130
Sure. Then I'll let you leave.

2059
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,499
- What are you doing here anyway?
- What?

2060
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:32,800
Are you still talking?

2061
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:36,500
He's feeble-minded right now.

2062
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,640
I think I'm drunk.

2063
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:42,170
I think Seung Yong saw you.

2064
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:43,939
- He didn't.
- He did.

2065
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,139
What could he see when I didn't do anything?

2066
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:46,609
You were covering your face with a pillow.

2067
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:48,109
- Me?
- You...

2068
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:49,519
Anyway, what did he see?

2069
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,920
- What?
- I'm drunk.

2070
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,520
- Did you kiss?
- Are you crazy?

2071
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,290
- What?
- That's crazy.

2072
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,989
I'm suddenly getting a runny nose.

2073
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:01,460
- What have you done?
- Hey.

2074
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,829
I suddenly had a runny nose.

2075
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:06,329
- What...
- That's ridiculous.

2076
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,070
- What were you doing?
- Hyeon Ji.

2077
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:10,069
You're pretty funny.

2078
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:11,316
- I had no idea.
- Is it that funny?

2079
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:13,270
What are you saying?

2080
01:44:13,570 --> 01:44:14,940
Gosh, you're funny.

2081
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:17,480
That's hilarious.

2082
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,180
I'll let you talk.

2083
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:23,220
"Kissed?"

2084
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:26,020
I didn't see that coming.

2085
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,589
You said you made a mistake.

2086
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:31,560
It wasn't a mistake.

2087
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,300
I'll let you talk. I might...

2088
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:40,030
- come back soon.
- Okay.

2089
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,599
Or late.

2090
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,140
It's okay to be back soon.

2091
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:55,880
(Hyeon Ji visits Yoo Sik's room.)

2092
01:44:59,790 --> 01:45:02,590
(The room is quiet.)

2093
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:06,390
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik are already sleeping.)

2094
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,830
Please.

2095
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:13,930
Seriously?

2096
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,649
- Seung Yong. What?
- What?

2097
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:34,850
Where's Jae Hyeong?

2098
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,559
I don't know. Isn't he in the other room?

2099
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,560
I think it's empty.

2100
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:40,660
Really? I'm not sure.

2101
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,230
(Yoo Sik got changed.)

2102
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:58,840
Why didn't you come out when you were in the room?

2103
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,580
Why didn't you come out?

2104
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:08,149
- Were you sleeping?
- No, I was just lying down.

2105
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:09,219
- You were lying down?
- Didn't you ring the bell...

2106
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:10,220
only once?

2107
01:46:10,221 --> 01:46:12,660
- Yes.
- I came out right away.

2108
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:15,090
- What?
- I came out after getting changed.

2109
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:17,159
- Did you?
- Yes.

2110
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,099
I went to ask where you were.

2111
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,870
We were just lying down.

2112
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:24,969
- What? This?
- Yes.

2113
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:26,940
- For you.
- You don't need it tomorrow?

2114
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,609
Tomorrow? I'm not sure. Keep it for now.

2115
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:31,139
You can keep it. I don't need it.

2116
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:33,480
- No?
- Tomorrow morning...

2117
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,150
- Did you cry?
- I didn't.

2118
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,220
- What?
- I didn't cry.

2119
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:42,020
(What did you do?)

2120
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:43,320
What?

2121
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:44,960
Why are you still up?

2122
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:47,230
I'll go to bed soon.

2123
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,899
I saw you walking back and forth a lot.

2124
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:53,299
- Me?
- Yes.

2125
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:55,369
Back and forth? On the first floor?

2126
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:58,170
Yes, and you were talking a lot.

2127
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:05,310
Didn't you...

2128
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:07,580
talk more?

2129
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:09,680
What are you saying?

2130
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:13,219
Woo Jin and Ji Yeon are talking in my room.

2131
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,250
Now?

2132
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:16,490
Really?

2133
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,230
What are you going to do?

2134
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:34,870
(Clacking)

2135
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:45,679
- Are you drinking?
- We're sleeping.

2136
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,189
Won Kyu is sleeping.

2137
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:49,219
Really? Goodnight.

2138
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,489
Where did Jae Hyeong go?

2139
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:52,319
Jae Hyeong is with Baek Hyun.

2140
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,960
- Okay.
- All right.

2141
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:05,540
Why?

2142
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:09,740
Come here.

2143
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:20,120
See you tomorrow.

2144
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,440
What time are you going to be up?

2145
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:25,390
Seven?

2146
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:28,730
Seven.

2147
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:36,000
(Hyeon Ji shows the ring on her finger.)

2148
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:39,610
I wondered what it was.

2149
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,010
Because I couldn't see.

2150
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,440
Behind you...

2151
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:49,380
Never mind. It's hair.

2152
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:54,090
What?

2153
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,220
I can't see. Don't look at me.

2154
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,060
- Were you in your pajamas?
- Me?

2155
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,030
You should get some sleep.

2156
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,570
Later...

2157
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:13,610
Sorry.

2158
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:25,580
(EXchange 4)

2159
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,819
- Min Kyung.
- Yes?

2160
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:29,189
- I have a question.
- Okay.

2161
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:33,890
Seung Yong wants to get back with me.

2162
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:36,659
He was talking about getting married to change my mind.

2163
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,129
And...

2164
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:40,829
you said you broke up for practical reasons.

2165
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:43,470
What are they exactly?

2166
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,670
(Staying single.)

2167
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,840
(Staying single?)

2168
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:52,009
(And)

2169
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:53,910
(The night of the truth begins.)

2170
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:55,880
What if...

2171
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,189
(If your ex tried to sway you with her sincerity, )

2172
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:02,620
(would you have been swayed?)

2173
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:04,790
He didn't seem certain.

2174
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,530
It can be changed.

2175
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:09,530
Let me ask Yoo Sik.

2176
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:14,100
If I'm pouring my heart out to Hyeon Ji,

2177
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,370
are you still going to keep going?

2178
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:19,370
Baek Hyun's bothered a lot.

2179
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,510
The answer didn't choose either one.

2180
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,850
(The situation might change.)
