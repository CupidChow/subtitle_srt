1
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,880
Joining us again this week is DAWN.

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Yong Jin)

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,580
(Kim Ye Won)

4
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,349
- How is it?
- It was so fun.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,819
- I couldn't sleep.
- It's like your energy was drained.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,959
(Yura)

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,960
I want DAWN's romantic cells comes back to life.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,189
What kind of relationship do you want?

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,129
I want to work more now.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,459
- Now.
- You don't want romance.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,699
I'm in a stage in which I want to focus on myself,

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,039
so if I were to meet someone,

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,439
I'd like the person to understand that bit,

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,269
and I want that person...

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,139
to also be someone who focuses a lot on herself.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,809
It would be really nice if we have a good synergy together.

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,979
It would be nice...

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,279
- if both of you are busy.
- Right.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,379
That's the best.

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,679
It's the best when both are busy and free at the same time.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,419
- That's right.
- That's the best.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,019
I believe your romantic cells will revive on this episode.

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,989
- I hope it does.
- Okay.

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,190
Let's go to revive DAWN's romantic cells.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,340
(Morning came after an unusually long night.)

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,440
(7:40am, Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon are awake.)

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,780
(9:20am, Min Kyung, Ji Hyeon, and Hyeon Ji are awake.)

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,910
Can I sleep a bit more?

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,180
Yes.

30
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,750
It's noon now.

31
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,079
It's 9am.

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,750
What?

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm just joking.

34
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,290
(Ji Yeon is ready.)

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,930
What are you doing?

36
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,599
I'm just here.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,100
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,970
They'd have slept late.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,370
Right.

40
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,510
- Yesterday.
- We had so much fun yesterday.

41
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,639
- What?
- It was very...

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,809
You drank quite a bit yesterday.

43
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,850
- I drank a lot.
- Right.

44
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,550
Wasn't it tough on you?

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,019
Drinking is always hard.

46
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,049
Right.

47
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,189
Are there herbal medicines good for hangovers?

48
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,759
There is something like that.

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,490
I should have brought it.

50
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,490
I didn't bring it.

51
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,260
Today's weather is really good.

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,100
The weather was good again.

53
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,569
Let's go hang out later...

54
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,040
when everyone is gone.

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,470
(Nodding)

56
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,780
(They have another secret plan.)

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,849
(10:40am, Baek Hyun and Woo Jin are awake.)

58
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,010
Let's eat. Aren't you hungry?

59
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,980
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

60
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:32,592
- It worked.
- Did it?

61
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,950
- Look.
- It's a bit...

62
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,359
- Should I do it again?
- Yes.

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Okay.

64
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,629
- Hello.
- Did you sleep well?

65
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,630
Yes.

66
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,200
You said you were leaving at 10:30am.

67
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,060
It was pushed a little.

68
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,800
I think it's that one.

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,470
That one?

70
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,670
The one Kyu brought.

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,939
Herbal medicine?

72
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,580
The white sticks.

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,479
I want to take that.

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,049
- Kyu...
- I really need it. I'll take it.

75
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,050
Kyu... Me too.

76
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,080
The one Kyu brought.

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,750
- Kyu?
- Kyu said we should take that.

78
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,589
(Someone has sent you a chat request.)

79
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,260
(Please enter the Chatting Room.)

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,530
(Ji Yeon quickly gets up after receiving the text.)

81
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,700
(A single message shakes up a peaceful morning.)

82
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,870
(An unknown force pulls them somewhere.)

83
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,310
(The Chatting Room is open again.)

84
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,639
(How are things here? Is it okay?)

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,810
(You can find out about the other person through chat...)

86
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,620
(in the secret space where tension seeps in.)

87
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,160
(The chat room is open.)

88
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,029
- Is it Ji Yeon only?
- Right.

89
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,059
I guess it's her ex.

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,429
Or did Won Kyu's ex make the request?

91
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,429
It was opened by someone's request.

92
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,299
It looks like a private chat.

93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,569
There's nothing added to the Chatting Room.

94
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,069
- It's just "Chatting Room." - Right.

95
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,370
I can't guess anything.

96
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,380
(Ji Yeon entered as the responder.)

97
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,550
I was very curious who it was.

98
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,419
I hadn't talked...

99
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,560
to anyone much except Won Kyu.

100
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,020
"Who is it?"

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,560
"Who is curious about me?"

102
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,730
(Who requested a chat with Ji Yeon?)

103
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,499
(The person who is curious...)

104
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,640
(about Ji Yeon entered.)

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,900
(Hi.)

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,010
(Hi.)

107
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,979
(How are you feeling today?)

108
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,650
(I'm feeling good today.)

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,150
(Was it a bit tough until today?)

110
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,730
(Yes. I was a bit tired because I couldn't sleep well.)

111
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,189
(I have some questions. Can I ask?)

112
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,200
(Go ahead.)

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,700
My only guesses...

114
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,800
were my ex and Won Kyu.

115
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,740
That's just my hunch.

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,269
It's not exactly based on evidence.

117
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,340
It's just my hunch.

118
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,310
(Is it her ex or Won Kyu as she guessed?)

119
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,979
If it were Won Kyu, he'd have asked her in person.

120
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,449
- Right.
- He wouldn't need to use that.

121
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,649
They wouldn't do that.

122
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,090
- Her ex?
- Ex.

123
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,020
(Do you still have lingering feelings for your ex?)

124
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,860
When I read that sentence,

125
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,530
I became certain.

126
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,870
(No, I don't think so.)

127
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,170
(Is there anyone you like?)

128
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,039
(Yes.)

129
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,110
"You don't need to worry about me. I have no lingering feelings."

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,980
I tried to express that.

131
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,550
(If the person is your ex, wouldn't he get hurt?)

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,220
I have no intention of getting back together with my ex.

133
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,760
I have no intention of getting back together,

134
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,660
but if my ex has,

135
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,830
I should tell him what I think.

136
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,870
(Is the person chatting Ji Yeon's ex as she guessed?)

137
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,040
(What kind of dates do you like?)

138
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,070
What is this?

139
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,210
I was a bit flustered.

140
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,309
(I like simple dates like having good food or talking at cafes.)

141
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,509
(I also like going to craft studios...)

142
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,910
(and making memories.)

143
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,080
(Where do you hang out with your friends?)

144
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,420
(I like going to Hannam-dong.)

145
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,690
I couldn't tell.

146
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
"Who is it?"

147
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,490
(Do you live near that area?)

148
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,560
The person asked, "Where do you live?"

149
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,800
This must be a new person.

150
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,600
The former residents...

151
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,870
all knew that I lived in Songpa-gu.

152
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,680
This is someone I've never met.

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,450
Or the person wasn't interested in me at all.

154
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,320
But why did the person request a chat?

155
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,550
I was sure it was a new person.

156
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,670
(Do we have a new resident?)

157
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,440
(1 hour ago)

158
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,080
(One man enters the Chatting Room.)

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,720
(New resident, Lee Jae Hyeong)

160
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,119
- What?
- What?

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,820
What?

162
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,590
A new person came so suddenly.

163
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,329
This happens out of the blue?

164
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,629
I can't think straight...

165
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,129
because he came so suddenly.

166
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,359
Doesn't he look like Jung Hae In?

167
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,969
- He does look similar.
- Right.

168
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,340
- He resembles Lee Jong Suk a bit.
- A bit.

169
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,569
He's that type. The pretty-looking type.

170
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,640
Ji Hyeon!

171
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,309
It's her ex who hung out a lot with women.

172
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,709
- What?
- The ex with many female friends.

173
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,250
Your eyes are almost flipping.

174
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,010
Did I do wrong here?

175
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,819
It is Ji Hyeon's ex.

176
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,689
He looks really good with Ji Hyeon.

177
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,619
- So good.
- It fits what Ji Hyeon said.

178
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
That's right.

179
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,259
He talks very smoothly too.

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,989
- He had to be popular.
- Right.

181
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,029
He looks like he'd be popular.

182
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,330
This may turn the tables.

183
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,760
(The new resident Jae Hyeong sat in the questioner's seat.)

184
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,440
I was curious to know the people in there.

185
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,869
(The female residents enter the Chatting Room...)

186
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,840
(in the order they woke up.)

187
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,239
(They chat with the new male resident for 10 minutes.)

188
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,850
(That's nice! What do you like doing on dates?)

189
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,950
(If he chooses someone after the chat,)

190
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,949
(the Chatting Room ends,)

191
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,720
(and he won't be able to chat with the next person.)

192
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,590
(Who will Jae Hyeong choose as his date?)

193
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,760
(The first person he chats with is Ji Yeon.)

194
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,200
(I have another question.)

195
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,430
(What should I do to get close to you?)

196
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,140
(You need to have a 1-on-1 conversation with me to get closer.)

197
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,180
(I guess you're a bit shy around strangers!)

198
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,420
(I am a bit.)

199
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,190
I didn't feel like the conversation was flowing.

200
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,890
She wasn't in the position to ask questions,

201
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,990
but when I asked questions, the responses were stiff.

202
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,930
It felt like the conversation wasn't flowing.

203
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,400
(All right. I had fun talking to you.)

204
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,070
That's why I ended the chat.

205
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,670
(The chat ends.)

206
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,009
They're just chatting without seeing each other, right?

207
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,039
- Yes.
- That's right.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,979
I think this is better.

209
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,279
He can choose someone just with the feeling he gets.

210
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,449
Right. Based on personality.

211
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,479
Right.

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,049
There are people you connect with...

213
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,189
- even through chats.
- That's right.

214
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,389
There are people whose conversation flows really well.

215
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,490
- That's right.
- That's right.

216
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,470
(Yun Nyeong entered as the second responder.)

217
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,209
"Who is it?"

218
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,310
"Who is curious about me?"

219
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,210
I don't think there would be many people...

220
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,410
who would be curious about me.

221
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,050
(The person she'll chat with is the new resident, Jae Hyeong.)

222
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,590
(The second chat starts.)

223
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,130
(Hi.)

224
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,900
(Hi!)

225
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,669
"Who would it be?"

226
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,340
I was a bit nervous too.

227
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,550
I think it was a mix of excitement and nervousness.

228
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,190
(I'm talking casually because I wanted to talk comfortably here!)

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,690
(Okay! I'll talk casually too!)

230
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,299
I mainly tried to ask...

231
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,600
about the atmosphere in the house.

232
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,240
(It's been several days. How are things here? Are thing okay?)

233
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,509
(Yes! Everyone is so nice.)

234
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,480
(They take care of me well.)

235
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,910
(It's really nice!)

236
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,580
(Was your ex your ideal type?)

237
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,060
(He was my ideal type.)

238
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,770
(Do you have lingering feelings for him?)

239
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,140
I hoped she wouldn't have so much feelings left for her ex.

240
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,510
I thought that was important to get closer to her.

241
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,780
That was something I thought was important.

242
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,750
(You don't need to reply if it's hard.)

243
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,429
(Actually, I've been doing great so far,)

244
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,300
(but now, I can't say I have no feelings left for him.)

245
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,600
(Is there anyone you're fond of now?)

246
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,510
(I think I have someone I like.)

247
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,950
(Can I ask you why you were curious about me?)

248
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
(It's a secret! I'm the only one who can ask questions now.)

249
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,170
(Geez.)

250
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,410
(I had fun talking to you.)

251
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,040
(How was the second person you chatted with?)

252
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,710
She seemed very cheerful.

253
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,279
She responded very well.

254
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,080
It would have been fun to hang out with her.

255
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,420
(Why didn't you choose her?)

256
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,390
to me,

257
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,590
it felt like my ex.

258
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,860
Actually,

259
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,230
I said hi casually at first,

260
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,530
and she responded politely.

261
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,430
That's when I thought she was my ex.

262
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,870
There was a time we briefly broke up,

263
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,340
and I reached out to her first.

264
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,679
She said hello politely...

265
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,210
even then.

266
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,510
I could feel that bit.

267
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,220
It's hard to explain in words, but I felt that.

268
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,720
(Is Jae Hyeong's ex Yun Nyeong?)

269
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,360
(The second chat ends.)

270
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,459
He noticed that she's her ex...

271
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,429
just by the "hello."

272
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,830
- He had that experience.
- Yes.

273
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,569
I think he was focused on that.

274
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,469
I think that "hello" is different...

275
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,869
from that "hello."

276
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,640
- Yun Nyeong said, "Hello!" - Yes.

277
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,439
Someone who'd say "hello..."

278
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,879
even when she knows it's him...

279
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,479
would be Ji Hyeon.

280
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,049
It would have been a "hello" that draws a line.

281
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,290
- Right.
- A bit.

282
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,360
(The third responder Min Kyung)

283
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,369
Even at the last chat,

284
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,539
my ex's date...

285
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,610
asked me questions.

286
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,279
I thought someone wanted...

287
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
to go on a date with my ex again.

288
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,620
My ex is popular.

289
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,849
So it didn't feel that great.

290
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,990
(Min Kyung isn't feeling so good.)

291
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,290
(The third chat)

292
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,630
(Hi.)

293
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,300
(Hello.)

294
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,840
(He's flustered by another hello.)

295
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,170
She wrote "hello" as well.

296
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,480
- How would he know by that?
- Most would say that.

297
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,840
He was focused on that.

298
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,750
(He's flustered by another hello.)

299
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,980
(I want to talk comfortably here. Is that okay?)

300
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,760
(That would be great!)

301
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,860
(How is it living here? Are things okay?)

302
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,510
I was surprised from the start.

303
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,980
The person didn't seem like a woman.

304
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,010
I thought, "This is a man!"

305
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,619
"Is there someone interested in me?"

306
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,379
That's what I thought,

307
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,790
and I felt good and at ease.

308
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,529
(It's fun,)

309
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,060
(and it's a bit hard to face new situations.)

310
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,600
(What's your ideal type?)

311
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,870
(I want to know in detail.)

312
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,810
(The person Jae Hyeong wants to know a bit more about)

313
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,049
(I think I like people with a pretty smile.)

314
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,890
(I like people with dimples too.)

315
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,930
(Why are you raising a finger at me?)

316
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,730
(It was...)

317
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,069
(She almost did it again.)

318
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,900
(It was a typo.)

319
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,680
(What about internally?)

320
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,410
(I like someone who takes good care of themselves.)

321
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,580
(I hope there's something I can learn from the person.)

322
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,260
(I think I enjoy growing together.)

323
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,960
When she talked about her ideal type,

324
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,900
she mentioned someone she could learn from.

325
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
I thought that response was very charming.

326
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,840
When people talk about internal aspects,

327
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,169
they usually mention someone who is gentle or has leadership.

328
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,009
Someone whom she could learn from.

329
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,450
That felt new.

330
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,080
(What do you like doing on dates?)

331
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,159
(I want to walk around places like Bukchon or Seochon...)

332
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
(and have a calm date.)

333
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:42,330
She said she likes taking walks.

334
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,660
I thought that part was very similar to me.

335
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,429
(When you're on a date, do you usually do most of the talking?)

336
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,130
(Or do you listen?)

337
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,739
(If the person finds it hard to talk, I tend to talk first!)

338
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,709
I thought it would be comfortable to be with her.

339
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,410
I thought there would be a comfortable excitement.

340
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,810
(That's nice!)

341
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,820
(Someone who would be comfortable to be with)

342
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,610
(Do you want to go on a date with me today?)

343
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,700
(The Chatting Room is open.)

344
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,799
This is crazy!

345
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,069
- This is crazy.
- What is this? I'm shocked.

346
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,199
- My goodness.
- It opened.

347
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,210
This...

348
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,869
- What is this?
- That...

349
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,839
- But...
- This...

350
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,410
That would be...

351
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,509
really exciting.

352
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,479
- That expression was excitement.
- That's really...

353
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
What is this?

354
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:15,649
That's the best appearance ever.

355
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,419
- It would be very impactful.
- It was like a drama.

356
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,219
Things would change a lot for Min Kyung now.

357
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,659
- This is nice.
- Yes.

358
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,959
Min Kyung will even date a catfish?

359
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,730
- She's dating everyone.
- She really dated everyone.

360
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,799
Jae Hyeong isn't someone...

361
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,529
- who tests the waters first.
- He's not.

362
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,069
- He goes with his feeling.
- He's straightforward.

363
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,169
- Right.
- He's straightforward.

364
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,369
It feels new to see Min Kyung smile in the Chatting Room.

365
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,409
- Right.
- Yes.

366
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,480
It's nice.

367
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,120
(The Chatting Room is open.)

368
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,960
You can remove them.

369
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,300
You must be shocked.

370
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

371
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,399
I got here now.

372
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,510
Yes.

373
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,269
You didn't know someone new was coming, right?

374
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,540
I didn't know.

375
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,939
I tried not to seem new. It's nice to meet you.

376
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,050
Hello.

377
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,779
Let's go on a date today.

378
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,019
Okay.

379
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,789
(Let's go on a date today.)

380
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,090
Okay.

381
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,530
- Shall we go out?
- Yes.

382
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,570
I didn't know the door would open. It opened,

383
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,440
and I thought the walls were falling.

384
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,070
She was more surprised than I was.

385
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,510
I could see her face turn red.

386
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,280
I thought...

387
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,450
that was cute. Her vibe...

388
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,920
I thought it would be someone among the residents.

389
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,219
Someone new and pale...

390
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,321
came.

391
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,860
I was surprised.

392
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,199
(How did you feel when he asked you on a date?)

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,329
I thought, "I've never met..."

394
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,930
"anyone this bold."

395
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,200
It had been a while I heard that from someone,

396
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,470
so my heart fluttered so much.

397
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,309
(Why did you stop after the third chat?)

398
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,639
I don't have a solid reason.

399
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,580
I stopped because I liked the overall feeling.

400
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,080
That's what I felt. I thought it'd be fun when we got closer.

401
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,590
I thought we'd have fun teasing each other.

402
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,259
(Weren't you a bit disappointed that you missed the two chats?)

403
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,660
I think you have to make a decision when you feel it's right.

404
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,990
I have no regrets.

405
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,260
I'm satisfied. I want to quickly go on the date.

406
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,230
(The Chatting Room ends.)

407
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,040
- This is so nice.
- He's very straightforward.

408
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,509
- Very straightforward.
- Yes.

409
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,869
- I feel excited.
- Min Kyung looks...

410
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,440
- the brightest so far.
- She looked the happiest.

411
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,079
She looked the brightest.

412
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,609
The expression was really different.

413
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,150
It became alive.

414
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,249
She was about to open the door,

415
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,120
and a very handsome catfish was in front of her.

416
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,789
It was the most troubling time for her.

417
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,119
- Right.
- She was in a bad mood.

418
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,159
She didn't know what to do.

419
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,489
The last Chatting Room experience wouldn't have been good for her.

420
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,029
- Right.
- For Min Kyung.

421
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,799
This moment really changed that.

422
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,900
This is really a dopamine rush.

423
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,880
(Kwak Min Kyung and Cho Yoo Sik)

424
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,479
(Park Hyeon Ji and Sung Baek Hyun)

425
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,479
(Lee Jae Hyeong)

426
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,389
(Park Ji Hyeon)

427
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,319
(Kim Woo Jin)

428
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,219
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

429
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,019
(Jung Won Kyu)

430
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,830
(Hong Ji Yeon)

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,070
(EXchange 4)

432
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,940
(Episode 7: The Door Opens)

433
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,180
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

434
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,920
(Ji Hyeon enters the 4th floor terrace by herself.)

435
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,690
(She looks around to see if anyone is coming.)

436
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,270
(What did you write so secretively?)

437
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,570
When I had a chat with Yoo Sik's ex,

438
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,310
she said that he doesn't like mixed signals.

439
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,840
So that he wouldn't be confused,

440
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,450
I wrote, "Let's go on a date on Friday."

441
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,220
"I'm writing you a note since there are too many people."

442
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,989
I expressed how I felt.

443
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,720
If he rejects me, it can't be helped.

444
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,959
But it's much better to regret what I've done...

445
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,760
than to regret what I haven't done.

446
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Baek Hyun.

447
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,470
You woke up late.

448
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,370
What... What is it?

449
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,769
- What?
- I woke up earlier.

450
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,980
- Really?
- Yes.

451
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,779
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

452
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,880
- Your eyes didn't get puffy.
- They did get puffy.

453
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,620
At what time did you wake up?

454
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,190
Around 10:30am.

455
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,120
Did you sleep well?

456
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,090
What? Yes. Pretty much.

457
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,760
Who cleaned up downstairs?

458
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,189
- Women did.
- Really?

459
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,560
Women downstairs.

460
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,769
- Really?
- When I woke up, I was like...

461
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,069
(She can't help but be wary of her ex's conversation.)

462
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,240
- "Why do we need to do this?" - What?

463
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,799
- What?
- What is it?

464
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,899
May we go in?

465
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,069
- Now?
- Come on in.

466
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,610
- Is it a bad time?
- No. Come on in.

467
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,310
(Knocking for manners)

468
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:39,444
I'll enter carefully.

469
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,009
Did you have breakfast?

470
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,680
- Where are you going?
- To get a vacuum cleaner.

471
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,620
So that was your business.

472
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,789
What are people doing downstairs?

473
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,819
They're making breakfast.

474
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,289
- Really? What are they making?
- Really?

475
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,759
They're making spam rice.

476
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,159
- Spam rice?
- That sounds delicious.

477
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,700
You should hurry up and ask them to make some more.

478
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,270
Really? Would it be okay to go and eat?

479
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,200
Would you ask them to make some for me as well?

480
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,870
- What?
- It's nothing.

481
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,240
For whom?

482
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,210
- Ji Hyeon.
- Yes. For me.

483
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,940
- For us?
- Yes.

484
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,579
- Didn't you have breakfast?
- No, I didn't.

485
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
At what time did you wake up?

486
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,819
I woke up at 9am.

487
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,020
- At 9am?
- Yes.

488
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,060
Can't you sleep?

489
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,520
- I mean...
- No?

490
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,459
Two more people want to eat. Is there enough food?

491
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,400
Would it be okay if Ji Hyeon and I eat as well?

492
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,829
Sure. I'll make some more.

493
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,870
Okay.

494
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,670
Thank you.

495
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,970
Thank you.

496
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,280
- It looks delicious.
- Do you need help with anything?

497
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,380
- No, I'm nearly done.
- Woo Jin.

498
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,749
- Are you nearly done?
- Seriously.

499
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,780
I'm nearly done.

500
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,480
I'm hungry.

501
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,879
- Is the rice done?
- Not yet.

502
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,890
I see.

503
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,990
- Shall we bring the chopsticks?
- Okay.

504
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,159
- Four people, right?
- Yes, four people.

505
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,290
Will only four people eat?

506
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,629
- Other people don't want to eat.
- Really?

507
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,659
Did everyone eat?

508
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,300
- Doesn't Baek Hyun want to eat?
- No.

509
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,200
He has something to do.

510
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,240
Why don't I make you guys pasta in the evening?

511
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,109
- Pasta?
- Oil pasta.

512
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,139
That sounds lovely.

513
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,710
- Pasta.
- Hold on. Let me use the restroom.

514
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,250
(She runs into Min Kyung who is ready to go on a date.)

515
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:32,319
- Are people eating downstairs?
- What?

516
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,519
Did people make something downstairs?

517
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,930
Yes, they did.

518
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,859
Spam rice.

519
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,160
That sounds delicious. Who made it?

520
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,430
Woo Jin did.

521
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,540
(Exclaiming)

522
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,170
- Where are you going, princess?
- To work.

523
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,540
(I see.)

524
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,309
What was that?

525
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,610
Why do you keep going to places?

526
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
I'm busy at work.

527
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,450
Are you going on a lot of dates?

528
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,550
No, I haven't been on a single date.

529
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,290
You're lying. Is that what we're supposed to say?

530
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,830
What? What is it?

531
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,059
Min Kyung is a fox.

532
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,160
Me?

533
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,400
- I haven't done anything.
- What is it?

534
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,069
- What is it?
- She keeps going to places...

535
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,339
looking all pretty.

536
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,969
- That isn't true.
- You're going on a date.

537
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,069
- That isn't true.
- That's an outfit for a date.

538
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,170
I'm so hungry.

539
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,510
I'm so hungry.

540
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,339
- The 2 of them...
- The 2 of them are so funny.

541
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,810
That obviously isn't an outfit for work.

542
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,819
I don't have time to work.

543
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,019
Instead of working...

544
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,850
- I'm going to work.
- Min Kyung and my ex...

545
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,190
were dressed in similar colors.

546
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,690
Anyone could tell that it was a lovely outfit for a date.

547
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,599
(She thinks Min Kyung and Baek Hyun are going on a date.)

548
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,900
- See you later.
- Bye.

549
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,630
- Shoes.
- I need to use the restroom.

550
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,069
My ex and my favorite roommate...

551
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,440
must be going on a date.

552
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,350
To be honest, it put me in a bad mood.

553
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,449
You get energy from rice.

554
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,580
(Woo Jin's spam rice is complete.)

555
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,090
I'm hungry.

556
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,589
Woo Jin, thank you so much.

557
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,590
- It's nothing.
- Thank you.

558
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,159
If it needs more seasoning, you can add this.

559
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,190
Okay.

560
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,159
It's so tasty.

561
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,530
- Is it tasty? Thank goodness.
- Yes.

562
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,829
I think it's the tastiest.

563
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,200
Do you think it's the tastiest?

564
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,140
The taste is strong, but it's suitable for a meal.

565
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,710
I love that Ji Yeon eats well.

566
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,840
I know.

567
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,080
Is it tasty?

568
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,210
I'm glad.

569
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,550
(Baek Hyun comes to the peaceful table.)

570
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,050
How much buldak sauce did you add?

571
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,390
You like spicy food, right?

572
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,690
- Yes.
- Let me add some more.

573
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,419
- Baek Hyun.
- Yes?

574
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,719
Aren't you going to eat?

575
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,930
I'm okay.

576
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,460
It must be tasty. It smells tasty.

577
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,969
Do you want some?

578
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,200
No, I'm okay.

579
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,540
- Can I eat it with my fork?
- Yes.

580
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,810
(At that moment, Min Kyung leaves the house.)

581
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,910
Woo Jin, do you get jealous?

582
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,620
- I do get jealous.
- Really?

583
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,279
I bet you get attached a lot.

584
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,790
- Attached? I get attached a lot.
- Yes.

585
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,690
I get attached to people.

586
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,229
I bet you don't get mad about delayed replies.

587
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,260
(By chance, Baek Hyun moves as soon as Min Kyung leaves.)

588
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,199
Letting your lover know what you're doing is...

589
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,400
common courtesy.

590
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,670
Do you get jealous?

591
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,000
- What?
- Do you get jealous?

592
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,440
A little bit.

593
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,270
I get so jealous.

594
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,340
I'm so bad at it.

595
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,050
Really? You don't seem like the jealous type.

596
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,610
Why not?

597
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm a jealous lover.

598
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,090
Seeing Baek Hyun leave the house right after Min Kyung...

599
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,520
put me in a really bad mood.

600
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,829
Her eyes moved so quickly.

601
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,029
I see why she misunderstood.

602
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,799
Seriously. Anyone would misunderstand.

603
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,999
- They left at the same time.
- I know.

604
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,869
- She can't focus on her food.
- Seriously.

605
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,940
She's very mindful of her ex.

606
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,370
- Let me use the restroom.
- It was so funny.

607
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,040
You seem a bit cold, so...

608
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,999
I don't know why it's so hard to watch...

609
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,500
something like that.

610
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,869
I never said that I was hung up...

611
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,580
on Baek Hyun for sure.

612
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,480
I didn't enter the show with that intention.

613
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,079
But when I hear Baek Hyun...

614
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,050
talking to other people outside the door...

615
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,119
or see him go on a date,

616
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,630
it gets so hard.

617
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,630
I'm a bit confused about the emotions I'm feeling.

618
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,230
Hyeon Ji shed tears again just like last night.

619
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,859
Maybe Hyeon Ji isn't over him yet.

620
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,700
She entered the house only a few days ago.

621
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,829
It must be hard...

622
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,839
to watch her ex get close to another person.

623
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,739
- I can't imagine that feeling.
- Seriously.

624
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,640
Like I always say...

625
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,109
- Unless you experience it...
- Seriously. Unless you do it...

626
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,139
You can't say anything for sure.

627
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,249
DAWN, do you think you understand that feeling?

628
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,320
- I would, right?
- Is that so? Really?

629
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,820
I think I understand that feeling.

630
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm sorry.

631
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,520
- I was so...
- "I'm sorry."

632
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,230
(Baek Hyun leaves the house before Yun Nyeong.)

633
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,910
(Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun, casual date)

634
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,080
Hi.

635
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,080
- Hello.
- All right.

636
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,220
What's up with the tea?

637
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,920
I didn't have a tumbler.

638
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,059
- Really?
- I thought you might be thirsty.

639
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
No way.

640
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:48,859
It's chamomile tea.

641
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,430
It's a bit small. Just push it inside.

642
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,660
Thank you.

643
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,670
I spilled it everywhere while carrying it...

644
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,540
over here.

645
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,080
It was my first time seeing someone give me tea...

646
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,139
in a mug.

647
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,610
It wasn't a tumbler or a paper cup.

648
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,020
It was unusual, but cute.

649
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,790
It was so funny. I just kept laughing.

650
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,060
It feels so strange to drink out of a mug in the car.

651
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,029
I drink it as soon as I wake up...

652
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,499
because I love chamomile tea.

653
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,470
- You drink chamomile tea.
- Chamomile tea.

654
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,469
If I must choose among tea,

655
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,400
I like either chamomile or rooibos.

656
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,639
I see.

657
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,910
I also like to drink lukewarm tea.

658
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,010
I like it.

659
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,780
I can't drink something that's too hot.

660
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,350
I didn't want you to get burned in the car.

661
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,050
You're very thoughtful.

662
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,380
I don't know. It's my first time receiving something like this.

663
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,290
Men who have many sisters must be different.

664
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,130
- We're nearly there.
- We're nearly there.

665
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,359
I can't wait.

666
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,500
Let's go.

667
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,099
- Hello.
- Hello.

668
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,829
- Please sit here.
- Okay.

669
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,800
- I've never done this before.
- Same here.

670
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,270
- It looks strange.
- Right?

671
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,380
I'll help you.

672
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,080
- Does my head go in here?
- Yes. And your arms.

673
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,190
And pull this.

674
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,590
I see.

675
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,260
- It's nothing.
- All right.

676
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,660
- Shall I tie it?
- Yes, please.

677
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,630
Good.

678
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,930
- Good?
- Yes.

679
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,000
- It'll be fun.
- Seriously.

680
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,910
- All done.
- Thank you.

681
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,480
I want to make something unique.

682
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,786
How can I make it the prettiest?

683
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,290
(Baek Hyun gets started without hesitation.)

684
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,060
This is fun. Drawing is fun.

685
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,470
(He doesn't answer.)

686
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,940
You become very taciturn when you focus on something.

687
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,450
- I can't multi-task.
- Okay.

688
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,950
It's nice. It means you can concentrate.

689
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,649
It was so funny.

690
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,620
He made the cutting board so diligently.

691
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,230
Lasers were coming out of his eyes.

692
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,710
You're hyper-focused.

693
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,419
We were there on a date, right?

694
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,050
It was funny and cute.

695
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,990
(Turning away)

696
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,890
(He even turns his back on her.)

697
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,159
Hey, mister.

698
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,440
Yes.

699
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,439
To be honest, I can't multi-task.

700
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,009
I became focused on making the cutting board.

701
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,719
So Yun Nyeong ended up saying something.

702
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,990
I was in the wrong.

703
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,820
All right.

704
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,620
If I give this to you, will you keep it?

705
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,130
Of course. Do you want this?

706
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,029
- Yes.
- Okay.

707
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,059
(They decide to exchange the cutting boards they made.)

708
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,930
- We'll have each other's. Okay.
- That sounds good.

709
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,470
This one is prettier, right?

710
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,899
Shall I be honest?

711
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,800
- Do you find that one prettier?
- No, the one you made is prettier.

712
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,010
- I'm being honest.
- That's so funny.

713
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,380
I'll use this to cook later.

714
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,210
I'll use this to cook.

715
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,609
Okay.

716
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,849
- I'm so hungry.
- That's so funny.

717
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,320
- Let's go in there.
- Okay.

718
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,890
- This place is so pretty.
- You're right.

719
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,190
(O'cellier)

720
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,400
You wear a bracelet every day.

721
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,699
- I never take it off.
- You never take it off?

722
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,030
I haven't taken off in years.

723
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,339
- Really? Isn't it inconvenient?
- Yes.

724
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,340
It isn't inconvenient.

725
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:31,170
I rarely wear jewelry except for a necklace.

726
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,910
I wear a hat to add something to my outfit.

727
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,380
I rarely wear things like rings.

728
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,010
Do you want to try it on?

729
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,829
- How does it look?
- It looks good on you.

730
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,869
- Does it suit me?
- Yes.

731
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,600
- It suits me.
- Then it'll be mine from now on.

732
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,099
- Keep it on. Is it inconvenient?
- I'm kidding.

733
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,470
No, it's nice.

734
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,770
- It's really pretty.
- It looks pretty.

735
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,540
It's really pretty.

736
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,010
It suits you very well.

737
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,580
How nice.

738
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,979
His ex will recognize it.

739
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,019
- Of course, she will.
- Of course.

740
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,519
She'll go insane once she sees it.

741
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,320
- Oh, no. Hyeon Ji.
- Don't take it off, Yun Nyeong.

742
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,489
Giving your bracelet is a big move.

743
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,689
- It's a big move.
- I know.

744
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,590
- I never do that.
- Seriously.

745
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,759
(They get the food they've ordered.)

746
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,600
Thank you.

747
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, yes.

748
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,900
It smells so delicious.

749
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,070
- Thank you.
- Hurry up and eat.

750
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,540
It looks good.

751
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,750
- Seriously, today, - Yes?

752
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,420
we went to a woodworking studio and ate tasty food.

753
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,850
Are you happy?

754
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,890
I'm happy for real.

755
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,829
Your shirt looks very sexy.

756
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,830
I can't help but keep looking in that direction.

757
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,499
This is insane.

758
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,030
(He changes the subject because he is embarrassed.)

759
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,069
I never get food on my clothes.

760
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,540
I must've been very hungry.

761
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,179
How will we take the cutting boards?

762
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,510
- The cutting boards?
- The cutting boards.

763
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,350
I'll take...

764
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,879
both of them.

765
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,580
What if Yoo Sik goes, "What's that?"

766
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,189
- Well...
- What's that?

767
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,720
(They suddenly begin a skit.)

768
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,990
This? It's my personal belonging.

769
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,760
Would you go over there?

770
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,229
- Will you say that?
- I bet...

771
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,730
Yoo Sik isn't home yet.

772
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,470
I think we'll be the last ones to arrive.

773
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,540
Shall we go back tomorrow?

774
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,640
- What do you think?
- For goodness' sake.

775
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,040
What do you think?

776
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,709
- That solves the problem.
- How are you so funny?

777
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,050
- Do you really find me funny?
- Yes.

778
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,250
What's so funny?

779
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,219
Well, you're just funny.

780
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,620
Everything you do is funny.

781
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,389
I don't know. He's funny even when he's just sitting still.

782
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,960
He's funny even when he's expressionless.

783
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,930
Thinking about him makes me laugh because he's so funny.

784
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,700
I don't know why.

785
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,470
Do I like him?

786
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,880
I think I like Baek Hyun.

787
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,480
It's just that...

788
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,280
Seriously, you're much funnier when you come outside.

789
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,179
You're much more entertaining.

790
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,580
- Really?
- Yes.

791
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,850
You're very charming.

792
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,320
- Are you certain?
- Yes, I'm serious.

793
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,960
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

794
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,629
You must've figured me out.

795
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,560
I'm serious when my eyes are like this.

796
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,800
I'm serious.

797
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,970
I was so thankful.

798
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,800
She kept laughing...

799
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,839
and showing me reactions.

800
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,410
It put me in a good mood.

801
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,580
Do I look better with or without glasses?

802
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,040
Look at me.

803
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,450
Personally speaking?

804
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,550
When you wear glasses, you look...

805
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,649
cuter.

806
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,390
Personally speaking, you look better with glasses.

807
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,220
I'll wear them to bed then.

808
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,200
I'll wear them during a shower.

809
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,529
- For goodness' sake.
- I'll wear them during a shower.

810
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,829
If I say that I like denim,

811
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,569
you'll wear denim at all times.

812
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,240
I'll wear denim during a shower.

813
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,570
Seriously, I feel dizzy.

814
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,070
I'll get a denim tattoo.

815
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,980
We'll arrive in no time.

816
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,280
Is it good to go home early?

817
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,379
No, it's disappointing.

818
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,719
- Is it disappointing?
- Of course.

819
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,320
Would you circle the house twice?

820
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,250
It's okay to circle it three times.

821
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,230
How did you become so funny?

822
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,700
(As they get closer, their laughter becomes louder.)

823
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,599
What's this?

824
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,629
How nice.

825
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,839
They definitely like each other.

826
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,009
Does Baek Hyun have no intention to get back together with Hyeon Ji?

827
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,269
Is he starting to forget about her amidst the date?

828
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,779
I think the two of them...

829
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,779
will become very close after today.

830
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,009
He sent her a text without getting swayed once.

831
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,480
- He sent it four consecutive times.
- That's right.

832
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,650
(Cleaning up after a meal)

833
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,319
I'll do the dishes.

834
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,420
No, I'll do the dishes.

835
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,189
You promised to cook dinner today.

836
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,230
Really? Okay.

837
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,300
Is there no trash can?

838
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,780
(Ji Hyeon goes downstairs.)

839
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,150
Yes?

840
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,880
May I go in?

841
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,020
Yes!

842
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,820
So this is what the room looks like.

843
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

844
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,570
Give me a second.

845
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,040
- What is it?
- Won Kyu, you're ready for bed.

846
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,839
Are you going to sleep?

847
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,510
No, I don't feel sleepy.

848
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,440
What did you do?

849
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,779
I had a meal.

850
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,010
- A meal?
- Yes.

851
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,610
I'm eating well.

852
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,280
It seemed that way.

853
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,850
Thank you for kyungokko.

854
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,560
You're still using the polite tone.

855
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,860
Aren't we supposed to do that?

856
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,630
You seem to be doing very well.

857
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,030
Is he her ex?

858
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,630
Why...

859
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
- What's this?
- Hold on a second.

860
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,970
- No way.
- This can't be it.

861
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,409
- Really?
- We thought her ex wasn't there.

862
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,279
- That's right.
- Ji Hyeon seemed so free.

863
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,909
We thought her ex wasn't there because she was doing very well.

864
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,979
Does that mean Won Kyu is the one who meets a lot of women?

865
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,619
- It seems that way.
- Seriously.

866
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,049
Is Ji Hyeon the one...

867
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,289
- he wanted to marry?
- What?

868
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,019
It really didn't show, right?

869
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,530
- Won Kyu has a serious poker face.
- My goodness.

870
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,290
My goodness.

871
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,730
You seem to be doing very well.

872
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,330
- I seem to be doing well?
- Yes.

873
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,229
Speak for yourself.

874
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,440
- Me?
- Yes.

875
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,270
As for me...

876
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,290
I feel uncomfortable now.

877
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,849
- You feel uncomfortable now?
- Yes.

878
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,250
I felt fine at first.

879
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,360
At first,

880
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,630
you were enjoying yourself.

881
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,599
It's okay to enjoy myself.

882
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,800
It's okay to enjoy yourself.

883
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,330
Why did you cry yesterday?

884
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,170
You don't need to know.

885
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,910
What are you thinking?

886
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,340
I can't tell you.

887
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,150
We broke up.

888
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,890
We do not know each other's true feelings.

889
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,190
I wondered, "Should I really wish for your happiness?"

890
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,900
"Be happy" or something like that.

891
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,600
So that is why you cried?

892
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,970
That was not the reason.

893
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,840
But I have the exact same thoughts.

894
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,909
It did not feel like you were wishing for my happiness.

895
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:20,910
Why not?

896
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,980
Because I am not that happy...

897
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,268
with you.

898
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,820
"What's wrong with you? What are you thinking?"

899
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,890
There were several moments when I wanted to blurt those out.

900
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,660
- Because I was cold to you?
- Yes.

901
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,790
Well, I should not expect anything since we are exes now.

902
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,330
But it did not make me happy.

903
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,300
That's because I'm uncomfortable.

904
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,430
Of course.

905
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,723
I...

906
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,890
Never mind.

907
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,610
I'm trying my best, you know?

908
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,080
- To get along.
- Amazing.

909
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,180
As for me, I feel...

910
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,180
You...

911
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,550
Why do you annoy me so much?

912
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,690
Likewise.

913
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,850
- I do?
- Yes.

914
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,860
There were sides to you...

915
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,160
that...

916
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,890
I never knew about.

917
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,559
- Sides that you did not know about?
- Yes.

918
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,660
Like what?

919
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,330
I shouldn't say it.

920
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,570
(They can hear something from afar.)

921
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,580
(Ji Yeon has come to the 1st floor.)

922
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,830
Yes?

923
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,830
Did you eat?

924
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,530
- Eat?
- Yes.

925
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,630
I didn't have lunch.

926
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,130
Aren't you hungry?

927
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,300
For real?

928
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,069
This is wild. Is this some thriller movie?

929
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,609
- This is truly wild.
- Seriously?

930
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,869
- It's a thriller movie.
- Hold on.

931
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,310
This is...

932
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,510
- What now?
- It's all too weird.

933
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,950
Aren't you hungry?

934
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,679
Not yet.

935
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,680
- I see.
- Yes.

936
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,920
Are you going to eat?

937
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:11,989
No, we had lunch.

938
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,490
- But me?
- Yes, it didn't seem like you ate.

939
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,930
- I'll close the door.
- Okay.

940
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,500
Come out.

941
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,400
This is bad.

942
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,440
(Her legs have turned into jelly.)

943
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,140
I knew it was her.

944
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,680
It didn't make me uneasy.

945
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,310
Because I already knew.

946
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,550
"So the two are talking a lot," was what I thought.

947
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,160
It was...

948
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,860
- like a drama.
- For real.

949
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,340
(The aftertaste is going strong.)

950
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,110
Either way, I'm seeing sides of you I didn't know.

951
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,080
And I hate it.

952
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,550
- Wait, are these earplugs?
- Yes.

953
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,280
She gave them to me.

954
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,260
You must be happy.

955
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,990
Even when I come to my room, your voice is too loud...

956
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,689
for me to sleep.

957
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,229
- Me?
- Yes.

958
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,699
That's when I get annoyed...

959
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,370
- Why do you get annoyed?
- and put these in my ears.

960
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,970
Did you buy her coffee?

961
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,810
- I can't tell you that.
- What?

962
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,640
Fine, don't.

963
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,410
But I bet you did.

964
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,050
Nice.

965
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,220
This sure is EXchange.

966
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,520
Bye.

967
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:57,960
Goodnight.

968
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,310
Seriously?

969
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,439
- Unbelievable.
- This is crazy.

970
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,580
I got goosebumps.

971
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,040
I'm cold.

972
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,349
I had to hold my breath.

973
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,079
Before, Ji Yeon...

974
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,419
- had entered Won Kyu's room.
- Right.

975
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,619
Had she done it just now, what would've happened?

976
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,689
Exactly.

977
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,619
They acted like people who were caught cheating.

978
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,689
For real.

979
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,359
To think we'd see such a scene...

980
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
after all these seasons of EXchange.

981
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:30,889
This sort of dopamine rush is a first.

982
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,189
- Right?
- That was...

983
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,259
Won Kyu really impressed me.

984
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,199
- Same.
- Had I been him in that situation,

985
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,469
I would've gotten out of bed and took her outside to talk.

986
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,999
- I would've gotten flustered, - Me too.

987
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,169
- Right?
- but he didn't.

988
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,809
- He wasn't flustered one bit.
- Exactly.

989
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,139
- I would've panicked.
- But why didn't he move?

990
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,140
Was he doing mugwort steam therapy on his stomach?

991
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,680
- Only him?
- It was like...

992
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,879
The whole situation...

993
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,579
from start to finish was a spectacle.

994
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,519
- But he was stuck in his bed.
- Listen.

995
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,089
Won Kyu is truly amazing.

996
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,989
- He's wild.
- He's extraordinary.

997
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,260
- Won Kyu is beyond ordinary.
- He's incredible.

998
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,789
We witnessed a different side of Won Kyu.

999
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,429
- Exactly.
- We did.

1000
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,529
- He's cold.
- "You're annoying."

1001
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,029
We saw a cold side to him.

1002
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,329
Ji Hyeon has found out...

1003
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,669
who her ex is dating.

1004
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,399
The tension is intense.

1005
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,070
This is all just too entertaining.

1006
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,640
(Jae Hyeong is heading to his first date spot.)

1007
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,620
(And Min Kyung is waiting for Jae Hyeong.)

1008
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,160
Hi.

1009
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

1010
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,870
- Please sit.
- Okay.

1011
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,499
- Were you surprised?
- Yes.

1012
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,070
Yes, after we met earlier.

1013
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,040
- You changed your outfit.
- Yes, my earlier outfit...

1014
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,210
- Was it weird?
- was too casual.

1015
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,720
How she blushed at the start was really cute.

1016
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,020
But seeing her all dressed up...

1017
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,620
made me even more excited for the date.

1018
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,220
May I know your name?

1019
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,729
It's Kwak Min Kyung.

1020
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,399
- "Kwak Min Kyung?" - Yes, Min Kyung.

1021
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,929
My name is Lee Jae Hyeong.

1022
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,430
- Sorry?
- Lee Jae Hyeong.

1023
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,470
- Jae Hyeong.
- Yes, Jae Hyeong.

1024
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,970
- Min Kyung?
- Yes.

1025
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:25,040
Your dimples are quite deep.

1026
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,980
I don't think they are.

1027
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,580
But people tell me that they are deep.

1028
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,749
Do you remember me mentioning it during our chat?

1029
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,050
Yes, I do.

1030
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,820
I remember.

1031
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,820
This feels unreal.

1032
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,660
He had a pretty smile.

1033
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,229
He looked at me with eyes...

1034
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:54,340
full of confidence.

1035
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,840
It made me think that a great guy had joined us.

1036
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,440
It's too pretty to eat.

1037
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,409
Right?

1038
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:05,810
How's my first impression?

1039
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,420
Here's what really impressed me:

1040
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,919
Asking me to go on a date.

1041
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,690
- That?
- It was a big surprise.

1042
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,920
Really?

1043
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,989
- I'm relieved.
- Because...

1044
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,830
you give off...

1045
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,699
a completely different vibe from the other residents.

1046
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,769
How so?

1047
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,969
I feel like all the guys are quite timid.

1048
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,840
- Is that so?
- Yes, but you're very honest.

1049
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,050
How you expressed yourself...

1050
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,580
was remarkable.

1051
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,320
- Thank you. That's good.
- Yes.

1052
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,289
Is everyone shy?

1053
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,820
That's what I think.

1054
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,760
I'm quite shy too. I'm really timid.

1055
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,429
I'm only acting like I'm not.

1056
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,629
- Really?
- Yes.

1057
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,859
Either way, I left a good impression, right?

1058
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,000
I...

1059
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,499
It made me happy.

1060
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,869
I see. What a relief.

1061
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,640
- Yes, I was happy.
- Good.

1062
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,340
What are you like? Do you have a fixed ideal type?

1063
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,879
Look-wise, I prefer someone who has a pretty smile.

1064
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,380
- You mentioned that earlier.
- Yes

1065
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,620
And...

1066
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:19,220
I feel like I'm attracted to guys who are tall.

1067
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,060
Even though I'm quite small.

1068
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,390
How tall must a guy be to be considered tall?

1069
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,900
- 180cm.
- 180cm?

1070
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,400
- I'm 181cm tall.
- Really?

1071
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:31,900
I'm relieved.

1072
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,240
I couldn't help but think that...

1073
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,840
I'm not too far off from Min Kyung's ideal type.

1074
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:46,010
By the way, you have a personality that's hard not to get along with.

1075
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,780
- If you feel that way, - Yes?

1076
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:49,283
I'm glad.

1077
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:52,219
If we continue to spend time together,

1078
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,990
I'm sure we'll get comfortable around each other.

1079
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,059
We can definitely get to know each other more.

1080
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,330
- Let's grab drinks together.
- Sure.

1081
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,600
- She's a cutie even today.
- Gosh.

1082
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,129
Look at her light up.

1083
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,529
- Exactly.
- She looks so cheery.

1084
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,869
- They look good together.
- Yes.

1085
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,040
I bet Min Kyung likes a face like his.

1086
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,940
- The two really look good together.
- Yes.

1087
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,310
- How about we get something to eat?
- I'm in.

1088
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,910
Do you also like cats?

1089
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,679
I do.

1090
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,649
- But dogs?
- But I prefer dogs.

1091
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,880
- Are you a dog lover?
- I love dogs.

1092
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,220
I'm starving.

1093
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,890
How pretty.

1094
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,320
It's really pretty.

1095
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,230
(Egg and Flower)

1096
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,499
I heard this was a pasta place.

1097
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,670
Great.

1098
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,239
The view here is...

1099
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,570
It's amazing.

1100
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,539
For real.

1101
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,869
Should I tell you how I ended up picking you?

1102
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,280
Yes, please do.

1103
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,109
- I joined late, right?
- Yes.

1104
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:53,219
I was given the opportunity to date...

1105
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,580
one of the girls.

1106
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,220
You weren't the only one I chatted with at first.

1107
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:00,890
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1108
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,589
I chatted with two other people...

1109
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,259
- before you.
- I see.

1110
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,030
It felt like we were on the same page.

1111
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,869
That's why I ended the chat...

1112
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,100
and asked you out on this date.

1113
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,300
I had no idea.

1114
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,910
That means...

1115
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,809
- There are two more girls.
- Yes.

1116
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,579
Did you not consider them?

1117
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,880
No, I didn't.

1118
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,950
I'm touched.

1119
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,249
But there's a limit to how much you can know through chats.

1120
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,289
True.

1121
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,319
I stopped when I had the feeling it'd be fun and we'd get along well.

1122
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,720
You did?

1123
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,160
We met up in an interesting way...

1124
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,000
- when the door opened.
- Yes.

1125
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,629
We met each other in what we would call...

1126
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,699
- a raw state.
- Exactly.

1127
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,939
That could be the reason why we're more...

1128
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,769
- At ease?
- at ease with each other.

1129
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,770
We didn't have to go through another icebreaker.

1130
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,610
It was fun.

1131
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,939
When I asked if he regretted not chatting...

1132
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,809
with the remaining two girls,

1133
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:01,019
Jae Hyeong said he didn't.

1134
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,280
That was a surprise.

1135
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,519
I'm going to take a photo.

1136
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,560
Okay.

1137
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,659
Is it good?

1138
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,760
Yes, it's good.

1139
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,870
- Gosh.
- I'm in bliss.

1140
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,130
It's delicious.

1141
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,870
- Do you like these too?
- Yes.

1142
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,810
Whenever you answer,

1143
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,080
you have a way of saying "yes."

1144
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,450
I think so too. "Yes."

1145
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,090
I also use a lot of sound effects.

1146
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,590
You seem like it.

1147
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,520
You're that cute type.

1148
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,490
I used a lot of gestures too.

1149
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,730
- I bet you act charmingly too.
- I totally do.

1150
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,800
She's the type of person I can't help but want to tease.

1151
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,940
She gives a very enthusiastic reaction,

1152
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,140
which was really nice.

1153
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,350
The more I talk to you,

1154
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:09,120
the more interesting you become.

1155
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,990
You seem like a straightforward guy.

1156
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,159
I can't beat around the bush.

1157
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,060
I'm totally like that.

1158
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:19,490
I must say what I need to say out loud right away.

1159
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,430
I felt like we had that in common.

1160
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,830
Speaking up right away.

1161
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,070
That's an unexpected side of you.

1162
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,299
Really?

1163
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,610
I thought you weren't like that.

1164
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,280
I don't know what I'm like.

1165
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,010
You have a twist.

1166
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,680
I'll try to show that off more.

1167
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,350
I'm curious.

1168
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,190
He welcomed me with a really bright smile.

1169
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,600
That expression left the strongest impression.

1170
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,200
He made my heart flutter.

1171
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:00,640
I want to get to know Min Kyung better now.

1172
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,740
It was a satisfying date.

1173
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,340
If possible, I'd like another date with her.

1174
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,479
Let's get along well.

1175
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,980
- Of course. Shall we leave?
- Yes.

1176
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,279
- He's got romantic eyes.
- Yes.

1177
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,149
He's got that main male character vibe.

1178
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:18,089
I think it's the perfect timing...

1179
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,259
- for Min Kyung.
- Right.

1180
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,889
Min Kyung's expression is completely different.

1181
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,860
- So different.
- Really different.

1182
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,699
- The satisfaction is different.
- Totally.

1183
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,629
There aren't that many proactive residents.

1184
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,129
- That's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

1185
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,769
Once he joins the house,

1186
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,570
I'm sure the girls' atmosphere will change.

1187
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,369
Did your love cells wake up?

1188
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,070
I think they did a little bit.

1189
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,650
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

1190
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,959
- Yes?
- May I come in?

1191
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,060
Yes.

1192
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,630
(She gets up in a flash.)

1193
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,630
- You were sleeping, weren't you?
- What is it?

1194
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,070
The residents would want to eat something...

1195
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,870
once they come back, so I'm thinking...

1196
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,439
of cooking something.

1197
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,539
- Cook something?
- Yes.

1198
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,570
Together?

1199
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,809
I guess.

1200
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,280
I don't think anyone else is here.

1201
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,510
Is that so?

1202
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,749
What a bummer. I thought you wanted to cook with me.

1203
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:18,980
Yes, I want us to cook together.

1204
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,549
- What?
- Let's cook together.

1205
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,620
Oh, okay.

1206
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,920
He wanted to cook dinner together.

1207
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,559
We thought about what to make...

1208
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,160
and chose stir-fried spicy pork.

1209
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,260
I'll prep the onion.

1210
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,130
You're good at peeling it.

1211
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,640
Everyone is a good cook,

1212
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,070
- which puts pressure on me.
- Same here.

1213
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,369
But since everyone is kind,

1214
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,410
- won't they still eat it?
- They won't say it's bad.

1215
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,320
- Not bad, right?
- Yes, you're good at cutting.

1216
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,290
I'm going to go with my gut feeling.

1217
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,230
- My gut feeling.
- Okay, let's do that.

1218
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,830
(Making the marinade based on her gut feeling)

1219
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,769
Where do I put these?

1220
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,900
- Why not dump them in here?
- Okay.

1221
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,940
The vegetables marinate together, right?

1222
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,340
Or not? No?

1223
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,449
Don't we add the vegetables last?

1224
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,979
Yes, near the end.

1225
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,919
- The onions...
- Stop here? Okay.

1226
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,949
Stop there.

1227
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,020
Here.

1228
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,090
But it looks natural.

1229
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,520
Right? Two carrots should do.

1230
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,330
It's because I rarely cook.

1231
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,560
The meat is frozen,

1232
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,200
but I can still marinate it, right?

1233
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:44,399
(Facing a 2nd crisis)

1234
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,470
How about...

1235
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,952
- defrosting it in water first?
- Okay.

1236
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,439
(Looking it up real quick)

1237
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,479
Beef loin...

1238
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,979
is best defrosted this way.

1239
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,080
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1240
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,449
I'll add them in later.

1241
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,950
(Successfully overcame the 2nd crisis)

1242
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,720
- If it's bad, - Yes?

1243
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,220
let's tell the others we don't know who made it.

1244
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,660
- Okay?
- Won Kyu.

1245
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,559
Tell them you simply grilled what was already prepared.

1246
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,690
I'll do that.

1247
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,000
- Okay?
- Yes.

1248
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,959
Get some rest.

1249
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,400
(They take a break while the meat defrosts.)

1250
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,270
- Bye.
- Bye.

1251
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,580
(Woo Jin spots the meat and the marinade.)

1252
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,190
What are you doing? Aren't you bored?

1253
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,629
Were you preparing to cook some food upstairs?

1254
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,900
- Yes.
- What's the menu?

1255
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,430
- Stir-fried spicy beef loin.
- Stir-fried spicy beef loin?

1256
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:52,900
How about we cook it together?

1257
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:56,000
- The base has been prepared.
- Okay.

1258
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,970
We're going to continue once the meat has defrosted.

1259
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,840
- After it defrosts?
- Yes.

1260
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,680
We'll cook once the meat has defrosted.

1261
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,380
- Are you cooking together?
- Yes.

1262
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:12,620
(After hearing they're cooking together, Woo Jin leaves.)

1263
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,040
Yes?

1264
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,470
Are you alone?

1265
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,940
- Are you going to sleep?
- Yes.

1266
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,280
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

1267
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,450
Sit here.

1268
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,820
No, I'm fine here.

1269
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,160
- What is it?
- What?

1270
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,330
- For real?
- Seriously?

1271
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,699
To reveal everything?

1272
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,759
Can you really show us everything out of the blue?

1273
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,069
But why?

1274
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,129
- Why?
- Just why?

1275
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,139
- What is this?
- A jackpot.

1276
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,369
Is it really okay to reveal everything?

1277
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,270
There must be more after this.

1278
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,539
Isn't revealing two couples at once...

1279
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,079
- a first?
- The best episode.

1280
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,379
- It's...
- Isn't this new?

1281
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,949
- Yes.
- This is the best episode.

1282
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,049
It hasn't been that long since the first couple was revealed.

1283
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,149
We're still recovering from the shock.

1284
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,620
The shock from Won Kyu and Ji Hyeon.

1285
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,519
Sit here.

1286
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,620
No, I'm fine here.

1287
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,760
What is it?

1288
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,700
What is it?

1289
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,600
Am I not welcome here?

1290
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,880
We barely talked after coming here.

1291
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,080
Are you interested in anyone?

1292
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,680
Must I answer it?

1293
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,289
- No.
- I hope you are.

1294
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,620
- You do?
- Yes.

1295
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:55,720
I'll take care of it.

1296
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,060
I'll deal with it.

1297
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,630
It feels like you have someone.

1298
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,600
Yes, I do.

1299
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,940
- But it's only been five days now.
- Yes.

1300
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,410
We've met these people for five days.

1301
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,010
But you're already interested in him?

1302
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,250
I am.

1303
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,180
How frustrating.

1304
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,920
(1 week ago in Seongsu-dong)

1305
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,430
(Ji Yeon is waiting for her ex.)

1306
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,190
Long time no see.

1307
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,400
Have you been well?

1308
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,700
You've lost a lot of weight.

1309
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,939
- Really?
- Yes.

1310
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,010
I must've been busy.

1311
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,850
How was life?

1312
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,419
I just go to work like I always do.

1313
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,020
- Work?
- Yes.

1314
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:39,290
We started dating on March 3, 2024.

1315
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,570
We broke up on March 17, 2025.

1316
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,400
I went to a restaurant where a close friend had reserved a table.

1317
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,670
I was a customer,

1318
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:52,570
and my ex was working at that restaurant.

1319
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,910
I met him for the first time that day,

1320
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,210
and he was my ideal type.

1321
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,249
I got hooked on him.

1322
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,380
"I'll regret it if I don't make a move."

1323
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,889
I wrote my name and number on a sticky note...

1324
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,960
and stuck it on the back of Woo Jin's hand.

1325
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:13,760
There were a few customers who asked for my Instagram handle,

1326
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,760
but I never gave it to them.

1327
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,900
She has a face that I really like.

1328
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,610
Unconsciously, I saved her number.

1329
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,480
That's how we first contacted each other.

1330
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,750
Since I work at a restaurant,

1331
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,049
I was busiest during the weekends,

1332
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,180
when my ex had her days off.

1333
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,649
After my ex got off work on the weekend,

1334
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:41,960
I told him I'd go over.

1335
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,460
It was around 2am to 3am.

1336
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:48,029
There was a 24-hour coffee shop in front of Mangwon Station.

1337
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,970
We talked over some coffee in that shop.

1338
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:54,669
Before we met in person,

1339
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,440
I asked about her job and such through text.

1340
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,569
She had majored in design...

1341
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,840
and was working at a company.

1342
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,279
As a joke, I told her to teach me later,

1343
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,950
but she brought her laptop and tablet when we first met.

1344
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:11,320
She had put together the shortcut keys on paper.

1345
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:17,490
We talked about everything, including our lives up until now.

1346
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,299
He said he was a former civil servant and had moved to Seoul...

1347
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,547
to pursue his dream.

1348
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,399
The fact that he had a dream...

1349
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,200
really impressed me.

1350
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,470
I thought about how diligent and upright he was.

1351
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:35,039
Even though it was our first time meeting, we had tons to talk about.

1352
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,510
We had a lot in common.

1353
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,080
We went to the Han River to chat.

1354
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,020
The sun was up before I knew it.

1355
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,190
After that, we stayed in touch...

1356
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,060
and naturally became lovers.

1357
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:58,070
(That's how they started a relationship.)

1358
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,700
The more I met her, the more I liked her,

1359
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:05,439
and my love toward her increased.

1360
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,570
She had so many charms.

1361
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,380
Our schedules were completely opposite.

1362
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,279
When I got off from work,

1363
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,420
that was the busiest time for my ex.

1364
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,289
When my ex got off,

1365
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,250
I was sleeping.

1366
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,830
(They had completely different schedules.)

1367
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:29,430
On weekends, I often visited her after I got off on Saturday.

1368
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,699
Usually, we often dated at home.

1369
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,340
(Woo Jin left work at dawn and dated at Ji Yeon's place on weekends.)

1370
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,209
She didn't go to bed and waited for me.

1371
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,909
When I got off from work,

1372
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,980
she always prepared a lot of food...

1373
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,040
worrying I might have worked without eating.

1374
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,979
(Food Ji Yeon cooked for Woo Jin)

1375
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,919
She didn't just prepare food.

1376
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,249
It looked too beautiful to eat.

1377
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,190
She plated the food beautifully on nice dishes.

1378
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:53,990
It touched me so much.

1379
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,420
I could see how much she cared about me.

1380
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,030
We had an intimate chat,

1381
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,060
and it was already light outside.

1382
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:02,999
I was sleepy,

1383
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,429
but the time felt so precious to me.

1384
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,799
He had to leave after I got up from sleep,

1385
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,899
so I didn't want to sleep.

1386
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,669
And he also stayed up almost all night.

1387
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,170
Then he went to work.

1388
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,379
While I was getting ready for work,

1389
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,580
she got a taxi waiting for me...

1390
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,310
so that I could go to work comfortably in a taxi.

1391
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,510
She made sure I took my vitamins before I left.

1392
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:22,850
She took care of me so well.

1393
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,419
We met once or twice a week.

1394
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,719
Our days off didn't match,

1395
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,220
and we sacrificed our energy to have a date.

1396
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,790
Those dates felt very special and precious.

1397
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,459
That's nice.

1398
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,269
They had such a beautiful relationship.

1399
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,440
I had a similar experience. I had to work the next day,

1400
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,499
but I thought, "I just need an hour's sleep."

1401
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,809
- Right.
- And later, I was like,

1402
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,709
"I actually don't need to sleep."

1403
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,309
Right. When you love spending time together,

1404
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,539
- you don't need to sleep.
- Sleep isn't a priority.

1405
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,209
- Why does it matter?
- It's not important.

1406
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,779
Sometimes, when you date, you hate wasting time sleeping.

1407
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,680
- Right.
- It's too precious.

1408
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,190
I'm a fruit lover.

1409
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,219
When I told him I wanted to have some fruits,

1410
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,290
he came carrying so many fruits enough to have his arms fall off.

1411
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,629
Being afraid that I might not be be bothered to prepare the fruit,

1412
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,930
he cut all he brought up and put it away in the refrigerator.

1413
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,969
He washed grapes...

1414
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,500
and sliced kiwis.

1415
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,470
He prepared and stored them before he left.

1416
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,680
I appreciated it very much.

1417
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,510
I relied on him a lot.

1418
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,870
My dad passed away last year.

1419
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,650
Thanks to my ex,

1420
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,520
I could get back to normal quickly.

1421
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,890
One day, I felt so distressed,

1422
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,799
and I was too scared to sleep. I didn't want to go to bed.

1423
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,960
I just didn't want to sleep.

1424
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:17,060
So I told him,

1425
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,869
"I just don't want to go to bed today."

1426
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,970
"I don't want to turn the light off."

1427
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,810
When I told him I just didn't want to sleep, he said,

1428
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:29,340
"Then we can watch something fun all day."

1429
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,610
He said that we could talk and laugh and not go to sleep.

1430
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,950
He had to go to work the next day.

1431
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,419
I watched videos all day as he suggested,

1432
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,420
and before I knew it,

1433
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,830
I fell asleep.

1434
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,390
At that time,

1435
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,870
after a few days off, I had to go back to work.

1436
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,199
I didn't want to have lunch...

1437
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,609
because it was hard for me...

1438
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:02,080
to talk to my colleagues as if I was fine.

1439
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,080
That day,

1440
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:07,320
I thought he went to work,

1441
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,149
but he said he'd wait for me...

1442
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:12,220
and I could come downstairs at lunchtime.

1443
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,260
He supported me a lot like that.

1444
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,460
- It's fruit, your favorite.
- Yes.

1445
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,200
I thought...

1446
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:35,810
we broke up on good terms.

1447
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,450
At first,

1448
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,890
I had some negative feelings.

1449
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:47,960
- After we broke up?
- Yes.

1450
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:53,960
Since the start of the year, I prepared to get my shop ready.

1451
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,399
Then on my days off,

1452
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,970
I had to go look for a location for my shop...

1453
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,970
and meet some people.

1454
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,340
In the first place, he didn't get to see me often,

1455
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,069
and he couldn't contact me often either.

1456
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:07,710
I could tell the way he spent time with me...

1457
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,680
changed in many ways.

1458
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,420
We talked on the phone once a day although it wasn't for a long time,

1459
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,080
but at some point, it stopped too.

1460
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,720
"Why can't you understand this?"

1461
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,120
"I'm busy preparing my business."

1462
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,520
"Put yourself in my shoes. You're working."

1463
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,660
"You might be unavailable because you're working."

1464
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,859
"That's fine with me."

1465
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,900
"That won't bother me."

1466
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,769
When I said these, she was disappointed,

1467
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,670
and she complained.

1468
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,070
The minor issues piled up.

1469
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,109
On the day off that week,

1470
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:42,439
I thought I'd see him, of course.

1471
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,080
So I called him, and he said,

1472
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,820
"I forgot. I need to meet someone tomorrow."

1473
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,719
So I said, "Why are you telling me about it now?"

1474
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,860
"I thought we were meeting tomorrow."

1475
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,720
Then he said,

1476
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:01,230
"Why do you assume my day off is for you?"

1477
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,799
"My day off is for me."

1478
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,970
"Do not feel entitled for my day off."

1479
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,840
He spoke so sharply to me.

1480
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,409
Before that, he used to tell me, "I might get very busy."

1481
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,240
"I might be busy running my shop."

1482
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,449
"But my day off is for you, Ji Yeon."

1483
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,950
"It's for you, no matter what happens."

1484
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,190
"It will never change."

1485
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,659
The moment I heard him saying his day off was for himself,

1486
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,189
I remembered what he told me in the past.

1487
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:36,260
In the past, when I asked him if visiting me on the weekends...

1488
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,600
didn't make him too tired,

1489
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,670
he said, "Still, I love hanging out with you. I'm fine."

1490
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,440
But later, he said,

1491
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,539
"When I go to work after meeting you on weekends,"

1492
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,380
"it feels so tired. You won't imagine."

1493
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,190
"I go to work after staying up almost all night."

1494
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,060
"It makes me really tired, Ji Yeon."

1495
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,260
"It's not like coming here is nothing for me."

1496
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,660
Once, he said that.

1497
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,269
I thought that he wasn't just busy.

1498
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:20,440
I wondered if he had fallen out of love with me.

1499
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,340
I thought that, unconsciously.

1500
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,479
I said, "I'm busy. Why can't you understand that?"

1501
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,549
She said, "I know you're busy, and I understand that."

1502
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:31,220
"However, I wish you'd think of me sometimes."

1503
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,050
We couldn't narrow the differences in our opinions.

1504
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,620
I actually didn't consider a compromise.

1505
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,190
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

1506
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,199
He has a colder side than we expected.

1507
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,099
She could have thought he became totally different.

1508
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,529
You might think...

1509
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:49,399
that those words are nothing,

1510
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,209
but women find that very disappointing.

1511
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,210
Right.

1512
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:56,309
It's all right if you put it a bit in a different way.

1513
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,079
- For example, "I'm sorry." - You need to say that.

1514
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,549
- "I'm sorry." - Right, you should say that.

1515
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,749
"I forgot to tell you in advance."

1516
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,089
"The appointment tomorrow is important to me."

1517
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,319
If only you say that,

1518
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,350
- your lover won't be disappointed.
- Right.

1519
01:17:07,526 --> 01:17:08,859
But he said, "Why do you think you're entitled to it?"

1520
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:10,959
That made her so upset.

1521
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,030
I want to point out, "I'm busy preparing for my business."

1522
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,399
I said that many times in the past.

1523
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,899
- Woo Jin said the same thing.
- That's...

1524
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,229
- Right.
- disappointing too.

1525
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:18,829
- It's all disappointing.
- "Do you think I'm slacking?"

1526
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,499
"I'm going to work. I'm working now."

1527
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,039
- Right.
- Speaking nicely to each other...

1528
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,409
- is really important.
- I know.

1529
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:28,079
Anyway, they broke up because things were not the same anymore.

1530
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,179
- That's right.
- Exactly.

1531
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,340
I can understand.

1532
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,309
- I understand.
- Preparing for his shop...

1533
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,920
- can make him sensitive.
- Right.

1534
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,419
I thought I had to tell him...

1535
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,590
my feelings that I had held in.

1536
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,060
We were in a cafe,

1537
01:17:42,061 --> 01:17:44,790
and she said it crying although there were other people.

1538
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,759
I realized that it was my fault.

1539
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,900
I knew she didn't expect a lot from me.

1540
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,170
She only wanted simple things, and I failed to provide them.

1541
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,740
After listening to what she thought, I said, "I'm sorry."

1542
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,440
"I'll do my best."

1543
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,380
We ended the conversation nicely,

1544
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,050
and the next day,

1545
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,280
I felt lonely, just the same.

1546
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,580
If things went on like that,

1547
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:15,090
we'd get tired over and over, and break up eventually, I thought.

1548
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:19,960
I thought I wouldn't be able to break up with him in person.

1549
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:22,430
I felt I'd tear up if I saw his face.

1550
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,599
I knew it was disrespectful,

1551
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,070
but I broke up with him over the phone.

1552
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,240
I was like, "What?"

1553
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,380
"What's wrong? I thought we settled it nicely yesterday."

1554
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,550
"We need to talk in person."

1555
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,150
But she said she didn't want to.

1556
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,149
I was upset.

1557
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,080
I thought we cleared the air,

1558
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,350
but she didn't think the same.

1559
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,620
I still have unresolved feelings,

1560
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,700
and I feel a bit frustrated.

1561
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,230
I wanted to meet her and talk things through,

1562
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,499
but that's how we broke up.

1563
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,170
(They made time for each other despite conflicting schedules,)

1564
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:09,540
(but their time together has ended.)

1565
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:17,050
For today's meeting,

1566
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,850
I wanted to tell you...

1567
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,590
that I was sorry to break up with you like that.

1568
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,700
Let's follow our hearts.

1569
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,800
Let's be honest.

1570
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:34,570
I'm going to be completely honest.

1571
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,700
I won't care about you.

1572
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,410
Do not care about me and do as you like.

1573
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,480
You can do as you like too.

1574
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,219
- I can understand Woo Jin too.
- Me too.

1575
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,319
I can understand both of them.

1576
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,019
I can understand both of their perspectives.

1577
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,389
But two of them are a bit...

1578
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,859
It's not like they both agreed to break up.

1579
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,689
- Right.
- Ji Yeon made a conclusion first.

1580
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:02,029
That's why he still has unresolved feelings.

1581
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,729
Why do you think about breaking up over the phone?

1582
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:05,769
I think it maintains a certain level of respect.

1583
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:07,369
It's better than sending an instant message.

1584
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,769
- "Let's break up." - Anything but ghosting is fine.

1585
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,399
- Ghosting is terrible.
- Anything except that is okay.

1586
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,869
Sometimes you get soft when you see your lover,

1587
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:13,969
- Right.
- to see her face.

1588
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:15,839
I don't think it's too bad, either.

1589
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,210
I also get easily soft.

1590
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,809
- You get soft to see her face?
- I get so soft.

1591
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:25,189
That's why quite a lot of people hate to break up in person.

1592
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,520
- Their hearts might falter.
- They might get pulled back in.

1593
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,870
(Before moving in, time room)

1594
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,740
(Time to express what's in their hearts before moving in)

1595
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,750
Once I break up,

1596
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,550
I can't see my ex again, I think.

1597
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,860
I wish there were someone I can really fall in love with.

1598
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,800
I'm a bit more inclined to find a new relationship.

1599
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:16,040
I expressed exactly how I felt.

1600
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:21,540
(11:30 for Ji Yeon, 7 o'clock for Woo Jin)

1601
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:26,580
(Ji Yeon and Woo Jin both expect a new relationship.)

1602
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,820
If we meet again,

1603
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,590
- I thought I'd have mixed feelings.
- Yes.

1604
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,260
But I feel better than I expected.

1605
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:43,000
That's enough. We had a good time.

1606
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,830
(Woo Jin and Ji Yeon, March 3, 2024 to March 17, 2025)

1607
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,799
(The first day of moving in)

1608
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,039
Hello.

1609
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

1610
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,339
Hello.

1611
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,010
I avoided her eyes right away.

1612
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,680
She was someone I felt closest in the past.

1613
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:00,750
So if I meet her eyes,

1614
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,580
it could be obvious, I thought.

1615
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:05,650
It's not that I didn't care about him at all,

1616
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:09,390
but I'm trying not to.

1617
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:12,230
I'll keep it for now.

1618
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,160
It was so nice.

1619
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,530
She hit him so hard.

1620
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:20,300
(Ji Yeon always secured the place beside Won Kyu.)

1621
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,240
It's true!

1622
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,410
- You hit me really hard.
- It got red.

1623
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,280
(Your ex did not pick you.)

1624
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,379
I have a negative feeling.

1625
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,380
(And he received a text every day.)

1626
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,050
I don't think it's jealousy.

1627
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:40,720
I suppose it's lingering feelings.

1628
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:44,729
I don't think I definitely want...

1629
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,390
to reunite with her.

1630
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,800
It's half and half.

1631
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:51,930
I'm really not sure.

1632
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,670
Honestly speaking,

1633
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:01,240
I can't believe you're attracted to him.

1634
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,810
You've done nothing with him yet.

1635
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,780
Attraction...

1636
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,350
Wanting to get to know someone as he seems to be a nice person...

1637
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,650
is curiosity.

1638
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:16,490
But you express it as you're attracted.

1639
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,660
As I see, I'm not curious. I'm attracted.

1640
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,400
I'm in front of you.

1641
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,900
Your presence...

1642
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,070
doesn't bother me that much.

1643
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,369
I'm not saying...

1644
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,010
that I don't care about you as a person.

1645
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:34,980
When you hurt your hand and all,

1646
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,810
I'm worried and bothered, of course.

1647
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,849
- But it's not like what I think.
- No.

1648
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,550
- It's not the same feeling.
- I'm not bothered in that way.

1649
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,420
So you don't need to care about me, either.

1650
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,990
Do as you like.

1651
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,360
I can take care of myself.

1652
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,229
- Don't keep telling me what to do.
- Okay.

1653
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,370
I'll take care of that.

1654
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,269
I'll take care of myself, too.

1655
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,800
I won't care about you, either.

1656
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,110
You look like you don't need my concern.

1657
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,810
That's why I joined this show.

1658
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,050
I, well,

1659
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:15,180
don't want to reunite with you.

1660
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,290
- At all?
- At all.

1661
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:21,090
I amaze myself.

1662
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,760
But I'm like this, you know.

1663
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,529
- I know.
- You know me.

1664
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:27,790
Once I decide on something...

1665
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,670
I really don't want to get back together, Woo Jin.

1666
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:38,510
I'm not telling you that we need to get back together.

1667
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,640
Meet someone new and do not care about me.

1668
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,580
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

1669
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,449
Anyway, regarding the one I'm interested in now,

1670
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:53,420
I'm not curious. I'm attracted.

1671
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,720
I know my own heart best.

1672
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,060
You should have been better to me when you had me.

1673
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,800
Do you think I wasn't good?

1674
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,330
Go. I need to rest.

1675
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,740
Let's talk about it tonight.

1676
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,350
Woo Jin looked like he wanted to get back together.

1677
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,020
I really don't want to.

1678
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,960
I started to have a lot on my mind.

1679
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,629
I wondered what I really felt.

1680
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,370
I asked myself, "What made me come here?"

1681
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:43,300
I really thought about a lot of things.

1682
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,710
Ji Yeon has no intension to reunite.

1683
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,409
- I think Ji Yeon...
- She even scares me.

1684
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,279
loved him without regret.

1685
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,449
I think she thinks so.

1686
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:54,409
So she doesn't regret anything now.

1687
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:59,089
But since Woo Jin thinks he wasn't good enough,

1688
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,549
he has lingering feelings.

1689
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,159
But Ji Yeon is showing him...

1690
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,689
that she's determined.

1691
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:05,229
It can be better for him.

1692
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:06,760
- She's saying it clearly.
- I know.

1693
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,340
(Knocking)

1694
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,140
Is he in the bathroom?

1695
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
(Just in time, Won Kyu leaves the room.)

1696
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:38,130
Come with me.

1697
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,830
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1698
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,630
Check if it's thawed.

1699
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:49,540
I guess it's being thawed.

1700
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,110
It's not thawed yet?

1701
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:53,410
Not yet.

1702
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,240
There's Woo Jin.

1703
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:59,910
(She doesn't care.)

1704
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,280
(She can see Woo Jin in the mirrors everywhere.)

1705
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,549
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

1706
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:08,690
I don't think this is working.

1707
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,229
(Their conversation is heard faintly, and it bothers him.)

1708
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,490
What is it?

1709
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,300
- If we do this...
- Yes.

1710
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:20,730
For example, it will be like this.

1711
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,140
Then we can do this.

1712
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,610
(Sighing)

1713
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,750
Okay.

1714
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,060
- Woo Jin...
- Woo Jin is upstairs, right?

1715
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,060
Shall we call Woo Jin?

1716
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,199
I'm not sure who's in. We need to call someone.

1717
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,370
Let's go upstairs. There's no one here.

1718
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,140
Sleeping.

1719
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:04,180
(Heading towards where Woo Jin is)

1720
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,920
- May I come in?
- Yes, of course.

1721
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,130
(Two people who bother him came together.)

1722
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:20,160
Thank you.

1723
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,100
- What is it?
- Just because.

1724
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,870
Have a seat.

1725
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,740
We have only two chairs.

1726
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,080
After he managed to go upstairs.

1727
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,079
- That's strange.
- Won Kyu has no idea...

1728
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,149
and came to Woo Jin thinking he's caring for him.

1729
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,720
He must be feeling so uncomfortable.

1730
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,990
It's nicer here in the afternoon.

1731
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,040
Aren't you hungry?

1732
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,669
I had a meal earlier.

1733
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,910
I guess you didn't have lunch.

1734
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:11,779
Why are you using honorifics to me...

1735
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,010
- again?
- I forgot.

1736
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,620
I'm using honorifics out of habit.

1737
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:27,029
(While they're feeling awkward, Yoo Sik arrives just in time.)

1738
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:28,800
- Yoo Sik?
- I'll go and see.

1739
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:39,710
How is it going to be? It will be all right, I guess.

1740
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,879
If it doesn't taste good, let's tell them three of us cooked it.

1741
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:43,980
If it doesn't taste good?

1742
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,880
Do you want to pass the buck to him too?

1743
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:48,699
If it doesn't taste good, I'll tell them you cooked it.

1744
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,418
You know,

1745
01:29:51,033 --> 01:29:52,533
I mean you, Won Kyu.

1746
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,590
If it tastes good, I'll tell them we cooked it together.

1747
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,160
- Yes, I'll shoulder the burden.
- Okay.

1748
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,830
Oh, my goodness.

1749
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,870
Gosh, I'm annoyed.

1750
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,600
Who made the sauce?

1751
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,440
- Together.
- Together?

1752
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,140
This is irritating.

1753
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,410
Seriously.

1754
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,390
What's wrong with you?

1755
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:29,189
(Yoo Sik joins them in the living room.)

1756
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,419
Shall we go grocery shopping?

1757
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,760
- I'd love to.
- Whatever works for you.

1758
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:35,960
- Hi.
- What are these?

1759
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,430
- Excuse me?
- What are these?

1760
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,600
Yoo Sik bought them.

1761
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:42,300
- You can drink it.
- Thank you.

1762
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:49,910
I feel hungry.

1763
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,480
Haven't you had a meal today?

1764
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,709
No.

1765
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:56,080
- We cooked stir-fried spicy pork.
- I saw it.

1766
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,520
I love stir-fried spicy pork.

1767
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:02,119
I love having home-cooked meals at a restaurant.

1768
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,160
Me too.

1769
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:05,930
I'll go to my room and come back soon.

1770
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,130
Okay.

1771
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,200
We were thinking...

1772
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:15,369
that three of us can go grocery shopping or...

1773
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,070
I want to go grocery shopping too.

1774
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:21,510
When Yoo Sik is ready,

1775
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,380
we can leave right away.

1776
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,480
I'll go and get ready quickly.

1777
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,220
All right.

1778
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:36,360
Are we taking this?

1779
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,959
- I think so.
- Should I drive?

1780
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,329
I'll drive.

1781
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:40,390
Will that be okay?

1782
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,799
(Won Kyu sits in the driver's seat.)

1783
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,600
(Ji Yeon sits in the passenger seat.)

1784
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,770
The smell of meat.

1785
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,400
Right. It would be important to get rid of that smell.

1786
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,469
Won Kyu drove,

1787
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:55,939
and my ex sat next to him.

1788
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:59,710
It didn't feel good to see that from behind.

1789
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,580
It kept bothering me.

1790
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:12,590
(It's silent in the car.)

1791
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,370
I felt conflicted.

1792
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:24,139
My ex surely knew that I was interested...

1793
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,370
in Won Kyu.

1794
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:27,670
That really bothered me.

1795
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:30,510
So I barely talked.

1796
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,780
(It's rush hour, so the traffic is also stressful.)

1797
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:37,380
Are the women all sleeping?

1798
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:38,849
(Yoo Sik broke the silence.)

1799
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:41,419
Yun Nyeong went out...

1800
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:43,860
because she had plans.

1801
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:45,959
- What about Min Kyung?
- Min Kyung...

1802
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,799
also went out because she had plans.

1803
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,600
Where has everyone headed so early in the morning?

1804
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:53,000
I know, right?

1805
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,499
You went out the most.

1806
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,039
- That's right.
- In the morning,

1807
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,299
you went out the most.

1808
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,369
(Ji Yeon went out the most with Won Kyu.)

1809
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:02,010
I should stay home from now on.

1810
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,850
He'll go out tomorrow again.

1811
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:10,980
You'll plan a 4-day trip as a date...

1812
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:12,890
and use all those days alone.

1813
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:18,930
(He can't comfortably laugh at Yoo Sik's joke.)

1814
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,800
My worry is,

1815
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,959
the men and the women...

1816
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,500
have become very close to each other now.

1817
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:30,140
Someone would surely have feelings for someone,

1818
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,070
and when that's revealed...

1819
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,939
- If they overlap?
- When they overlap,

1820
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,280
or when it's the ex...

1821
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:41,180
That wouldn't feel good either.

1822
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:52,260
(They arrived at the supermarket amid an awkward atmosphere.)

1823
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,030
- Two?
- Two.

1824
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:59,830
Hello.

1825
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:01,470
Should we get some fruit?

1826
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,969
- Fruit.
- Should we get some fruit?

1827
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,170
Do we not have fruit?

1828
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,469
- Only a little.
- We have apples.

1829
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,610
- Apples?
- Apples.

1830
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:09,279
We're almost out of crushed garlic.

1831
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,780
We used all the crushed garlic.

1832
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,310
We have almost no onions.

1833
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,949
Would people eat cherries?

1834
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:17,050
- Cherries are nice.
- There are many people.

1835
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,049
- There are many people.
- There are many people.

1836
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,219
(Ji Yeon left the two and went to Yoo Sik.)

1837
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,119
- Who likes blueberries?
- Me.

1838
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,220
Me too.

1839
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,490
I think olive oil would be over there.

1840
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:28,700
Would it be there?

1841
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,269
- I'll bring it.
- We should get the cup noodles.

1842
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,630
(They move separately from them.)

1843
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,799
We had to take two carts.

1844
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,509
I was concerned about my ex...

1845
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:40,970
to shop with him,

1846
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:43,680
and it felt uncomfortable...

1847
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,079
to shop with my ex.

1848
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,150
So I shopped with Yoo Sik,

1849
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:50,220
and let Won Kyu and Woo Jin to shop together.

1850
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:53,650
(The Pyeongchang-dong House is left in silence.)

1851
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,220
(Moving)

1852
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,510
(5:00pm, Ji Hyeon wakes up.)

1853
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,010
What?

1854
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,420
Amazing.

1855
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,349
What are these?

1856
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:27,090
(She found the coffee and dessert Yoo Sik brought.)

1857
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:38,500
(She instinctively starts looking for Yoo Sik.)

1858
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:46,740
(Knocking)

1859
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:48,680
(Knocking)

1860
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,710
(There's no one inside.)

1861
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:20,570
I talked in Won Kyu's room,

1862
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:22,880
and I knew which bed he used.

1863
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:26,780
So I left a letter by Yoo Sik's bed.

1864
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:29,749
I pulled him more...

1865
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,280
to give him assurance.

1866
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:38,730
(Ji Hyeon expresses her feelings to Yoo Sik again today.)

1867
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:41,660
(The grocery team comes back at that time.)

1868
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,359
Did you do the groceries?

1869
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

1870
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:47,030
- The 2 of you?
- No, we were 4.

1871
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:48,570
Really? Again?

1872
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:49,732
Yes.

1873
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,310
There were more things that were lacking.

1874
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:55,609
You bought this, right?

1875
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:56,610
It was Won Kyu.

1876
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:00,150
- Really?
- Yoo Sik bought all of these.

1877
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:02,250
Why are you lying?

1878
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,579
- He's shy.
- Kyu bought them.

1879
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,819
Why are you lying?

1880
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,420
- Yoo Sik bought them.
- Right.

1881
01:37:09,293 --> 01:37:10,353
Thank you.

1882
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,070
(Glancing)

1883
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:27,339
It's funny how you can hear their eyes roll.

1884
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,640
- Right.
- You can see it now.

1885
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,879
- You can start seeing it.
- You can see it now.

1886
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,010
The radar.

1887
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:35,149
You know there's a fridge down there, right?

1888
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,349
- Yes.
- Shall we take some beer there?

1889
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:38,350
That's nice.

1890
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,350
Where is the instant rice?

1891
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,960
The ones we bought are there.

1892
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,230
Yoo Sik. Did you have fun?

1893
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:53,530
Yes. Earlier...

1894
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:55,899
We came back sooner than we thought.

1895
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:56,969
Really?

1896
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,710
I was caught as soon as I came back.

1897
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,039
Look next to your bed.

1898
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,879
- What?
- Look next to the bed.

1899
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,080
Okay.

1900
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:31,100
(Yoo Sik takes the note and heads to the bathroom.)

1901
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:37,579
It said, "Let's go on a date..."

1902
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:38,850
"and eat something tasty on Friday."

1903
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:43,580
I liked that she showed interest in me.

1904
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:51,459
(I'm writing a letter because I might not get to say this...)

1905
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,859
(when there are many people around!)

1906
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,460
(Take me to a famous restaurant on Friday. Let's go on a date!)

1907
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:58,770
(They're preparing a meal in the kitchen.)

1908
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,209
Do you cook at home?

1909
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,270
No.

1910
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:09,610
You're cooking here.

1911
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,209
- Me?
- Yes.

1912
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:12,510
I never cooked.

1913
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:16,320
For people who don't cook,

1914
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:18,790
- it's not easy.
- It's not easy.

1915
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:20,620
It's not easy for me now.

1916
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,359
Hello.

1917
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,789
Did you sleep well?

1918
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:29,029
Yes. I slept a little.

1919
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:30,729
- Did you eat?
- Did you eat?

1920
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:32,269
- Dinner.
- Aren't you hungry?

1921
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,540
I was going to eat with Ji Hyeon.

1922
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:37,540
- Amazing.
- We got them.

1923
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,710
What is this?

1924
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:42,579
That's chamomile tea.

1925
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:44,209
Someone said they drink that. Who was it?

1926
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,710
- Really?
- Yes.

1927
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:50,880
I can't drink coffee so well.

1928
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:54,889
When I dated with Yoo Sik the previous day,

1929
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:57,920
I drank chamomile tea.

1930
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:02,300
I don't know if he bought that because he remembered...

1931
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:04,730
what I drank that day.

1932
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:08,129
But I thought maybe...

1933
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:10,900
he kept that in mind.

1934
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,710
This is amazing.

1935
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:25,080
It's okay.

1936
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,850
It's really okay.

1937
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:29,090
It's okay.

1938
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:32,990
(He sees them together and his attention goes there.)

1939
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,430
I think we can serve this.

1940
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:37,530
I think it's too little.

1941
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,730
We have more.

1942
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:43,670
You have to eat two spoons of rice for one piece.

1943
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:48,709
We put some vegetables, so it's...

1944
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,509
- Yes. We put some vegetables.
- Since we put them...

1945
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:52,010
- It became much better.
- It became better.

1946
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,379
I can't help but feel bad.

1947
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:56,520
Of course, I feel bad.

1948
01:40:58,650 --> 01:40:59,850
I kept noticing them.

1949
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,690
I see them do things together.

1950
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,960
Couldn't they keep it low in front of me?

1951
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:09,830
Judging by how they're behaving,

1952
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,030
I don't think they care about me.

1953
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:16,039
(Dinner is ready amid the subtle tension.)

1954
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,199
- Let's eat.
- Come...

1955
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,340
- for dinner.
- Okay.

1956
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,440
Can we drink any of these drinks?

1957
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,140
- Yes.
- That's chamomile.

1958
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,550
- Can I drink this?
- Yes.

1959
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:29,480
Will you have yogurt?

1960
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:31,180
- Yes.
- Shall we?

1961
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,520
Enjoy your meal.

1962
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,859
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

1963
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:37,890
Enjoy your meal.

1964
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,890
Should I taste it?

1965
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:44,200
- Yes. Try it.
- I'll evaluate it objectively.

1966
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:46,269
- Okay.
- I'll give you...

1967
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:47,500
the Professor Foodie's evaluation.

1968
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,939
I'm so nervous.

1969
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,870
- Why?
- About what score you'll give.

1970
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:58,180
(He reacts as soon as he eats it.)

1971
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,380
It's nice, right?

1972
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,910
- Correct.
- Correct.

1973
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:03,220
It's really good.

1974
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:04,619
It's a relief.

1975
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:07,089
I made the first sauce,

1976
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:08,619
made it again the second time,

1977
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,560
- and the third.
- really?

1978
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,289
Ji Yeon was good...

1979
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:16,600
at seasoning it.

1980
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,429
- It's...
- She just went with her feeling.

1981
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:20,899
Really? You seasoned it?

1982
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,039
- I did it. Ji Yeon.
- Ji Yeon.

1983
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,200
I'm sorry.

1984
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,910
It's funny.

1985
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,710
Why aren't you eating?

1986
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,420
You made it.

1987
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,020
I ate a lot at lunch.

1988
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:42,090
I'll get that...

1989
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,660
- I see.
- That's right.

1990
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,189
I enjoyed the food.

1991
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:48,659
I'll wash the dishes.

1992
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,329
Let's do it together.

1993
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,600
(Dinner ended while someone hid his uncomfortable feelings.)

1994
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,669
Woo Jin is very bothered.

1995
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,229
- He is.
- He's conflicted.

1996
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:57,439
It wouldn't matter that she has no feelings left,

1997
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,369
but losing to the people...

1998
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:01,709
who she met for five days would make him angry.

1999
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,379
He doesn't understand that she developed feelings...

2000
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,579
- only after five days.
- Right.

2001
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,479
"Did the time she spent with me lose to these five days?"

2002
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,779
- That's right.
- What makes you more mad...

2003
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:08,809
as a man...

2004
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:11,949
is that Woo Jin spoke politely to him unlike before.

2005
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,249
"Really?"

2006
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:15,050
"Why are you suddenly speaking politely to me?"

2007
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:16,859
That indicates that he's already...

2008
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,859
- intimidated.
- Right.

2009
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,159
That would make him mad.

2010
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,759
To Woo Jin, Won Kyu has become an uncomfortable person.

2011
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,599
- Right.
- He suddenly spoke politely.

2012
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,306
That was out of instinct.

2013
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,238
Yes.

2014
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,740
(Ji Yeon came to Won Kyu.)

2015
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:37,640
Is there anything else that improves your stamina?

2016
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:40,150
- You want to improve your stamina?
- Yes.

2017
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:42,050
- What do you want to do?
- Just...

2018
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:44,920
What are you going to do with your improved stamina?

2019
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,750
Are there more supplements?

2020
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,590
It's not for stamina...

2021
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,030
Can I sit here?

2022
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,830
Yoo Sik will be here.

2023
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:02,440
He was brushing his teeth.

2024
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,739
He'd come back.

2025
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:07,170
Then could you come to my room?

2026
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:08,940
Okay.

2027
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:21,320
(She quickly makes her bed.)

2028
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,690
(Won Kyu gets the supplements for Ji Yeon.)

2029
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,900
Where are you going?

2030
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,899
(It's an awkward confrontation.)

2031
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,600
I'm not going anywhere.

2032
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,600
Why? I'm not going.

2033
01:44:38,576 --> 01:44:40,076
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

2034
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:44,210
(He feels thirsty.)

2035
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,680
(Ji Yeon is watching from her room.)

2036
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,150
What did you do? Did you clean?

2037
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:57,260
Yes. I took out the trash.

2038
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:00,730
(He keeps the supplements for Ji Yeon...)

2039
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:04,000
(in the corner.)

2040
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:18,080
I think I should stay with Yoo Sik for a bit.

2041
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,350
Why?

2042
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:21,209
Hang out with me.

2043
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:22,349
A bit later.

2044
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:24,950
Hang out with me. Just sneak out.

2045
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,450
When will you come?

2046
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:28,649
Later at night.

2047
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:31,020
Later at night?

2048
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,290
Okay.

2049
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,360
- They're almost in a relationship.
- She's very active.

2050
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,799
She's very active.

2051
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,569
- Aren't they dating?
- I know.

2052
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:43,599
- They have something between them.
- It's almost...

2053
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,369
- It's like a workplace romance.
- Yes.

2054
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:47,810
They're really enjoying EXchange well.

2055
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:02,420
Then...

2056
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,190
I should talk now.

2057
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,599
What's important is...

2058
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,059
- Talking about family.
- Talking about family.

2059
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,500
- The family talk...
- That can't be helped.

2060
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:22,370
- Is that alcohol?
- Yes.

2061
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:27,479
Where is the kitchen towel?

2062
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,650
Here.

2063
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:44,500
(Ji Yeon and Woo Jin quietly move somewhere else.)

2064
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:57,609
Are you not feeling cold?

2065
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:58,710
- Should I get you something?
- No.

2066
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:09,960
I felt like I was being selfish...

2067
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:11,290
with you.

2068
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:18,760
I didn't say many things when we broke up.

2069
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:25,170
Then let me ask you. Why...

2070
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,810
We did make up the previous day.

2071
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,080
Was that not a make up to you?

2072
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:35,850
I don't think it was.

2073
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:40,550
I spent a lot of time until I said that.

2074
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:45,020
It was just...

2075
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:50,900
Anyway, I thought we worked it out well.

2076
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:54,629
- And...
- What you said then...

2077
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:57,000
wasn't a solution. You said you would put in an effort.

2078
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,327
- You said...
- Did you see me put in an effort?

2079
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,349
I said I would put in an effort. Did you wait to see me do that?

2080
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:08,249
The way I saw it, that was...

2081
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,080
What did you see? It was only a day.

2082
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:11,650
It wasn't even a day.

2083
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,389
We had fun that day,

2084
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:16,960
and you called me the next day to say we should break up.

2085
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:19,290
What did you expect from me?

2086
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:23,429
Shouldn't you have given me some time...

2087
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,460
to show you my efforts?

2088
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,199
You should have watched me.

2089
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,969
(Woo Jin can't understand how the relationship ended...)

2090
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,770
(without getting the time to make an effort.)

2091
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,480
What you said to me...

2092
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:41,150
It didn't feel like you had bad intentions.

2093
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:42,350
It felt more like a whine.

2094
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:44,920
How did that feel like a whine?

2095
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,020
Until I brought myself to say that to you,

2096
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,490
I thought about it so many times.

2097
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:55,230
I said that once after stopping myself so many times.

2098
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,430
- Was it because I was sensitive?
- It may have...

2099
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:04,270
come across as a whine to you, but for me,

2100
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:06,940
I just said that once...

2101
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,910
after holding back the things I was upset about.

2102
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,780
I'm sorry.

2103
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:21,520
I didn't know.

2104
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:28,160
You also made me...

2105
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:32,560
lonely when we were together.

2106
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,900
I was very lonely when we were together.

2107
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:20,210
That's how I feel.

2108
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:24,279
I have no intention...

2109
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,720
of getting back with you.

2110
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:36,630
(She drew a line again and ended the conversation.)

2111
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:43,640
I'm someone with a very strong pride.

2112
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:50,280
Thinking about getting back with my ex...

2113
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:53,210
while knowing she has no intention of doing that...

2114
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,880
honestly hurt my pride so much.

2115
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,589
I don't know.

2116
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:03,690
I think I'm suppressing some things.

2117
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:18,900
If she felt lonely while meeting him,

2118
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,869
- doesn't that end things?
- Right.

2119
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:23,639
That's the reason they broke up.

2120
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,979
Ji Yeon left this much,

2121
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:27,709
and I think that was because she felt sorry...

2122
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:29,619
that she said it over a call.

2123
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:31,120
- Right.
- I think she ended it...

2124
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,820
after saying it now.

2125
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,719
But from Woo Jin's perspective, he said he'd put in an effort,

2126
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:38,619
but she suddenly broke up with him the next day.

2127
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,890
It would have been very...

2128
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,410
He could feel it's unfair.

2129
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,760
Why aren't the people coming?

2130
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:46,696
I know.

2131
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:50,799
- Shall we play this again?
- Yes.

2132
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,535
Would You Rather?

2133
01:51:55,370 --> 01:51:56,880
Why are you suddenly silent?

2134
01:51:59,010 --> 01:52:00,410
- I don't know.
- Ji Hyeon.

2135
01:52:02,269 --> 01:52:03,779
The thing is...

2136
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,714
you don't know who is whose ex.

2137
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:10,190
Things you do without realizing could be...

2138
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:13,330
hurtful to the other.

2139
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,430
You know what I mean, right?

2140
01:52:15,712 --> 01:52:16,740
What does it matter?

2141
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:17,989
Really?

2142
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,999
In that case, you shouldn't have come here. You should...

2143
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,130
have called the person personally to get back together.

2144
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,570
Why would you be here?

2145
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:26,440
Didn't they also come to meet other people?

2146
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:29,539
That may not be the case.

2147
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:30,679
There would be many reasons.

2148
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,780
- But objectively, I think...
- Right.

2149
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,249
If they wanted to get back together, they should have done it personally.

2150
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,480
Why come here to get back together?

2151
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:39,249
(Baek Hyun's response makes her think.)

2152
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:40,620
Was I too...

2153
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,090
No. I...

2154
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:47,429
(Ji Yeon came back after clearing her mind alone.)

2155
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:48,960
If...

2156
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:51,560
(Ji Yeon sits next to Won Kyu.)

2157
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:53,900
- Did you sleep?
- Yes.

2158
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:57,200
If you're...

2159
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,310
This.

2160
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,040
- Should I use it?
- Yes.

2161
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:09,749
(They can see their ex...)

2162
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:13,050
(and their ex's new person.)

2163
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:24,600
(EXchange 4)

2164
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,530
How do you about feel staying here?

2165
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:28,930
It's not that comfortable.

2166
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:30,740
What about you, Ji Yeon?

2167
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:32,370
I don't feel uncomfortable at all.

2168
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:35,470
Do you want your ex to feel the same?

2169
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:38,140
I won't mind my ex,

2170
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:42,009
so I want my ex not to mind about me.

2171
01:53:42,010 --> 01:53:44,420
(I want him to ignore me.)

2172
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:46,490
Are you happy today?

2173
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:49,320
- Why?
- You look happy.

2174
01:53:49,501 --> 01:53:51,120
I'm always happy.

2175
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:55,230
It felt like he wasn't bothered at all.

2176
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:58,430
It made me so mad.

2177
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:01,230
It's so annoying.

2178
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,530
Are you having fun?

2179
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,040
You look comfortable. It's as if you're at home.

2180
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,385
Hold on.
