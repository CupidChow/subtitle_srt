1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,010
(EXchange 4)

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,749
Just like last week,

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,989
Yoon Su will be joining us this week.

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,820
(Actor Nam Yoon Su)

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,219
What did you all think about the first episode...

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,259
of EXchange 4?

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,759
First of all, I'm so excited.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,759
- It seemed all of them had...
- Right.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,859
- such intense relationships.
- Exactly.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,829
I found myself watching the episode while holding my breath.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,470
- I love this season's participants.
- Me too.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,899
First off, everyone looked...

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,469
- so good-looking and perfect.
- Right? Yes.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,740
They were so good at keeping a straight face.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,479
- It actually made me more curious.
- Right.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,879
In fact, it was more entertaining...

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,749
because they were so good at keeping a straight face.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,209
Min Kyung directly asked him out on a date...

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,419
at the end of the first episode.

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,319
More women will ask Baek Hyun out on a date, right?

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,189
- Yes, definitely.
- Right?

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,419
My guess is that everyone will pick him for the date.

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,860
Everyone?

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,989
- I'm done.
- Are you done?

25
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,999
Yes.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,599
- I'm going.
- See you.

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,300
(Sighing)

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,970
- You have to turn around.
- Okay.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,939
- No one can know.
- Right. I'll go over there.

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,970
Come here.

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,809
You came back pretty fast.

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,380
- Right. I was able...
- I see.

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,449
- to find him quite quickly.
- Really?

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,780
My gosh.

35
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,049
If you enter a room and don't see the one you want,

36
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,319
you have to come out, right?

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,660
Right.

38
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,730
Oh, no. What will I do? This is crazy.

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,100
(Ji Hyeon is the second one to go.)

40
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,640
(Peeking in)

41
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,669
- Wait. In that room...
- Baek Hyun is in it.

42
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,870
"Will you go out on a date with me?"

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
(Baek Hyun is putting away his belongings.)

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,420
I see.

45
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,590
(Flustered)

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,159
- No?
- It wasn't him.

47
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,290
- She doesn't want him.
- Who then?

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,659
Or she could've seen her ex when she opened the door.

49
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,630
- Right. He could be her ex.
- Yes.

50
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,340
(It's quite embarrassing.)

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,780
(Getting embarrassed for the 2nd time)

52
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,660
Seriously. I spent the whole day walking around the house.

53
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,859
(The other two guys are outside.)

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,770
(Won Kyu, Yoo Sik)

55
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,710
(Ji Hyeon turns around.)

56
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,109
I heard the door open. So I wondered, "Will I..."

57
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,450
"get a vote?"

58
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,280
But no one came to me even though I waited.

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,250
So I thought no one was coming.

60
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,920
I sat there...

61
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,360
and kept zoning out.

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,899
Oh, no. Again?

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,069
It happened twice.

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,470
He's an attractive guy.

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,470
(After roaming the house, she comes back to the 4th floor.)

66
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,050
- Hello.
- I see. Hello.

67
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,520
Go out on a date with me.

68
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,050
I was nervous.

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,820
So I couldn't ask him out confidently.

70
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,390
I whispered to him.

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,460
I gave him this look, "Go on a date with me."

72
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
I came back after giving him this signal.

73
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,530
Yoo Sik...

74
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,970
He's the one I want to talk to the most and am curious about.

75
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,279
I keep seeing her.

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,580
When we were eating,

77
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,210
she was sitting in front of me.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
I was curious about her.

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,780
I'll get going.

80
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,390
Bye.

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,360
I was grateful that she came to me.

82
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,489
- Yoo Sik?
- She chose Yoo Sik.

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,529
He must have butterflies.

84
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,059
I get the feeling that...

85
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,930
Yoo Sik and Ji Hyeon might have a similar personality.

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm sorry I took so long.

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,269
It's okay. Go ahead.

88
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,539
Gosh, that was so tough.

89
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,669
- Go ahead.
- The guys are hiding quite well.

90
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,769
- They're hiding well?
- Seriously.

91
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,509
- Was it hard to find?
- I'm serious.

92
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,810
- Gosh, come on.
- That's not good.

93
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,409
That's crazy. I can't wait.

94
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,450
Did you know right away who you wanted?

95
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,519
- Or did you have to think about it?
- I didn't know right away.

96
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,920
- You had to think about it?
- I had to think about it.

97
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,420
But I picked the guy I was the most curious about.

98
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,819
- "The most curious about?" - I chose the one...

99
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,960
- I was the most curious about.
- Really?

100
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,770
I wonder who it is.

101
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,970
(How many people do you think will choose Yoo Sik?)

102
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,610
I think there must be more than two people.

103
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,280
My guess is that at least two people asked him out.

104
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,890
(She's worried as she feels insecure.)

105
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,120
(Ji Yeon is the third one to go.)

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,800
(Woo Jin is now in the kitchen.)

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,360
(Glancing)

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,500
(Ji Yeon just walks past him.)

109
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,700
- He can hear her footsteps.
- Yes!

110
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,309
I bet he's focused on the sound.

111
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,239
It's more embarrassing that...

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,510
- he has to pretend to be okay.
- Right.

113
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
- It's embarrassing for the guys.
- Right.

114
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,790
(She visits Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room.)

115
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,120
What?

116
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,290
Where is he?

117
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,000
(She walks past Woo Jin again.)

118
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,140
(She arrives on the 4th floor where Baek Hyun and Yoo Sik are.)

119
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,110
Where is he?

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,680
Wait.

121
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Where is he?

122
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,380
(His room somehow turns into a popular place to visit.)

123
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,850
(Coincidentally, the guy Ji Yeon wants is also outside.)

124
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,360
Honestly, I thought no one would want me.

125
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,380
Let's go on a date tomorrow.

126
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,790
- Okay. I got it.
- Okay.

127
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,660
It was unexpected.

128
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,800
I was relieved and grateful.

129
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,500
But she went back in so quickly after asking me out.

130
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,100
That's how it felt.

131
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,339
After asking him out right away,

132
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,610
I thought I should go back in. So I rushed back in...

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,480
after talking to him.

134
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,780
Appearance-wise, when I saw him for the first time...

135
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,180
(Won Kyu walking into the house for the first time)

136
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,859
I was drawn to him because he was the type...

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,060
I usually go for.

138
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,860
When I heard him talk, it made me feel...

139
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,399
I wanted to get to know him better.

140
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,000
So when we were having dinner,

141
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,900
I sat next to him on purpose.

142
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,240
(Ji Yeon was getting close to Won Kyu in her own way.)

143
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,080
(Ji Yeon picks Won Kyu for her date.)

144
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,720
- Right.
- Okay.

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,289
- They look good together.
- Yes.

146
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,589
- They look good together.
- Yes.

147
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,719
- They do.
- They're a nice match.

148
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,219
He seems relieved.

149
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,729
- Remember the first episode?
- Yes.

150
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,359
When Won Kyu cried,

151
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,299
the look on Ji Yeon's face...

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,099
- It was the look she had...
- "He's my type."

153
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,099
- when she saw her type.
- I guess so.

154
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,769
- Just like Yoon Su...
- It was about the way he cried.

155
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,839
- That must've been it.
- He cried in an attractive way.

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,399
- Some women are drawn to this type.
- Right!

157
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,740
Indeed!

158
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,810
- I'm rooting for them.
- Yes.

159
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,609
- I took so long, right?
- Are you done? No, it's okay.

160
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,749
I'll go now.

161
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,920
My gosh.

162
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,120
They were hiding so well.

163
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,960
- Did you have to think for long?
- No.

164
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,690
- Really?
- Yes.

165
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,360
(Yun Nyeong is the last one to go.)

166
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,369
I thought a lot about whom I should pick...

167
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,870
for my first date.

168
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,339
But I wanted to pick the guy who left the strongest impression...

169
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,270
on me. That's what I decided to do.

170
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,810
(Knocking)

171
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,850
May I enter?

172
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,090
(She's even checking the bathroom.)

173
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,460
- The bathroom too?
- The bathroom too?

174
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,789
She's so innocent.

175
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,129
"May I enter?"

176
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,429
"May I enter?"

177
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,299
"No! You can't come in."

178
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
What would she have done then?

179
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,110
(Do you want to go on a date with me?)

180
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
- My gosh! That was...
- This is crazy.

181
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,190
- My gosh! That was...
- This is crazy.

182
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,289
- They all picked different guys!
- My gosh! That was...

183
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,689
(All 4 of them chose someone different for their date.)

184
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,429
- They make a good couple.
- I can't believe this happened.

185
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,059
- How is it possible not to overlap?
- This is great.

186
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,899
- The combination is great.
- Yes.

187
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,769
I wondered if he was her ex.

188
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,869
- Right.
- She was just drawn to him.

189
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,940
- She was.
- Yes.

190
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,069
How come none of their choices overlapped?

191
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,210
Hold on.

192
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,680
It felt great.

193
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,150
(Why do you think Yun Nyeong chose you?)

194
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,220
Because I cooked delicious doenjang stew?

195
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,120
It seemed she was a foodie.

196
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,089
His doenjang stew was really tasty.

197
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,329
And I really wanted a chance to talk to him.

198
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,489
He was good at carrying...

199
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,229
on a conversation while meeting my eyes.

200
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,659
That made me think that...

201
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,370
I might have an easier time getting to know him on a date.

202
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,270
So I picked him.

203
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,069
(Do you think you're the only one who chose Woo Jin?)

204
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,569
Well, I'm not sure.

205
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,379
But I think Min Kyung might have chosen him too.

206
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,250
She might have developed a bond with him while cooking.

207
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,020
But despite that,

208
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,620
I still felt confident.

209
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,459
(The women, filled with worry and anticipation,)

210
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,660
(are done asking men out on a date.)

211
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,730
(Kwak Min Kyung)

212
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,739
(Sung Baek Hyun)

213
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,669
(Park Ji Hyeon)

214
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,639
(Cho Yoo Sik)

215
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,609
(Choi Yun Nyeong)

216
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,509
(Kim Woo Jin)

217
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,349
(Hong Ji Yeon)

218
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,180
(Jung Won Kyu)

219
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,860
(EXchange 4)

220
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,740
(Episode 2: A Breakup Locked in a Closet)

221
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,680
- Why all of a sudden...
- Right. After this, the mood...

222
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,350
- Right.
- has gotten more awkward.

223
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,850
I'm really bad with names.

224
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,389
I only remember your name.

225
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,920
- Really?
- What's my name?

226
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,929
- Se Hyun?
- Se Hyun?

227
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,160
- Se Hyun?
- What...

228
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,399
- Se Hyun?
- There's no one by that name.

229
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
- Who's Se Hyun?
- What is this, Hyun Baek?

230
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,670
- Se Hyun?
- That's funny.

231
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,800
Woo Jin. Yoo Sik.

232
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,109
- And...
- Cho.

233
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,369
Cho Yoo Sik.

234
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,180
(The date for Ji Yeon and Won Kyu has been arranged.)

235
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,549
I was happy that I could go on a date...

236
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,750
with Won Kyu.

237
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,450
I couldn't wait to go on a date with him...

238
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,819
and get to know him at once.

239
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,260
I want to talk to him more.

240
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,760
No.

241
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,660
- I shouldn't have done that.
- Look.

242
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,770
Was it Won Sik?

243
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,539
(He unexpectedly ends up with many names.)

244
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,640
He must be drunk.

245
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,039
- He asked if my name was Se Hyun.
- After Se Hyun...

246
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
The next one was Won Sik.

247
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,239
At least, my guess was close.

248
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,110
(The date for Yun Nyeong and Woo Jin has been arranged.)

249
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,610
I got the text that my date with Woo Jin...

250
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,880
had been arranged.

251
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,750
When I got the text message,

252
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,490
he was sitting right next to me.

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,020
It felt...

254
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,630
so awkward.

255
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,029
But it felt great.

256
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,730
It was an awkward moment, but it still felt good.

257
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,029
Actually, I wondered if he had chosen me...

258
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,970
or if I was the only one who picked him.

259
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,169
These thoughts crossed my mind.

260
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,570
I was really curious.

261
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,079
- It was so unexpected.
- Right.

262
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,309
- Right.
- Yes.

263
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,749
- She doesn't know.
- I bet everyone thought about that.

264
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,379
But anyway, everyone must feel good.

265
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,889
They must feel that the guys chose them among other options.

266
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,059
- Right.
- That must make them feel great.

267
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,620
It must feel more special, thinking they were chosen.

268
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,859
- Will you give us chocolates?
- Do you like them?

269
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,399
- Have some.
- I don't like jelly.

270
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,429
(The date for Min Kyung and Baek Hyun has been arranged.)

271
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,770
- He's firm.
- Yes.

272
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,099
I got the text message that my date was arranged.

273
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,140
Getting the news...

274
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,870
made me happy.

275
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,180
I guess a lot of people like sweets.

276
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,879
- I like sweets.
- Really?

277
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,979
- And so does he.
- Yes.

278
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,620
- I love sweets too.
- Do you like sweets?

279
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,880
- Do you like chocolate?
- Baek Hyun likes them.

280
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,150
- I like chocolate.
- Right.

281
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,500
(The date for Ji Hyeon and Yoo Sik has been arranged.)

282
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,530
It felt great.

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,100
It made my heart flutter.

284
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,140
Right now, we don't know anything about each other other than names.

285
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,470
So I'm quite curious...

286
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,080
about his personality...

287
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,950
and how he behaves on dates.

288
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,749
- Does anyone want beer?
- Pardon?

289
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,150
- More beer?
- Sounds good.

290
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,920
I'll get them for you.

291
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,260
Well,

292
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,629
- I wasn't...
- Last time...

293
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,960
- We should go to sleep early today.
- Sounds good.

294
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,399
Thank you.

295
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,470
What time are you all waking up tomorrow?

296
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,869
- Nothing's set.
- Really?

297
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,170
I guess it's just up to us.

298
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,010
Do you have a window in the room?

299
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,379
On the second floor?

300
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,850
- Our...
- In the first-floor room.

301
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,379
- Is there a window?
- A window...

302
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,849
- There's no window.
- On the bottom...

303
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,750
- Bottom?
- The room on the lower floor.

304
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,619
Bottom? That doesn't sound right.

305
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,420
- For ondol, that's the best spot.
- Really?

306
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,220
- When we were talking earlier...
- Let's settle this.

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,459
- I can't let this go on.
- Downstairs Residents sound good.

308
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,230
- Are we on the fourth floor?
- Downstairs Residents?

309
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,729
How come you're not saying anything?

310
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,500
- Isn't that a nice nickname?
- You think so?

311
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,269
But the upside of your floor is...

312
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,369
you have a communal living room.

313
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,569
- A few steps up from our floor?
- Yes.

314
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,939
- You're drawing the line then?
- The bathroom too.

315
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,240
- Yes.
- We're not going to spare that?

316
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,679
Then should we be the only ones...

317
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,339
- using that space?
- How about the washing machine?

318
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,849
- But the fourth floor has...
- No.

319
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,150
- The terrace.
- Yes, terrace.

320
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,720
Will they do laundry there?

321
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,150
- That's tough.
- The terrace...

322
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,089
- So you guys want to use...
- Laundry...

323
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,860
the washer exclusively?

324
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
- No.
- That's too mean.

325
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,589
- You'll make our lives...
- Let's share everything.

326
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,159
- harder?
- Gosh, no.

327
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,230
- We were joking.
- Let's share everything.

328
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,529
- Of course.
- Downstairs Residents?

329
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,629
Upstairs Residents?

330
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,000
- Upstairs Residents.
- Upstairs Residents.

331
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,670
That kind of sounds like German. Upstairs Residents.

332
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,309
- Upstairs Residents.
- Downstairs Residents.

333
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,979
I think those are neat nicknames.

334
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,139
- Upstairs and Downstairs Residents?
- Yes.

335
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,209
Let's do that.

336
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,449
- Yes. I like them too.
- They're cute nicknames.

337
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,649
Hold on. We have to pick a name for our house too.

338
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,449
- We talked about that.
- Wasn't it Mountain Gym?

339
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,719
- Mountain Gym.
- Mountain Gym.

340
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,519
Upstairs Residents, Downstairs Residents, Mountain Gym.

341
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,989
I like Downstairs Residents. That's cute.

342
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,320
- Right? It's cute.
- Yes.

343
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,130
I think we got a text message.

344
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,339
(Welcome, everyone. Who made your heart flutter today?)

345
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,639
(Let them know via text.)

346
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,080
(Your text will be delivered anonymously.)

347
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,590
How about a toast?

348
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,620
Sure.

349
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,159
(They seem to crave alcohol on the first night for some reason.)

350
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,230
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

351
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,870
This is it.

352
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,570
It's starting now.

353
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,740
I'm on EXchange.

354
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,410
I must brace myself.

355
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,689
(Between an ex who feels familiar yet uncomfortable...)

356
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,930
(and someone new who feels unfamiliar yet exciting,)

357
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,470
(which way will their feelings turn to first?)

358
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,899
- It's been a while.
- They'll have to pick...

359
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,570
- their date for sure.
- I think so.

360
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,069
It might have been easy to pick...

361
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,269
- someone they were interested in.
- Right.

362
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,409
But having the option where they can pick their ex...

363
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,949
- This is...
- might make it difficult.

364
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,609
Their ex might be disappointed...

365
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,679
- if they send it to their date.
- Right.

366
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,119
If they send it to their ex, their date might be disappointed.

367
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,420
- Right.
- Right.

368
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,690
By the way, your false eyelashes...

369
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,690
- look so pretty today.
- Really?

370
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,160
Do they look pretty on me too?

371
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,700
- They look pretty.
- One of them fell off earlier.

372
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,370
Are you wearing false eyelashes too?

373
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,370
- They're natural.
- They look so pretty.

374
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,899
(They start talking about eyelashes all of a sudden.)

375
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,240
- You have such long eyelashes.
- Really?

376
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,280
(Glancing)

377
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,340
- Are they natural eyelashes?
- Yes, they are.

378
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,750
Are they natural eyelashes?

379
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,549
- Your eyelashes.
- Well...

380
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,650
That's so funny.

381
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,450
- What?
- Your eyelashes.

382
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,490
- Yes.
- That's so funny.

383
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,119
- Are yours natural too, Woo Jin?
- That's so funny.

384
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,430
- That's so funny.
- Yes.

385
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,299
- What was that, seriously?
- Gosh.

386
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,560
No more girly talk. Sorry about that.

387
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,869
- Seriously.
- They're natural.

388
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,800
- You have long eyelashes.
- Mine?

389
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,999
It's so funny...

390
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,310
- how he said they were long.
- That's hilarious.

391
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,910
His reaction was crazy.

392
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,840
He's a funny one.

393
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,790
If my ex were to pick someone else,

394
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,720
I thought she'd pick Yoo Sik.

395
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,789
He's funny and cheerful.

396
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,900
And he has a beautiful smile even for a guy.

397
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,270
I know that my ex likes men...

398
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,140
who have a beautiful smile.

399
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,440
He's also tall.

400
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,480
Yoo Sik probably has the highest chance.

401
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,619
It seems like there's competition among them.

402
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,649
- Yes.
- I agree.

403
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,990
They don't make it obvious.

404
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Like that?

405
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:53,959
I think that's one of the charms.

406
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,900
(Yoo Sik)

407
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,229
(You worked so hard to cook with me today.)

408
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,240
(Thank you for your help. See you tomorrow.)

409
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,710
She wrote, "See you tomorrow." I expected it to be Ji Hyeon.

410
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,910
Also, she cooked for us.

411
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,710
I sent my message to Yoo Sik.

412
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,420
I asked him out on a date.

413
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,490
After revealing my thoughts to him,

414
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,090
sitting next to him made...

415
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,990
my heart flutter even more.

416
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,040
(Ji Hyeon)

417
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,370
(Your ex did not pick you.)

418
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
- What?
- Hold on.

419
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,009
Yoo Sik picked his ex.

420
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,349
- Yoo Sik sent it to Hong Ji Yeon.
- Ji Yeon?

421
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,380
Yoo Sik picked Ji Yeon.

422
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,120
I got a message saying, "Your ex did not pick you."

423
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,190
I expected it.

424
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,560
That's how my ex is.

425
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,860
But Yoo Sik didn't send me a text?

426
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,770
I wonder why.

427
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,230
I cooked really hard.

428
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,500
I guess I didn't leave a good first impression on him.

429
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,380
What if that's the response?

430
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,649
What if she's ten years older than me?

431
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,410
(Your ex did not pick you.)

432
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,459
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

433
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,789
His ex must be present.

434
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,359
- One of them is his ex.
- Soju tastes sweet and bitter.

435
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,330
- Yes.
- It's starting now.

436
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,969
It seemed very clear...

437
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,610
that she had no feelings for me.

438
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,740
I felt frustrated.

439
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,010
That's what you said.

440
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,950
When it comes to this...

441
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,919
The names...

442
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,720
(Your ex did not pick you.)

443
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,390
To be really honest, I expected it.

444
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,960
Definitely not a boy and a girl.

445
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,300
(Woo Jin, 2 messages)

446
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,510
This is really interesting.

447
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,249
(Yun Nyeong, 2 messages)

448
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,710
We keep worrying about it.

449
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,150
What?

450
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,190
Why did he send it to me? I didn't expect it at all.

451
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,260
Over here.

452
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,800
(Won Kyu, 1 message)

453
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,529
- Me?
- Yes.

454
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,530
(What do you want to do tomorrow?)

455
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,610
After she asked me out on a date,

456
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,770
I got the text.

457
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,080
It had to be from Ji Yeon.

458
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,880
I sent the text to Won Kyu.

459
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,320
My ideal type is someone tall with a sharp look.

460
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,190
And someone who's sweet.

461
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,229
- This is it.
- Really?

462
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,759
- Because of the vibe I got...
- Really?

463
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,960
(Ji Yeon, 0 message)

464
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,100
(Your ex did not pick you.)

465
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,070
Since I asked Won Kyu out on a date,

466
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,500
I was waiting for his response.

467
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,040
But he didn't send me anything.

468
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,979
"Your ex did not pick you."

469
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,140
That was the only message I got, so I was very upset.

470
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,580
Since it's our first day,

471
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,879
I won't take it too personally.

472
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,990
I was just relieved to have someone...

473
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,090
whom I'm interested in.

474
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,090
I can't wait to go on a date with him tomorrow.

475
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,860
(Beaming)

476
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,559
- What?
- What?

477
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,530
Then Yoo Sik can't be her ex.

478
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,639
We were sure of it after seeing them wash the dishes.

479
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,469
- What?
- Why did he wash the dishes?

480
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,470
- I know.
- Why...

481
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:03,169
- Was he really worried...
- She had no gloves on.

482
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,879
- because she had no gloves on?
- That's possible.

483
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,039
- He could've been considerate.
- "What are you doing?"

484
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,249
"I want to spend time with Won Kyu right now. Goodness."

485
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,320
Also, Won Kyu is...

486
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,249
interested in someone else.

487
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,290
- Or he sent a text to his ex.
- To his ex.

488
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,320
Then no one got matched.

489
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,760
- Exactly.
- What?

490
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,959
When I was going through that...

491
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,329
- Really?
- Yes.

492
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,069
When it happened...

493
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,270
(Min Kyung, 1 message)

494
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,039
I don't like getting comfortable.

495
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,440
(Min Kyung, 2 messages)

496
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,779
Being comfortable even during that time.

497
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,779
- So you don't like...
- Really?

498
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,479
I prefer to be comfortable.

499
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,020
(Your ex picked you.)

500
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,840
I didn't expect my ex to be interested in me at all.

501
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,210
I got flustered by the message.

502
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,210
I was surprised.

503
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,080
(Your ex did not pick you.)

504
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,720
Okay.

505
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,230
(Everyone's time is starting to flow individually.)

506
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,329
- Wait a minute.
- If not...

507
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,499
- Wait, my head hurts.
- If not...

508
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,469
- No.
- Can you give me a sketchbook?

509
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,209
- We need to jot things down.
- Could you give me...

510
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,639
- an iPad?
- It's too confusing.

511
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,079
I'm sure that Min Kyung's ex is Woo Jin.

512
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,850
She said that she wanted to go on a date with Baek Hyun,

513
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,720
but she didn't send him a text.

514
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,919
She couldn't have sent it to someone else...

515
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
she's interested in.

516
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:57,959
- And so, - It must be her ex.

517
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,589
she had to send it to her ex.

518
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,920
- If she sent it to Woo Jin, - There's only Woo Jin.

519
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,929
- he is her ex.
- Right.

520
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,629
- That's possible.
- Min Kyung has to be his ex.

521
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,599
We didn't expect this result at all.

522
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,629
- It's confusing.
- Right.

523
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,830
- We were sure about certain things.
- This is hard.

524
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,170
- We found out that we were wrong.
- Everything got messed up.

525
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,839
Anyway, Min Kyung got a text from her ex. He's one of them.

526
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,340
Min Kyung didn't expect it from her ex,

527
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,679
- but she got a text from him.
- She did.

528
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,179
She must have mixed feelings right now.

529
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,749
His text was to wind things down.

530
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,089
- He wished her well.
- And not to get stressed out.

531
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,619
- It could make you hard to forget.
- Right.

532
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,220
What are the chances of Yoo Sik sending a text to Min Kyung?

533
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,190
Can't you ask Yoo Sik about it?

534
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,029
- Should I?
- It's too hard to guess.

535
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,629
- It's too difficult.
- It's too difficult.

536
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,300
What if all our guesses are wrong?

537
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,840
(After everyone's thoughts and feelings got delivered)

538
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,609
What is your favorite style of clothes that you like to wear?

539
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,770
That you like to wear?

540
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,010
I pick you.

541
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,180
I pick you.

542
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,679
I like it. This is fun.

543
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,820
(Ji Hyeon picked Baek Hyun.)

544
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,189
I like it. This is fun.

545
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,649
- My favorite type of clothes?
- Yes.

546
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,160
- What you like to wear.
- A style that you prefer.

547
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,419
Clothes that you like to wear.

548
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,760
I like denim.

549
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,730
(Yun Nyeong's ideal type is someone who looks good in denim.)

550
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,129
- Denim?
- Denim?

551
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,130
Denim.

552
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,310
- What?
- Did he captivate you?

553
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,910
Seriously?

554
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,980
I look good in denim. I have a lot of denim clothes.

555
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,990
You're guilty.

556
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,860
He's guilty.

557
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,690
- Why?
- You're guilty.

558
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,160
That's unusual.

559
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,530
- What?
- No way.

560
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,170
I'll go and get it.

561
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,810
(The bell rings for the third time in the house in Pyeongchang-dong.)

562
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,170
I'll go and get it.

563
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,379
- Again?
- Is there more?

564
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,149
- Does it ring 3 times a day?
- It rings 3 times a day?

565
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,280
- What could it be?
- What is it?

566
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,680
(The bell rings for the third time in the house in Pyeongchang-dong.)

567
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,790
What could it be again?

568
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,929
We even got introductions from our exes.

569
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,159
Could there be more?

570
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
I was flustered.

571
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:19,560
Suddenly, I felt nervous.

572
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,430
I'll go and get it.

573
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
What could it be?

574
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,740
Let's eat it together.

575
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,340
(Yoo Sik gets out of the front door.)

576
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,450
(Yoo Sik finds something.)

577
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,490
(Packages in front of the mailbox)

578
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,419
- The ex's...
- I know what it is.

579
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,459
- Farewell package.
- Farewell package.

580
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,689
- Farewell package.
- The box size is still the same.

581
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,400
Isn't it too intense on their first day?

582
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,170
There were eight boxes of the same size.

583
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,170
They looked like things that people wanted...

584
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,080
to return to their ex.

585
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,350
However,

586
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,490
about 4 or 5 of them felt empty.

587
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,019
Could they be something else?

588
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,320
(Are they not farewell packages?)

589
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,729
Could one of you come out and help me?

590
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,960
- Sure.
- Okay.

591
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,799
- Sure.
- Okay.

592
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,970
I'll go.

593
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,269
- Let's go together.
- Sure.

594
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,499
Everyone is going out barefoot.

595
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,670
(They go out in a hurry.)

596
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,840
What is it?

597
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,310
Oh, my

598
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,610
This late at night?

599
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,319
Wait a minute.

600
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,049
- But...
- They're big.

601
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,320
Someone delivered them up to the door.

602
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,020
- Give me two of them.
- Okay.

603
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,220
- I can carry them.
- Ji Hyeon, I have three.

604
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,690
- Oh, right.
- I was joking.

605
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,029
Everyone, you have a package.

606
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,069
What is it?

607
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,640
- Ji Yeon, it's for you.
- Is that for me?

608
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,840
It's for Yoo Sik.

609
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,939
This is for Woo Jin.

610
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,910
(Everyone gets a package with their name on it.)

611
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,149
- Thank you.
- What's this?

612
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,879
It was a new item from the last season.

613
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,049
They could return something that they got from their ex...

614
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,379
- in a farewell package.
- Yes.

615
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,419
I remember it clearly.

616
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,489
- And so, - It's sad.

617
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,589
it's very sad.

618
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,219
Dong Jin opened his package...

619
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,789
- Right.
- on the last day.

620
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,389
- I remember that.
- He kept it closed until the end.

621
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,559
I bet you would open it right away.

622
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
- Of course.
- Right?

623
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,329
- You'd open it right away.
- If not, I'd be frustrated.

624
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,399
The question is, would it make you sway or feel relieved...

625
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,799
from seeing what's inside?

626
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,939
We don't know how they will feel.

627
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,040
I wonder what's inside.

628
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,610
Are you going to drink more?

629
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,079
I don't mind either way.

630
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,580
- Me neither.
- Really?

631
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,310
(Shaking it suddenly)

632
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,520
- It's a collection.
- A collection?

633
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,219
I have no idea what's inside.

634
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,890
Isn't it light?

635
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,789
I don't think there is anything.

636
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,560
Mine is also very light.

637
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,489
It's so light.

638
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,930
It says here...

639
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,830
that you can open it whenever you want.

640
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,069
Really?

641
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,970
(Opening the package and when to open it is up to you.)

642
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,600
I can't hold back when I'm curious about something.

643
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,709
- If you're curious...
- Open it.

644
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,810
It's up to you.

645
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,280
Gosh, what do I do?

646
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,480
Four times is...

647
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,720
- He's going upstairs.
- I'll be back.

648
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,220
Really?

649
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,700
(He starts to take off the tape from the corridor.)

650
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,650
I have to find out when I'm curious about something.

651
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,349
I'll look at it at some point.

652
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,850
If it's something that I have to handle later,

653
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,460
I'd rather look at it now...

654
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,059
and handle it.

655
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,730
So I opened it very quickly.

656
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,570
(Baek Hyun is the first one to open it.)

657
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,410
(What is inside his box?)

658
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,040
It was a package...

659
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,110
from my ex.

660
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,610
She wanted to give it back to me.

661
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,949
It was a letter that I wrote to her.

662
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,750
(A letter he wrote to his ex)

663
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,120
It was a letter I wrote to my ex...

664
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,830
to break up with her.

665
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:52,540
(His letter asking for breakup was returned to him.)

666
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,749
(I hated you so much and didn't even want to see you.)

667
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:12,060
(I told you that I regretted all our moments together.)

668
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,059
(I'm very sorry for hurting you.)

669
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,730
(It must have been so difficult for you.)

670
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,139
(I wanted to be with you for a long time.)

671
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,610
(I'm always rooting for you.)

672
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,020
(He read all the sentences that he wrote.)

673
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,990
(Sighing)

674
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,740
I thought, "I liked my ex very much."

675
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,510
I thought about how much I liked her.

676
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,150
(He put away the farewell inside the closet.)

677
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,629
It would feel strange to read your own letter.

678
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,329
It'd also be strange...

679
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,559
to get back the letter you wrote...

680
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,929
- to ask for a breakup.
- Right.

681
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,129
He looks more upset than when he got his intro from his ex.

682
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,539
Do people break up with a letter?

683
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,969
Is that how people break up these days? With a letter?

684
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,270
I've written one too.

685
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,469
- Really?
- You have?

686
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,670
- You broke up with a letter?
- Yes.

687
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,739
Do you give the letter yourself or send it through someone?

688
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,749
- Or do you mail it to his house?
- Do you mail it?

689
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,750
Do you leave it when he's not there?

690
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:45,449
I wrote it in his house and left it.

691
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,149
- I see.
- Right.

692
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,219
That makes sense.

693
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,219
I didn't write the letter...

694
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,059
when I wasn't ready for our breakup.

695
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,229
- When ending our relationship, - For good?

696
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,729
I wrote my last thoughts...

697
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,330
to him in a letter.

698
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,929
That was very polite.

699
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,429
You were being the politest possible.

700
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,369
She asked for a breakup...

701
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,739
- Right.
- politely.

702
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,669
- She asked for it very politely.
- Also,

703
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,379
Baek Hyun read the letter he had written himself.

704
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,649
From watching him, I could imagine...

705
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,909
- how he must feel.
- Right.

706
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,649
The heartache he went through back then must have...

707
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,949
returned like a scent of nostalgia.

708
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,959
- It must be painful.
- Exactly.

709
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,159
I agree with you.

710
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,819
Why did she return it to him?

711
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,729
That's because...

712
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,930
it's the hardest thing to keep.

713
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,829
Keeping that would be a nightmare.

714
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,529
- He wrote it by hand.
- Right, you can't throw it away.

715
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,269
It wasn't a casual relationship.

716
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,069
They also thought about getting married,

717
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,070
so it must have been a long-term relationship.

718
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,580
(Sighing)

719
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,680
(1st floor, Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon's room)

720
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,730
When I opened my farewell package,

721
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,070
there was hand cream inside.

722
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,469
(A set of hand creams in Ji Yeon's farewell package)

723
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,080
My ex had dry hands.

724
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,610
It's something I gave him every day.

725
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,980
What was inside was so unexpected.

726
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,459
Whenever I saw hand cream at a pharmacy,

727
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,290
I always bought it.

728
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,029
I also bought small ones so that he could carry them...

729
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,800
easily inside his pocket.

730
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:55,210
(An unexpected item got returned in the farewell package.)

731
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,620
(Ji Yeon also put away the farewell in the closet.)

732
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,429
It must be something that she gave him out of habit.

733
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,059
And he threw away that habit.

734
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,229
- It must be related to his work.
- It must be related.

735
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,370
Her ex must be Baek Hyun.

736
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,439
- Why Baek Hyun?
- I think it's Baek Hyun.

737
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,339
As soon as Baek Hyun left,

738
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,709
she came downstairs out of curiosity.

739
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,409
She said that her ex's hands were always dry.

740
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,279
Most people who work out have hands...

741
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,909
that are very dry.

742
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,420
We guessed that Baek Hyun could be...

743
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,919
an athlete.

744
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,649
Isn't Baek Hyun a cook?

745
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,919
He has to wash his hands often.

746
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,159
- Right, he could be a cook.
- He said that he likes to cook.

747
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,219
Right.

748
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,560
(4th floor, Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon's room)

749
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,670
(Min Kyung opens the farewell package without hesitation.)

750
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,890
(She can't bring herself to read the letter.)

751
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,370
(What kind of letter is it?)

752
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,100
It was a letter that I wrote a long time ago.

753
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,870
When I opened the letter,

754
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,349
I read, "Congratulations on our 1,000th day."

755
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,879
(She realized that it was a letter about their 1,000th day.)

756
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,480
It's a letter about our 1,000th day.

757
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,900
(Min Kyung's farewell package: 1000-day letter)

758
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,670
- Hold on.
- One thousand days?

759
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,139
That means they have dated for about three years.

760
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,069
- She dated him for a while.
- Yes.

761
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,210
- Three years is long.
- If it's over three years.

762
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,980
They dated for a long time.

763
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm not sure how her feelings will change.

764
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,049
The letter was about...

765
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,690
how I couldn't live...

766
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,789
without my ex-boyfriend.

767
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,359
(I simply love you.)

768
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,259
(I will stay by your side.)

769
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,460
(You mean too much to me now.)

770
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,800
(The letter was full of words of love.)

771
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,699
It was sad from start to finish.

772
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,170
(Our story has ended now.)

773
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,840
At the end, I wrote,

774
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,580
"From your exclusive cutie, Min Kyung."

775
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,449
That was what I wrote.

776
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,880
(Written on the letter: "From your cutie, Min Kyung")

777
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,980
The sentence shows...

778
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,550
what kind of existence...

779
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,920
I wanted to be for my ex.

780
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,660
It made me sad.

781
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,380
When we dated,

782
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,850
we often said, "Let's date until 5,000 days."

783
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,190
The letter ended with,

784
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,420
"We have 4,000 days left."

785
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,830
But we broke up before that could happen.

786
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,869
It felt like the letter showed...

787
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,370
the feelings we had back then.

788
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,890
Rather than wavering,

789
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,320
I felt more hatred toward him.

790
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,230
"Why is he doing this to me after all this time?"

791
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,830
I hated him.

792
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,670
(4th floor, Woo Jin and Baek Hyun's room)

793
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,150
(Woo Jin keeps shaking the farewell package.)

794
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,660
(Sighing)

795
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,870
(Woo Jin's farewell package was left in the room.)

796
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,070
When...

797
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,670
I shook the box in my quiet room,

798
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,080
I could hear it.

799
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,180
But it sounded familiar.

800
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,280
I knew what my ex had sent me.

801
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,689
That was why I didn't open it.

802
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,360
(Knowing what it might be is stopping him from opening it.)

803
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,690
(Are you certain?)

804
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,530
I could guess what it was.

805
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,159
Dolls.

806
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,900
Dolls I gave names to.

807
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,070
It was Hodol and Baeksoon.

808
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,580
Whatever we did, we were those dolls.

809
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,709
If I were drinking something,

810
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,979
I'd take photos with the dolls and send them.

811
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,550
I sent photos of them under the duvet.

812
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,319
Those dolls mean quite a lot to me.

813
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,150
I wanted to open it...

814
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,960
after thinking about it and calming myself more.

815
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,789
(Why would she have sent it if they were dolls?)

816
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,030
Maybe...

817
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,000
"Recall our memories."

818
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,929
"I couldn't throw them away as they were too special."

819
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,600
"You throw them." Or something like that?

820
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,470
I'm not too sure.

821
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,680
(Will Woo Jin be able to open the farewell package?)

822
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,219
- They must be his other self.
- Exactly.

823
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,950
- That's tough.
- It's not easy.

824
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,489
I found that surprising,

825
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,389
guessing what it was right away.

826
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,119
- It must mean quite a lot to him.
- It...

827
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,530
- The dolls were his other self.
- Right.

828
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,859
A package like that would confuse you.

829
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,799
In Min Kyung's case, she must feel...

830
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,399
If I were her, I'd have wavered.

831
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,429
Same here.

832
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,269
It'd remind me of the past...

833
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,499
and our memories together.

834
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,669
Being there physically in front of you is scary.

835
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,209
- Of course.
- A physical object...

836
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,809
that holds memories with your ex...

837
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,979
- Yes.
- and is right in front of you...

838
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,279
is really scary.

839
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,949
Which would make you falter more?

840
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,919
A breakup letter or a 1,000-day letter, from when things were good?

841
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,519
The 1,000-day letter would shake me up more.

842
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,119
- Me too.
- From when things were good?

843
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,389
From when things were good.

844
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,429
- Right.
- That breaks your heart the most,

845
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,399
facing the happiest moment.

846
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,399
If it were from an odd time, like 50 days, it wouldn't be that sad.

847
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,629
- Fifty days?
- Right?

848
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,839
- Not even 100 days, right?
- Not 50 days.

849
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,139
- Not even 22 days.
- That's not sad at all.

850
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,339
But 1,000 days carry this weight.

851
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,940
You'd want to throw away a breakup letter.

852
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,440
This would be her chance to throw it away.

853
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,550
(The residents are gathered in the living room again.)

854
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,920
(The atmosphere is awkward after the farewell packages have arrived.)

855
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,170
Did you open it? Did you see what was inside?

856
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,370
- See what?
- I contemplated opening it or not.

857
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,640
- You opened it, right?
- Did you open it?

858
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,639
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

859
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,909
- Did you?
- Me neither.

860
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,510
- You?
- Mine's right here.

861
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,050
I just opened mine.

862
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,150
- Really?
- Yes.

863
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,380
- That's amazing.
- How fast.

864
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,919
- "That's amazing?" - "I just opened mine?"

865
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,659
"I just opened mine..."

866
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,659
- could make his ex angry.
- Yes.

867
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,329
I feel like Baek Hyun's ex is Ji Hyeon.

868
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,229
"That's amazing." Isn't it like,

869
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,229
- "Seriously? You opened it," - Yes.

870
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,699
"and yet, you're here?"

871
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,569
"How can you say that you just opened it?"

872
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,369
Her words and the way she looked at him felt like that.

873
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,500
- That's possible.
- Baek Hyun and Ji Hyeon?

874
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,140
- It seems like it.
- Maybe.

875
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,710
I just opened mine.

876
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,910
- Really?
- That's amazing.

877
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,120
How fast.

878
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,990
Seeing it might make my feelings change.

879
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,130
Right, about your ex. I get it.

880
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,959
- I'm curious.
- Yes?

881
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,030
Yoo Sik. Say that one of the guys, including me,

882
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,569
has feelings for your ex...

883
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,370
and ends up actually dating her after this show.

884
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,540
Can you root for them?

885
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,250
Like genuinely.

886
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,019
If my ex has feelings for him.

887
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,219
- Will you support her?
- Yes.

888
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,519
- Really?
- Yes.

889
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,650
- Because...
- Cool.

890
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,619
Picking on her and such will only be worse.

891
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,990
If that'll make my ex happier,

892
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,460
shouldn't I?

893
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,400
Do you have no lingering attachments to her?

894
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,870
- That's a bit...
- That's...

895
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,540
Got it.

896
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,909
I bet you can't do it.

897
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,009
- No, right, Woo Jin?
- Honestly,

898
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,079
I don't think I can root for her.

899
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,080
- You can't.
- No.

900
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,050
But I'd still wish for her happiness.

901
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,050
Baek Hyun?

902
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,189
I can cheer them on if he's a great match for her.

903
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,730
- Really?
- For real?

904
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,460
- Are you over her?
- What if he's not?

905
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,600
If not,

906
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,370
that's her fate.

907
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,969
- That's fierce.
- He's a thinker.

908
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:46,970
- "Fierce?" - Seriously.

909
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,140
- Isn't he the big thinker?
- Right?

910
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,440
Yes.

911
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,580
- I have my own life to live.
- Is that so?

912
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,779
After seeing the package, he's become...

913
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,010
Did it bring back old feelings?

914
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,620
"I'll root for you, so you should root for me."

915
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,020
That's a nice mindset.

916
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,589
But that's the right thing to do.

917
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,860
- Yes.
- I agree.

918
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,359
I have a question.

919
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,230
How big of an age gap are you okay with?

920
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,069
I'm not sure about men younger than me.

921
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,140
Really?

922
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,339
I find them difficult.

923
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,509
I feel like she'll be good at controlling younger men.

924
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,510
- Right?
- Yes.

925
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:30,709
I'm bad at it.

926
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,910
- Really?
- You are?

927
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,579
Personality-wise, I may be like that.

928
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,420
But I might like the guy leading me...

929
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,720
- To lead you?
- around more.

930
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,890
Honestly, I don't think age gaps are that important.

931
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,200
But we must be able to connect on similar things.

932
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,699
For example,

933
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,829
he must know sentimental songs...

934
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,570
from Cyworld that I know.

935
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,240
- Really?
- What's Cyworld?

936
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,570
- What?
- Hold on.

937
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,009
- Wait.
- Cyworld?

938
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,809
- What's Cyworld?
- What's with you?

939
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,709
- Do they not know what Cyworld is?
- They don't?

940
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,210
- Woo Jin doesn't know.
- What?

941
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,089
To not know what Cyworld is, they must be born...

942
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,319
- in 1999 or...
- In...

943
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,519
No, they know Cyworld.

944
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,019
- How can they know what it is?
- They do.

945
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,489
You know Cyworld, right, Yoon Su?

946
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,089
I do. I used it back in middle school.

947
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,489
He was born in 1997, and he knows it.

948
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,029
There's only a 2-year difference from 1999.

949
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,459
Does that mean he was born in 2000?

950
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,769
Yes, in 2000.

951
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,169
Or he might be acting.

952
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,769
- Acting? No way.
- No way.

953
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,869
To be that good at acting?

954
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,170
Or he could've shut himself off from the world.

955
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,640
- What's Cyworld?
- What's with you?

956
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,110
Hold on. What's up with you?

957
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,610
- Cyworld?
- What are you?

958
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,479
- What is that?
- Are you Gen Z?

959
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,650
Do you not know what Cyworld is?

960
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,620
How old are you?

961
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,420
Do you not know "Love Love Love" by Epik High from Cyworld?

962
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,860
- Epik High?
- Like...

963
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,529
Come on, Woo Jin. Not knowing Epik High is absurd.

964
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,729
I told you, didn't I?

965
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,770
He could've shut himself off from the world.

966
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,570
Maybe he lived abroad.

967
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,169
- "Abroad?" - But he's too fluent in Korean...

968
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,669
- not to know that much.
- Right?

969
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,610
Let's see how much he doesn't know.

970
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,210
Where are we?

971
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,550
- Woo Jin is quite odd.
- Exactly.

972
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,050
Epik High?

973
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,150
- Don't you know Epik High?
- The singer Epik High?

974
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,020
Pour us drinks.

975
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,890
Do I receive it with both hands?

976
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:21,589
For example, if I were to talk about EXO...

977
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,059
and he talks about Seo Tai Ji, it'd be like, "What?"

978
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,830
- Yes.
- Right, that could happen.

979
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,900
To go as far as Seo Tai Ji?

980
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,899
- I'm not that old.
- No, right?

981
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,070
- Gosh.
- Right?

982
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,240
Are you from the Seo Tai Ji generation?

983
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,369
I ruined my image...

984
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,640
- from day one.
- No.

985
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,940
- You didn't, sir.
- "Sir?"

986
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,380
- It's because Won Kyu is quite old.
- I see.

987
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,079
Sorry

988
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,749
But what if he turns out to be the youngest?

989
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,690
That'd really bring me to tears.

990
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,260
- What about Baek Hyun? I'm curious.
- Baek Hyun?

991
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,330
I don't care as long as...

992
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,559
- I like her.
- Is that so?

993
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,529
What if she's 15 years younger than you?

994
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,070
- Come on, that's...
- What if she's 17 years older?

995
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,199
(An extreme balance game)

996
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,409
- That's...
- You said you didn't care.

997
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,669
Let's be realistic and say a nine-year gap.

998
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,279
- Okay, nice.
- A nine-year gap.

999
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,350
A nine-year gap is all right. She's older, right?

1000
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,609
What about younger?

1001
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,020
If she's younger... I'll just stop here.

1002
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,650
Got it.

1003
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
If there's love, the age gap isn't...

1004
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,430
As long as the woman...

1005
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,200
- isn't 12 years older than me...
- Really?

1006
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Is that too much?

1007
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,869
No, it differs for everyone.

1008
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:42,040
True. I'm fine as long as she's not two years younger than me.

1009
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,269
You don't want to date anyone older than that?

1010
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,440
When you said we'd be similar in age,

1011
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,649
I thought,

1012
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,880
"Is he quite old?"

1013
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,890
Overall, I just think we're similar in age.

1014
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,050
- You do?
- Yes.

1015
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,929
A little bit of beer, please.

1016
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,300
- Beer?
- Just a bit.

1017
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,300
Thank you.

1018
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,200
Great work, everyone.

1019
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,669
I'd like a bit too.

1020
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,209
Okay. Do you want somaek?

1021
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,580
No, I'll just have soju.

1022
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,649
- Thank you.
- I'm turning in for the night.

1023
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,679
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

1024
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,750
- Thank you.
- I'm going to take a shower.

1025
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,779
I only got an hour of sleep yesterday.

1026
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,820
- Got it.
- Go to bed.

1027
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,990
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

1028
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,060
(Sighing)

1029
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,780
I felt very uncomfortable.

1030
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,520
It was a series of awkward moments.

1031
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,560
All I thought was, "Let's stop thinking about it."

1032
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,760
Nothing was memorable during the drinking party.

1033
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,799
I simply wanted...

1034
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,330
the day to end quickly and to get used to this situation.

1035
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,239
Feeling uncomfortable means his ex was there.

1036
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,869
- Yes.
- Is it really Ji Hyeon?

1037
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,440
It's Ji Hyeon. "That's amazing."

1038
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,609
- No way.
- But earlier, she said "Cool..."

1039
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,779
- to Yoo Sik in that same tone.
- The expression was different...

1040
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,049
when she said, "That's amazing."

1041
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,150
- True. It was subtly different.
- Right?

1042
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,320
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow, everyone.

1043
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:43,730
Who is it?

1044
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,230
- Did you shower?
- No.

1045
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,959
I'm going to take one now. Did you take one?

1046
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,970
Yes.

1047
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,370
- Did you open yours?
- I did.

1048
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,670
Give me a second.

1049
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,270
In secret.

1050
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,450
(Her quick roommate had already opened the package.)

1051
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,950
(Ji Hyeon looks for a different spot.)

1052
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,660
(Taking a bag to put the object in it)

1053
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,660
There it is.

1054
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,070
I opened it alone in the bathroom.

1055
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,030
Where did you leave the box?

1056
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,599
- Inside the closet.
- Closet?

1057
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Yes.

1058
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,130
Did you open it?

1059
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,240
- It's annoying.
- How come?

1060
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,440
It's just annoying.

1061
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,540
Did you open it?

1062
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,840
- Yes. I'm annoyed.
- Oh, no.

1063
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,950
I opened it, thinking it might be something with our memories.

1064
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,190
But it was empty.

1065
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:21,460
(Ji Hyeon's farewell package was empty.)

1066
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,630
- What?
- Did he have nothing to send?

1067
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,130
He must've thrown everything away.

1068
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,499
He could've thrown them away...

1069
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,399
or had nothing he wanted to return.

1070
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,829
Yes, if you see it in a positive light.

1071
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:36,270
I think he's saying he has no lingering attachments whatsoever.

1072
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,909
If it had something inside,

1073
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,109
- even the smallest thing, - Right.

1074
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,179
- it could mean something to her.
- Yes.

1075
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,749
So he could've chosen not to send anything.

1076
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,249
- He could've been considerate...
- Yes.

1077
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,879
and put nothing inside...

1078
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,279
- so that she wouldn't waver.
- Exactly.

1079
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,749
There could be many meanings behind it.

1080
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,589
Hwi Hyun left the box empty because he literally had...

1081
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,889
- nothing to give his ex.
- True.

1082
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,089
He was in a completely different situation.

1083
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,359
- There could be many intentions.
- Yes.

1084
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,430
Let's think about it.

1085
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:00,360
This one's tough.

1086
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,629
(Ji Hyeon's farewell package was empty.)

1087
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,370
Back then, I felt like,

1088
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
"What?"

1089
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
"What's going on?"

1090
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,480
It really made me upset.

1091
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,210
Either way, it's about something we gave each other.

1092
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,680
But he left the box empty.

1093
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,850
Was it all so meaningless?

1094
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,460
Nothing.

1095
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,200
(1st floor, Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon's room)

1096
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,340
(Yun Nyeong also opens her farewell package.)

1097
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,890
We had matching rings.

1098
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,630
(Yun Nyeong's farewell package: Ex's matching ring)

1099
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:11,730
It's a ring.

1100
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,139
- Oh, no.
- Matching rings?

1101
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,410
- A ring is intense.
- That's harsh.

1102
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,910
- That's...
- Goodness.

1103
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,409
(Yun Nyeong's farewell package: Ex's matching ring)

1104
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,580
Because I really liked him, I insisted that...

1105
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,719
we get matching rings because if he wore one, like shackles,

1106
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,220
girls would think, "Oh, he has a girlfriend."

1107
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,529
When I looked at it, it still had...

1108
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,160
the scratches from when he used to wear it.

1109
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,570
I thought, "He still had it?"

1110
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,770
I wanted to try it on, but I didn't.

1111
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,780
It could've shaken me up.

1112
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,649
It made me recall past memories.

1113
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,290
Looking at what my ex had sent me that contains our memories...

1114
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,720
from back then...

1115
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,790
hit me quite differently.

1116
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,930
I can't cut off people quite easily.

1117
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,970
He must stop making me falter.

1118
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,700
That's why I kept it in the closet.

1119
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:29,040
(Yun Nyeong puts away her breakup for a while.)

1120
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,480
(1st floor, Won Kyu and Yoo Sik's room)

1121
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,320
(Tearing)

1122
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:40,820
(Tearing)

1123
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,400
(Won Kyu is struggling to open the package.)

1124
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,500
He's a funny one.

1125
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,990
It was a hoodie I gave her after we broke up.

1126
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:23,130
(The hoodie he gave to his ex after they broke up)

1127
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,170
(Why did you give her the hoodie after you broke up with her?)

1128
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,000
That hoodie,

1129
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,410
when we were dating,

1130
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,980
was what my ex gave me for my birthday.

1131
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,319
(The birthday gift from his ex)

1132
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,890
I thought about it after we broke up.

1133
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:48,320
Back then, she was looking for a job...

1134
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,489
and didn't have enough income.

1135
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,600
She might have wanted to wear the same one as me,

1136
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:59,330
but she must have bought one only for me, I thought.

1137
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,410
So after one year, although we were not in a relationship,

1138
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,580
I asked her if I could leave it at her place.

1139
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,850
That's how I gave it back to her.

1140
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,019
At that time, I didn't give the gift back...

1141
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,620
with an intention to get back together.

1142
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:21,490
However, receiving it again,

1143
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,129
I was reminded of what she told me,

1144
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,260
"You should meet someone more mature than me."

1145
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,439
I wondered if she didn't want to see me again.

1146
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,840
I got a strong feeling about that.

1147
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,609
(The hoodie he gave her back was returned as a farewell package.)

1148
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:45,710
(The hoodie he gave her back was returned as a farewell package.)

1149
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,249
Won Kyu said this earlier.

1150
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,819
He didn't give it to his ex to get back together,

1151
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,449
but she must have felt that it meant a reunion.

1152
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,789
That's why she would rather...

1153
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,389
- She returned it.
- return it, I guess.

1154
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,289
If I imagine that I get that gift back,

1155
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,029
I'd be 100 percent sure that he's still thinking about me.

1156
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,029
- That's right.
- That's what I'd think of.

1157
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,000
You'd think he still has lingering feelings after the breakup.

1158
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,129
After a breakup,

1159
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,970
have you ever given a gift to your ex?

1160
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,600
- I don't think so.
- A gift?

1161
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,469
I don't even contact her.

1162
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,079
- I have.
- What?

1163
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,839
Although I'm living happily with my wife now,

1164
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,379
we broke up once when we were dating.

1165
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,410
I sent her shoes while we were separated.

1166
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,979
You wanted to get back together.

1167
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,080
Well, that's right.

1168
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,550
I sent her a newly released sneakers and all.

1169
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,059
That's an honest feeling.

1170
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,120
- Yes.
- Right.

1171
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,760
(Yoo Sik comes out after taking a shower.)

1172
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,460
Why aren't you sleeping?

1173
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,400
Have you opened this box?

1174
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,070
I haven't opened it yet.

1175
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,310
I have a feeling that this isn't the right timing...

1176
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,840
to open it.

1177
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,310
When are you going to bed?

1178
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,050
I think I'll go to bed soon.

1179
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:10,570
(Looking at the farewell package, Yoo Sik can't decide.)

1180
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,370
I wanted to open it as late as I could.

1181
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:20,580
I wanted to open it after I became calm.

1182
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,950
If I have...

1183
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,820
a chance to talk to her, I will talk.

1184
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,290
I'd like to open it that day.

1185
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,630
(Yoo Sik didn't open the farewell package after all.)

1186
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,960
- I guess this is it.
- Yes.

1187
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:48,540
I have a feeling that I'd be heartbroken.

1188
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,710
I only wish that my mind wouldn't be in turmoil.

1189
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,510
It would be, though.

1190
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,880
- It definitely would be.
- Definitely.

1191
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,720
I'm going to be in big trouble.

1192
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:13,030
(The first morning in the House)

1193
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,540
(It's the 2nd day here, and they'll have a 1st date.)

1194
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,209
(Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon wake up at 6:18am.)

1195
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,809
Good morning.

1196
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,880
Good morning.

1197
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,180
Come on.

1198
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:33,010
I went to sleep right away last night, didn't I?

1199
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,250
You did.

1200
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:39,020
(Yun Nyeong and Ji Yeon wake up at 6:56am.)

1201
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:46,660
(Baek Hyun and Woo Jin wake up with an alarm ringing.)

1202
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,140
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik wake up at 7:16am.)

1203
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,910
(4th floor, Min Kyung and Ji Hyeon's room)

1204
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,479
You cried quite a lot yesterday, I guess.

1205
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,610
No, I didn't. What are you saying?

1206
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,950
I'm different from my yesterday self.

1207
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,290
Is there anyone you're interested in?

1208
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,689
I find about two of them attractive.

1209
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,060
Really?

1210
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,290
That means most of them, doesn't it?

1211
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,500
Excluding your ex.

1212
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:24,370
But the one...

1213
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:27,540
I asked out yesterday feels the most...

1214
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:30,370
I think I know who he is.

1215
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,670
Who could it be?

1216
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,880
If I have a date today,

1217
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,750
my mind would become clear.

1218
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,450
How about you, Min Kyung?

1219
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,480
I'm...

1220
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,149
interested in one person.

1221
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,449
- Really?
- Yes.

1222
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,120
I have no idea about the one you're interested in.

1223
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,660
- About whom I selected?
- Yes.

1224
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,770
Pasta. What kind of pasta should I cook?

1225
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,700
We have a sauce there.

1226
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,939
- There's a pasta sauce.
- I saw it.

1227
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,870
Are we having pasta for dinner today?

1228
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,270
I think I heard so.

1229
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,720
(Ji Hyeon comes out to put her shoes away in the shoe rack.)

1230
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,060
- Your shoes?
- I'm putting them away now.

1231
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,289
- Do you need my help?
- No, thanks.

1232
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,259
- It feels embarrassing.
- Does it?

1233
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,600
- I see.
- These are shoes. Thanks, anyway.

1234
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,170
Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.

1235
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,300
Okay.

1236
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,570
What are you going to wear when you go out today?

1237
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,980
- Me?
- Yes.

1238
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,240
What are you going to wear?

1239
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,780
I was going to wear matching outfits with you.

1240
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:49,720
(He closes the sliding door to keep their date a secret.)

1241
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,389
Then what should I wear?

1242
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,420
- I will match your outfit.
- It's raining.

1243
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,730
Can I wear a cardigan and a skirt?

1244
01:04:58,790 --> 01:04:59,859
Yes.

1245
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,929
I will wear grey and white.

1246
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,530
Grey and white. I got it.

1247
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:07,340
(Their date outfits are decided quickly.)

1248
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:25,390
(Woo Jin is bothered about their conversation.)

1249
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,889
- I didn't have breakfast.
- I'm hungry.

1250
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:29,919
You are, right?

1251
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,960
- Like this...
- Would you like to have cereals?

1252
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,030
- Can I?
- Sure.

1253
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:36,700
We need this and...

1254
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,370
- Are these chocolate cereals?
- a bowl...

1255
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:40,999
This one is too small, right?

1256
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,839
(She takes out a cereal bowl for Baek Hyun.)

1257
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,869
- It's too small, I guess.
- Do we have something larger?

1258
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:45,940
A larger one is...

1259
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,110
- Is this one too small?
- No, in this one...

1260
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,550
Shall we use this one?

1261
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,350
In here?

1262
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,120
- Will you use that?
- I'd rather use this one.

1263
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,620
- Really?
- Yes, in here... Is it too large?

1264
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,590
That's funny.

1265
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,659
- Have you had breakfast?
- No.

1266
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,259
Shall I eat it now? I can't decide.

1267
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,930
Would you like to? Let's eat together.

1268
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,369
Did you drink a lot yesterday?

1269
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,009
Me? I had mixed drinks all along.

1270
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,209
- Really?
- So I had a headache this morning.

1271
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,440
I usually don't have a hangover, though.

1272
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,410
It's raining outside today. It feels very humid.

1273
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,150
Did you do your hair all right?

1274
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,679
Yes.

1275
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,250
(Staring)

1276
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,819
I think your hair looks nice.

1277
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,590
- Really?
- Yes, it looks good.

1278
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,759
I'm glad.

1279
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,290
I guess I styled it nicely today.

1280
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,030
Are you going to wear jeans for today's date?

1281
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,700
- Did you see it?
- Yes.

1282
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:59,150
(Their conversation stops as Yoo Sik passes by.)

1283
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,230
Would you like to have breakfast?

1284
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,130
- You can remain seated. I'll do it.
- Is it all right?

1285
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,210
What?

1286
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,940
I guess his ex is Ji Hyeon.

1287
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,880
The atmosphere totally tells she's his ex.

1288
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,890
(Meanwhile, Won Kyu is alone in the living room.)

1289
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,690
Hi.

1290
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,460
(Ji Yeon casually sits beside Won Kyu.)

1291
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,360
Did you expect that I'd ask you out yesterday?

1292
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,529
- No.
- You had no idea?

1293
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,600
No.

1294
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,200
I really had no idea.

1295
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,009
I was looking for you everywhere.

1296
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,240
- Really?
- I went to every room.

1297
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,280
I went to all three rooms...

1298
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,309
- and opened the door.
- Really?

1299
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:06,310
(Venting her feelings of last night)

1300
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,979
Other guys were in the rooms?

1301
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,980
Yes.

1302
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,849
Did you want someone else to ask you out?

1303
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,320
No, it's not like that.

1304
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,559
They look really good together.

1305
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,629
- Their looks match well.
- Their looks are a perfect match.

1306
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,599
- They look alike.
- They really resemble each other.

1307
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,060
They both have sharp noses.

1308
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,529
Your introduction from your ex...

1309
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:27,540
said you like animals.

1310
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,139
- Right.
- Do you have a pet?

1311
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,269
- I have a dog.
- You have a dog.

1312
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:33,409
- I have a cat.
- Really?

1313
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,880
My cat is really cute.

1314
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,149
You'll be surprised to see her.

1315
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,809
(Their preliminary date is going on.)

1316
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:40,880
What color is your cat?

1317
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,549
He was alone in the living room,

1318
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,249
so I sat by his side and asked many things.

1319
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,820
We talked about a lot together,

1320
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,690
and I liked...

1321
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,290
each talk we had.

1322
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,830
Dogs used to be my favorite animals,

1323
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:02,070
but now I have a cat, so...

1324
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,709
What's the text about?

1325
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,850
- Did they get a text?
- What is it?

1326
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,120
(Min Kyung is checking her text too.)

1327
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,890
It's on vibrate.

1328
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:22,589
(Female residents should enter the chat room.)

1329
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:26,630
(You can get advice from your date's ex.)

1330
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,669
- The chat room.
- The advice.

1331
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:31,869
The chat room.

1332
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:32,999
It should be fun.

1333
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,369
This is fun. They might give advice, but they might not.

1334
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:36,940
- That's right.
- They might lie. Right.

1335
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,910
They might have an idea...

1336
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,339
who their date's ex is.

1337
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,580
They can get a feel for it.

1338
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,220
(They checked the text about the chat room.)

1339
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,490
Where are you going?

1340
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:57,060
We want to get some fresh air.

1341
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,699
- See you.
- See you.

1342
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,730
(For female residents only)

1343
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,600
(EX-chat room)

1344
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,570
(Is it okay that I do my best for the date?)

1345
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,180
(I'm curious about his ideal type!)

1346
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,909
(You can ask questions to your date's ex...)

1347
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:22,920
(and give information on my ex.)

1348
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,489
(Hiding their identities,)

1349
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,790
(they have a chat with a wall between each other.)

1350
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,030
(EX-chat room is open.)

1351
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:40,840
(Woo Jin's date, Yun Nyeong)

1352
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,870
(Sitting with an excited heart for the first chat)

1353
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,549
It's time to find out more about Woo Jin.

1354
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,150
I can ask a lot of things about him during that time.

1355
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:01,320
So I prepared a lot of questions.

1356
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,630
I was like, "What should I ask?"

1357
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,130
(Waiting for Woo Jin's ex after getting fully prepared)

1358
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,620
(EX-chat begins as they hide their identities to each other.)

1359
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,649
(Hello.)

1360
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,050
(Hello.)

1361
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,620
(Glancing)

1362
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,859
(I'm curious what his favorite behavior of a girl is.)

1363
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,560
(He likes it when a girl shows her love a lot.)

1364
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,559
(Then what are the things I need to avoid during the date?)

1365
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,270
(Are there any behaviors he doesn't like?)

1366
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,740
(Don'ts for the date with him?)

1367
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,209
(He'd like everything except for hanging out on a windy day.)

1368
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,910
(Would a rainy day be all right?)

1369
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:00,449
(He cares a lot about his hair.)

1370
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,620
(If you make sure he's under an umbrella, it'd be fine.)

1371
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,989
(She got new information on Woo Jin.)

1372
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,289
What I thought I should be most careful of was...

1373
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,190
his hair.

1374
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,259
She said he puts a lot of effort in doing his hair.

1375
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,729
Since he doesn't like it when his hair gets messed up,

1376
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,700
she told me to avoid dating outside when it's windy.

1377
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:20,229
(I want to know what Woo Jin's favorite date was...)

1378
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:22,200
(and what your favorite date with him was.)

1379
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,910
(Their favorite date?)

1380
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,580
(We both like dating at home, so we met at our places often.)

1381
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,380
That's intense.

1382
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,180
Can she go to his place?

1383
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,989
(Is your most memorable date also a date at home?)

1384
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,889
The most memorable date...

1385
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,130
among ones with his ex.

1386
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:50,200
There must be reasons why it was most memorable,

1387
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,670
and I could pick the good elements in the date.

1388
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,700
That was why I asked those questions.

1389
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,140
(And do you want to see those memories again?)

1390
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,850
(Do you want to see those memories again?)

1391
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:11,419
(Since we hung out a lot at home, that's most memorable.)

1392
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,320
(I don't want to see the memories again.)

1393
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,600
(What do you feel about Woo Jin going on a date with someone else?)

1394
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,210
(Would it bother you a lot?)

1395
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,249
(I can't say I won't be bothered,)

1396
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,280
(but I hope you have a good time.)

1397
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,760
(Is it okay that I do my best for the date?)

1398
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,429
(Yun Nyeong's question has a strong impact.)

1399
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,830
"Is it okay that I do my best for the date?"

1400
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,429
That makes my heart race.

1401
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:57,900
- That makes my heart flutter.
- Right.

1402
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:59,599
- That was very gentle, - Right.

1403
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,769
but she really cut to the core.

1404
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,699
"Is it okay that I do my best for the date?"

1405
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,769
That was awesome and wise.

1406
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,239
That's a terrific question.

1407
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,980
I would get offended if I heard that.

1408
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,519
(Is it okay that I do my best for the date?)

1409
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,389
That was my key question, as I think.

1410
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,920
It was an indirect way to ask...

1411
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,720
if she still had lingering feelings.

1412
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:26,260
(Yun Nyeong, a strategist, asked a prepared question.)

1413
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,630
(Yes, you can do your best...)

1414
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:40,940
(A question not easy to answer)

1415
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,580
(Is it really okay that my ex's date does her best?)

1416
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:53,320
(Yes, do your best and have a good time!)

1417
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,389
All along our conversation,

1418
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,760
it felt that she had no lingering feelings at all.

1419
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,759
I never expected that.

1420
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,959
It felt like she said, "All right. Go and have fun."

1421
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,929
That's what I actually felt.

1422
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:06,800
I thought she was definitely over him.

1423
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,510
So I decided to have a nice date.

1424
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:15,080
(The first chat ends with peace of mind.)

1425
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,040
Yun Nyeong, by nature,

1426
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:19,279
to someone she's interested in,

1427
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,020
does her best, although she asks for understanding.

1428
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,049
I feel that her chat partner...

1429
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,719
is Min Kyung.

1430
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,189
- It rather sounded like Ji Hyeon.
- Ji Hyeon?

1431
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,690
It sounded like Ji Hyeon.

1432
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:34,960
(The second chat)

1433
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:45,240
(The second questioner, Min Kyung, enters.)

1434
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,340
(She starts a chat with Baek Hyun's ex.)

1435
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,880
What I worried about before I went on a date was this.

1436
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,149
He looked rather quiet,

1437
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:03,189
so the date might not be fun, or it could be boring.

1438
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,860
That was what I worried about.

1439
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,259
What should I do to lighten the mood?

1440
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,970
Is it just how he is all the time?

1441
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:15,200
I asked questions about those things.

1442
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:19,910
(He talks a lot only to someone he's interested in.)

1443
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,349
(What are the things I should be careful of?)

1444
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:27,010
(I wonder if there are topics or behaviors he doesn't like.)

1445
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,350
(Nothing special. Like anyone else, no talks on the past or other guys.)

1446
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,620
(I'm curious if he likes to take pictures.)

1447
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,800
(Take pictures after you get familiar.)

1448
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:53,570
(Did you get enough information on Baek Hyun?)

1449
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,540
Not at all.

1450
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:02,150
Everything she said did not satisfy my curiosity.

1451
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,519
So, I wondered...

1452
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,689
if she didn't want to answer my questions.

1453
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,460
That was what I thought.

1454
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:16,460
(Reading the chat window again)

1455
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:19,170
(So serious)

1456
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,770
(May I ask what you usually did for a date together?)

1457
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:30,340
It also took a long time to get the replies.

1458
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,250
She didn't seem to have lingering feelings,

1459
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:38,050
but it seemed she didn't want to tell me about things so much.

1460
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,390
(I'd like your reply, please.)

1461
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,589
(Min Kyung cutely rushes for an answer.)

1462
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:48,730
- She's rushing her.
- She would feel frustrated.

1463
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,370
That would be because there are lingering feelings.

1464
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,040
(She doesn't give up until she gets an answer.)

1465
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,140
(We'd eat good food, go to cafes,)

1466
01:17:57,141 --> 01:17:58,269
(take a walk when the weather is nice, and go to the sea.)

1467
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,980
(I think he likes therapeutic dates.)

1468
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,550
(She's satisfied because she finally got a reply after waiting.)

1469
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:10,150
(But if he likes the person, he'd find everything cute.)

1470
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,560
(Who do you think is Baek Hyun's ex?)

1471
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,590
I think it's Yun Nyeong.

1472
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:22,200
I sensed the energy from the manner of speaking.

1473
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:28,640
Other people seemed...

1474
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:31,170
a little calm.

1475
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,840
I think Yun Nyeong is the only person...

1476
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:37,410
with such a cheerful tone.

1477
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:39,679
That's why I thought like that.

1478
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,320
(Is Yun Nyeong Baek Hyun's ex?)

1479
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:44,320
(Why do you think Yun Nyeong and Baek Hyun are ex-couples?)

1480
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,650
I don't have a reason.

1481
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,260
But it seems weirder because there are none.

1482
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,890
They look like they could get along better,

1483
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,160
but they didn't talk so much to each other.

1484
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,670
So I thought they could be each other's exes.

1485
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:02,400
(The chat ended with her curiosity grown.)

1486
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,569
Baek Hyun and Yun Nyeong do look good together too.

1487
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,640
A very quiet person and a very cheerful person.

1488
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,610
They have opposite personalities.

1489
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,680
(Pyeongchang-dong House)

1490
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,280
- Everyone is sleeping.
- Everyone is sleeping?

1491
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:21,860
I'm glad it's not as hot as I thought.

1492
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,490
- Don't you think so?
- But I think it will soon get hot.

1493
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,490
When this period ends.

1494
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:35,240
(Won Kyu and Yoo Sik are still awkward with each other.)

1495
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,340
(The third chat)

1496
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,580
(The third chat user Ji Yeon enters.)

1497
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:51,190
I was curious about who Won Kyu's ex was,

1498
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,490
and I thought about what I could ask.

1499
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,090
(She starts chatting with Won Kyu's ex.)

1500
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,260
(Can I ask you about Won Kyu?)

1501
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,400
(Yes.)

1502
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,139
(What food does Won Kyu like?)

1503
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,340
(He likes pizza.)

1504
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:14,340
(What food does he dislike?)

1505
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:18,380
(Food that Won Kyu, my ex, dislikes?)

1506
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,150
(Pizza that tastes bad.)

1507
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,820
(Smiling)

1508
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,820
(Laughing)

1509
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:31,230
(Chatting with Won Kyu's ex is quite fun.)

1510
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,630
(What's Won Kyu's ideal type in terms of looks?)

1511
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,130
(Someone tall, fair-skinned, and with a clean look.)

1512
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,169
I asked what his ideal type in terms of looks was,

1513
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:41,340
and the answer was someone tall, fair-skinned,

1514
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,900
and with a clean look.

1515
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,439
But I'm short.

1516
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,080
So I thought I was in trouble after reading that.

1517
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:52,080
(What kind of person does he dislike?)

1518
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,180
(I don't think he prefers people dressing too sexy.)

1519
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,320
(He's a conservative man.)

1520
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,829
She said Won Kyu is a very conservative man.

1521
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:07,060
My ex was like that.

1522
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,759
He was very conservative.

1523
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,870
I thought that was very similar to my ex.

1524
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,799
(So he's conservative. What's Won Kyu's dating style?)

1525
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,570
I asked what his dating style was.

1526
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,740
She said he doesn't make you stressed...

1527
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,840
about keeping in touch or other issues.

1528
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:26,380
She said he's like a cat.

1529
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,720
I asked if he expresses himself well.

1530
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:33,950
She said he always makes you feel that you're being loved.

1531
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:37,120
After reading that, I became curious.

1532
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,360
I wanted to go on a date with him quickly and talk to him.

1533
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,040
(How do you feel about him? Do you still have feelings?)

1534
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:59,180
I asked if she had thoughts about getting back with him.

1535
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,090
(I don't know.)

1536
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:10,359
In other replies, she gave long and thoughtful response,

1537
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,690
but that time, she hesitated a lot...

1538
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,489
and ended up saying she didn't know...

1539
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:14,730
and that it was difficult. When I read that,

1540
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:18,930
it seemed like she had lingering feelings.

1541
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:22,400
So I felt a bit troubled.

1542
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,769
But I became more curious about Won Kyu.

1543
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:30,110
Through the chat with Won Kyu's ex,

1544
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:34,280
my liking for him increased.

1545
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,320
(Her liking for Won Kyu increased through the chat with his ex.)

1546
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:43,119
(The third chat ended.)

1547
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,229
Ji Yeon clearly seems to have a lot of curiosity...

1548
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:47,959
- and liking for Won Kyu.
- Right.

1549
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,460
- She actively tries to talk.
- She's very proactive.

1550
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,600
She has no lingering feelings.

1551
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,870
I really can't tell who Won Kyu's ex is.

1552
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,139
- It's so confusing.
- I'm getting more confused.

1553
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,010
We normally get some guesses.

1554
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,409
They never tell you, right?

1555
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,039
- Right.
- Right.

1556
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,379
We begged them a lot,

1557
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,049
- They don't tell us.
- but they never tell us.

1558
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:08,419
We begged them a lot...

1559
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,749
- We begged them for 4 years, - until we reached season 4.

1560
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,780
but still...

1561
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:15,590
(The fourth chat)

1562
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:20,360
(The last questioner looks determined.)

1563
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:24,100
(Careful)

1564
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,570
(The last questioner Ji Hyeon)

1565
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,940
(She starts chatting with Yoo Sik's ex.)

1566
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,980
(You're Yoo Sik's ex, right?)

1567
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:41,280
(The last responder, Yoo Sik's ex)

1568
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:43,750
(Yes.)

1569
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,989
I tried to ask many questions...

1570
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,060
that could help me get to know Yoo Sik better.

1571
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:56,500
(What kind of woman do you think Yoo Sik likes?)

1572
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:01,670
(The kind of woman Yoo Sik likes?)

1573
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:07,939
(Someone who makes him want to take care of.)

1574
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:10,080
(It's going to be quite hard.)

1575
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,950
(Is there anything I should be careful about on the date?)

1576
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,889
(My ex is kind and treats everyone well,)

1577
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,690
(which could lead to misunderstandings.)

1578
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,460
He's polite and nice, so that could lead to misunderstandings.

1579
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,570
I think this could be my misunderstanding.

1580
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,500
It sounded like she didn't want me to be misled.

1581
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:40,070
But I thought, I'm going to be misled.

1582
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,919
(Would he prefer a woman...)

1583
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,480
(who keeps other guys completely at a distance?)

1584
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,519
(I think you would feel better...)

1585
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,060
(if you just directly asked things you're curious about.)

1586
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,790
- That's strong.
- That's...

1587
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,629
I don't think there's anyone there who would say that.

1588
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:03,859
- I don't think there's anyone.
- There's no one there.

1589
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,700
Ji Hyeon seems the type who could talk like that.

1590
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,140
Maybe Ji Hyeon talked to herself.

1591
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,039
The person could have a different tone on chat and on speech.

1592
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,609
She may talk kindly...

1593
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,639
but talk stiffly on text.

1594
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,409
- Her words were harsh.
- Yes.

1595
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,149
"Ask him yourself if you're curious."

1596
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,079
This is a chat where you ask things you're curious about.

1597
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,149
- Right.
- Right.

1598
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,289
- This is the time for that.
- It's a time for that.

1599
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:28,559
- She didn't like it.
- She didn't like it.

1600
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,819
I think there's a high chance...

1601
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,990
- that she's not in here.
- Right.

1602
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,329
(I think you would feel better...)

1603
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:39,830
(if you just directly asked things you're curious about.)

1604
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,940
(How did you feel when you couldn't get an answer?)

1605
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,940
I could understand her,

1606
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:50,910
but I also thought, "Hey."

1607
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,620
I guess she didn't want to tell me.

1608
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,920
I won't ask.

1609
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:10,530
(What do you think Yoo Sik found attractive about you?)

1610
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:14,970
(I'm not sure.)

1611
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,749
(Yoo Sik's ex was writing a response and stopped.)

1612
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,380
The air was very tense,

1613
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:31,280
but it was also polite.

1614
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:36,020
Also, I thought she had lingering feelings.

1615
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,230
She didn't seem to want to tell me about things.

1616
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:40,960
That's what I thought.

1617
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,400
(Was Yoo Sik usually the one to make up first after an argument?)

1618
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:47,930
(Was Yoo Sik usually the one to make up first after an argument?)

1619
01:26:58,150 --> 01:26:59,610
(No.)

1620
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,950
(Then?)

1621
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,529
(You have to wait...)

1622
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,230
(until he cools off.)

1623
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,800
(That's the part that didn't work out.)

1624
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:30,380
(What makes him seem the happiest? Aside from work.)

1625
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,790
(The moment Yoo Sik seems the happiest)

1626
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,900
(Yoo Sik's ex doesn't reply.)

1627
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:01,170
(He seemed happy when he was with me.)

1628
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,040
Goodness.

1629
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,680
Goodness.

1630
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:08,380
- She was defensive.
- Right.

1631
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,949
She was defending.

1632
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,389
She's telling her not to touch him.

1633
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,019
They would have fought if it was an in-person meeting.

1634
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,660
- Right.
- Yes.

1635
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,790
This...

1636
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,629
I think this was the most intense chat so far.

1637
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:19,989
It's so intense.

1638
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,389
What should she reply?

1639
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,029
What do you think you would say?

1640
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,530
I think I would reply shortly. "Okay."

1641
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,770
- "Okay." - "Okay."

1642
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,769
I think I'd be scared.

1643
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:31,439
I don't think I'd feel good.

1644
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,909
Ji Hyeon would be thinking,

1645
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:35,239
- "Look at this person." - "Look at this person."

1646
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,339
Maybe she's really not here.

1647
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,579
That's possible if she isn't around.

1648
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,379
She totally could be defensive.

1649
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,409
- She doesn't know about her too.
- Yes.

1650
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:43,679
- That could increase the fear.
- Right.

1651
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,890
- Yes.
- Somehow.

1652
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,889
This...

1653
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:50,189
- This is driving me crazy.
- I'm really curious who she is.

1654
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,389
- Right.
- She's tough.

1655
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:52,790
She's really tough.

1656
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,660
(He looked happy when he was with me.)

1657
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:08,480
(I think he gets happy when he's with someone he likes.)

1658
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:18,420
(The person who made Yoo Sik happy.)

1659
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:25,630
(Yoo Sik's ex)

1660
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:29,500
(We'll reveal Yoo Sik's ex.)

1661
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:31,529
- What?
- What?

1662
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:32,930
- Really?
- Already?

1663
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,599
You're going to reveal this?

1664
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,139
- Hold on.
- What's going on?

1665
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:37,169
- Hold on.
- You'll reveal her like this?

1666
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,309
I saw those nails earlier.

1667
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:39,939
Is she there? Or not?

1668
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,379
Min Kyung... Did she have a different color?

1669
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,279
- Then you didn't see them.
- Wait.

1670
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,849
- Why pretend like you know?
- What are you doing?

1671
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,309
- Ji Yeon...
- What did you just do?

1672
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:48,379
You said you saw the nails.

1673
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,720
You didn't see them then.

1674
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:51,550
- What's this?
- I saw them.

1675
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,189
- But it's confusing.
- Confusing?

1676
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:54,689
- Please hear me to the end.
- Okay.

1677
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,559
Is she really in here?

1678
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,459
I think so. That color.

1679
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,359
- She's here?
- Can we just watch?

1680
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,430
- Someone was...
- They said they'll reveal her.

1681
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:08,600
(The person who made Yoo Sik happy.)

1682
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:15,740
(Yoo Sik's ex)

1683
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:19,710
(We'll reveal Yoo Sik's ex.)

1684
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:21,410
(I think he gets happy when he's with someone he likes.)

1685
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:25,919
(Yoo Sik's ex,)

1686
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,190
(Min Kyung)

1687
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:34,129
Of course.

1688
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:35,700
She's no joke!

1689
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:37,730
Seriously.

1690
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,499
The long-term relationship couple gets revealed first.

1691
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,269
We saw the letter for the 1,000th day.

1692
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,769
But they may have been together for more than 1,000 days.

1693
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:47,269
- Right.
- They may have met...

1694
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:48,409
- for around 2,000 days.
- Right.

1695
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:50,539
- The first couple has an impact.
- Right.

1696
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,509
Couples who were together...

1697
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:54,349
for more than three years...

1698
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:56,179
didn't say nice things on the chat.

1699
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,050
- Right.
- It was always like that.

1700
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,419
They weren't that friendly.

1701
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,960
- Right.
- Right.

1702
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:07,690
(Ji Hyeon was chatting with Min Kyung, Yoo Sik's ex.)

1703
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:17,069
(Ji Hyeon, the ex's date, met a wall.)

1704
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:19,110
(I think he gets happy when he's with someone he likes.)

1705
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:30,080
(I'll try to make him happy during our date today!)

1706
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:37,219
This is like "Show Me the Money."

1707
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:39,259
- She doesn't lose.
- She doesn't.

1708
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,929
This is fun. That's what she should do.

1709
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,259
This is what they call the power struggle?

1710
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,859
- The power struggle.
- It is a power struggle.

1711
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:47,029
It's only been two days.

1712
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:49,569
- Right.
- What significance is the two days?

1713
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,469
My 1,000 days are much more important.

1714
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:54,069
But Ji Hyeon isn't weak either.

1715
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,580
Those two...

1716
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,210
(I'll try to make him happy during our date today!)

1717
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:10,090
(Right. What did you normally do on your dates after eating?)

1718
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,929
(Someone who wants to know about the ex)

1719
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:13,960
(Someone who has to tell her about the ex.)

1720
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:17,130
(We would go to watch movies, go to coin karaokes...)

1721
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,800
(Have you also been to amusement parks?)

1722
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:24,900
(He doesn't like amusement parks so much.)

1723
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:28,810
(Then what does he like to do on dates? Calm dates?)

1724
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,080
It was as if she had a list of questions ready.

1725
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,410
She asked very many questions.

1726
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,450
She was more curious...

1727
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,619
about what he liked...

1728
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,819
and what his personality was like...

1729
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,630
more than what she should do at the date.

1730
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:47,690
When I saw those questions, I thought,

1731
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,130
"Does she like him a lot?"

1732
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,329
"Does she have a lot of interest in him?"

1733
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:55,370
That's what I kept thinking.

1734
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,669
(I think he likes healing dates...)

1735
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:00,170
(than calm dates.)

1736
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:06,750
(Ji Hyeon is still curious about Yoo Sik.)

1737
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:08,620
(Have you ever played sports together?)

1738
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,320
(Yes.)

1739
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,350
(What sports did you play?)

1740
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:17,660
(Give me an example.)

1741
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:25,300
(There's jogging, lifting weights at the gym...)

1742
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,499
(There's jogging, lifting weights at the gym,)

1743
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,899
(badminton, golf,)

1744
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,140
(tennis, and so on.)

1745
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:32,609
(Who do you think is asking the questions?)

1746
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:36,710
I think it's Ji Hyeon, who is my roommate.

1747
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,649
Since we share a room together,

1748
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,780
we talk about many things.

1749
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:45,150
I think Ji Hyeon was the only person...

1750
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:48,760
who liked sports.

1751
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,229
The person asked...

1752
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:54,390
about sports in the chat room.

1753
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,499
That made me think...

1754
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,700
it was Ji Hyeon right away.

1755
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:06,810
(Min Kyung realized who ex's date was.)

1756
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:10,180
(We tried everything except golf.)

1757
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:20,350
(I guess you were together for a long time.)

1758
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:16,140
(It wasn't a short period of time.)

1759
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:31,990
(EXchange 4)

1760
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,790
Why did you choose me?

1761
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,090
I don't know if I should say this.

1762
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,330
It was because you were handsome.

1763
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,730
This is crazy.

1764
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:40,970
It felt like we were dating.

1765
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:43,040
I like you.

1766
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,100
Are you flustered?

1767
01:35:44,101 --> 01:35:45,540
No. I'm not flustered.

1768
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:48,340
(A strange feeling he's never felt before)

1769
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:49,939
I'll take a really good photo.

1770
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,139
She looked cute that time.

1771
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,010
- Are you nervous?
- I'm nervous.

1772
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:55,549
I think I was worried...

1773
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:57,750
I'd like him too much.

1774
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:01,090
I'm back.

1775
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,960
You look happy.

1776
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,920
I'm a bit thrilled.

1777
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:06,230
What are you doing?

1778
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,290
Let's go upstairs.

1779
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,860
I don't think I cared about my ex so much.

1780
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,769
I clearly had good feelings...

1781
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:17,399
after the date together.

1782
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,740
I think they became quite close.

1783
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,670
I had to be concerned.

1784
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:25,609
I thought I could be feeling...

1785
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:28,180
a greater variety of feelings here than I thought.

1786
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:29,450
It was fun.
