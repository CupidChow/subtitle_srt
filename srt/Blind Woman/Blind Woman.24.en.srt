♫Let the past scars be carried away by the wind♫

185
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,090
Wanyue.

186
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,270
♫Those who have dreams must first face♫

187
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,330
Look over there.

188
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,750
♫The chaos of the world♫

189
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,490
♫The path ahead still holds uncertainties♫

190
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,790
♫It's hard to tell what's real from false♫

191
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,160
♫What I believed in was trampled at will♫

192
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,670
♫Dismissed as mere dreams and jokes♫

193
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,230
♫If you want to escape this world, wait for the rain to fall♫

194
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,480
♫Watch the fireworks released by the gods♫

195
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,640
♫Just pause for a moment♫

196
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,200
♫Let the nearly barren heart sprout new buds♫

197
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,080
♫Set forth again, and I won't be afraid♫

198
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,760
♫The most resilient flowers bloom on the cliffs♫

199
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,390
♫Let the past scars be carried away by the wind♫

200
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,920
♫Those who have dreams must first face♫

201
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,400
♫The chaos of the world♫
