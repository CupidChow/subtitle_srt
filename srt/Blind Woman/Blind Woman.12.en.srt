1
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,960
She is Lin Wanyue. She is Lin Wanyue.

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
How do you prove she is Lin Wanyue?

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,640
Cheng Hao, tell her.

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,960
Miss Si Yu,

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
When you first met Miss Lin,

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,760
I went to the orphanage to check.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,760
Miss Lin in front of me

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,120
is Lin Wanyue from the orphanage.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,800
It can't be fake.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,160
It's... It's...

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,920
But what?

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Is the answer not clear enough?

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Tell me the truth.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,680
Are you in love with Lin Wanyue?

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,120
I love her.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,560
[I love her.]

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Don't forget that

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm your uncle and aunt.

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,240
chosen for you.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,920
Wanyue.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,880
I always treat Si Yu as my sister.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,560
She is not my fiancée.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Okay.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,840
Let's go.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Tell me the truth.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,400
Are you in love with Lin Wanyue?

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,400
I am in love with her.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,120
Chan.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Yu Yan Chuan is your enemy’s son.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
You can’t fall in love.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Father, you worry too much.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,520
Miss Lin and I can't fight.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,360
Maybe one day, we'll forget each other.

35
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,320
I know what to do.

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,440
Good morning, Wanyue.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,760
Good morning, Mr. Yu.

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
Did what happened last night

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Did it affect you?

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,280
No.

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,840
Okay. Okay.

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,720
Let's go.

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Uncle.

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,040
You and cousin were cheated by her.

45
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
She is not Lin Wanyue.

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
I asked you to do it.

47
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,960
What happened?

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,320
I checked.

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,960
She is Lin Wanyue from the orphanage.

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
I think I'm overthinking.

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
Hello, Tong Tong.

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm the director, Mrs. Xu.

53
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,040
Welcome.

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,200
Hello, Mrs. Xu.

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,080
Tong Tong is so polite.

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
President Xu.

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,640
Please take good care of Tong Tong.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,720
It's okay.

59
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
You've done so much for the orphanage.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,400
I can still

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,400
I can help you.

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
Hurry up.

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,200
Let's go. Wait for me.

64
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,080
We can't catch up. Let's go.

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
Come on. Come on.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,440
Come on. Come on.

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,560
Come on. Come on.

68
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,440
Hurry!

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Wait for me.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm coming for you.

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,440
Wanyue.

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,640
Your husband takes good care of you.

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
I envy him.

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
He's not my husband.

75
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Not now.

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
Not necessarily.

77
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,040
You two are a perfect match.

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,720
are a perfect match.

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
You're so sweet.

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,920
That's why you can be the director.

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,440
Miss Lin.

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,200
How is the investigation of the opium?

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,240
A bunch of idiots.

84
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
Find a way to keep looking.

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,360
Uncle.

86
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,640
What's wrong?

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
Lin Wanyue wants to see you urgently.

88
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,800
She wants you to go to her room.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,120
Why didn't she come alone?

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,520
Her leg is injured.

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
She asked me to deliver a message.

92
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Let’s go.

93
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,720
Yan Chuan.

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,040
You provoked me first.

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,240
Let’s go.

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
You said Lin Wanyue wanted to see me.

97
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,840
This is just an excuse.

98
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
You want...

99
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,520
You want me to have a relationship with Lin Wanyue,

100
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,080
right?

101
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,120
Uncle, I...

102
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,960
Si Yu,

103
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,880
If you want to keep your hopes up,

104
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,840
I advise you to stop thinking about it.

105
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
Uncle, I was wrong.

106
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
I won't do it again.

107
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,520
Lin Wanyue.

108
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,840
I won’t let you go.

109
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
How is Wu Yingtian?

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,720
We robbed the opium

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,200
and cut off Wu Yingtian's money route.

112
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,960
He's in danger now.

113
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,040
What's the rush?

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,400
When the captain's position is lost,

115
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,600
Has he ever thought of talking to Yu Zhenhai?

116
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,960
Of course.

117
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,480
He will visit you tomorrow.

118
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,600
Okay.

119
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,680
Let's take this opportunity

120
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,280
to kill Wu Yingtian.

121
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,880
Miss, you want to use me to kill him?

122
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,280
That's right. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you.

123
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,240
We're going to kill Wu Yingtian! We're going to kill Wu Yingtian! We're going to kill him! We're going to kill him!

124
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,280
before we kill Wu Yingtian. We must find a way

125
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,800
we must find a way

126
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,840
to get all the evidence of Yu Zhenhai.

127
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,480
Got it.
