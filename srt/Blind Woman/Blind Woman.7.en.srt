1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,710
Enough, Mr. Lai!

2
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,480
I don't want to hear your made-up stories

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,390
and lies anymore!

4
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,750
Young Master, Miss Lin and I are back.

5
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,840
No way, no way!

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,390
Lin Wanyue couldn't have gone out.

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,430
She must have been in the room the whole time, Master!

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,840
Let me tell you, Mr. Lai.

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,600
Right after you choked and injured Miss Lin,

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,000
in order to comfort her,

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,240
I specifically asked Cheng Hao to take her to the temple fair.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,110
So everything you just said

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,320
is simply untrue!

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,670
Impossible! Impossible!

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,840
I clearly saw that the person in the room

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,030
was Lin Wanyue!

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,120
Lai Guangsheng!

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,790
If I verify

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,230
this is true,

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,000
you won't get away with it easily!

21
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:10,789
Master.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,039
Thank you, Master.

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,759
Lin Wanyue, I'll kill you!

24
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,039
The old fox is getting desperate.

25
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,710
Lai Guangsheng.

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,870
Lai Guangsheng.

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,430
Lai Guangsheng.

28
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,840
Lai Guangsheng?

29
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,750
Mr. Lai?

30
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,870
Mr. Lai, wake up.

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,630
Mr. Lai?

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,470
Mr. Lai, wake up.

33
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,590
Ghost! Ghost!

34
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,680
Ghost!

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Ghost!

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,750
Wanyue.

37
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,800
What's wrong with Mr. Lai?

38
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,080
Why is he acting so strange?

39
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,190
He must have been severely traumatized,

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,710
causing a mental breakdown.

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,310
Is there a way to treat him?

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,960
It's hard to say.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,190
But I can prescribe

44
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,630
some tranquilizers for him.

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,840
Lai Guangsheng, your days are numbered.

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,150
Mr. Lai, bring me my medicine.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,430
Mr. Lai?

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,910
Yes, Master.

49
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,030
Master, please take your medicine.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,310
Wait.

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,560
You can't take this medicine.

52
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,190
There are monkshood and fritillaria in it.

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,680
Taking it would damage the heart.

54
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

55
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,920
The Master's medicine was personally brewed by me.

56
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,510
How could there be monkshood?

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,830
Mr. Lai, trust my sense of smell.

58
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,480
You blind fool, what nonsense are you spouting?

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,390
Chuan, you're a doctor.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,390
You take a look.

61
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,310
It's true that there are monkshood and Fritillaria.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,800
Young Master, that's impossible.

63
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,870
Master, it's impossible!

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,750
Mr. Lai.

65
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,310
Take good care of yourself from now on.

66
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,310
Don't worry about the family.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
No, Master, I...

68
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,950
Yes, Master.

69
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,000
Lai Guangsheng,

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,750
let's see how you can fight me now.

71
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
This is a hallucinogen.

72
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,190
Long-term use will cause delusions and hallucinations.

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,750
Got it, Miss.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Mother.

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,950
I want to tell you some good news.

76
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
I've found someone I love.

77
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,310
I brought her here to visit you today.

78
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,830
Mother.

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,830
I want to give the jade pendant you gave me

80
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,000
to the one I love.

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,120
Wanyue.

82
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,430
This was left behind by my savior,

83
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800
who saved me from that terrible fire.

84
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,480
Could it be...

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,800
The person who saved you was my mother?

86
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Then, the one who killed my savior...

87
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,430
Is the one who killed my mother?

88
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,830
Let's go find He Dahai.

89
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,310
Okay.

90
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,680
High! High!

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,310
Open it!

92
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,830
Open!

93
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,630
Small!

94
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,160
He Dahai!

95
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,920
He Dahai, stop right there!

96
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:20,920
Stop.

97
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,630
It's you.

98
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,360
Look what this is.

99
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,390
My daughter's whistle?

100
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,430
That's right.

101
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,240
We have your daughter now.

102
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,040
You'd better cooperate with us.

103
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Otherwise...

104
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,800
I think you've got a death wish.

105
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,630
He Dahai!

106
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,270
Yu Yanchuan, you're here at last.

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Once,

108
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,390
I thought I could face

109
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
all the evils and dangers in this world alone.

110
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,390
But at this moment,

111
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
I hope the person in front of me, Yu Yanchuan,

112
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,670
can shield me from the storm

113
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,910
and protect me from harm.

114
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,600
You won’t let me live in peace,

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,270
and neither will you!
