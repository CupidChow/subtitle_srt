Yu Zhenhai,

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,600
you are really a cunning old fox.

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,310
Why is it you again, Yu Yanchuan?

Yu Zhenhai, let Yanchuan go.

12

You want me dead? It won't be that easy!

13
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,810
You killed, set fires, trafficked opium,

14
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,840
and betrayed your country for personal gain. You deserve to die!

15

and the identity is unrecognizable.

98

I learned that my distant aunt was seriously ill,

Their lives were always in danger.

they changed your name

159

and entrusted me with taking care of you.

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,710
It's absolutely impossible.

This seal

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,360
was left to me by Zhong Cheng and his wife back then.

164

The mark on your body

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,400
was branded with this seal, heated red.

166

Ever since I learned about my true identity,

It turns out that you and Wu You

172

are the real culprits who killed my parents.

173
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,190

Yes.

177
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,670
I've been looking for an opportunity to assassinate you these past few days.

Back then,

my father discovered that your parents were transporting opium.

181
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,790
What did we do wrong?

182
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,260
It was them who were transporting opium.

183
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
It was them who killed my parents,

184
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,520
set fire to the warehouse,

185
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,310
and caused everyone inside to die.

Their deaths

187
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,710

191
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,880
She must die today!

192
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,950
Cheng Hao, stop it.

193
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,120
You must have been used by my father.

194
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,240
Used?

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,280
The mark on my arm

196
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,160
is exactly the same as the seal Master gave me.

197
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,880
How could it be fake?

198
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,160
Cheng Hao, don't force me to pull the trigger.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
Wanyue, it's alright.

200
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,760
Today I heard that

201
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,430
the newly appointed chairman of the first business association in Jiangcheng, Yu Yanchuan,

202
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,830
will marry Miss Jiang Chan, the daughter of the former chairman, Jiang Yude,

203
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,120
at Desheng Church tomorrow.

204
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,430
The Jiang Chan you're talking about, is she the blind one?

205
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,070
I don't know.

206
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,590
Lin Wanyue,

207
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,040
I must kill you!

208
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,190
I must kill you all!
