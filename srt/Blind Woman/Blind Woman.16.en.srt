1
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,800
Wu Yingtian is dead

2
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
Yu Zhenhai has no obstacles.

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,640
He will migrate abroad as soon as possible.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,960
It seems that

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,800
we have to kill Zhenhai as soon as possible.

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,560
Is the evidence of Yu Zhenhai killing his wife confirmed?

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
Yes, it's true.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,680
I didn't expect that

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,480
Yu Yanchuan's mother

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
was really killed by Yu Zhenhai.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,760
Okay.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,920
The next step is

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,680
is to let Yu Zhenhai

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,320
the pain of turning against his own son.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,160
I will use Yan Chuan

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,360
to get rid of Yu Zhenhai.

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,480
Chan,

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,960
People may not believe in destiny,

19
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
but you have to believe in karma.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,320
This time

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
It's your turn. It's your turn.

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
Yu Zhenhai.

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,040
Here you are. Thank you.

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,240
Director Wu.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,240
You finally called me out.

26
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,640
just to buy me coffee?

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
I found this

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,920
I found out by accident

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,680
your mother was killed by Yu Zhenhai.

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Why did you kill my mother?

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,840
Chuan.

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Where did you get these?

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
Wu You gave them to me.

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Chuan.

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
You haven't experienced anything yet.

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
These things

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,240
were made

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
by Wu Yingtian.

39
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,160
The purpose is to

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
at the critical moment.

41
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,760
Don't take it seriously.

42
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,160
Do you think I'll still believe you?

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,360
Chuan,

44
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
No matter how bad I am,

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,680
I would never kill my wife.

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,800
[Your mother is the one who killed your wife.] [Father!]

47
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,320
[Chuan!] [Father!]

48
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,440
Chuan!

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,200
What happened?

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,320
Is it possible to send Director Wu away

51
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
and Wu You?

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,399
God's grinding plate is slow,

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
but it's very detailed.

54
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm waiting for the good show between father and son.

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,400
Mr. Yu,

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
What brings you here?

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,800
Director Wu.

58
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,320
Here comes the new official.

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
Congratulations.

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,880
I should have come to visit you

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,440
on the first day you took office.

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Something happened at home yesterday.

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,760
I was so worried.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,960
Please forgive me, Director Wu.

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm so worried.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,280
I think President Yu is busy leaving Jiangcheng.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Sorry, Director Wu.

68
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,560
What worries me is that

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
Yesterday, Chuan

70
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,840
received an unidentified evidence

71
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
to prove that I killed my wife.

72
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm here

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,840
to learn from you.

74
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
How should I prove my innocence?

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,760
and restore our relationship?

76
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,840
Actually,

77
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,840
can be solved.

78
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,600
Go ahead, Director Wu.

79
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,480
As long as you stay in Jiangcheng,

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,440
we'll continue our business with my foster father.

81
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
you'll be cleared

82
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
will be cleared.

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,720
There are no

84
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,880
in Jiangcheng

85
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,720
for me to stay.

86
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
Immigrate abroad?

87
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,520
I've already decided.

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
In that case,

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,200
please stay at home

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,120
and fix your relationship with your son.

91
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,720
Don't go anywhere.

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Director Wu.

93
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't be shameless.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
President Yu.

95
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,080
Please go back.

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,560
Let's go. Okay.

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Mother.

98
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,520
Father said you died in an accident.

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,320
but he killed you.

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,440
Yan Chuan.

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Don't be sad.

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Maybe the evidence Wu You gave you is fake.

103
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,440
It's written clearly that

104
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,360
How could it be fake?

105
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,720
Even if he really killed your mother,

106
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,200
he's still your biological father.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
So what?

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
He killed my mother.

109
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,120
Yu Zhenhai,

110
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Let's see what you're going to do next.

111
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
Are you really going to

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,159
kill your biological father

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
and avenge your mother?

114
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Chuan,

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,400
You can kill me now.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
Yu Zhenhai.

117
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,880
You evil beast!

118
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,520
Why did you kill my mother?

119
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,760
I admit

120
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,120
I killed your mother.

121
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,640
But back then,

122
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
was forced by Director Wu.

123
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
If you don't kill your mother,

124
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,799
you're the only one who died.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
All these years,

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,440
I've been living in guilt.

127
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm sorry to your mother.

128
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Chuan.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Chuan!

130
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,880
Kill me.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,680
Chuan.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
Kill me.

133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,240
I don't want to live with guilt anymore.

134
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,600
I’m living a miserable life now.

135
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,080
Yu Yan Chuan,

136
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
I’ve been waiting for this moment for too long.

137
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,520
Shoot me.

138
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,160
Kill this evil beast!

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,920
Shoot him!
