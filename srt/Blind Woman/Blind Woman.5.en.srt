1
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,560
Jiang Chan.

2
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,640
Jiang Chan.

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,790
You didn't die in that fire?

4
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,710
You've got the wrong person.

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,960
I am Lin Wanyue.

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,150
You can't fool me.

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,430
You're Jiang Yude's daughter, Jiang Chan!

8
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,390
Master, you are back.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,310
Xiang,

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,400
why is the house so dark?

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,789
Master, the power just went out.

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,950
Xiang,

13
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,590
help the master to the living room

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,950
and make him a bowl of kudzu soup to sober him up.

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,510
Okay, Mr. Lai.

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,350
Young Master, you're back.

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,070
Who's this lady?

18
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,950
This is my friend, Miss Lin Wanyue.

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,430
She's staying here for a few days.

20
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,479
Miss Lin is so beautiful.

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,430
This is the first time I've seen you

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,120
bring a female friend home.

23
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,920
Young Master, I'll get back to work then.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,200
Bei,

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
remember the scent of Yu Zhenhai.

26
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
It's time to show your fangs.

27
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,870
Who is it?

28
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,590
You're the blind woman who identified my son at the police station,

29
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,840
Lin Wanyue?

30
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,870
It's me.

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,870
You're quite pretty.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,560
Then tell me,

33
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,120
why are you here?

34
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,630
My puppy is missing.

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,840
I came to find my puppy.

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,590
The power is back on.

37
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,840
Master, please have some soup.

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Didn't you see I was talking to Miss Lin?

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm sorry, Master.

40
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,520
I was wrong.

41
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,280
Clean this up.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Make the master another bowl of sobering soup.

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,150
Yes, Mr. Lai.

44
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,870
Master, you are drunk.

45
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,280
Please go back to your room and rest.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,150
Don't play tricks on me.

47
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,870
You know what I want to ask.

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,390
Master,

49
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,000
I have no improper intentions toward the young master.

50
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,680
It was the young master who asked me to stay in the mansion.

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,480
What was his reason?

52
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,120
The murderer of Mr. and Mrs. Zhong

53
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,630
still has not been caught.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,159
Captain Wu forced me to identify the young master as the murderer.

55
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,070
I know he is innocent,

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
so I refused.

57
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,120
But he wanted to kill me.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
It was the young master who saved me.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,000
He asked me to stay in the mansion

60
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,510
to prevent Captain Wu

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
from coming after me again.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,510
Miss Lin,

63
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,720
your words are indeed convincing,

64
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,120
but you can't fool me.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,270
What I said is the truth.

66
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,680
You can ask the young master.

67
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,270
Take your beast and get lost!

68
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,160
Miss Lin, your dog.

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,310
Thank you, Master Yu.

70
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,510
Lin Wanyue.

71
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,240
Miss.

72
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,800
How are you doing at Yu's Mansion?

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,120
Everything is fine.

74
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm just glad that you're fine.

75
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,480
I'm an outsider who suddenly appeared at Yu's Mansion.

76
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
Yu Zhenhai was wary of me.

77
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,630
Bringing him down

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
won't be easy.

79
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,070
We can start with Lai Guangsheng.

80
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,310
Okay.

81
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,000
Find the ledger where

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,560
Lai Guangsheng recorded his embezzlement behind Yu Zhenhai's back as soon as you can.

83
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,270
Yes, Miss.

84
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,190
Miss Lin,

85
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,240
the young master asked me to tell you

86
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
that he found a job for you

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,000
playing the piano for the choir at the church.

88
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,800
Really?

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
Please thank Mr. Yu for me.

90
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,390
Miss Lin, you're very thoughtful. You're welcome.

91
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,120
Mr. Lai, please wait.

92
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,680
Miss Lin, what can I do for you?

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,870
Have a cup of tea.

94
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,270
Thank you, Miss Lin.

95
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
How did she know I was leaving?

96
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,870
Is she pretending to be blind?

97
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
Thank you for your tea, Miss Lin.

98
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,390
You're welcome.

99
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,240
I'll leave you to it.

100
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,159
He really is quite vigilant.

101
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,920
This old fox.

102
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't move. Let me handle it.

103
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,950
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

104
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,160
I was trying to get some water

105
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,070
but accidentally knocked the cup over.

106
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,870
No need to thank me.

107
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,720
You just moved in

108
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,270
and are not familiar with this place yet.

109
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,120
You'll get used to it after a few days.

110
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,870
Thank you for your understanding.

111
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,390
I...

112
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,480
I saw there was a glass shard on your foot,

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,240
so I took it off for you.

114
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,080
Thank you.

115
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
This is the first time I've met someone

116
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,150
as thoughtful and considerate as you.

117
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Yu Yanchuan,

118
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,440
only if you fall in love with me

119
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,750
will I be able to complete my revenge.

120
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,670
Chuan,

121
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,790
be honest with me.

122
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,270
Do you like Miss Lin?

123
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,550
A little bit.

124
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,240
Chuan,

125
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,720
we're immigrating soon.

126
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,440
In three months at most,

127
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,240
we'll be leaving Jiangcheng.

128
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,440
Besides,

129
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,550
women are

130
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,080
a dime a dozen

131
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,720
for someone of your status.

132
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,360
Why do you have to get so attached to a blind woman?

133
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,480
Listen to me.

134
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't get too serious with her.

135
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,390
Father, you're overthinking it.

136
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,630
Miss Lin and I are completely unrelated.

137
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,960
I know what to do.

138
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,270
That's good.

139
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,480
During this time,

140
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
avoid getting into trouble outside.

141
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Focus on wrapping up the hospital handover.

142
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,240
Yes, Father.

143
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,240
Looks like I don't have much time left.

144
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,240
Miss,

145
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,270
I've found the ledger that shows how much Zhong Cheng

146
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
and Lai Guangsheng embezzled behind Yu Zhenhai's back.

147
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,000
Great.

148
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,390
With this ledger,

149
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,080
Yu Zhenhai will lose trust in Lai Guangsheng,

150
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,720
and we can take the chance to kill him.

151
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,270
However,

152
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,390
we can't do it at Yu's Mansion.

153
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,200
We need to lure Lai Guangsheng out.

154
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,480
Okay.

155
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,120
I'll discuss it with Xiang.

156
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,440
Mr. Lai.

157
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,600
I have something here.

158
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,960
Do you want to take a look?

159
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,550
What is it?

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
The ledger that records your embezzlement.

161
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,120
Go to hell!

162
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,200
You little bitch.

163
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,030
You are trying to blackmail me with the ledger?

164
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,910
You'll have to wait for the next life!
