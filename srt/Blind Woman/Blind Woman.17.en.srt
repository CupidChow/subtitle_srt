1
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,760
Yu Zhenhai,

2
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,840
though you schemed and

3
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,030
were clever all your life,

4
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,430
you never expected

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,710
to die at your own son's hands, did you?

6
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,920
Yu Zhenhai.

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,600
Since you are my father,

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,240
I can spare your life.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,840
But I will never forgive you

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
for my mother's death.

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,710
Thank you, Chuan!

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,680
Yu Zhenhai.

13
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,430
Since your son can't bring himself to do it,

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll give him a hand one more time.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,710
Yu Zhenhai.

16
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,000
Since you are my father,

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,710
I can spare your life.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,759
But I will never forgive you

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,789
for my mother's death.

20
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,640
Master, it's time for your medicine.

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,520
This was Chuan's mother's favorite song.

22
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,750
Meihui.

23
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,840
Is that you, Meihui?

24
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,800
Meihui!!

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,310
Meihui.

26
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,030
I'm not...

27
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,000
I've missed you so much.

28
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,710
Meihui.

29
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
-Meihui. -I'm not her.

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm Zhenhai, Meihui.

31
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,520
-I'm not her. -Meihui!

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,750
You, let go of me!

33
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
Meihui, I've missed you so much.

34
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,800
-I'm not her. -Meihui.

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,630
You've got the wrong person!

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Meihui.

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
-Meihui. -I'm not her.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm Zhenhai.

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,470
Young Master, Master...

40
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,560
What's wrong?

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,310
Master is acting inappropriately with Miss Lin.

42
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,800
Yu Zhenhai!

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,390
Yu Zhenhai, are you still human?

44
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,600
Who are you?

45
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,870
Do you believe I'll shoot you?

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,190
Shoot.

47
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,560
Shoot him.

48
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,159
You... you...

49
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,120
Wanyue, are you alright?

50
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,750
Let's go.

51
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,830
Yu Yanchuan still couldn't bring himself to kill Yu Zhenhai.

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,830
Looks like the patricide plan still needs more work.

53
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,630
Miss,

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,270
is there any other way

55
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,430
to make this fire of revenge burn hotter?

56
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,160
Yes.

57
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,480
I'll marry Yu Yanchuan

58
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,190
and force Yu Zhenhai to kill me.

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,159
No.

60
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,070
We can use other ways.

61
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,560
Why does it have to be this one?

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,560
I don't agree.

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,270
This is the best option we have for now.

64
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,560
But...

65
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,270
Don't worry.

66
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
I will protect myself.

67
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,720
Tell me, did you put the hallucinogenic drug?

68
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,190
Master, I wouldn't dare.

69
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,830
I don't know anything.

70
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,390
Won't talk, eh?

71
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,390
Then don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

72
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,560
Did you see anyone else

73
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,830
in the kitchen that night?

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
I only remember...

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Miss Lin came to the kitchen that night.

76
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,360
Lin Wanyue.

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,120
Lin Wanyue.

78
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I've always treated you well.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,630
Why did you drug me and set me up?

80
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,040
I didn't.

81
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,830
You still deny it?

82
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,430
The maid who prepared the medicine has told me everything.

83
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,159
That night, besides her,

84
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,120
only you went to the kitchen!

85
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,159
I did go,

86
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,800
but I went to wash some fruit.

87
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,600
You still won't admit it?

88
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,190
It really wasn't me.

89
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,680
Yu Zhenhai, stop!

90
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,159
I've already checked the drug residues from last night.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,270
There's no hallucinogenic substance in it at all!

92
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,040
The reason why you hallucinated

93
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,680
was that several types of medicine were boiled together.

94
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,950
Do you understand?

95
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,190
Then I...

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
Thank goodness I switched the medicine residue last night...

97
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,390
Then...

98
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,270
Then...

99
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,070
Chuan, actually, that night I...

100
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,240
I don't want to hear your explanation!

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Get out now!

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,510
Wanyue.

103
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,950
Did Yu Zhenhai do anything to you?

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,480
After what Yu Zhenhai did to you yesterday,

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,600
he not only feels no guilt

106
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,390
but even came to criticize you today.

107
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,870
Yanchuan,

108
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,920
I know you are sad about your mother.

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,360
But

110
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,360
you can't keep being so negative.

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,870
Just do it for me, okay?

112
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,510
For you?

113
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Chuan.

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,950
Please wait for a moment with Wanyue.

115
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,830
Wanyue.

116
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,270
I'm very sorry

117
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,510
about what happened last night.

118
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,190
Chuan.

119
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,920
How are the preparations

120
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,430
for emigration coming along?

121
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
What a lovely daydream.

122
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,950
From now on,

123
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,390
I won't leave Jiangcheng again.

124
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,080
Chuan.

125
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,549
You promised me before.

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,510
Why did you change your mind?

127
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,440
Wanyue has agreed to marry me.

128
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
We will live well in Jiangcheng

129
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,240
and won't go anywhere.

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,270
Uncle,

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120
we truly love each other.

132
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,390
Please give us your blessing.

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,150
Lin Wanyue.

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,790
It's you

135
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,440
who's taken Chuan away from me.

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
It's you

137
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,870
who's made Chuan become like this!

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,150
You're the one who broke his heart,

139
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,120
and that's why he's like this.

140
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,750
You...

141
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,150
Yu Zhenhai, enough!

142
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
I couldn't stop you

143
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,390
when you killed my mother years ago.

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,790
But if you try to hurt Wanyue now,

145
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,550
I won't let you get away with it.

146
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,750
You ungrateful son.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,390
Are you going against your father

148
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,120
just for this woman?

149
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,550
Think whatever you want.

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,510
But if you want me to go abroad with you,

151
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,790
I advise you to stop daydreaming!

152
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,870
Yu Zhenhai.

153
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,790
I will slowly break you down...

154
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,790
until you die.

155
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,360
Bury Lin Wanyue alive.

156
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,790
After it's done,

157
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,360
500 silver coins each.

158
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,840
Thank you, Chairman. Consider it done.

159
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,270
Lin Wanyue.

160
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,670
Die.

161
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,790
You must die.

162
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,080
Fine.

163
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,440
I'll play along with your plan.

164
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,840
Wanyue!

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,670
Her walking stick.

166
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,910
Wanyue would never leave her walking stick behind.

167
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,480
Unless...
