1
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,360
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,920
Miss Lin. Miss Lin.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,200
Miss Lin!

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,600
Help! Help!

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,240
Help! Help!

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,680
Miss Lin.

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,040
She's here. She's here.

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Are you okay? Are you okay?

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm fine.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,640
Let's go home.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,280
Master Yu.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
I promised you

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
to perform for you on your birthday.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm afraid I'll break my promise.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,800
Also,

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,600
I promised you

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,520
I'll move out after your birthday.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,600
You took a bullet for my father.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,039
He was grateful to you.

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,320
Why would he kick you out?

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,160
Right, father?

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,520
Miss Lin.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,759
My father won't be ungrateful.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,039
Just stay here.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,039
Thank you, Master Yu.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,680
Let's go.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,240
Yu Zhenhai, you want to kick me out?

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,039
How can it be so easy?

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,320
Chuan,

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
Did you find the person who hurt Miss Lin?

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Yes.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,200
It's Wu Yingtian's man.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,280
It's Wu Yingtian again.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,400
It seems that he will keep threatening us

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,000
he'll keep threatening us.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,600
Uncle. Uncle.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
Hi, Si Yu. Hi.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Why are you here?

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
How can I miss my uncle's birthday?

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
I worked so hard to come here.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,120
Si Yu.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
You gave me

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,160
a big surprise today.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,200
Wait for me

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
I'll go to the kitchen

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
to cook some favorite dishes for you.

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
Let's welcome you. Okay.

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,280
Okay.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,720
Chuan, keep Si Yu company.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,960
Cousin, did you miss me?

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
You're an adult.

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,280
You're still the same as when you were young.

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,440
How inappropriate!

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,360
Do you want it or not?

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Yes.

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
Cousin.

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,200
Take care

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,000
My cousin

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Who is she?

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Why are you so nice to her?

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
This is Miss Lin Wanyue.

63
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
She’s blind again.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,200
She needs someone to take care of her.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
I thought it was someone.

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Turns out he's a disabled blind man.

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,400
Tsukasa, speak properly.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,680
Be polite.

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,079
Hello, Miss Lin Wanyue.

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,840
I am

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,960
my cousin, Yan Chuan,

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
and his fiancée, Si Yu.

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
Hello, Miss Si Yu.

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,920
I'm Mr. Yu's friend.

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
I'll stay here for a while.

76
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't believe it.

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
Listen to my advice. Get lost tomorrow.

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,880
This is Yu Residence, not Si Residence.

79
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll follow Mr. Yu's arrangement.

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,920
You...

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Alright, Si Yu.

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,280
Stop it.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Cousin, I'm not.

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,160
Can't you see she's bullying me?

85
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,520
I can.

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
You've been forcing me.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,000
Apologize to Miss Lin.

88
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,040
No way to apologize to her.

89
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
Lin Wanyue, I warn you.

90
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
If you don’t leave,

91
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,079
I won't let you go.

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,800
Stop!

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Uncle.

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,720
Si Yu.

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,320
Miss Lin is indebted to our family.

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
You should treat us with respect.

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,840
Don't go too far.

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
Are you okay?

99
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm fine.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,960
Now we know

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
the murderer of my mother is Director Wu.

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,800
What's your plan next?

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,960
I want to send Tong Tong to the orphanage

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,240
and continue to find Director Wu.

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,159
Okay, I'll listen to you.

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,159
Cousin, it's me.

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Open the door.

108
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Oh no!

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,040
If Si Yu sees you,

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,120
if Si Yu sees you.

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,480
What should we do?

112
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,320
Follow me.

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,080
Si Yu, what are you doing?

114
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,080
I heard you talking to someone else.

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,400
You heard it wrong.

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,080
I'm the only one here.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,040
I don't believe it.

118
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,360
Si Yu.

119
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
What are you doing?

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
Of course I'm here to give you a gift.

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,200
What gift?

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Si Yu.

123
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,440
What did you smell for me?

124
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,400
Dear cousin.

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,120
Of course it's me

126
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,760
Let's go.

127
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Blood!

128
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Yu, Si Yu left.

129
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,360
Si Yu has been unconscious since young.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
She just fainted.

131
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,560
Blood.

132
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
You're hurt.

133
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,200
Leave me alone.

134
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,440
I haven't gotten rid of the drug yet.

135
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,640
Go now.

136
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,640
Okay.

137
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,600
Yu Yan Chuan,

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,320
Although you are the son of my enemy,

139
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,960
I still can't hate you.

140
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,720
Okay.

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,039
Great! Great!

142
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,520
All relatives and friends gather here.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's celebrate Chairman Yu's 50th birthday.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,760
Let's raise our glasses.

145
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
to the president.

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,040
President Yu.

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
A toast to you.

148
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,040
Welcome.

149
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Let's drink together.

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Come on.

151
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
Thank you.

152
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Let’s welcome Miss Lin Wanyue to the stage.

153
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,720
to sing a song for President Yu tonight.

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Bravo! Bravo!

155
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,800
Lin Wanyue, stop!

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,680
Si Yu!

157
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
Miss Si Yu.

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,800
What are you doing?

159
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,480
I'm going to embarrass you tonight.

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,760
I advise you to stay out of trouble.

161
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,720
This...

162
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,640
Why are there so many scars?

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
It's so scary.

164
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,160
Yeah

165
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,240
This is too scary.

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,120
Her back is full of scars.

167
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,960
How did Young Master Yu find this woman?

168
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,840
Si Yu, if you keep messing around,

169
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Get out!

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,360
Lin Wanyue.

171
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,880
I don't think you can perform tonight.

172
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,000
Uncle.

173
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,000
You and cousin were cheated by her.

174
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,760
She is not Lin Wanyue.

175
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,040
She is not Lin Wanyue. What?

176
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Si Yu.

177
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,880
You have no evidence. What nonsense are you talking about?

178
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm not.

179
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,520
I know Lin Wanyue from the orphanage.

180
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,680
She doesn’t look like this at all.

181
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
I can prove

182
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,720
she is Lin Wanyue from the orphanage.

183
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm here. Don't be afraid.
