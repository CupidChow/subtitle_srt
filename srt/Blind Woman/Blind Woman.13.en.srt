1
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,560
I’m here to see you. I’m here to see you.

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,120
What’s up? I’m here.

3
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,880
What?

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,120
You slept with my man.

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,560
Can't you let me vent my anger?

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,760
Your man.

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,760
Lin Wanyue, you bitch!

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,520
Do you think you can get him forever

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,880
if you sleep with my cousin?

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,840
At least he's mine now.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,600
You bitch!

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,520
How dare you hit me?

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,080
Hit me! I'll kill you!

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,760
Stop! Stop!

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,920
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,720
Stop it

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,720
Come on

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,320
She hit me.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,680
Do you think I'll believe you?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,360
What did she do to you

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,320
to help her?

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,000
Get out!

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,440
Get out! Get out!

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,160
Are you all right?

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,520
Director Wu, have some tea.

26
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,720
My master is on his way back.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Go ahead.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,360
[Wu You, I'm here to see you.] [I'm here to see you.] I'm here.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,160
I heard that

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,840
a beautiful blind lady came to the Yu family.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,560
It's her, right?

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,440
Yes, Godfather.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,040
After seeing you today,

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,840
You deserve your reputation.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,200
Miss Lin.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,040
Your high heels.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Hello. Hello.

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
Who are you?

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,520
This is Director Wu.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,640
Thank you, Director Wu.

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,760
If you don't mind,

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,640
can I put it on for you?

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
Thank you, Director Wu.

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Your shoes are ready.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
Thank you, Director Wu.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
Bye.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,000
Lin Wanyue,

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,560
I know you want to avenge my mother.

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,360
but you didn't have to

50
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
to get close to Director Wu.

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,320
Mr. Yu.

52
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,440
I didn't make it to the birthday banquet last time.

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,440
I brought you the birthday gift today.

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
Thank you, Director Wu.

55
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Thank you.

56
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
It's nothing.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,400
What really worries me

58
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,400
is the opium we lost.

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,159
It’s been almost a month.

60
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,680
Haven't you heard anything?

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,960
Not yet.

62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,480
But once there is any news,

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,600
I will inform you immediately.

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,240
Yu Zhenhai.

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,080
If I can't be the police chief,

66
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
you won't live a good life.

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,320
Chief Wu, don't worry.

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,440
Please give me more time.

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
When we find the opium,

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,800
and get the money from the opium.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
You can take 90% of it.

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,880
I'll take 10% of the rest.

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
What do you think?

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,880
You said it yourself.

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,760
Don't regret it then.

76
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,280
I'm a man of my word.

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Mr. Yu,

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
If I remember correctly,

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,480
you have a niece named Si Yu.

80
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,480
Right?

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,960
Chief Wu, don't worry.

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,080
I'll deal with it properly.

83
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Okay.

84
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
That's what I want.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,800
Uncle, I don't want to leave.

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
I want to stay here.

87
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,440
It's not up to you to decide.

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,680
Leave Jiangcheng as soon as possible.

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
What did I do wrong?

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,800
I'll explain later.

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
Let's go.

92
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,120
I...

93
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,280
to the train station safely.

94
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,960
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,640
Let's go.

96
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,720
Si Yu, I'm sorry.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
Boss, what are you doing?

98
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,159
routine check.

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Who's in the back?

100
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,560
It's my lady.

101
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,520
Open it.

102
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,720
Stop!

103
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,640
Godfather.

104
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Keep it for him to go back and inform him.

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,800
as a warning to Yu Zhenhai.

106
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Father.

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
I want to know

108
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,280
why you suddenly drove Si Yu away.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
I accidentally

110
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,120
overheard Wu Yingtian bribing an official.

111
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
I was afraid Wu Yingtian would take revenge on her.

112
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
So I had to do it.

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,039
Oh, I see. I see.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,520
Sir! Sir! Sir!

115
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Mr. Li. Mr. Li. Mr. Li.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,520
Go ahead.

117
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
I was stopped by Director Wu's men

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,040
I was stopped by Director Wu's men.

119
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,080
Miss Si Yu...

120
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
What happened to Si Yu?

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,200
She was shot to death by Director Wu's men.

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,640
Father.

123
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,360
Wu Yingtian

124
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,520
to get us into trouble.

125
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
He killed Si Yu.

126
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
You may leave.

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Wu Yingtian,

128
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,400
You finally killed Si Yu.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,640
I must avenge Si Yu.

130
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
I must kill Wu Yingtian with my own hands.

131
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,240
Stop!

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
Chuan, calm down.

133
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,080
Don't act recklessly.

134
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
I have an idea.

135
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,680
Go ahead.

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
In the countryside,

137
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
if the dog doesn't listen,

138
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,920
will have a obedient puppy.

139
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,120
You mean

140
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
we can work with Wu You?

141
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,800
Wu You.

142
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
Place your bets. Place your bets.

143
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,680
Director Wu.

144
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
I'm really unlucky today.

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's play two more rounds.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,680
I quit.

147
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,400
Chief!

148
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,840
Have a drink.

149
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
Isn't this Miss Lin?

150
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,720
Miss Lin, we're destined to meet.

151
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
High-end hunters

152
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,640
usually appear in the way of prey.
