[Blind Woman]

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,870
[Episode 3: He Took the Bait]

3
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,710
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

4
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,530
How did you know my last name is Yu?

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,350
And how did you know my address?

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,850
Then, I'll be straightforward with you.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,280
Why didn't you identify me at the police station?

8
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,320
Because I want to make a deal with you.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,010
A deal?

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,290
I'll help clear your name,

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,800
and in return, you help me find someone.

12
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,210
Who?

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,600
The person who killed my savior.

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,560
Deal.

15
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,280
Miss, someone is outside.

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,350
Why are you still coming back here?

17
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:35,390
Leave!

18
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,140
Pay me my salary.

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,250
I haven't killed you yet,

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,200
and you're still asking me for money?

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,509
You won't pay me, right?

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,860
I'll report you to the police right now.

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Report to the police?

24
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,430
Go ahead!

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,120
Go ahead and report it!

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,000
Let go of me!

27
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,660
I'll kill you.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,370
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
-What are you doing?
-Let go of me!

30
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,240
Playing dirty, huh?

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,970
Of course not.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,070
I have other matters to attend to. You guys talk.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,630
Miss Lin, are you alright?

34
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,590
I'm fine.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,150
May I ask who you are?

36
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,940
I'm Cheng Hao, Young Master Yan Chuan's assistant.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
Our Young Master wants to see you.

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,500
Looks like he took the bait.

39
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,829
Young Master, Miss Lin is here.

40
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,329
What happened to your neck?

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,180
Her boss did it.

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,710
Did I ask you? Get out.

43
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,520
Cheng Hao told me

44
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,480
that you've found the person who killed my savior, right?

45
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,400
I've found his record.

46
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,240
He is in the hospital right now.

47
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,060
He Dahai, 36 years old,

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
was once under Wu Yingtian's command.

49
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,700
He has killed before and served time.

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,079
A year ago, he got addicted to opium,

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
and now he's in the hospital for treatment.

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,120
Mr. Yu.

53
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,350
Sorry.

54
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,480
I was walking too slow.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,510
♫There is so much I want to say that I can't remember♫

57
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,540
♫My heart crumpled into a ball, stolen by someone♫

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,590
♫When I was gazing at the sea of clouds alone♫

59
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,150
♫You and I ran into each other in some alley♫

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,560
Let's go.

61
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,570
♫Carrying that dream while crossing mountains and ridges♫

62
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,570
♫Grasping destiny's sleeve and waiting for me at the intersection♫

63
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,400
♫Let those who look down on me come to know, one by one♫

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,060
♫To believe in me and understand me♫

65
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,740
♫As I cross that sky♫

66
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,520
♫Who will be waiting for me?♫

67
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,360
♫Dreams are like clouds that will bloom♫

68
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,700
♫I'm glad I walked with you♫

69
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,610
♫And arrived in this different space and time♫

70
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,210
♫The future has fallen into my eyes♫

71
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,060
♫I lift my head high♫

72
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,240
Miss Lin, are you alright?

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
He Dahai, stop!

74
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,350
I'm sorry!

75
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,460
♫I push hard to topple the darkness♫

76
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,840
♫A corner of light emerges♫

77
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,840
♫You spread your wings♫

78
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,080
♫Dancing quietly♫

79
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,400
♫You've been through surging waves♫

80
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,760
♫Sending out signals♫

81
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,680
♫I say, in this world♫

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,020
♫There's still some beauty♫

83
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,980
♫The night sky is upside down, with gentle hues♫

84
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,620
♫If love could be the cure♫

85
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,530
♫I'd search for you, for what was once lost♫

86
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,780
♫Those playful jokes♫

87
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,680
Miss Lin, sorry.

88
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
He Dahai has escaped.

89
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,850
♫Waiting until you're ready to touch the heartbeat of the world♫

90
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,300
Hold my hand tight.

91
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,800
♫It's also a sign of me rushing toward you♫

92
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,170
♫As the ice and snow melt away, I wait for your embrace♫

93
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,750
♫Waiting for the rainbow to stretch across every path♫

94
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,430
♫And in your world, there is no more noise♫

95
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,159
♫I'm here, and you'll eventually feel it♫

96
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,460
♫I push hard to topple the darkness♫

97
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,840
♫A corner of light emerges♫

98
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,860
♫You spread your wings♫

99
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,180
♫Dancing quietly♫

100
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Yu Yanchuan, I'm sorry.

101
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,840
In order to get close to your father, Yu Zhenhai,

102
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,360
I have to make you my pawn.

103
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,360
Mr. Zhong?

104
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,790
Come in.

105
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,360
Hello?
