00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,670
Think carefully.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
Is there anything else you need to bring back to the Yu Mansion?

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,350
I've packed everything.

7
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,200
Don't worry.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,880
Miss, Mr. Yu,

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,670
we've got a confidential document

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,280
and found that Yu Zhenhai's other identity

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,800
is a Japanese agent in China.

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,300
I didn't expect

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,960
he was working for the Japanese.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
So that's why Yu Zhenhai is in such a hurry to leave the country.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,560
It's because his identity as an agent had been exposed.

I was born into a tainted family.

A person's birth is not something they can choose,

but their beliefs can be.

I can save some innocent people who have been harmed.

Yu Zhenhai, you monster!

111

Impossible.

Wasn't she making a fuss about leaving Jiangcheng?

Why would she go to the dock?

164

Miss Si Yu appears to be searching for someone known as "Ghost Hand."

00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,750
Looks like something really happened to Cheng Hao.

166

Looks like Yu Zhenhai has realized

169

that he can't stay in Jiangcheng anymore.

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
I have a plan.

171

We can pretend to be Ghost Hand

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,450
and lure Yu Zhenhai into our trap.

173

He often went to Japan.

Don't worry.

189
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,590
I'll keep my word.

190
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,230
Ghost Hand.

191
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,470
Secretary Yu?

192
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,630
No.

193
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,280
I should call you Chairman Yu now.

194
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,610
Ghost Hand.

195
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,960
You should know my situation very well.

196
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,710
Don't mock me now.

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,440
Everyone has their low points.

198
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,610
Chairman Yu, who knows, maybe your luck will turn around

199
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
and you'll rise again?

200
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm afraid it's hard this time.

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,140
Otherwise, why would I come to you for your help?

202
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,160
I only survived that injury at sea

203
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,710
all because of your help.

204
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,520
I'll definitely help you.

205
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,850
You truly are the brother I've always considered you to be.

206
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,710
Thank you.

207
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,440
Chairman Yu, tell me

208
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
how I can help you.

209
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,320
Find a way

210
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,080
to get me on today's merchant ship to Japan.

211
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,120
Okay, no problem.

212
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,080
When I get to Japan,

213
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,230
I'll reward you generously.

214
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,470
Who are you?

215
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,110
Chairman Yu, I am Ghost Hand, of course.

216
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,040
No.

217
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,990
Ghost Hand was injured at sea

218
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,510
and has a scar on his right wrist,

219
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,560
but you don't.

220
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,280
You're not Ghost Hand.

221
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,510
Yu Zhenhai,

222
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,600
you truly are a cunning old fox.
