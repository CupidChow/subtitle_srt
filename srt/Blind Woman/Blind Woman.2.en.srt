00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,940
[Episode 2: Lure Him In]

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,150
Miss Lin, the person in front of you, is the suspect.

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,970
Please identify him.

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,030
Okay.

6
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,660
A scent of disinfectant.

7
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,509
He's about the same height as that person.

8
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,479
His physique is quite similar to that person's as well.

9
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,280
I'm sorry about earlier.

10
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,200
What are you doing?

11
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,420
I already have an answer.

12
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,790
Miss Lin.

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Is he the murderer?

14
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,320
He's not the murderer.

15
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,750
My dear nephew,

16
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,910
we have to follow proper police procedures here.

17
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,829
We didn't scare you, did we?

18
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,530
No.

19
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,430
Thank you for today, Uncle Wu.

20
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,010
And thank you, Captain Wu.

21
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,740
Cheng Hao, let's go.

22
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,710
Godfather, are we really going to just let them go like that?

23
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,400
Don't worry.

24
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,680
If Yu Zhenhai is really behind this,

25
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,550
he'll eventually have to send his son

26
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
back to us willingly.

27
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,050
Have someone keep an eye on Wu You.

28
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,940
See if he deliberately framed me.

29
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,700
Also...

30
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,480
Check out

31
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,680
who Lin Wanyue is.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,650
Got it, Young Master.

33
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,850
Please enjoy.

34
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,800
Master.

35
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,390
The Young Master is no longer considered a suspect.

36
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
Director Wu and the police

37
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,830
have dropped this matter.

38
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,550
Director Wu is on our side, after all.

39
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,120
It's as expected.

40
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,970
By the way.

41
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,770
Keep an eye on Chuan lately.

42
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,010
Tell him to be careful

43
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,100
and not cause trouble.

44
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,340
Yes, Master.

45
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,720
Young Master.

46
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,900
How's the investigation going?

47
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,760
Wu You is still the same,

48
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,810
stalking and threatening members of our business association, 
as well as obstructing our activities.

49
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,520
Is that all?

50
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,790
Yeah.

51
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,720
That Lin Wanyue, 23 years old,

52
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,230
is a blind piano tuner.

53
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,360
She's been an orphan since childhood

54
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,770
and grew up in the Jiangcheng Welfare House.

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,320
She lost her eyesight in a fire when she was 7.

56
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,330
And that's all about her.

57
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,920
That's all?

58
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,680
Young Master, Lin Wanyue

59
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,340
has a clean background, and her identity is simple.

60
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,690
Wanyue, you must be tired.

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,510
Let me rub your shoulders.

62
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,230
I'm not tired.

63
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,110
What are you afraid of? There's no one else here.

64
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,310
Okay, okay, come on.

65
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,720
Come on, come on.

66
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,159
Boss, don't be like this.

67
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,380
Boss, don't be like this!

68
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,270
No!

69
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,070
Help!

70
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,159
No!

71
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,140
Help!

72
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,159

Quiet, Bei.

106
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,030
I'll be there in a moment.

107

119
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,490
Miss, Yu Yanchuan is here.

120
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,460
Okay.
