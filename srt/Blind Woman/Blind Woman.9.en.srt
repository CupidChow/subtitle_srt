00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,440
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,520
Mr. Yu.

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,320
There was a fire in the warehouse.

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,920
He's dead.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,000
What?

6
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,120
He just wanted to teach me a lesson.

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,120
No way.

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,440
Don't worry.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,080
I will help you

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
I'll help you with your father's death.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,960
Why are you helping me?

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,760
Because I already know

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,880
He Dahai said

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,080
in He Dahai's mouth.

15
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,920
He killed my mother.

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,120
What?

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,640
[You deserve to die.] I'm sorry.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,080
I deserve it.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,840
If anything happens to you tonight,

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
I won't let him go.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,840
Thank you.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,160
Wanyue,

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
You've taken your revenge.

24
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,160
What's your plan next?

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
I haven't avenged.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Uncle told me in the warehouse

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,960
there was more than one person who killed my benefactor.

28
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,520
Then who is the other one?

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,000
He didn't tell me.

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
No matter who he is,

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
I will find him.

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,720
Wanyue.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
Have you heard of fireflies?

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Yes.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
Is this the firefly?

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
What does it look like?

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,960
It's

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,040
that shines on the tail.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,320
Then it'll be pretty at night.

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,160
That's right.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
The summer night glows.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
The stars in the mortal world.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,840
Hearing what you said,

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,280
I feel so beautiful.

45
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,840
Any news about the opium of Zhong Cheng and his wife?

46
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,720
No.

47
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,640
Hurry up and investigate.

48
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,360
Okay, go ahead.

49
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,440
Mr. Yu.

50
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
What's the matter?

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,360
There was a fire in the western suburbs last night.

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
Someone was burned to death.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,160
According to the investigation,

55
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,360
we found the victim was Mr. Yu's butler to Guangsheng.

56
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Mr. Lai is dead.

57
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,840
There's a possibility that he was murdered.

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,680
No.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
The initial judgment is that there was an accident.

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,040
Mr. Yu,

61
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,800
We need you to go to the police station

62
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,760
to identify the body.

63
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,760
Okay. I'll go with you.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,960
Father.

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
Father, I have something to tell you.

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,920
Let's talk when I'm back.

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,440
I've long heard that Miss Lin is living in the Yu family.

68
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,280
I knew it.

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
Wu You, I'm warning you.

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
Don't try to hurt Miss Lin.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,920
Miss Lin, I'm glad you're fine.

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
If someone bullies you in the Yu family,

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,320
call the police.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,080
Thank you, Officer Wu.

75
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,560
Don't be afraid.

76
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,320
Wu You thinks he's Wu Yingtian's foster father.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,400
because Wu Ying Tian is Wu Ying Tian.

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
Will the police find evidence and find me?

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,200
Don't worry.

80
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
The warehouse was burnt down.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
No clue is left.

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's go.

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Let's go find He Dahai

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Extra edition, Xishan Warehouse

85
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,640
[Xishan Warehouse]

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,640
Tong Tong.

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
You gave me a whistle last time.

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,280
I'll give you a wave drum this time.

89
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,280
Do you like it?

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,440
Yes

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Thank you. Thank you.

92
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
You're welcome.

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,400
It's you again.

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
What do you want?

95
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,960
Can't you stop?

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,560
Tell us who the other murderer is.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,280
We won't get you into trouble.

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,880
What other murderer?

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
That's not true.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
You won't tell me?

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
What are you doing?

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Tong Tong.

103
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
You're not going to tell me?

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,240
He Dahai.

105
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,280
Tong Tong should be five years old this year.

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,720
Don't you dare touch her.

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm not trying to hurt her.

108
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,240
I want to help her.

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,040
Help her?

110
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,640
How?

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,920
I can send Tong Tong to the orphanage

112
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,440
and let her study there.

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,840
But in exchange,

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
you must tell us

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,280
who the other murderer is.

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,600
What do you think?

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,000
The other murderer

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
is Wu Yingtian, the current director of the police station.

119
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,159
Tong Tong, come here.

120
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Master! Master!

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,800
I’m innocent!

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,160
Lin Wanyue must have set me up.

123
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,480
She pushed me down the stairs.

124
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Uncle, I'm blind.

125
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
You overestimated me.

126
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,480
When I walked to the stairs,

127
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,960
I saw uncle rolling down

128
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
and rolled down the stairs.

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
You little girl.

130
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,840
What are you talking about?

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,240
Let's go. Let's go.

132
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,800
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,560
Let's go. Let's go.

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,200
Master

135
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
I found this in Xiang's room

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
Caixiang

137
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,680
I want to see

138
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,800
whether you're tough or a bullet.

139
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,920
Master.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Please don't kill me, Father!

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
What happened?

142
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,120
Chuan.

143
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,320
Look at this.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,360
It's hallucinogenic.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
hallucinogenic.

146
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,240
This unused hallucinogenic

147
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,640
was found in Xiang's room.

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,919
I asked someone to compare it

149
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,640
The hallucinogenic in Uncle's autopsy report.

150
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,640
in the autopsy report.

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,680
She's the murderer who killed Uncle Lai.

152
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,280
For the sake of our years,

153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,720
I'll give you one last chance

154
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,880
Tell me, Caixiang.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,880
Why did you do that

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,320
Master, I was forced.

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,400
Who?

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,520
It's me. It's me.

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

160
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
