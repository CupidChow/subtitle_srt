1
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,000
Wanyue.

2
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,790
Yan Chuan.

3
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,790
Yu Zhenhai.

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,470
Every time I got hurt,

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,710
will deepen Yan Chuan’s hatred for you.

6
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,950
Yan Chuan!

7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,350
Wanyue!

8
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,350
Yan Chuan!

9
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,920
Wanyue.

10
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,590
Wanyue.

11
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,759
Are you alright?

12
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,350
Who did this to you?

13
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,509
Master Yu.

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,560
Yu Zhenhai.

15
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,950
Let's go.

16
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,710
Alright.

17
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,079
Yan Chuan,

18
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,800
can you stay and talk with me?

19
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,560
Okay.

20
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,630
We've known each other for so long.

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,310
you've been protecting me.

22
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,470
Is it worth it?

23
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,030
Of course.

24
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,910
You are my fiancée.

25
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
Of course I have to take care of you

26
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,870
and protect you.

27
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,000
But Master Yu didn't accept me.

28
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,910
He even...

29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,430
Wanyue,

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,750
I know you better than anyone else.

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,070
You don't need his recognition.

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
Yan Chuan, thank you.

33
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,310
Yu Zhenhai,

34
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,270
I'm warning you for the last time.

35
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,830
If you dare to hurt Wanyue again,

36
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,430
I will kill you.

37
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,310
Yu Yan Chuan!

38
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
You unfilial son!

39
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,480
I raised you up.

40
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,630
Is this how you treat me?

41
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,630
Really?

42
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,830
You've been challenging my bottom line

43
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,390
In order to target Wanyue,

44
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,000
you even did whatever it takes.

45
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
You are despicable!

46
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,680
You bastard!

47
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,870
For Lin Wanyue,

48
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,310
for Lin Wanyue,

49
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,360
and turned against each other.

50
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,630
Because of her,

51
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,920
because of her.

52
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,750
and abandoned me willingly.

53
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,950
If I don't kill her, who else can I kill?

54
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,390
She must die.

55
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,000
How dare you kill me?

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Guards! Guards!

57
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,950
Lock him up!

58
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Lock him up!

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,510
Yu Zhenhai, I must kill you!

60
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
Yu Yan Chuan is imprisoned by Yu Zhenhai.

61
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,040
Our plan failed.

62
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,430
Miss,

63
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,800
is there any other way

64
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,800
to save Yan Chuan?

65
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,000
It's time to let him know

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,750
how cruel

67
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
is so inhumane.

68
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,310
Useless!

69
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,000
Chairman.

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
We really did as you said.

71
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,430
But...

72
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
Miss Lin is so lucky.

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,070
Get lost!

74
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Get lost!

75
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,390
Yes.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,480
Master.

77
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,190
Who is it?

78
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,510
It's me, Wanyue.

79
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,160
Miss Lin, come in.

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What can I do for you, Miss Lin?

81
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Master, I'm looking for Yan Chuan.

82
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,430
Do you know where he went?

83
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,070
Chuan has to go to the provincial province

84
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,270
because of the hospital.

85
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,270
He'll be back soon.

86
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
Didn't he tell you before he left?

87
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,480
No.

88
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,070
Maybe I left in a hurry

89
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,600
so I didn't have time to tell you.

90
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,240
Do you know how long he was away?

91
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,510
No.

92
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
I'll call him and tell you later.

93
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,310
Master,

94
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,720
I plan to end this relationship with Yan Chuan.

95
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,950
You and Chuan are so close.

96
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,310
Why do you want to break up?

97
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,920
You're right.

98
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,870
Yan Chuan became like this

99
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,360
because of me.

100
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,160
I don't want

101
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,950
affect your relationship.

102
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,320
So I decided

103
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,480
leave Yan Chuan

104
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,789
and move out.

105
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,480
But before that,

106
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,360
you still want me to help you two.

107
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,870
I've reflected on myself.

108
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
There's indeed a huge gap between us.

109
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm blind.

110
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,080
I don't deserve Young Master Yu.

111
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,440
Wanyue, you're right.

112
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
You and Chuan

113
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,870
don't belong to the same kind.

114
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,510
However,

115
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm grateful and admire you

116
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,750
I really appreciate and admire you.

117
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,910
After you move out,

118
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,550
if you encounter any difficulties,

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,870
as long as I'm still in Jiangcheng,

120
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,870
just let me know.

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,670
Thank you, Master.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I plan to move out tonight.

123
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,670
Please inform the guard.

124
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,910
It's nothing.

125
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
I'll tell them.

126
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,670
Goodbye.

127
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,720
Yu Zhenhai,

128
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,030
Do you think I'm scared?

129
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,200
The real reason

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,870
is that I'm sharpening the sharpest knife

131
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,750
Kill you.

132
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,150
Miss Lin, we're here.

133
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,320
OK.

134
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,870
Everything is ready.

135
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,910
Don't miss anything.

136
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,080
Wanyue,

137
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,510
since you've decided to leave,

138
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,910
I won't keep you.

139
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,600
Don't think

140
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,150
this little money.

141
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,320
Please accept it.

142
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,200
Here.

143
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,030
Thank you, Master.

144
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,670
It's nothing.

145
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,030
Mr. Yu, I'm sorry.

146
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,270
Master Yu, I'm sorry.

147
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,720
What's wrong?
