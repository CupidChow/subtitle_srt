1
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,160
What are you doing here? I'm here to see you.

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,880
Are you here to see me? I'm here to see you.

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm here today

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,200
to thank Director Wu.

5
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,400
It's nothing.

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,000
Although it's a small matter,

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,480
it has entered Wanyue's heart.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,200
Miss Lin, aren't you afraid

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,080
the Yu family will find out?

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,560
Chief Wu is here.

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,080
it's okay for them to know.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,759
Miss Lin is unique.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,520
She has a distinctive personality.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,880
I like it.

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,840
Miss Lin, your wine is here.

16
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
Mr. Yu.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,960
Wu Yingtian, let her go!

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,600
Kid.

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
How dare you talk to me like that?

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
Didn't your father teach you?

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
Be polite.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Wu Yingtian, let her go.

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,040
I'll let you go.

24
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Do you think I'll believe you?

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
Get out of my way!

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,920
Don't move.

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,200
Go.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,000
Move! Move! Move!

29
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Move! Move!

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,600
Move! Move! Move!

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,440
Get in! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,520
Father! Hurry up! Hurry up!

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
We were all fooled by Wu You.

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,280
He didn't plan to kill Wu Yingtian.

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,040
Instead, he helped Wu Yingtian escape.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,080
I didn't expect Wu You to be so cunning.

37
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,560
Father.

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,200
Lin Wanyue has been captured by Wu Yingtian.

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
We must find a way to save her.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Chuan.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Right now, Wu Yingtian and we

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,280
with Wu Yingtian.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
At this time,

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,640
it's not easy to save Lin Wanyue.

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
Wanyue was caught by Wu Yingtian

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,680
because she helped us.

47
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,840
We can't

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
we can't ignore it.

49
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,480
OK.

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,120
Let's find a way to save Lin Wanyue.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
to save Lin Wanyue.

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Thank you, father.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
I almost lost my life because of you.

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,880
You know?

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
Director Wu, don't kill me.

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Yu Zhenhai ordered me to do all this.

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,160
You stopped him from migrating abroad

58
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,520
and killed his niece.

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,040
It's him. He asked me to kill you.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Okay, Yu Zhenhai.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,839
You bastard!

62
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,920
If I hadn't cleaned up his mess in the early years,

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,120
Godfather,

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,440
You took such good care of Zhenhai.

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
but he wanted to kill you.

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,400
We can't let him go.

68
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,320
Don't worry.

69
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I'll teach him a lesson.

70
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,960
Godfather, I have an idea.

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,600
Go ahead.

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,159
Rumor has it that

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,840
Yu Zhenhai's wife

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,080
saved Jiang Yude's daughter.

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
Yu Zhenhai killed his wife

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
shot his wife to death.

77
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,760
We can use this as an article

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,880
to sow discord between Yu Zhenhai

79
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
between Yu Zhenhai and his son.

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,440
That's right.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
But

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,480
it's just a rumor that Yu Zhenhai killed his wife.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,680
We don't have solid evidence.

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm afraid it's hard to achieve our goal.

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
It's not difficult for me.

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Everything Yu Zhenhai does

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
I have something on him.

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
Great, Godfather.

89
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Leave it to me.

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,400
Okay.

91
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,159
Godfather,

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
What should we do with Lin Wanyue?

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,360
Lock her up first.

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Tsukasa, I've arranged it.

96
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
No one will know that place.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Right. 70.

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

99
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,400
Fifty to the right.

100
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,480
Yu Zhenhai

101
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,960
Don't ever think about leaving Jiangcheng.

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,680
Godfather, are you looking for me?

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,720
You're here. Let's go. Let's go.

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,400
Come here.

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,120
This is evidence of Yu Zhenhai's murder of his wife.

106
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,160
Take it.

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,520
Rest assured, Godfather.

108
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,400
I promise to give it to Yan Chuan myself.

109
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,240
Miss, come out.

110
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,040
Wu Yingtian has been knocked out by me.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,720
That was close.

112
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,159
Miss, do you remember the password?

113
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Wu You.

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,360
Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Let go of me! Let go of me!

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,040
Let go of me! Let go of me!

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Let go of me!

119
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
Do you hear me?

120
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,600
You bastard!

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Listen, Wu Yingtian.

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,000
I've been staying by your side for two years.

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
for two years.

124
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
Do you think I'll let you go?

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,880
Wu You.

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,120
You're a dog that you're not familiar with.

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Even if I'm a dog,

128
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
I know human nature.

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
And you?

130
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
You were greedy for money

131
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
to clear Yu Zhenhai's name

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,240
and cover up the fire in the warehouse.

133
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
Did you forget that?

134
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,760
Okay.

135
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,520
So,

136
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,520
you agreed to be my adopted son

137
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,080
to investigate this, right?

138
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,440
Yes.

139
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,640
My mother died in that fire too.

140
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,240
I won’t let anyone

141
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
anyone related to her death.

142
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,600
Your mother was killed by Yu Zhenhai.

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,920
It has nothing to do with me.

144
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,280
Do you think you can get away with it?

145
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,240
The fire took countless lives.

146
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,040
Your ban on their deaths

147
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,800
by you?

148
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,960
Have you forgotten all this?

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,040
Wu You.

150
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm the current chief of the police station.

151
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
No one dares to kill me.

152
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,520
Okay.

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,280
Let's try.

154
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Try it.

155
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,880
Come on.

156
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,160
Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!

157
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,720
Listen, Wu Yingtian.

158
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,600
After you die,

159
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm not Wu You.

160
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,320
What's your name?

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
I'm Xiao Nan Sheng. I'm Xiao Nan Sheng.

162
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,480
My name is Xiao Nan. My name is Xiao Nan.

163
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Wu You.

164
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,960
Let's go.
