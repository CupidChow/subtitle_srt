1
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,480
It's...

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,600
It's...

3
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,360
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,600
It's Director Wu. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
He asked me to

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,520
to the warehouse in West Hill to kill him.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,760
so that you can be intimidated and warned.

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,680
How dare you

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,680
colluded with Wu Yingtian to betray me?

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,840
Master, spare my life!

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,280
They kidnapped my father.

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,160
I can only do this.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,440
Master, please don't kill me!

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,080
Please!

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,880
Wu Yingtian

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,240
Throw the body to the mountain to feed the wolves.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,600
Yes, Master.

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,720
Wanyue, are you alright?

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,880
I've been with my father for years.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
He was suddenly framed by his family.

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,760
Father can't accept it.

23
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,160
Mr. Yu.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm sleepy.

25
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,080
I want to go to bed now.

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,760
Okay.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,600
Okay. Okay.

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,480
Miss.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Wait here.

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll be back when I find it.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,720
Okay, be careful.

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,120
Bill!

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,680
Yes! Yes!

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,520
Come with me.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,040
Be careful.

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
Biao! Biao!

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,200
Caixiang

40
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,560
Caixiang

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
Miss's voice

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,720
Hurry! It's dangerous!

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,240
Yes!

44
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Save her first.

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,280
Miss, are you okay?

46
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm fine.

47
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
Biao is missing

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,320
Have you found Caixiang?

49
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,320
Yes

50
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,760
Take me to her.

51
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,760
Okay.

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,080
Caixiang

53
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,480
You died to save me

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,240
Miss!

55
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
Don't blame yourself

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,040
Caixiang and I

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
were also victims of the fire in the warehouse

58
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
Xiang, don't worry.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,280
I will make them

60
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,480
deserve the punishment.

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
The day after tomorrow is my birthday.

62
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
You used to do it all by yourself.

63
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,000
Now,

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Chuan,

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,520
I'll leave this to you.

66
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes, Father.

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
Miss Lin.

68
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,080
There are too many troubles at home recently.

69
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
For the sake of safety,

70
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,760
I suggest you move out.

71
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
As for the money,

72
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,960
go find the new butler after dinner.

73
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,440
I'll pay you as much as you want.

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,960
Father.

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,640
You're tearing us up! Father!

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Chuan.

77
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,640
Director Wu has reached out to our house.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
This house is not safe at all.

79
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,560
I disagree.

80
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,520
Only when Miss Lin lives here,

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
Wu You won't hurt her.

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm in charge of this family.

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,040
It's not up to you.

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,080
It's settled.

85
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,640
Master.

86
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
I'm not staying.

87
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
You've been taking good care of me.

88
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,400
I want to play a song on your birthday

89
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,240
to express my gratitude.

90
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,320
I'll move out after the birthday banquet.

91
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,520
Since you're so thoughtful,

92
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,360
you can leave after the birthday banquet.

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,360
Enjoy your meal.

94
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,600
I have something to do.

95
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Wanyue, don't worry.

96
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
I will find a way to keep you.

97
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Since Lai Guang Sheng died,

98
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,640
Yu Zhenhai has been cautious.

99
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,200
He not only planted two more bodyguards by his side,

100
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,920
but also strengthen the guard of the mansion.

101
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,880
He's feeling guilty and afraid.

102
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,640
He deliberately told me to move out of Yu Residence.

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,080
It seems that he still doesn't trust me.

104
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,560
My Lady,

105
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
Once we move out, it'll be hard for us to enter the house.

106
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,600
it'll be hard for us to go back in.

107
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,440
I have to find a way to stay.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Father.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
The banquet hall is almost ready.

110
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,799
Please have a look.

111
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,640
Not bad.

112
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,159
Chuan, thank you.

113
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,559
Thank you, Father.

114
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Miss Lin, the piano is ready.

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Try it.

116
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,040
Okay.

117
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,720
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

118
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,840
Young Master.

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Young Master.

120
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,400
A worker is looking for you.

121
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,960
Okay, I'll be right there.

122
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
Father, I'll get back to work.

123
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,080
Bye.

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,440
Coming.
