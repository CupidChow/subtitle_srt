1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Don't worry, Miss Lin.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,240
I'll stay by your side from now on.

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,400
Hey.

4
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,800
How long are you going to tie me up?

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,760
Tie me up until you tell me the truth.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,720
I'm not lying.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,480
I really don't know what you asked me.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,080
Looks like it's necessary to sell your daughter

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
to a rich family as a maid.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,120
Don't! Don't!

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,800
You're here. You're here.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,600
It's called "The Tablet of the Heart". It's "The Tablet of the Heart". It's "The Tablet of the Heart". It's "The Tablet of the Heart".

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,280
I remember he had

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,480
on his hand.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,600
It's a birthmark.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,080
It's a jade pendant. It's a jade pendant. It's a jade pendant. It's a jade pendant.

17
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,360
If you don't have the jade pendant, you'll be able to find it. You'll be able to do it. You'll be able to do it.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,160
I wouldn't have known

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
my mother saved Wanyue.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,280
Wanyue has been looking for

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,760
who killed my mother.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,920
But a few years ago, my father told me

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,080
the murderer who killed my mother has been brought to justice.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,800
[Could my mother's death]

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,480
for another reason?

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,880
Looks like Wanyue and I have to investigate this

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,760
until we find out the truth

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,200
until we find out the truth.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,800
Miss Lin.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Before Young Master went out,

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,520
he asked me to put more ointment on you.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,240
It'll reduce swelling so that you can recover quickly.

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,080
Thank you Caixiang

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
Miss Lin, are you going out?

35
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,680
Yes.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm going to Xishan to worship my family.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,360
Can you arrange a car for me?

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,680
No problem, Miss.

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,000
Here comes the chance.

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,840
Lin Wanyue.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,760
I must kill you this time.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Oh no.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
We're in trouble again

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Caixiang what's wrong

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,640
Young master

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,680
I broke the glass frame.

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,320
It's okay.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
If Master punishes you,

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,720
tell him I fell.

50
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Thank you for helping me.

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,280
Go. Go.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,160
Hello. Hello. Hello.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,160
Excuse me.

54
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,240
The murderer who killed that woman...

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,680
I remember

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,920
on his hand.

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Caixiang

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
What's wrong, Young Master?

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Did you see me?

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,640
Uncle.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,560
I sent Miss Lin to Xishan this afternoon.

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,600
What's wrong?

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,320
Wake up! Wake up!

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
Lin Wanyue.

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,079
I don't understand.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,280
why you want to kill me.

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,040
and kill me?

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,520
until I came here.

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
I finally figured it out.

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,400
You are the daughter of Jiang Yude and his wife, Kang Chan.

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,920
Entering the Yu family

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,000
to take revenge on me and Yu Zhenhai.

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,520
That's right.

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,399
When my parents found you smuggling opium,

75
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,680
If you fail, kill them all.

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
So what?

77
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,440
You're still in my hands.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,040
Even if I die,

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,720
I won't let you go even if I die.

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,440
Okay.

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
Then go to hell.

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
Kuang Sheng.

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Why are you here?

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
Surprised, right?

85
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,560
I didn't expect to be here.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,920
You two...

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
What's your relationship?

88
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
You deserve to die.

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,120
You don't deserve to know that.

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
You don't deserve to live in this world.

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,440
You should go to hell.

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,440
Wu You.

94
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,600
What's the matter, Miss?

95
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,520
I'll kill him myself!

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Don't kill me!

97
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
Don't kill me! My lady!

98
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Please!

99
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't kill me, my lady. Don't kill me.

100
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,040
I didn't expect

101
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,600
I've been in Jiangcheng for years.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
You will beg for mercy now.

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,480
Miss.

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,880
Please don't kill me.

105
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,640
Mr. Jiang and Mrs. Jiang.

106
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
Yu Zhenhai ordered me to do it.

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
He's the real culprit.

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,280
You can't escape.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,040
All of you will die!

110
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,560
Miss Lin! Miss Lin!

111
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,200
As long as you don't kill me,

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,880
I can help you kill Yu Zhenhai.

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,040
Miss, don't trust him.

114
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
Okay. Let's go.

115
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,000
This is for my father.

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
for my father.

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,160
This stab

118
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
for my mother.

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,640
You crazy bastard!

120
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,520
This stab

121
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,840
was stabbed by everyone who died in the fire.

122
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
My Lady is dead.

123
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,560
Father!

124
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,080
Mother!

125
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,240
I killed him myself.

126
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,760
to avenge you.

127
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Miss.

128
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Kuang Sheng knocked down the candlestick

129
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,520
and ignited the warehouse.

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Let's go.

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,040
Give me the knife.

132
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Let's go.

133
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,920
Wanyue.

134
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,320
Why is Yu Yan Chuan here?

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,920
You go first.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,560
No.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,120
Let's go together.

138
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
I won't leave you behind.

139
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,560
I can't let him find out our revenge plan.

140
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,360
Listen to me. You go first.

141
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,880
Okay.

142
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,280
Take care of yourself.

143
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,280
Wanyue! Wanyue!

144
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,640
Be careful, Young Master.

145
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,360
Wanyue.

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,880
Wanyue.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Wanyue, where are you?

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Wanyue, where are you?

149
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,600
Lin Wanyue.

150
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,400
Yan Chuan.

151
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,000
Yan Chuan!

152
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Yan Chuan!

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
Yan Chuan!

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,920
Wanyue. Wanyue.

155
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,320
Yan Chuan.

156
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,640
Wanyue, how are you?

157
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,960
Wanyue.

158
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,920
Young Master.
