00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,980
[Blind Woman]

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,870
[Episode 21: You'll Inevitably Meet Your Death]

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,710
Si Yu?

4
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,620
Si Yu?

5
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,570
How did she escape?

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,810
Lin Wanyue.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,170
You weren't expecting me here, were you?

8
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,770
Si Yu?

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,450
Chuan,

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,850
Uncle,

11
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,320
you've both

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,400
been deceived by this bitch!

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,810
She and Wu You set a trap, faking my death,

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,130
all to

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,080
make you want to kill Director Wu.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,000
So they could use your hands to kill Director Wu.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,720
Si Yu, what nonsense are you talking about?

18
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,330
You are not welcome here.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,210
Get out!

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,360
Why are you still so stubborn?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,280
Lin Wanyue has been using you for her revenge!

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,570
What nonsense are you talking about?

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,770
If you're still trying to stop me and Yanchuan from being together,

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,850
it's too late.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,490
I'm already pregnant with his child.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,850
You even have the audacity to say that.

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,000
The test report in my hand

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,880
can prove that you're not pregnant!

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,780
What?

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,950
I didn't expect her to be this kind of woman!

31
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,160
She's lying.

32
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,080
That's right.

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,850
Chuan,

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,490
you must have known about

35
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,490
Lin Wanyue's fake pregnancy all along, right?

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,050
Si Yu.

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,610
I've always doted on you since we were young.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,330
But if you ruin my wedding today,

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,640
don't blame me for being harsh.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,280
Yu Yanchuan,

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,130
how dare you!

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,080
How dare you collude with this woman to deceive me!

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,730
Uncle.

44
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,730
I also know

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,680
that the main characters of the wedding today

46
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,800
are not Chuan and Lin Wanyue...

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,480
but you.

48
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,020
They planned to use this wedding

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,310
to expose all your crimes in public,

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,910
to ruin your reputation,

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,240
and to get the punishment you deserve.

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,460
Father,

53
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,180
you know that Si Yu has always liked me

54
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,079
since childhood.

55
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,890
You can't believe anything she says.

56
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,290
Is that so?

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,090
That day when you and Lin Wanyue

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,730
were plotting in the hospital,

59
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,520
I was there.

60
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,640
Next, let me, his son,

61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,730
tear off

62
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,930
his mask.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,490
Bastard. Bastard!

64
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,080
If Si Yu hadn't shown up in time today,

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,400
were you really going to send me to prison?

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Jiang Chan.

67
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,720
I've met your parents.

68
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,079
They want you to join them in the netherworld!

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,210
Si Yu.

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
What did you just call her?

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,930
Jiang Chan.

72
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,050
Jiang Chan.

73
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,770
Jiang Chan?

74
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,670
Who is that girl?

75
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,079
Who is she?

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,290
No wonder I felt something off

77
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,329
when I first met you.

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,050
Turns out

79
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,610
you're Jiang Yude's daughter, Jiang Chan!

80
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,240
She's Jiang Yude's daughter.

81
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,800
Chairman Jiang.

82
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,560
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,930
Yu Zhenhai,

84
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,050
even if we die today,

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,560
we won't stoop to your level

86
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,490
and harm the people with opium!

87
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,089
Since Chairman Jiang insists on going against us,

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,000
there's no point in continuing this polite discussion.

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,930
Father! Mother!

90
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,000
Master,

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,320
what should we do about Jiang Yude's daughter?

92
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,409
Uncle.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
I've investigated everything thoroughly.

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,850
The real Lin Wanyue from the Welfare House

95
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,200
died from an illness years ago.

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,930
The current Jiang Chan deliberately borrowed Lin Wanyue's identity

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,490
to enter your family to avenge her parents.

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Little Jiang Chan,

99
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,930
how have you been all these years?

100
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,650
I've been doing very well.

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,560
So well that every night,

102
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,120
I dream of killing you

103
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,410
to avenge my parents.

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,260
You think you can kill me?

105
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,760
You're so naive!

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,200
Father.

107
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,760
You won't be leaving this church today.

108
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,170
What?

109
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,320
Do you want to kill me in front of everyone?

110
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,560
Of course not.

111
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,970
I want to remove your disguise

112
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,810
and expose your crime.

113
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,970
Where is the evidence?

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,290
Evidence?

115
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,440
Cheng Hao!

116
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:01,880
Everyone.

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,760
My father, Yu Zhenhai,

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,760
is the murderer who killed former Chairman

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Jiang Yude and his wife, as well as my mother!

120
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,170
He is also the mastermind behind

121
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,170
setting fire to the Yunhai warehouse, burning everyone inside

122
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
to death!

123
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,530
Besides these,

124
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,910
he also conspired with former Police Director Wu Yingtian,

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,090
Lai Guangsheng,

126
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,850
Zhong Cheng, and his wife

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
to secretly traffic opium!

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,170
All the evidence is here!

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,650
The evidence is solid.

130
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah.

131
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,880
So it was really all their doing.

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,760
Look. Look.

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,760
It was all done by Yu Zhenhai.

134
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,120
He's simply a beast in human form.

135
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
He is a two-faced monster.

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,410
Shut up.

137
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,680
Shut up.

138
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,290
Shut up, all of you!

139
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,410
Yu Zhenhai, you didn't see this coming, did you?

140
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,090
This is my sharpest knife.

141
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,630
Do you feel the pain?

142
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,530
Father.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,530
Now the evidence is solid.

144
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,530
You'd better surrender.

145
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,290
Kill...

146
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,000
kill every one of them!

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,760
Yes, sir!

148
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,090
Don't move!

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,560
Let's go.

150
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,610
Stop!

151
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,240
-Yu Zhenhai!
-Freeze!

152
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,730
I order you to put down your guns immediately!

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Don't move!

154
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,290
One more step, and I'll kill her!

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Yu Zhenhai, let her go!

156
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,530
Stand back! Stand back!

157
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,320
Make way!

158
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,360
Yu Zhenhai, don't do anything stupid.

159
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,170
Back off!

160
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,530
Stop! Back off!

161
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,100
I'll kill her if you come any closer!

162
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,370
Captain Qin, my father...

163
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,080
no, where is Yu Zhenhai?

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,320
He has taken Miss Si Yu hostage and has fled.

165
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,650
Don't worry, Wanyue.

166
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,600
Yu Zhenhai can't escape.

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Wanyue.

168
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,380
It must be Si Yu.

169
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,540
Father.

170
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,170
Mother.

171
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:26,840
Wanyue.

172
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,050
When we get back, I'll find a skilled craftsman

173
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,770
to make new ones for you.

174
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,370
I will make those who hurt you

175
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,560
pay the price they deserve.

176
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,890
They will.

177
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,200
Uncle?

178
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,840
Uncle!

179
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,930
Uncle!

180
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,280
Look, my neck has broken out in a rash.

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,290
When can we leave this place?

182
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,930
Si Yu,

183
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,050
things are different now.

184
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,560
Just bear with it for now.

185
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,930
Do we have to stay in this hellhole

186
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,800
forever?

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,730
Now the entire city's police are hunting me down.

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,930
I can't go back to Yu's Mansion.

189
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,050
I can only stay here temporarily.

190
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,010
But... you, Si Yu,

191
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,960
listen to Uncle—

192
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,680
buy a train ticket and return to your hometown.

193
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,080
Don't stay in Jiangcheng anymore.

194
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,170
Uncle,

195
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,650
I didn't come back

196
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,370
just for your birthday.

197
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,720
I want to be with Chuan forever.

198
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
I won't go back to my hometown.

199
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Si Yu,

200
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,800
don't you understand?

201
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,320
Lin Wanyue has already stolen Chuan's heart!

202
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,370
Then...

203
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,840
I advise you

204
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,480
to give up on this idea early.

205
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,650
How can we deal with Lin Wanyue?

206
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,930
Uncle,

207
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
we absolutely cannot let Lin Wanyue off easily!

208
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I do have a plan.

209
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,410
T-Tell me then.

210
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,010
However, this plan

211
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,080
needs your help, Si Yu.

212
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,790
As long as I can get Chuan back,

213
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm willing to do anything.

214
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,460
Si Yu.

215
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm in great trouble now,

216
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,560
yet you're still willing to help me.

217
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,490
I'm really touched.

218
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,560
But don't worry.

219
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,080
Once everything is over,

220
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,450
I will definitely have Chuan

221
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,650
marry you into our family with a grand wedding.

222
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,410
Then, we can all

223
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,200
emigrate abroad together,

224
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,050
okay?

225
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,530
Okay, thank you, Uncle.

226
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,530
Then quickly tell me what it is.
