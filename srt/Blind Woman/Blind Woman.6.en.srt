1
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,670
Mr. Lai.

2
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,640
I have something here.

3
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,280
I don't know if you want to see it.

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,790
What is it?

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,030
The ledger of your embezzlement.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,350
You asked for it!

7
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,350
Master.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,560
It was her.

9
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,840
It's this blind girl who wants to kill me!

10
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,039
She pushed me down the stairs!

11
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,560
Miss Lin.

12
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,280
Mr. Lai keeps accusing you of pushing him down the stairs.

13
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,400
What's your explanation?

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,680
Mr. Lai,

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm blind.

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,280
You're way too overestimating me.

17
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,120
You... you...

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,590
Master.

19
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,920
This morning, I saw...

20
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,789
Go on.

21
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,640
After breakfast,

22
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,120
Miss Lin was having stomach pains

23
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,229
and asked me to bring her some hot water.

24
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,400
Just as I reached the staircase,

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
I saw Mr. Lai...

26
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,950
mumbling nonsense

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,590
as he rolled down the stairs.

28
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,400
You little girl,

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,950
what nonsense are you talking about?

30
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,480
Mr. Lai.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,150
Are you crazy?

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,790
Master.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,710
She's lying!

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,510
Mr. Lai!

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,000
She's lying!

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
She's lying!

37
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,150
You wicked girl, you...

38
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,840
Father.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,470
The main symptoms of schizophrenia

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,030
are auditory hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia.

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,710
After hearing Xiang's account,

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,680
I'm certain

43
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,190
Mr. Lai's condition has worsened.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Chuan,

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,800
Mr. Lai has been serving me for years.

46
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,470
He has no children of his own. It hasn't been easy for him.

47
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,800
Please help him.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
Don't worry, Father.

49
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,840
I'll do everything I can to help him recover.

50
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,190
Xiang.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
Thank you.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
You're welcome, Miss.

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,710
We were both victims of that fire from back then.

54
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,310
In the future, we'll continue to fight side by side.

55
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,360
Okay.

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,080
Let's send our enemies

57
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,630
to their graves together.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Chairman Jiang?

59
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,190
Mrs. Jiang?

60
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,270
Open the door!

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
Open the door!

62
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Open the door now!

63
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,040
Open the door!

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,070
Open the door!

65
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,070
Open the door now!

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,720
Lai Guangsheng.

67
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,480
Why did you kill them?

68
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,600
Stay away. Don't come near me.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
I beg you. Please don't come near me.

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,270
Don't come near me!

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
Don't come near me.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,070
Don't come near me.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,390
Go to hell.

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
It's you, you darn blind fool, playing tricks.

75
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,950
I'll choke you.

76
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,070
I'll choke you.

77
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,480
-I'll choke you. -Stop! Stop!

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Master, she...

79
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,430
Are you alright?

80
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,390
Master.

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,120
What's going on?

82
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,310
I... I...

83
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,510
That was disrespectful!

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,800
It's fine now.

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,750
What were you doing just now?

86
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,920
How inappropriate!

87
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Master, I...

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,040
I...

89
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,240
What?

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,430
Out with it!

91
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
I suspect Lin Wanyue

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,270
is connected to former chairman Jiang Yude and his wife.

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,480
Do you have anything to prove this?

94
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,800
I dreamed that Lin Wanyue was coming to take my life.

95
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,430
In my dream, the red dress

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,310
she was wearing was exactly the same

97
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
as the one she wore in reality.

98
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,950
Dream?

99
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,750
Come on, Mr. Lai,

100
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,800
you're actually using a dream as evidence?

101
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Mr. Lai,

102
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,390
are you really senile?

103
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,360
Master, trust me.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
The red dress in the dream and the one in reality

105
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,480
are really exactly the same!

106
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't want to hear your nonsense here.

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,480
Quick, get the car ready.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,920
I need to go to the business association.

109
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,510
Yes, Master.

110
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,000
It can't be a coincidence.

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,680
There must be something wrong with Lin Wanyue.

112
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,720
Feeling better?

113
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,270
Much better.

114
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,680
Young Master.

115
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,310
Come in.

116
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,480
I found He Dahai's hiding place.

117
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,630
Great.

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,750
Miss Lin.

119
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,630
How about we

120
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,909
go together to find He Dahai in the next few days?

121
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,789
Okay.

122
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,150
Looks like I was right.

123
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,720
She really does have ties with Jiang Yude and his wife.

124
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,480
This time, I must get the evidence

125
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,270
to convince Master.

126
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Chuan.

127
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Mr. Lai is getting on in years

128
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,910
and has been a bit muddled recently.

129
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,960
Please forgive him.

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,240
Father.

131
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,630
If he had hurt someone else,

132
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,870
I might have let it go.

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
But he hurt someone important to me!

134
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,510
I can't forgive him!

135
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,030
I've already reprimanded him.

136
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,630
What else do you want me to do?

137
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,080
Kill him?

138
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,030
In a few days,

139
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,960
it'll be your mother's memorial day.

140
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,750
But there's too much work at the business association.

141
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,960
I can't make time.

142
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,630
Go to visit your mother for me.

143
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,670
What do you think?

144
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,080
I'll go visit Mother.

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,960
That's my good boy.

146
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,200
Master! Master!

147
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,550
I have something to report!

148
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,600
Come in.

149
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,270
Master.

150
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,790
I've found evidence that Lin Wanyue has ties

151
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,240
with Jiang Yude and his wife.

152
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,320
Y-Young Master.

153
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,510
Don't worry about my feelings.

154
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,320
Since you say you've found evidence,

155
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,320
then open it up, and let's all see it.

156
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,840
Master.

157
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
You've brought it here.

158
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,750
Why don't you open it so we can see?

159
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,870
No, Master...

160
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,630
Master,

161
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,480
I just saw very clearly

162
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,320
Lin Wanyue in the room

163
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,750
bowing and offering incense to the photo of Jiang Yude and his wife

164
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,750
and then placing the photo into this box.

165
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,480
But somehow,

166
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,030
the photo inside the box turned into an account book.

167
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,750
Lai Guangsheng, Lai Guangsheng.

168
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,320
Our Yu family has always treated you well!

169
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,030
How dare you embezzle money and falsify accounts behind my back?

170
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,750
Master!

171
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm innocent!

172
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,790
This must be Lin Wanyue setting me up!

173
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,630
Enough, Mr. Lai!

174
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,630
Let me tell you, Mr. Lai.

175
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,390
Right after you hurt Miss Lin,

176
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,790
in order to comfort her,

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,030
I specifically asked Cheng Hao to take her to the temple fair.

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,910
So everything you just said

179
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,870
is simply untrue!

180
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,150
Young Master,

181
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,150
Miss Lin and I are back.
