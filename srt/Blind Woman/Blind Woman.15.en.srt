1
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,390
Wu You.

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,070
Do it.

3
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,390
Yes, Miss.

4
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,280
Miss?

5
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,750
Lin Wanyue!

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,000
Who exactly are you?

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Jiang Chan.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
I'm Jiang Yude's daughter.

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,520
Jiang Yude?

10
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,240
Tell our men to spread the word,

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,510
saying that Wu Yingtian kidnapped me and brought me here.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Yes, Miss.

13
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,590
Miss.

14
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,759
Miss, everything is ready.

15
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,789
As soon as Yu Zhenhai opens the door,

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
it will confirm that he killed Director Wu.

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,790
We can finally arrest Yu Zhenhai

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,950
and bring him to justice.

19
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,040
Yes.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,950
This time, it will be hard for Yu Zhenhai to clear his name.

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,080
Let's go, Miss.

22
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Father, you must be careful.

23
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,280
You too.

24
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,240
Come with me.

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,190
Master, be careful. It might be a trap.

26
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,870
Wu You!

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,840
Help!

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,470
Help!

29
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,000
Help!

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,190
Help!

31
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,590
Help!

32
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,710
Miss.

33
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,840
How is it?

34
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,750
Yu Zhenhai didn't open the door.

35
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,240
His subordinate did.

36
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,870
Let's go.

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,630
Father,

38
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,190
Mother,

39
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,510
did you hear that?

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,830
This is Wu Yingtian's confession to you.

41
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,120
Wanyue, tell me.

42
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,830
What exactly happened?

43
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,159
It was Wu You

44
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,800
who rescued me from Wu Yingtian's hands.

45
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,950
Wu You?

46
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,830
Didn't he refuse to cooperate with us?

47
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,000
The reason he didn't kill Wu Yingtian at the casino

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,159
was that he wanted to use my hearing

49
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,600
to steal the safe's password

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,040
and get the evidence of Wu Yingtian's crimes.

51
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,750
I see.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,390
I misunderstood Wu You.

53
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,630
You misunderstood him.

54
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,310
So Wu Yingtian's death in the fire

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,190
was also planned by Wu You?

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,510
That's right.

57
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,120
He originally just wanted to find a scapegoat.

58
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,480
But he didn't expect that

59
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,870
it would be your father's subordinate who opened the warehouse door.

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,510
Luckily, it was his subordinate.

61
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,750
Otherwise, the murderer would have been my father.

62
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,000
Stop overthinking things.

63
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
It's all over now.

64
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Wu Yingtian is dead.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,310
And you have avenged Si Yu and your benefactor.

66
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,950
You have finally settled a matter that has been on your mind.

67
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,720
Father.

68
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,190
You wanted to see me?

69
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,070
Chuan, good news.

70
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,040
Now that Director Wu is dead,

71
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,800
our only obstacle has been removed.

72
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,070
We should hurry up and handle the procedures for going abroad

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,950
and leave Jiangcheng, this land of turmoil.

74
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,630
Father,

75
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,630
Director Wu got what he deserved.

76
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,390
I believe Yu should be able to

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,510
rest in peace now.

78
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,830
I'll have someone handle the procedures

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
for going abroad as soon as possible.

80
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,070
Okay.

81
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,070
Chuan,

82
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,240
let me say one more thing.

83
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,720
This is a critical time.

84
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,430
You should have a sense of the bigger picture.

85
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't let your love for a girl interfere with our big plan.

86
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,830
Father, don't worry.

87
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,560
I know what to do.

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,950
Wanyue,

89
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,680
this is for you.

90
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,750
It smells so good.

91
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,190
Wanyue,

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,600
If the medicine abroad

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,920
can cure your eyes,

94
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,430
would you be willing to go?

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,310
I grew up here.

96
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
If I go abroad,

97
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,920
I don't think I'll be able to get used to it.

98
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,630
Don't you want to see the light again?

99
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
I've been blind for so many years.

100
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,480
I've long since

101
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,360
gotten used to this life.

102
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,680
Come on, let's go somewhere else.

103
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,120
Okay.

104
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,040
Wanyue,

105
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,430
no matter what sound you hear later,

106
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,480
don't move.

107
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,430
Okay.

108
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,320
What are you doing?

109
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,720
Don't move.

110
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,750
You'll know the answer later.

111
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
Open your mouth.

112
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,270
Is it tasty?

113
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes.

114
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,390
A person who doesn't love himself

115
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,790
isn't worth my love.

116
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,080
But I can't be with

117
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
the person who loves me.

118
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,240
Yanchuan,

119
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,270
Maybe tomorrow,

121
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,200
I'll become the person who killed your father.
