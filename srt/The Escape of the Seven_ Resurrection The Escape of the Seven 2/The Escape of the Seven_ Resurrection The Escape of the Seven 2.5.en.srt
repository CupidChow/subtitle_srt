1
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,119
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection )

2
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,919
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,288
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,990
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,689
(Episode 5)

6
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,789
Do you remember this place?

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,589
Yes.

8
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,829
But why did you want to come here?

9
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,998
So you could get a breather.

10
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,160
You've been stuck to your computer for several days.

11
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,529
You didn't eat or sleep.

12
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,000
What's the matter?

13
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,069
Is it because of Han Mone?

14
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,009
Because her mother died?

15
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,610
When I look at Mone,

16
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,919
she reminds me of me.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,519
I wasn't able to treat my mom well while she was alive.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,789
I was always testy with her.

19
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,059
I threw fits and was hardly home.

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,530
I gave her a hard time.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,469
I wondered if there was a time if I ever treated her well,

22
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,470
but...

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,500
There was none.

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,509
That was the thought I had in my mind.

25
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,250
I'm sure...

26
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,750
Mone's feeling...

27
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,959
the same feelings I had.

28
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,190
Han Na's grandmother...

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
was a good person.

30
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,069
Just like your mother.

31
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,309
Your aunt will meet Matthew...

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,009
to seal the deal for S Talk.

33
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,880
Then a large sum of money will be deposited as a down payment.

34
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,750
We need Lee Hwi So's fingerprint to get that money.

35
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,719
- When? - It's Han Mone's engagement today.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,989
K won't be home.

37
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,720
He'll be off guard too.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,919
How are you feeling today?

39
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,530
- I'm fine. - I'm glad.

40
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,929
Congratulations, Mone.

41
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,370
You look so beautiful today.

42
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,239
You two are a fantastic match.

43
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,810
Thank you.

44
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,439
You've prepared a grand engagement for my daughter.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,579
Thank you so much.

46
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,409
To show my appreciation,

47
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,979
how about an after-party at our place tonight?

48
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,819
You'll come with Mone, won't you?

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,789
If that's what she wants.

50
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,430
Sure.

51
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:13,500
I'll prepare the wine and the food.

52
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,199
Gosh, you're looking after us too.

53
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,569
You're such a romantic man.

54
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,469
Welcome to the TIKITAKA family, Mr. Hwang.

55
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,410
Can we talk casually now?

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,448
Mone.

57
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,780
You're so beautiful today.

58
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,630
Did you see Mone's ring?

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,929
How big do you think that rock is?

60
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,568
Just from a glance, I could tell it was over ten carats.

61
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,000
She's such a fox.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,768
If that's her engagement ring, I can only imagine her wedding ring.

63
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:00,780
Honey.

64
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,810
Did you learn anything from this?

65
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,448
She's a celebrity. I'm sure it's sponsored.

66
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,079
Didn't you hear? Nothing was sponsored.

67
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,979
Everything was paid out of their pockets.

68
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,250
Anyway, those who propose without a ring at hand...

69
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,160
should be buried in a ditch.

70
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,660
Deputy Mayor.

71
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,160
Do people use fake rings for fake marriages?

72
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,900
What are you saying?

73
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,299
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,840
What?

75
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,239
Look.

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,239
We're much better off than that fake couple.

77
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,840
We're not fake lovers.

78
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,710
We're real lovers. Isn't that right?

79
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,379
What a joke.

80
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,320
Get off me, I'm hot!

81
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,049
Mone is a public figure, so we're very cautious.

82
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,989
Please write nice articles for us.

83
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,520
Have you proposed to her?

84
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,590
Yes, I did.

85
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,058
Do you have any plans for children?

86
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,260
I think it's too early to think about children.

87
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,868
You're now the daughter-in-law of a conglomerate.

88
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:58,769
How did you two meet?

89
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,969
Are you here to see your sister?

90
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,340
This brings TIKITAKA and Save together.

91
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,439
Mr. Hwang, tell us how you feel.

92
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:06,640
I was thinking of contacting you soon.

93
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,780
I have a nice offer for you.

94
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,580
Can we have a quick chat?

95
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:29,700
Enjoy your time.

96
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,509
Isn't this the wine the British royal family drinks?

97
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,739
Gosh. He's way out of our league.

98
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,710
I can't believe how much he prepared for us.

99
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,049
I'd love to get close to him.

100
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,590
You're smiling from ear to ear.

101
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,589
Anything can win you over if it's free.

102
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,189
Hwang Chan Sung isn't rude like what the rumours say.

103
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,259
If he fell in love with Mone,

104
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,330
maybe he was a pure man at heart.

105
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,960
This is the only way Han Mone can survive.

106
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,668
She probably risked everything for this.

107
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,900
Don't look down on someone else's love.

108
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,700
I believe in pure love.

109
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,799
Just look at me.

110
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,679
You killed two people, but my heart for you remains strong.

111
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,978
I didn't kill two people!

112
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,309
They were both attempted murder.

113
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:17,749
Should I kill you instead?

114
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,079
How much is this anyway?

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,378
- In order to enjoy it later, - Gosh.

116
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,089
- we should open it now. - Put it down.

117
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,319
Stop thinking about drinking...

118
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,989
and go find Lee Hwi So instead.

119
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,119
You're too content these days.

120
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,228
A corrupted teacher, a corrupted agency,

121
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,729
a corrupted police officer, and a corrupted doctor...

122
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,029
Did you forget the fortune I've spent...

123
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,629
on clearing your names?

124
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,269
I'll get all of you arrested if you can't find Lee Hwi So.

125
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,400
So you better prepare yourselves.

126
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,039
It's a good day today,

127
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,239
so what's with the air?

128
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,879
No way.

129
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,619
Welcome, Mr. Hwang.

130
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
You're at Mone's parents' home,

131
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,400
so you make yourself at home too.

132
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,929
Attention, everyone.

133
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,368
As a means to congratulate their engagement,

134
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,239
- I'd like to say a word. - I'm sick of speeches.

135
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,369
Let's stop.

136
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Shall we?

137
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,038
Then let me introduce you to those in the inner circle.

138
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
They can introduce themselves.

139
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,650
You're Seoul's Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs, right?

140
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,049
Yes. The name's Yang Jin Mo.

141
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,259
I'm his wife, Go Myoung Ji.

142
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,390
We've been married for a year.

143
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,160
This is his first marriage,

144
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,900
- but I'm a single mom of two... - Okay.

145
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,929
That's too much information.

146
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,570
You're the head of Children Home, right?

147
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Yes.

148
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,340
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Ju Ran.

149
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,308
I actually studied medicine at the Seoul National University,

150
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,580
but I somehow ended up founding a company in AI.

151
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,689
Right. Too much information.

152
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,789
The chief of the Multi-region Investigation Unit of Gyeonggi-do.

153
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,189
I'm Nam Chul Woo.

154
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,229
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?

155
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,239
Mone, your glass is empty.

156
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,609
- Are you okay? - Ms. Geum!

157
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,879
Are you all right?

158
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,350
- I'll go get changed. - Okay.

159
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,090
You'll help me, won't you?

160
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,560
Of course.

161
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,739
Mr. Hwang, let's drink.

162
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,239
Shall we all drink together?

163
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,739
- Okay. - Sure.

164
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,239
Cheers!

165
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,580
- Cheers. - I'll wait...

166
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,040
until Mone returns.

167
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:06,909
Of course.

168
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,450
Right.

169
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,019
What do you think you're doing?

170
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,748
We have a guest.

171
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,989
Did you think I wouldn't know if you had hidden it?

172
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,330
Stop monitoring and intimidating me.

173
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,430
I won't let it pass anymore.

174
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,399
What are you scheming?

175
00:09:58,729 --> 00:09:59,930
Change your dress first.

176
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,809
I'm only trying to show Chan Sung...

177
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,639
that you're monitoring my every move.

178
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,580
You can't.

179
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,290
It's too late.

180
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,190
Mone, did something happen?

181
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Mone!

182
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,409
What happened to your face?

183
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,810
It's nothing.

184
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:47,550
Do you call this nothing?

185
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,580
Then it must've happened countless times.

186
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,149
Are you always this violent?

187
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,460
Mr. Hwang,

188
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,359
it's a misunderstanding.

189
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,430
- It wasn't me, she... - Shut...

190
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,330
that mouth.

191
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,399
What are you hiding behind your back?

192
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,310
It's nothing.

193
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,269
It looks like something to me.

194
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,739
Isn't that a camera and a tapping device?

195
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,279
Hand it over.

196
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,659
I said, hand it over!

197
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,070
Tell me why such a thing is in Mone's room.

198
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,498
You act like a good mother,

199
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,639
but you were watching Mone all this time.

200
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,779
Did you know about this, Chairman Lee?

201
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,879
Did you tolerate this behaviour?

202
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,450
I honestly didn't know about this.

203
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,720
Ms. Geum, what happened?

204
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,259
You won't even make up an excuse.

205
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,600
Your family's human rights were violated by Sim Jun Seok,

206
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,729
yet you're an assailant to another.

207
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm speechless.

208
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,340
How will the public react when they find out about this?

209
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,840
Ms. Geum, hurry up and apologize.

210
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,580
Mone, I truly didn't know.

211
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,849
Why didn't you tell me?

212
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,420
You're also at fault for not knowing.

213
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,149
Now that I know, I can't overlook this issue.

214
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,460
Treating my fiancée this way...

215
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,190
is the same as mocking me.

216
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,229
Mone, let's go.

217
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,129
Mr. Hwang.

218
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,769
Mr. Hwang.

219
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,710
Did you spy on her even at home?

220
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,139
It's a punishment for the traitor.

221
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,350
My goodness.

222
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,680
Maybe they tapped us too.

223
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,920
I wouldn't doubt it.

224
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,989
Mr. Hwang!

225
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,060
Mr. Hwang. No.

226
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,830
Wait. Just a minute.

227
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,450
Darn it.

228
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,648
What did you do?

229
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,220
Why did you put cameras in her room?

230
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,059
You're the one who told me to watch Mone.

231
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,629
You shouldn't have gotten caught!

232
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,499
How are you going to fix this if Chan Sung makes this public?

233
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,369
What if this stops Mone from getting the security program from Save?

234
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,100
That would never happen.

235
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,269
She's not that foolish.

236
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,840
Let me make myself clear.

237
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,080
To me, the most useful person right now isn't you. It's Mone.

238
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,950
No matter what happens, coax Mone into coming back.

239
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,220
If you fail, you'll be the first to go.

240
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,320
Got that?

241
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,529
Darn it.

242
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,940
We need to go to the secret room in order to log in to LUCA.

243
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,080
That's where LUCA's main system resides.

244
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,749
First, we must find a way to open that door.

245
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,379
We must hurry, Do Hyuk.

246
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,889
Lee Hwi So,

247
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,389
please help me.

248
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,139
Hello, Lee Hwi So.

249
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,269
Lee Hwi So is now connected.

250
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,569
(A student runs away with something in their arms.)

251
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,710
(The students returned to clean.)

252
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,940
Is this LUCA?

253
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,310
What Jin Mo said was right.

254
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,019
K built...

255
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,649
a big enough database to turn even an angel into the devil.

256
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,119
The epitome of that was Children Home.

257
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,330
LUCA?

258
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Who turned LUCA on?

259
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,469
LUCA.

260
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,499
LUCA!

261
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,239
Could it be Lee Hwi So?

262
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,139
LUCA!

263
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,779
There's a video of Lee Hwi So and one of Park Nan Young.

264
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:52,409
Let's play it.

265
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,619
Mom.

266
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,430
I feel bad for Medusa.

267
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,359
Medusa used to be very pretty.

268
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,270
But she was cursed,

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,270
and her hair turned into snakes.

270
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,698
- But... - Medusa.

271
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,239
She scared people and did bad things.

272
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,468
Da Mi is talking about Medusa.

273
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,209
She did those things because she was so lonely...

274
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:24,179
- What about it? - from living in hiding...

275
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,050
LUCA!

276
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,080
Connect me to the security cameras at home! Now!

277
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,619
LUCA!

278
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,290
I've been receiving information...

279
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,989
from someone called Medusa.

280
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,830
But the condition was not to tell you.

281
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:42,230
Medusa has the same goal as us.

282
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,929
To kill K and Geum La Hui.

283
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:45,629
What?

284
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,639
Thanks to Medusa, I found out Han Na's location,

285
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,240
and I also found out that Yoon Ji Sook was in trouble.

286
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,740
How did that person know?

287
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:52,969
I'm not sure.

288
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,340
All I know is that they contacted me through Save's server.

289
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,679
"Save?"

290
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,780
Are you saying Medusa is connected to Hwang Chan Sung?

291
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
Perhaps...

292
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,020
they're connected to Da Mi.

293
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,059
Who accessed my system?

294
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,159
Is it you, Lee Hwi So?

295
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,100
LUCA, disconnect Matthew.

296
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,070
Darn it!

297
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,530
I'll kill Lee Hwi So.

298
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,609
We don't have much time.

299
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,580
K will barge in any second.

300
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:28,879
LUCA,

301
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:31,949
transfer all information related to Lee Hwi So to my server.

302
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,909
Include everything including his fingerprint.

303
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:35,419
Yes, Lee Hwi So.

304
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:00,639
Did I doze off?

305
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,580
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,149
You must be tired after dealing with so many people.

307
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,550
You even talked in your sleep.

308
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,149
You said,

309
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,350
"Chan Sung, I miss you."

310
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,490
You can joke too?

311
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Thanks for doing as I asked earlier.

312
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:27,369
And for pretending to be furious.

313
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,240
I actually was furious.

314
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,540
And I meant it when I said I couldn't leave you there.

315
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:41,780
I'll find you a temporary home.

316
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Move out immediately.

317
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,419
No.

318
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:51,330
Ms. Geum will have to take me seriously now...

319
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,159
because you have my back.

320
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,399
Why do you have to live there?

321
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,240
To get revenge...

322
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
for my mom.

323
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,949
Will you come outside?

324
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,030
You can look now.

325
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,580
Mom.

326
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,520
You didn't get to say goodbye.

327
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,629
I prepared all this while praying for her...

328
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,530
to go to a better place.

329
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:40,869
Grieve all you want.

330
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,139
Mom.

331
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Do you feel cold?

332
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,490
You have no troublemaker kids there, do you?

333
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,389
Don't feel sad because of the likes of me.

334
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,760
Don't let me off because I'm yours.

335
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,600
Don't ever forgive me.

336
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,459
Who could it be?

337
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,260
Medusa.

338
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,530
In Lee Hwi So's video,

339
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,459
Medusa came up.

340
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,469
Then...

341
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:53,270
it's someone who remembers Da Mi as a child.

342
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,209
Lee Hwi So is dead.

343
00:22:58,449 --> 00:22:59,449
Ki Tak.

344
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,320
It's a huge if,

345
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:03,550
but what if Park Nan Young's alive?

346
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,119
That can't be.

347
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,350
She died in the fire six years ago.

348
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,520
I know it's nonsense.

349
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,159
But I want to check.

350
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,730
The house was burned down, so no bodies were found.

351
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,070
In some shape or form,

352
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,469
what if she's alive?

353
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,340
It's impossible.

354
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,570
We should meet Hwang Chan Sung first.

355
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,810
If Medusa is using Save's server,

356
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,280
it could be a huge clue.

357
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,429
Now...

358
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:57,030
it's time for you to show me how much I need you.

359
00:24:58,629 --> 00:24:59,629
Right away,

360
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,399
get me Save's security program.

361
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:03,570
Just like that?

362
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,080
Don't you think I waited a long time?

363
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,010
You're promising me...

364
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,480
that if I get you the security program,

365
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,050
you'll give me Geum La Hui's life, right?

366
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,959
You die within a minute upon drinking this.

367
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,199
The cause of death will appear to be heart failure.

368
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Okay?

369

372
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,740
Congratulations on the engagement.

What are you doing here?

374
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,790
Didn't Ms. Geum tell you?

375
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,389
I'm your new manager.

376
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:34,128
- What? - Ms. Geum and I...

377
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:35,659
have something in common.

378
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,168
Neither of us can stand you.

379

Do you even know what Ms. Geum's like?

380
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,669
- She killed our mom... - I don't care!

381
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,540
I just want you.

382
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:46,909
I'm warning you.

383
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,939

385

No. He skipped breakfast today.

391

I brought a sandwich.

392

400
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,070
I'll leave. Tell him to enjoy the food.

404
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,060
Have you heard the name "Medusa?"

405
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,490
"Medusa?"

406
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:20,769
You mean the snake-haired witch from Greek mythology?

407
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,770
I'm asking if you contacted me under the guise of Medusa.

408
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,179
I don't get why you're asking me that.

409
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Excuse me, then.

410

00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,529
You said I could use you if I needed to.

554
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,259
You said I could use you and do whatever I wanted.

555
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,199
Right now,

556
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:29,799
I need Save's security program.

557
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,739
Instead of stealing it, you could've just asked for it.

558
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:52,659
Here.

559
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,560
Give it to Matthew.

560
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,299
You knew?

561
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,630
However,

562
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,029
he's to think you stole it.

563
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,469
Do you understand?

564
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,319
Hwang Chan Sung.

565
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,119
What on earth are you?

566
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,500
LUCA will come online soon.

567
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:31,299
How do you know that?

568
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,469
Before LUCA comes back on,

569
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,900
delete the Children Home data first.

570
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:37,139
Wait.

571
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,069
Are you...

572
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,969
Bang Da Mi's stepmom Park Nan Young?

573
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,310
Answer me.

574
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,310
Hello?

575
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:00,659
Sir.

576
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,299
Han Mone sent this.

577
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:11,500
I knew she'd manage.

578
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,710
LUCA, log in.

579
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,949
Yes, Chairman.

580
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:23,219
Download Save's security program.

581
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,350
Downloading.

582
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,049
A new ID logged in.

583
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,289
- Who is it? - It is Lee Hwi So.

584
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,988
Track the IP address.

585
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:34,359
Yes, Chairman.

586
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,899
Connect Geum La Hui, Cha Ju Ran, Yang Jin Mo,

587
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,560
Go Myoung Ji, and Nam Chul Woo, on video calls.

588
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,330
Lee Hwi So showed himself.

589
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,170
Prepare to get him.

590
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:46,068
I have Lee Hwi So's location.

591
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,709
Seoul City Hall, mayor's office.

592
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,879
The mayor's office. That's where he is.

593
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,380
Yang Jin Mo, move it!

594
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,549
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

595
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:02,589
There's no one here.

596
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,920
LUCA, track Lee Hwi So again!

597
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,028
I have Lee Hwi So's location.

598
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,499
Go Myoung Ji's store.

599
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,330
Go Myoung Ji. He's there.

600
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm the only one here.

601
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:20,239
I have Lee Hwi So's location.

602
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:22,710
TIKITAKA Children Home office.

603
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,949
The Children Home database is being deleted.

604
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:27,409
What?

605
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,750
LUCA, stop it.

606
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,619
Do whatever it takes to stop it!

607
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,650
That is currently impossible.

608
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,919
- Access blocked. - Darn it.

609
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,520
Don't just stand there! Go to Children Home!

610
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,630
- Hey. - Stop!

611
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:47,969
You!

612
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,170
My gosh.

613
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Who are you?

614
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,869
Where's Lee Hwi So?

615
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,739
Where are you hiding him?

616
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:06,889
Min Do Hyuk?

617
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,819
Where do you think he is?

618
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,659
Guess if you can

619
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,270
There's no Lee Hwi So.

620
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:22,369
Why do you keep looking for him?

621
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,940
Do you remember the day you shot me in the stomach?

622
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,610
The person who died in the exhibition hall explosion...

623
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:31,139
was Lee Hwi So.

624
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,919
So the person you were chasing was an illusion.

625
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,279
It wasn't even an illusion.

626
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:40,889
It was me.

627
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:43,619
It wasn't Lee Hwi So?

628
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,029
It was you?

629
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:50,860
Then who did I see at the vacation home?

630
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
(Children Home)

631
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:55,069
Lee Hwi So.

632
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:56,469
You...

633
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,339
It was me.

634
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,219
Ms. Cha.

635
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
Yes?

636
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,380
Can you hold this for me?

637
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,790
Here.

638
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,770
- You! - What?

639
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,540
- Are you crazy? - Maybe?

640
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,639
What now? The Children Home's database...

641
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:34,439
was deleted for good. It can't be recovered, can it?

642
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,880
How could you delete...

643
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,710
Oh, no. Please don't do this.

644
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,509
You make life harder than it has to be.

645
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,519
Because of someone who doesn't even exist,

646
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,149
some live in fear,

647
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,350
and some are intimidated.

648
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,560
Jun Seok.

649
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,690
This is just the beginning.

650
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:56,230
I can become Lee Hwi So at any time.

651
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,699
And I can become Sim Jun Seok too.

652
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:01,029
Ms. Cha.

653
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,239
You're about to get really busy.

654
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:05,299
You have a press conference to host.

655
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,678
The DNA information of 70 percent of the population just vanished.

656
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,580
Isn't that a death sentence?

657
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:17,279
So you weren't a moron.

658
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:18,880
You were a genius.

659
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,889
How dare the likes of you dupe me?

660
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:29,859
As of today, you're fired!

661
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,230
It's just what I wanted.

662
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,670
(Letter of Resignation)

663
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,880
Breathe. Take a deep breath.

664
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,310
You look like a Boy Scout. Keep it.

665
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,679
You dirtbag, Min Do Hyuk!

666
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:52,319
Hey!

667
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:55,790
Sir. What should we do?

668
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,159
Mission complete.

669
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,060
Well done.

670
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,529
Now they know what you're capable of,

671
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,199
they'll be on high alert.

672
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,900
Be careful.

673
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:08,429
They can come at me at any time.

674
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,299
I'll take them all on.

675
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:19,909
Min Do Hyuk.

676
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:21,679
Good job.

677
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:32,259
Congratulations on a mission well done.

678
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,560
Shall we celebrate over a drink?

679
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,270
Shall we?

680
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:43,500
I was craving something killer.

681
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,900
You die within a minute upon drinking this.

682
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,040
The cause of death will appear to be heart failure.

683
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:26,009
My daughter's so special.

684
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:28,709
You seduced Hwang Chan Sung...

685
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,779
and got the security program.

686
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:32,619
Just like that.

687
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:40,759
Cheers.

688
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:52,839
Lovely.

689
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,540
One more shot.

690
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:00,679
Geum La Hui.

691
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:05,250
What you just drank wasn't liquor. It's poison.

692
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,290
If you drink that, you die within a minute.

693
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,989
I've only been waiting for this moment.

694
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,659
To kill the enemy who killed my mom...

695
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,799
right before my eyes in terrible pain.

696
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,239
Now go ahead and beg me to save you.

697
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,679
You'll regret this.

698
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,179
I finished regretting everything when my mom died!

699
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,690
Don't resent things too much.

700
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,020
Matthew and I have already agreed on this.

701
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,100
Why did you do it?

702
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,139
Why did you kill that poor woman?

703
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,380
If you despised me, why didn't you kill me?

704
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,540
You've paid for your own sins.

705
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,670
Goodbye.

706
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,549
Do you seriously think you've won?

707
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:04,839
Hey.

708
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,040
Did you think that was actually poison?

709
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,909
Matthew may be young,

710
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,449
but he's not dumb enough to be fooled by you.

711
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,980
Matthew, that piece of trash.

712
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:22,619
Matthew never lets a traitor live.

713
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:25,290
There is only one reason for keeping you alive.

714
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:28,830
That's because I still think that there's a use for you.

715
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,360
I'm saying your life is in my hands.

716
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,600
Got that?

717
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,509
You're the devil.

718
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,210
You're no different.

719
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:51,119
We're all devils.

720
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,719
The devils who killed Da Mi.

721
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,889
If Medusa is Park Nan Young, I'm sure she came to visit Da Mi.

722
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,770
Ki Tak, someone was here.

723
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:10,600
Did you seriously go there?

724
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,500
What is it you want to know?

725
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,710
Every branch has been decorated with fish-shaped ornaments.

726
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,210
Fish?

727
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,339
I've heard from Lee Hwi So.

728
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:23,219
Da Mi liked tropical fish, so he had gifted her a fish tank.

729
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,920
But if Park Nan Young really is Medusa,

730
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,690
why isn't she showing herself?

731
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,389
Because officially, she's a dead person.

732
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:34,159
Or, there could be a different reason.

733
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,100
I'll call you later.

734
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:42,569
Excuse me.

735
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,040
Sir!

736
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,339
Could I ask you a question?

737
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:51,909
Sir, have you ever seen someone who came to visit that tree?

738
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,779
Oh, do you mean that person?

739
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,048
That person's face was completely covered up,

740
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,449
so I looked, thinking it was weird.

741
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,318
She sometimes comes early in the morning...

742
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,389
to sweep and wipe things down.

743
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:06,119
She even put up those decorations.

744
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:08,529
But that woman...

745
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,060
had a limp.

746
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,369
Since when?

747
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,100
I'm not sure. About a month?

748
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,679
It was around that time that Medusa started contacting me.

749
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,049
Park Nan Young...

750
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:36,619
was alive.

751
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,869
(TIKITAKA's Children Home App Discontinuation Press Conference)

752
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,810
I'm Cha Ju Ran, director of TIKITAKA's Children Home app.

753
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,319
The app, Children Home, which started as a public service,

754
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,319
developed a critical error,

755
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:08,949
leading to the deletion of its entire database.

756
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,989
Therefore, we have decided to discontinue the service...

757
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,290
for Children Home.

758
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:16,600
Don't you have any backup data?

759
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:18,729
Since it is the valuable private information of citizens,

760
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,869
it was designed not to be backed up from the beginning.

761
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:23,500
How did the data end up being deleted?

762
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,399
According to our investigation,

763
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,439
we have discovered that it was due to spyware...

764
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,408
that Sim Jun Seok planted while registering No Han Na's location.

765
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,079
Don't you think the security is too weak?

766
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,278
- Over here! - Don't you think...

767
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,448
- Please give us a statement! - security should've been stronger?

768
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:38,218
- Isn't this too irresponsible? - Shouldn't you explain further?

769
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,389
- Please explain further. - Do you have anything more to say?

770
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,159
The jerk who was standing before me was Min Do Hyuk.

771
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,659
The jerk who broke into my house was also Min Do Hyuk.

772
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:49,730
That jerk is continuing to screw me over.

773
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:53,069
How much is he actually capable of?

774
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,170
What Jin Mo said was right.

775
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,839
K built...

776
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,409
a big enough database to turn even an angel...

777
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,980
into the devil.

778
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,310
The epitome of that was Children Home.

779
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,819
Grandma.

780
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,529
Thank you for taking care of me...

781
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,960
all this time.

782
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:00,569
Let's meet again in the skies.

783
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,199
Grandma.

784
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,849
Put away your bags and wash your hands first, okay?

785
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,880
- Okay. - Okay.

786
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,049
Hey, Go Phillip.

787
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,330
Do you know how many calls I get from directors,

788
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,960
saying they want to shoot dramas with me?

789
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,969
But I've decided to star in the movie produced by TIKITAKA,

790
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:35,770
"Escape."

791
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,639
Sorry.

792
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,210
You don't know English, do you?

793
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:45,339
"Escape" means to get away from someplace.

794
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,650
Listen carefully, will you?

795
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,949
Why did you hit me?

796
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:57,319
Every time you boast about yourself,

797
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,759
I get so sleepy.

798
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,000
Hey, just run my lines with me.

799
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,869
I can't read yet.

800
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,569
Gosh, you idiot. Is there anything you can do?

801
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,040
Then,

802
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,779
shall I run your lines with you?

803
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,420
Will you be able to do it?

804
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,880
Acting is super hard.

805
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,489
You can teach me because I don't know how.

806
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,460
You're a superstar.

807
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,690
All right.

808
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,830
Then, watch what I do and repeat after me.

809
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,729
I'm the daughter, and you're the mom.

810
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,799
Here we go.

811
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,698
Kids, come and eat your snacks.

812
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:45,739
Snacks?

813
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,969
Yes, snacks!

814
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,929
Everyone, gather at TIKITAKA Cinema.

815
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:09,190
I will present to you the best movie ever.

816
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,630
Matthew.

817
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:16,528
Chairman Sim Yong just wired 50,000 dollars out of the penalty...

818
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:17,569
he got from K.

819
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:21,170
We've gone through all of K's bank accounts and stocks.

820
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,639
But we haven't even found half of Chairman Bang's money.

821
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,210
There's no need to rush. We have plenty of time.

822
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,278
I just want to get all the money back...

823
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:29,779
before we meet Park Nan Young.

824
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:37,060
It is time for us to meet.

825
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:41,089
Come to Yongin Public Parking Lot by exactly 7pm.

826
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:44,199
Get into the car waiting for you, and you'll get a location.

827
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,600
Come with Kang Ki Tak.

828
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,100
I look forward to our meeting.

829
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,639
Ki Tak.

830
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,940
Medusa sent a message.

831
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,170
She wants to meet with us.

832
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,110
Come on in.

833
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,850
What's this about a movie, all of a sudden?

834
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:09,020
Soon, the by-election for the mayor of Seoul will be held.

835
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,319
I consider this the launch of Deputy Mayor Yang Jin Mo.

836
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:14,529
What does the mayor of Seoul have to do with a movie?

837
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:16,730
Thank you, Chairman Lee.

838
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:19,900
My dear Jin Mo is completely ready.

839
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,000
Thank you. I will do my best to win.

840
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,239
Well, then. Shall we raise our glasses first?

841
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,369
For the new mayor of Seoul.

842
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,839
- Cheers! - Cheers!

843
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,690
The movie will begin soon. You can look forward to it.

844
00:58:50,299 --> 00:58:51,860
I don't think this is a movie.

845
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,029
No.

846
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:56,940
It will be a very thrilling and impressive movie.

847
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,449
That's...

848
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,350
Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak.

849
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,420
What happened?

850
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,420
Pipe down and just enjoy the show.

851
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,969
When you come to where the navigation system guides you,

852
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:31,369
you can meet me.

853
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,839
We also look forward to meeting you,

854
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:35,409
Medusa.

855
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,210
"Medusa?"

856
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,110
Who's Medusa?

857
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:44,678
Until now, Min Do Hyuk has been receiving information...

858
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:46,850
from someone called Medusa.

859
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:49,790
They were always able to move one step ahead of us,

860
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,819
thanks to Medusa.

861
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,489
Min Do Hyuk has another person helping him?

862
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,069
Min Do Hyuk doesn't seem to know who that helper is either.

863
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,869
Just stay quiet if you don't know.

864
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:03,939
Chairman Lee is trying...

865
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,670
to catch Min Do Hyuk by using Medusa.

866
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,810
How did you know about the existence of Medusa?

867
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,179
It was all thanks to Min Do Hyuk hacking into LUCA's system.

868
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,279
We may have lost Children Home,

869
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,850
but we did gain something.

870
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:18,420
So, this is LUCA?

871
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:20,549
I've been receiving information...

872
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,088
from someone called Medusa.

873
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:25,920
But the condition was not to tell you.

874
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,330
Medusa has the same goal as us.

875
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,029
To kill K and Geum La Hui.

876
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:31,699
What?

877
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,730
Thanks to Medusa, I found out Han Na's location,

878
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,330
and I also found out that Yoon Ji Sook was in trouble.

879
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,469
Today will become Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak's last day.

880
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,119
All right then.

881
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,860
All right.

882
01:00:57,089 --> 01:00:59,060
From now on, the real movie will begin.

883
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,159
Go and take your seats.

884
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,670
- Why did you stop? - No, Ki Tak. I didn't stop...

885
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:04,460
- Why are you doing this, Do Hyuk? - It's not me.

886
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:07,989
Darn it!

887
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:19,540
- K... - Good to see you.

888
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,710
Life is tough, isn't it?

889
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:25,940
But sadly, you won't be able to meet Medusa,

890
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,679
the person you're dying to meet.

891
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,089
I can't unbuckle my seatbelt.

892
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,159
The glass won't break either.

893
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:48,770
All right.

894
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,009
Do Hyuk.

895
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,980
All right.

896
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:07,350
He's crazy.

897
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:09,549
He's lost his mind.

898
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,619
Is he laughing right now?

899
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:13,690
This is supposed to be fun? He's totally insane.

900
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,389
Is murder a joke? Crazy jerk.

901
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,730
He's not even human.

902
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,869
No. I have to stop this, no matter what.

903
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:27,210
(Under construction)

904
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:46,889
(End, Good-bye)

905
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:49,790
Do Hyuk.

906
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:02,069
No matter how hard you try, it's no use.

907
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,040
The only thing that awaits you is sweet death.

908
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,589
You're all crazy! You crazy people.

909
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,770
What is this? Things were just getting fun!

910
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,869
We have to get out of here now.

911
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,239
What is it?

912
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,580
What?

913
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:46,618
What's up with this place? Is there a fire somewhere?

914
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:47,750
A fire? All of a sudden?

915
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:49,089
What...

916
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:50,960
I think it's just malfunctioning.

917
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,559
No, I need to get out.

918
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,029
Now is the time to be cautious about every little thing.

919
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,560
Darn it!

920
01:04:57,659 --> 01:04:59,029
Where do you think you're going?

921
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:01,869
Go and sit down, you fools!

922
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,000
Unless you want to die along with Min Do Hyuk.

923
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,540
I will end this.

924
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,380
Darn it.

925
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,528
System unlocked. Escape now.

926
01:05:28,529 --> 01:05:29,960
Medusa is helping us.

927
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,759
What? Medusa?

928
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,170
Ki Tak, jump!

929
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:50,179
Gosh darn it!

930
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,650
How dare you ruin my plan?

931
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,850
Don't move.

932
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,619
Medusa is among you.

933
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:00,489
Who is Medusa?

934
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:02,429
Who's the traitor?

935
01:06:41,069 --> 01:06:43,969
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

936
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,940
Find out who Medusa is!

937
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,610
Then, I'll let you live!

938
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,009
You're Medusa?

939
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,409
Why did you help us?

940
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,009
Punishment for what I did to my daughter.

941
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,779
I will destroy what's precious to you, one by one.

942
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,819
What if Mone is on the same side as Medusa?

943
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:01,319
That child looks oddly similar to Mone.

944
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:03,219
Of course I'll kill him!

945
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,360
I've been checking the facts on the Bang Da Mi case.

946
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,759
Won't you join me in fighting against Matthew?
