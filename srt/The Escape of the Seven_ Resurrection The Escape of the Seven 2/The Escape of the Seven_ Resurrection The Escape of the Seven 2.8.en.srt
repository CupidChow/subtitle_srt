00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,148
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

2
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,888
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,089
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,950
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:02,230
(Episode 8)

6
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,069
Geum La Hui!

7
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,709
Geum La Hui, you crazy wench. What are you doing right now?

8
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,079
- Hey, Geum La Hui. - Geum La Hui!

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,918
- Geum La Hui! - Hey, Geum La Hui!

10
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,350
How dare you?

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,750
Honey!

12
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,990
Chul Woo! I'm right here.

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
- It's okay! - Chul Woo.

14
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,530
Jin Mo, are you okay?

15
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,259
- Chul Woo... - Can you hear me?

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,199
Jin Mo!

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,270
Welcome to the fiery pit.

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,669
We will begin a survival game from now on.

19
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,640
In order to live,

20
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,610
you must follow my orders, no matter what.

21
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,119
It sounds like fun, doesn't it?

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,619
All right, then.

23
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,089
Shall we start with Bang Da Mi's story first?

24
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:01,890
The first game is Confession.

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,459
To the person who confesses their sins in detail,

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,459
I'll give you a chance to live.

27
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,069
What kind of nonsense is this?

28
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,669
What confession are you talking about?

29
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,769
Untie these chains if you don't want to die!

30
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,970
You were going around, calling yourself Medusa.

31
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,280
What kind of deal did you make with Hwang Chan Sung?

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,978
It wasn't enough that you ripped off Ju Ran and my money?

33
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,410
Now, you want our lives too?

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,819
Then, what will you do after you get our confessions?

35
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,549
Talking about Bang Da Mi after all this time?

36
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,389
Even still, you're just a murderer who killed your own daughter.

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,518
You're the one who drove her to the end.

38
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,859
You, Geum La Hui!

39
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,130
You depraved, immoral wench.

40
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,759
What right do you have to speak Bang Da Mi's name?

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,259
You don't even deserve to be called a mom!

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,299
Who do you think had to endure watching the unthinkable?

43
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,539
You pretended to be a mom, selling your own daughter's name.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,139
You devilish wench.

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,539
You turn the murderer who killed your daughter into a national hero?

46
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,009
All because of some money?

47
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,280
What's all this nonsense? Since when were you a mom?

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,078
You should've done better when she was still alive!

49
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,479
What do you think you can do now?

50
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,479
You crazy psycho! Hurry up and untie these chains!

51
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,289
What if she's regretting it?

52
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,460
What if that was why she contacted you?

53
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,130
Geum La Hui.

54
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,030
Why are you only listening?

55
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,970
Are you really regretting it?

56
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,069
- What's this? - That seems bad.

57
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,340
- What? - Oh, no.

58
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,009
That crazy wench. She's going to crush us to death.

59
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,940
It... It stopped moving!

60
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,579
This is unfair!

61
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,250
Untie me right now!

62
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,419
If you left me dirt poor, you should at least let me live!

63
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,160
All right.

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,460
Do you finally feel ready to speak up?

65
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,710
I'll give you another chance.

66
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,450
If confessing is hard,

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,520
you can reveal each other's sins.

68
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,590
Those who stay silent...

69
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,059
will end up dying in that room soon.

70
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,900
Will you really let us out...

71
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,129
if we do as you tell us to?

72
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,439
You really won't do anything to my kids, right?

73
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,939
Of course.

74
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,609
There are three minutes left.

75
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,479
This was why...

76
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,320
Geum La Hui planned the survival game.

77
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,020
She wants to reveal their sins on a live broadcast.

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,489
Then, I'll go first.

79
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,729
That woman, Cha Ju Ran,

80
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,589
made a fake pregnancy diagnosis...

81
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,999
and tricked everyone that Da Mi was pregnant.

82
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,629
It's something a doctor should never do.

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,729
The corrupt doctor, Cha Ju Ran.

84
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,100
Bang Da Mi?

85
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:34,369
(Bang Da Mi)

86
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,799
Yes, Bang Da Mi.

87
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,039
There's something I haven't told you, Chairman Bang.

88
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,780
Da Mi visited my hospital not too long ago.

89
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,340
I have her chart here too.

90
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,009
(Bang Da Mi, Confirmed pregnancy)

91
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,049
Why, you!

92
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,249
How dare you?

93
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,619
Shut up.

94
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:52,819
You were the one...

95
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,590
who made a false statement that Da Mi gave birth.

96
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,059
I saw it.

97
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,530
Bang Da Mi giving birth.

98
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,530
Just to hide your affair, right?

99
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,460
Should I list the newest sins that have been updated?

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,428
That woman, Cha Ju Ran,

101
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,339
even kidnapped Erica and staged a joint kidnapping act...

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,309
to get more people to register on Children Home.

103
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,510
And what about you?

104
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,738
During the Seoul Mayor lobbying incident,

105
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,239
you fabricated the evidence.

106
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,308
Using college entrance as an excuse, you sold...

107
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,749
ridiculous paintings and went on a power trip with students' parents.

108
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,879
A corrupt teacher like you becoming the mayor's wife?

109
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,150
I'm sure your children will learn so much from you.

110
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:28,819
The lies I told were nothing compared to what you've done!

111
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,890
Right back at you!

112
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,229
All I've done is lie to Da Mi's grandpa.

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,499
That old man was senile for believing everything I said.

114
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,200
And who tried to kill that old man?

115
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,330
Who tried to kill Kang Ki Tak?

116
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,840
But he didn't die!

117
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,570
Nobody died because of me!

118
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,710
Hey, Nam Chul Woo.

119
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,978
You turned an innocent citizen into a drug-addicted murderer...

120
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,450
and made him get the death penalty, didn't you?

121
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:53,720
You nasty jerk.

122
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,950
You only see drug addicts since you are one yourself, don't you?

123
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,090
And who started the fake news?

124
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,460
It was you, Yang Jin Mo.

125
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,058
If you hadn't started Scarlet Letter,

126
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,229
Da Mi would never have become known to the entire country.

127
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,900
You manipulator of public opinion.

128
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,299
Create fake news during an online live broadcast.

129
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,270
You're the worst of the worst!

130
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,709
The fact that a jerk like you...

131
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,910
is a candidate for the mayor of Seoul...

132
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,710
is proof that this world is going crazy.

133
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,479
Oh, right! I heard you did drugs again.

134
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,979
What a befitting ending for you.

135
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,748
A mutt would quit eating poop before you quit doing drugs.

136
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:32,320
A mutt? Did you just compare me to a dog, you son of a dog?

137
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,189
I graduated at the top of my class at the Police University!

138
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,688
You only finished middle school and used to work in a bar.

139
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,889
Who do you think you are?

140
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,199
It's better to pour drinks than do drugs!

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,228
Why, you little...

142
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,428
Fine, go ahead and hit me, you jerk!

143
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,599
I ought to kill this little piece of trash.

144
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,368
Hey, Geum La Hui! Untie these chains right now!

145
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,339
- Let me at him! - I ought to...

146
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,910
All of you, shut your darned mouths!

147
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,850
What did Geum La Hui do to make you blab on like that?

148
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,450
Why?

149
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,689
Are you scared?

150
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,520
Are you afraid you'll get caught as the fake Lee Hwi So?

151
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,229
Should I list all of the names of those who died because of you?

152
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,489
Be quiet, you punk.

153
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,729
There's a stench that murderers give off.

154
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,030
No matter how much plastic surgery you get or steal other's names,

155
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,999
that nasty stench never goes away.

156
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,270
Bang Da Mi's murderer.

157
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,580
A depraved man who killed his own parents.

158
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,179
And what about you?

159
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,410
You're nothing but a lowlife thug.

160
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Jun Seok.

161
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,619
When these chains come off,

162
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,220
you'll die then.

163
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,690
Kill me, then.

164
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,358
Kill me now, you punk.

165
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,369
I said to kill me now!

166
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,700
You're crazy.

167
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,619
Why? I thought you were good at fighting.

168
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,229
What?

169
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,470
Does it hurt right here?

170
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,840
- I still have this hand. - Fine.

171
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,649
Darn it.

172
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,159
Die, you jerk.

173
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
You jerk.

174
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,569
You call yourself human...

175
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,439
when you made your student seem like she gave birth?

176
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,939
Before everything comes to light during the election campaign,

177
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,709
it might be better to just die here, don't you think?

178
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,508
Why would I die here? Worry about yourself,

179
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,509
you scumbag piece of trash!

180
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,279
Are you seriously crazy?

181
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,950
That hurts!

182
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,420
Wait!

183
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,790
But...

184
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,930
why isn't Mone here?

185
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,729
Oh, right. Han Mone.

186
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:27,899
Did Hwang Chan Sung get her out, perhaps?

187
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,969
Even at the brink of death, she uses her personal connections.

188
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,999
That nasty wench.

189
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,540
- Let go of me! - You!

190
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,409
Mone will die too.

191
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,979
In a different way from you guys.

192
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,148
(TIKITAKA CEO Geum La Hui confesses in "Confession")

193
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,519
(Live broadcast cancelled)

194
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,759
You're sure Geum La Hui is here, right?

195
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,859
What is she planning to do on the live broadcast?

196
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,869
That's not what's important.

197
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,440
What's important is that the chance to kill Geum La Hui yourself...

198
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,509
is now here.

199
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,350
Hang on.

200
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,560
It's a time bomb. Get out now!

201
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,080
It's Geum La Hui's doing.

202
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,690
It wasn't enough to kill my mom.

203
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,050
Now she's trying to kill me!

204
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,159
You said you wanted to kill Geum La Hui, right?

205
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,229
Today is that day.

206
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Get over here!

207
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,060
- I forgot to let you know earlier. - You jerk.

208
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:38,960
You are being live-streamed on Save right now.

209
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,930
And everything you just said too.

210
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,670
That crazy wench...

211
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,399
- Why, I ought to... - There are cameras.

212
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,810
Cameras.

213
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,639
Hey!

214
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,249
None of it is true. No!

215
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,719
Only the parts I said about Yang Jin Mo were true.

216
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,879
Everyone, don't be fooled...

217
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,290
Erica, Phillip. You're not watching this, are you?

218
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,719
Mom is not a bad person.

219
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,888
That crazy lady was just lying about everything.

220
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,659
They weren't lies, kids!

221
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,229
I'll change the rules.

222
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,170
Now, only one person can survive and leave each room.

223
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,239
You must kill the other with the gun first...

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
in order to escape from that room.

225
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,009
Do you mean you want us to...

226
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,009
shoot and kill one another?

227
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,149
That's your choice.

228
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,749
Will you kill and survive?

229
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,519
Or...

230
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,389
will you be killed?

231
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,029
What?

232
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,440
The key is in the room, so look for it carefully.

233
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,100
There's only a single bullet. You get five minutes.

234
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,769
If you don't shoot within five minutes,

235
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,840
everyone will die.

236
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,139
Geum La Hui!

237
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,180
What ridiculous nonsense!

238
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,479
That means we'll all end up dead anyway!

239
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,550
We're all going to die, but you're just putting on a show!

240
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,090
That's right.

241
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,220
In five minutes, this basement jail...

242
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,119
will disappear without a trace because of a time bomb.

243
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,790
A time bomb?

244
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,129
What do we do?

245
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,200
A time bomb...

246
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,800
Hey! Are you crazy?

247
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:25,729
If you want to live,

248
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:26,970
is there any other way?

249
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,369
As of now, the only way out is to win the fight...

250
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,170
and to escape this room first.

251
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,210
From now on, it's punishment time.

252
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,350
Why, that...

253
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,619
(Bang Da Mi)

254
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,560
No...

255
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,100
That rat.

256
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,629
Hey!

257
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,149
No!

258
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,590
Honey, I don't want to die.

259
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,619
We can get out of here alive, right?

260
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:58,759
Of course. We have to meet again.

261
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,859
You know how hard it was for us to love again.

262
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,029
Be sure to get out alive.

263
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,628
If you don't,

264
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,499
you'll die by my hands in the afterlife, Nam Chul Woo.

265
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,139
Erica, Phillip. Wait for me.

266
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,440
Mom will be there soon.

267
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,810
Mom will come and explain everything.

268
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
I will never abandon you.

269
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:19,909
I will not disappear irresponsibly like my parents did.

270
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,320
You jerk.

271
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,550
Paeng Hee, don't worry.

272
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,720
I won't let Han Na be alone again.

273
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,320
I promised you...

274
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,220
that I'd protect Han Na until the end.

275
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,159
K.

276
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,359
Remember this moment today.

277
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,700
The day our ill-fated relationship ends.

278
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,999
You people wouldn't know even if you die and come back to life.

279
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,570
You won't know the sorrow of being a fake son.

280
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,440
You won't know how cheap it is to give something only to take it back.

281
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,739
You made yourself into a fake son.

282
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,279
Kang Ki Tak.

283
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,619
This letter...

284
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,920
is the last apology letter I write to you.

285
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,389
And it will become my will.

286
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,760
I believe you will take good care of the aftermath.

287
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,629
Today,

288
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,199
I plan to reveal all of our sins...

289
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,800
on a Save live broadcast and to kill everyone.

290
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,639
I also...

291
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,810
do not deserve a comfortable death.

292
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,149
(Live broadcast cancelled)

293
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,850
La Hui.

294
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,280
You were fooled by Hwang Chan Sung.

295
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,919
The live broadcast won't happen.

296
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,540
Do Hyuk!

297
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,480
Do Hyuk!

298
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
La Hui.

299
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:57,879
La Hui.

300
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
La Hui!

301
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,320
Do Hyuk!

302
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,159
To them,

303
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,990
I will give back Da Mi's pain of dying from a gunshot.

304
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,629
They ought to know...

305
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,969
just how terrifying that was.

306
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,070
(Bang Da Mi)

307
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,759
Hey, stay still.

308
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,859
Oh, no!

309
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,030
Hey!

310
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,350
Min Do Hyuk.

311
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,719
Acting like a phoenix is over for you today.

312
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,959
Geum La Hui. I hope you end up in the fiery pit!

313
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,869
A bomb is installed here too.

314
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,369
We have to get out of here quickly.

315
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,750
Geum La Hui.

316
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,119
Why are you...

317
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,600
- Jin Mo! - Ju Ran!

318
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Darn it.

319
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,820
You psycho.

320
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,770
We must get out of here, Ju Ran!

321
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,070
There's no time.

322
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,439
Hurry.

323
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,350
Geum La Hui. You!

324
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,250
Die!

325
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,320
Darling!

326
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,089
Darling.

327
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,889
No. You're my children's dad.

328
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:50,800
It was decided from the start.

329
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:55,080
I was to die in vain.

330
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,579
(Bang Da Mi)

331
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,750
Like Da Mi who died with a bullet in her heart.

332
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,649
Like Park Nan Young who got burned to cinders.

333
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,689
Like Lee Hwi So who got shredded by a bomb.

334
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Will the Almighty...

335
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,459
allow me to get my revenge?

336
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,169
Min Do Hyuk. Pull yourself together.

337
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:58,310
You can't die.

338
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,050
Darn it.

339
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,250
Just a little further. You'll be fine.

340
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,948
It's okay. You'll be okay.

341
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:25,949
Darling.

342
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,060
That psycho.

343
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,608
Tonight at 7:30pm, in the Gagok District,

344
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,080
a large bomb went off in an act of terrorism.

345
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,480
Police are focusing efforts on finding out what happened.

346
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,149
Darn it.

347
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,850
How can you laugh at a time like this?

348
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,290
Min Do Hyuk is dead.

349
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,969
I killed him.

350
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,939
He's not here.

351
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,409
It means he died there with Geum La Hui.

352
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,050
Now we just have to come up with a story.

353
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,480
The live broadcast won't be a problem.

354
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,619
How will you handle Hwang Chan Sung?

355
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,349
He's working with La Hui.

356
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,820
I'll silence him myself.

357
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,189
Geum La Hui threatened us, and we had no choice but to lie.

358
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:41,830
She tried to kill us,

359
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,730
so we had to say what she wanted to hear.

360
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,239
The cruel mom who abandoned her daughter...

361
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,369
for money.

362
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,609
I'll testify too.

363
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll say the wench took all my money.

364
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,780
I can blame La Hui for my drug charge.

365
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,010
But...

366
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,149
will the public believe us?

367
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,020
You and she were close.

368
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:10,119
You used Da Mi to get this far.

369
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:12,230
We can say Matthew got duped too.

370
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,928
Now Geum La Hui...

371
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,330
is guilty of killing Do Hyuk, the national hero.

372
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,730
You're the expert at spreading fake news.

373
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:23,199
If we're lucky, we can use this to cover up...

374
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,869
our sham marriage scandal.

375
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:28,709
If we get our stories straight,

376
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,040
it's totally doable.

377
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:33,649
Who's there?

378
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:35,850
This place is off limits!

379
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,899
Congratulations, everyone.

380
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,859
For getting back alive.

381
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,629
Do you have a death wish?

382
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,399
You colluded with La Hui and tried to kill me?

383
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,439
Jun Seok.

384
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,840
Get your face out of mine.

385
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,709
I still haven't gotten used to...

386
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:09,919
your new face.

387
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,820
Who do you think got you out alive?

388
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:23,159
You'd have all died in there if I hadn't opened the exit.

389
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Oh, right.

390
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:29,300
Shall I tell you something fun?

391
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,770
Min Do Hyuk. He's not dead.

392
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,379
He's alive.

393
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:53,629
It's shredded.

394
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:55,129
Mosquito forceps.

395
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:01,639
Ki Tak.

396
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,770
My gosh.

397
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,379
You're in such shock, your face is half its usual size.

398
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,109
But don't worry.

399
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,850
The best doctors are working on him.

400
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,550
This is my friend's hospital, so the secret is safe.

401
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,090
I banned reporters from entering.

402
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,320
Thank you.

403
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,330
You were the only person I could call.

404
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:34,330
You don't have to say such meaningless niceties.

405
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,300
From now on,

406
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,009
you can call me Mi Young.

407
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,340
You don't have to be so formal.

408
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,780
Do you feel uncomfortable, ma'am?

409
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:48,820
Do Hyuk is in critical condition.

410
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,179
I promise.

411
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,550
I'll bring him back to life.

412
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,459
I'm his aunt. His only family.

413
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,819
As long as Sim Jun Seok lives,

414
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,459
Do Hyuk will never die.

415
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,629
I'm the type to keep my word.

416
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,030
I'm the icon of promise.

417
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,939
I trust in you, Mi Young.

418
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,310
Where is he right now?

419
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm looking for him.

420
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,310
I think Sim Mi Young got involved.

421
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:21,780
Blood is thicker than water.

422
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:24,750
She rushed over as soon as she heard her nephew was hurt.

423
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,490
He's not dead?

424
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,719
The persistent fool cheated death so many times.

425
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,790
Do Hyuk isn't our problem right now.

426
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,429
What about the live broadcast?

427
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,128
What we did was aired far and wide.

428
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,129
Society will practically execute us.

429
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,199
I took care of that already.

430
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:44,070
The live broadcast was cancelled.

431
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,939
I was never going to do it.

432
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,840
It was just a trick to dupe Geum La Hui.

433
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,679
Thank you.

434
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,980
You saved us.

435
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,550
You're like a deity to us.

436
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,320
That's right.

437
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,619
A deity.

438
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,060
I have the videos of you confessing.

439
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:11,869
You what?

440
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:13,368
Delete them right now.

441
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,369
Darn it.

442
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,240
That's pointless. I made backup copies already.

443
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,379
Do you get it now?

444
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:29,149
Your lives are in my hands.

445
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,020
Especially you, Sim Jun Seok.

446
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:34,850
I could be a Grim Reaper...

447
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,560
or a saviour.

448
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,730
What do you want?

449
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
What do I want?

450
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:48,869
LUCA.

451
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,609
Let's share it.

452
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,740
Are you insane? What nonsense is that?

453
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,549
Why can't you share?

454
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,178
You want to haggle in this situation?

455
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,378
Give him what he wants!

456
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,718
What's more important than our lives?

457
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:07,148
That's right. We did as you said so far.

458
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:08,490
Look at us now.

459
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:11,359
We almost got slaughtered by La Hui.

460
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,189
If that's what you want, Mr. Hwang,

461
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:14,459
we'll help you.

462
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,800
Whatever it may be,

463
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,399
I'll steal to bring it to you.

464
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:21,429
Trust us.

465
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,810
As of now, I'll handle the Gagok District...

466
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,740
terror plot.

467
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,810
Okay.

468
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,349
Where did she go?

469
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,819
- Show yourself, Ju Ran! - Is she here?

470
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,019
I need to get my money back.

471
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,189
- I know you're in there! - What's going on?

472
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,628
- Come on out! - You can't hide forever.

473
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:50,529
Give me back my money, Ju Ran.

474
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,029
Turn around and walk.

475
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,429
- Why? - Let's get out of here.

476
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,409
Hey.

477
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,709
Mom.

478
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Erica.

479
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,679
Phillip.

480
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,259
Where's Dad?

481
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,889
Is he okay?

482
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,759
He'll be fine after he's treated at the hospital.

483
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,299
Don't worry too much.

484
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,109
Last night, Geum La Hui announced a live broadcast...

485
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,948
titled "Confession" would take place from 7pm on Save.

486
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,919
But right before going online, Geum cancelled the stream,

487
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,349
and at 7:30pm,

488
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,989
she set off a string of bombs in Gagok District.

489
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,818
Before the explosion, Geum announced the stream...

490
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:51,819
You're awake.

491
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,089
How about a coffee?

492
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,460
How did you get in?

493
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,230
I knew the code long ago.

494
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,869
Mone.

495
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,980
You're beautiful when you sleep.

496
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:15,178
You were in my bedroom too?

497
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,179
Yes.

498
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:18,949
You were so fast asleep, I didn't wake you.

499
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,020
With Ms. Geum now gone,

500
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,790
won't you feel lonely in this huge place on your own?

501
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,659
I should stay with you for a while.

502
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,270
Until we get married.

503
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,069
No.

504
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,139
You don't need to.

505
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,610
I can't relax unless I do.

506
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,719
Drink up.

507
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,630
I wanted to ask you something.

508
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,330
Were you aware that Ms. Geum was going to kill everyone...

509
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,440
in the Gagok District?

510
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,670
Yes, of course.

511
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,440
You were part of La Hui's original plan.

512
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:18,949
To get you out, I had to...

513
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,210
sacrifice someone else.

514
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,850
Someone else?

515
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,549
Who was that?

516
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,790
Min Do Hyuk of course.

517
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,520
You even told me how to get him.

518
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,859
You had a key with which you could call him at any time.

519
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,060
(Press when in danger)

520
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,469
What?

521
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,069
So...

522
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,270
is he dead?

523
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,279
Let's talk about something interesting.

524
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:03,219
Soon, Save will report something exciting.

525
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,730
Hey.

526
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:07,159
That must be it.

527
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,049
(Video of Geum La Hui abusing her daughter 6 years ago!)

528
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,150
Do you want to tell your parents?

529
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Do you want to go back?

530
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,989
Then go back!

531
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,659
Mom.

532
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:50,699
How do you have this?

533
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:56,580
I did some fact-checking.

534
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:00,249
Geum La Hui's dashcam footage from six years ago,

535
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,379
the CCTV footage from nearby,

536
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,420
and her call history with Joo Yong Ju...

537
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,449
It was hard work getting it all.

538
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
So,

539
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,989
now it's time for me to make a move.

540
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,159

541
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:19,699

00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,759
will have shocked you to the core.

551
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,790
But it's all a fact.

552
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,399
Save always had a negative view of TIKITAKA.

553
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,860
Was that related to this?

554
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,270
Save...

555
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,139
cares about nothing but facts.

556
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,770
I have a question for Chairman Lee.

557
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,008
Did you have no idea...

558
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:02,838
Geum La Hui constantly abused Bang Da Mi?

559
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,508
(TIKITAKA and Save Joint Press Conference)

560
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,509
I'm ashamed to say...

561
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,250
that I had no idea Geum La Hui was leading a double life.

562
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:11,179
That's on me.

563
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,189
I realized much later that she had taken Da Mi from me...

564
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,389
so she could take Da Mi's grandfather's money.

565
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,929
That's not all.

566
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:20,889
She embezzled from TIKITAKA...

567
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,599
and had no qualms to blackmail politicians for her own gain.

568
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,199
That doesn't mean...

569
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,770
Chairman Lee is blameless.

570
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,279
I admit to that.

571
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,810
As of this moment,

572
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,750
I will resign from my position at TIKITAKA...

573
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:45,150
and will cooperate with the police investigation.

574
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,170
Sit down over here.

575
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,738
Wait here for a while.

576
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,310
I'll get your dad discharged.

577
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,709
Erica. Are you here to see your dad?

578
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,218
Did you know your parents' marriage was a sham?

579
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,289
Do your mom and dad sleep in different rooms?

580
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,650
Do you eat together?

581
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:22,259
Did you see them fight?

582
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,789
Han Na, while staying with a foster family,

583
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,389
did you ever feel wronged or discriminated against?

584
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,129
When no one was watching, were they mean to you?

585
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,859
We're all reporters.

586
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,670
You can tell us anything.

587
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,170
Leave the kids alone.

588
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:41,339
They did nothing wrong.

589
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,479
If you have questions, ask me.

590
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,779
I will, then.

591
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,749
Will you give up running for mayor?

592
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,219
How did you become a victim of Geum La Hui's terrorist attack?

593
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,419
Were you an accomplice?

594
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,289
We heard a recording of you saying you'd use Han Na in the election.

595
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,388
Do you admit to that?

596
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,129
If it's proven your marriage was a sham,

597
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,290
you might not be able to foster Han Na anymore.

598
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,699
We're not a fake family!

599
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,369
I...

600
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,299
know that much.

601
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:10,969
Erica and Phillip.

602
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:13,170
And everyone else. I love them.

603
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,779
Ms. Go...

604
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,080
likes Mr. Yang too.

605
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,279
And Mr. Yang.

606
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,920
He sincerely looked out for my mom and me for a long time.

607
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:28,819
I'm grateful for that.

608
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:31,819
Get out of my way.

609
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,259
I'll make something very clear.

610
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:37,860
My husband will run for mayor.

611
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,900
All the suspicions and rumours about our family...

612
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,100
will be judged by the voters.

613
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:51,380
It's so tasty.

614
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,449
Darling. Have some soup.

615
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,150
It's killer.

616
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:03,759
- Darling. - Yes?

617
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Do you have money?

618
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,028
Why do you keep asking? Don't you trust me?

619
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:10,960
Trusting you is separate matter...

620
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
from you being penniless.

621
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,199
Here.

622
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,339
- Listen and learn. - Okay.

623
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:21,670
Who's our ringleader?

624
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,710
Matthew.

625
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,849
He got crushed and flattened.

626
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,110
Then who is it?

627
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,779
- There she is. - Who?

628
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,190
Is Mone our leader?

629
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,330
No. Hwang Chan Sung is.

630
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,428
Rome's Antonius had Cleopatra,

631
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,459
and Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty had Yang Guifei.

632
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,799
Then, who has her thumb on Hwang Chan Sung?

633
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:48,069
Over here.

634
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,369
Ma'am.

635
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,159
Mone!

636
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,690
Goodness!

637
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,360
Are you here?

638
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:22,130
Welcome, Mr. Hwang.

639
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,040
What brought the two of you here?

640
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,580
Geum La Hui took all their money, so they didn't have anywhere to go.

641
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,310
Technically speaking, we own a part of this house.

642
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,420
We fell for Geum La Hui's trick and lost all of our fortune.

643
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,388
Until we get that money back,

644
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,219
we won't leave this house.

645
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,869
Don't tell me you brought them on purpose.

646
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,500
Of course not.

647
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,338
I allowed it since I figured...

648
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:01,239
you'd be more at ease knowing I wasn't alone at home.

649
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,679
Gosh, you bought flowers.

650
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,449
I look forward to getting along with you, Mr. Hwang.

651
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:17,389
Right.

652
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,730
You two should get married soon and move to a new place.

653
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,860
Yes.

654
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,529
We'll make sure to look after this house,

655
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,029
so don't worry about it.

656
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:29,799
Why not take the opportunity to take over TIKITAKA?

657
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,609
You should show Sim Jun Seok a lesson.

658
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,969
We'll support you all the way.

659
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,310
- All the way. - All the way.

660
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,040
I love you, honey.

661
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,150
Thank you.

662
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:43,580
Hwang Chan Sung.

663
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,619
Two can play this game.

664
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,420
I won't be so easy to beat.

665
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,540
Geum La Hui...

666
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:08,909
Geum La Hui...

667
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,210
Do Hyuk.

668
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,139
Can you hear me?

669
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:19,850
Do you recognize me?

670
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,259
You were unconscious for a week.

671
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,489
It's okay.

672
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:28,389
You can rest easy now.

673
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,330
Ki Tak.

674
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,429
Geum La Hui...

675
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,100
Geum La Hui...

676
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,619
Throw them all out.

677
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,480
If you want anything, you can go ahead.

(Dream24Trans)

679
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,159
I'm in paradise

680
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,130
Who are you?

681
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,738
(Cha Ju Ran, the balance you owe is 5,000,000 dollars.)

682
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:13,739
(Cha Ju Ran, the balance you owe is 2,000,000 dollars.)

683
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,440
(Cha Ju Ran, the balance you owe is zero dollars.)

684
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,080
Hello?

685
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:27,020
This is Cha Ju Ran.

686
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,889
Hey, Dr. Cha. Long time no talk.

687
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:32,790
What got you to call me first?

688
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,559
What is going on? How do I have zero balance owing?

689
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,698
I just received the text.

690
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:38,130
That?

691
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:41,500
The deputy of Geum La Hui came and paid everything back.

692
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,699
Geum La Hui? Are you sure you're not mistaken?

693
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,310
She said all you had was money.

694
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,979
She didn't want anyone to fall victim...

695
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,779
to lending you money.

696
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,909
She sure knows how to get things done.

697
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,980
Okay. I got it.

698
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
Right.

699
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:04,819
Let's never see each other again.

700
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,600
Stop. Wait.

701
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,399
Leave that box behind.

(Dream24Trans)

703
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,810
Geum La Hui, what's with you?

704
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,549
Why did you pay back my debt?

705
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:31,850
It's not like you.

706
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,330
No way.

707
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,830
Were you planning to die all along?

708
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Why?

709
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,299
For what?

710
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,449
You were alive?

711
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,589
Why did you only contact me now?

712
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,319
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

713
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,219
Is it okay for you to be outside?

714
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,400
There was something I couldn't tell you.

715
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,839
That day at the reservoir,

716
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,409
the person who died in Sim Jun Seok place...

717
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,350
was your brother Cheong Soo.

718
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:37,049
What?

719
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,960
You're all crazy.

720
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:49,560
Why are you only telling me this now?

721
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,759
Who was behind it? Was it K?

722
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,569
I bet Geum La Hui helped him.

723
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,000
Geum La Hui...

724

Geum La Hui...

725
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:02,610
Geum La Hui deserved to die.

726
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,710
Yes.

727
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,980
But not the way she did.

728
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,449
She didn't deserve to die...

729
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:11,080
in the hands of Hwang Chan Sung.

730
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:15,549
The one who saved me...

731
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,259
was Geum La Hui.

732
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,730
Are you saying this because she saved you?

733
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,529
Were you moved?

734
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,360
I'm sure she had a reason.

735
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,500
Both K and Geum La Hui are psychopaths all the same.

736
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,639
They're crazy people who killed my mom and brother!

737
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Mone.

738
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,139
There's something you should know about your mother.

739
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,079
My mom?

740
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,409
- What is it? - This is a letter...

741
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:42,880
Geum La Hui left for Ki Tak.

742
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:52,489
I have something to confess.

743
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,290
Mone's mom...

744
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:57,659
is still alive.

745
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,130
I hated Mone to death,

746
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,270
but I couldn't do anything to her mom.

747
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:06,869
Thank you.

748
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:08,540
She...

749
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,739
- thanked me. - Thank you...

750
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,679
She had no idea her son was dead before her...

751
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,920
when she thanked me.

752
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,190
Bring me an unclaimed dead female within an hour.

753
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,619
Do it as fast as possible.

754
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:30,299
Long time no see, So Yeon.

755
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,500
Are you well?

756
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,569
What brings you to my place?

757
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,069
I need you to help me.

758
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,009
Firstly,

759
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:45,380
let's start packing.

760
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:54,449
This lady...

761
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,389
It's Mone's mom.

762
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,730
- What? - Take care of her for a while.

763
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:04,029
Stay out of everyone's sight.

764
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:06,230
You can't use your phone either.

765
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:07,730
Only go out to buy groceries.

766
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,600
Make sure you keep her comfortable.

767
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Unfortunately,

768
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,949
Hwang Chan Sung found out about it.

769
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:24,949
She's with him now.

770
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,589
Please find Mone's mom for me.

771
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,219
That woman...

772
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,219
is innocent.

773
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,589
Mom...

774
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,690
Mom was alive?

775
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,569
Is this true? Is this letter real?

776
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,069
I can't guarantee it,

777
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,400
but it's worth checking.

778
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,040
Hwang Chan Sung, that jerk.

779
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:50,739
How can he put up such a show while holding Mom hostage?

780
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,110
He's out of his mind.

781
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,110
- Don't get worked up. - Let go!

782
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:59,049
No. It can't be true.

783
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,850
All of it must be a lie.

784
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,519
Why would she save my mom?

785
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,889
Geum La Hui is different from K.

786
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,989
At least near her end.

787
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,060
She intended to kill all of us to take everything for herself.

788
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:11,330
That was why she stole Cha Ju Ran's money.

789
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,369
She was punished for her wrongdoing, and that was why she died.

790
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,270
From the very beginning,

791
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,139
she planned to die there.

792
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,940
I couldn't understand it either,

793
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,210
nor believe that she was Medusa.

794
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,980
But,

795
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,089
people change.

796
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:38,589
I was a thug, but for once,

797
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,230
I wanted to live like a human.

798
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,029
Maybe Geum La Hui...

799
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,299
also felt the same.

800
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,299
I don't want to hear it!

801
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,900
What do you know about that woman?

802
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,420
If...

803
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:42,049
If you find...

804
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,790
even a handful of my ashes,

805
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,100
please throw it as far away from Da Mi as possible...

806
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,699
so we'll never meet in the afterlife.

807
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,040
Maybe I'm worrying for nothing.

808
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:01,339
Da Mi will be in paradise,

809
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:04,210
while I'll be punished in suffering.

810
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,080
Da Mi...

811
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,779
Did you meet...

812
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,290
your parents up there?

813
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,060
I hope you're happy.

814
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,779
I did everything you asked.

815
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:41,880
I even took care of Cha Ju Ran's debt...

816
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,619
so no one suffered from the damage.

817
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,069
Geum La Hui.

818
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:16,049
Since when did she get a prosthetic leg?

819
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:18,079
Why did she hide it?

820
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,819
What could she gain from that?

821
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,489
If she hated me so much,

822
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:24,489
why did she save my mom?

823

(Our family)

826
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:00,759
I found out who gave me the sketchbook and the crayons.

827
00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:02,029
Who?

828
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,659
Ms. Dimples.

829
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,299
I guess she was watching me all along.

830
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,400
Why did Geum La Hui do that?

831
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,610
Why did she give this sketchbook to Han Na?

832
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,179
Who knows?

833
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,980
Only she will know.

834
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,179
It doesn't make sense.

835
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,750
She knew where Han Na was.

836
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,989
She should've told Matthew to make use of her,

837
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,330
but she was hiding Han Na.

838

(Our family)

839
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,569
Do you think she was regretting it?

840
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:46,199
Regret what?

841
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:48,009
I'm talking about Da Mi.

842
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,710
Maybe when she found Han Na,

843
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,650
she might have reminded her of Da Mi.

00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,900
Do you think...

846
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,529
that's a possibility?

847
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,239
Maybe Geum La Hui...

848
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,480
was a mom too.

(Bang Chil Sung, Bang Da Mi)

858
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,130
You should ask for her forgiveness in person.

Da Mi...

860
00:59:07,779 --> 00:59:08,779

861
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:13,549

I'm not thankful.

Why didn't you tell me?

869
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,980
Why did you torment me so much?

874
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,790
Of course not. I got the text.

Gosh.

01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,770
