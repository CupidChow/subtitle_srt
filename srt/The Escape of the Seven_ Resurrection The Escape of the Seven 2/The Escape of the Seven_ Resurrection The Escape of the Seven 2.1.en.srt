5
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,339
Happy birthday, dear Da Mi

6
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:16,750
Happy birthday to you

7
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,319
Happy birthday, Da Mi.

8
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:25,390
Happy birthday, Da Mi.

9
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,119
Thank you for being my daughter.

10
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,690
When did you get so big?

11
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,330
Thank you,

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Mom and Dad.

13
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,169
Did you hear that?

14
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,898
She called me "Mom."

15
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,599
What are you talking about? She called me "Dad."

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,939
I heard it myself.

17
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,940
No, she called me "Mom."

18
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,839
Come here, Da Mi.

19
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,079
If I were on television

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,219
I would be so happy

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,190
Da Mi! Good job!

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,660
Now, remind me what I taught you.

25
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,029
I must listen to my teacher,

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,930
get along with my friends,

27
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,839
and never follow strangers.

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,239
Da Mi is so smart.

29
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,910
Honey, we won't have to worry.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,909
Good luck, Da Mi.

31
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,380
I'll do my best! See you later.

32
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,350

Please don't...

Ki Tak.

43
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,299
It's really you, Ki Tak.

44
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,809
It's not a dream.

45
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,879
Thank you, Do Hyuk.

46
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Good job.

47
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,749
Thanks for hanging in there.

48
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460

Mr. Lee Hwi So...

51
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,999
You must be Min Do Hyuk.

52
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:39,439
Thank you so much for protecting Da Mi until the end.

53
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:42,710
Also, I'm indebted to your mother and brother.

54
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,879
We have to hurry.

55
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,608
We need to get out of this building.

56
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:46,609
Ki Tak,

57
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,618
this flash drive has all the information on LUCA.

58
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:50,688
You have to get out of here!

59
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:51,788
If they find a corpse here,

60
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,589
they'll be at ease thinking that Do Hyuk is dead.

61
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,988
Hurry. You must run!

62
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:56,989
Now!

63
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,919
How many months was I in bed?

64
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,619
You neared death several times.

65
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,289
But you survived miraculously every time.

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Ki Tak.

67
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,260
Madam No is dead.

68
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:35,859
I know.

69
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,299
I looked for Han Na too,

70
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,100
but she disappeared without a trace.

71
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,910
(I, Lee Hwi So, will fight for the truth.)

72
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,479
What is that?

73
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,910
Why is he Lee Hwi So?

74
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,850
The world has turned upside down.

75
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,720
K has become Lee Hwi So now,

76
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,989
thanks to the help of Geum La Hui.

77
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,220
The whole country is going wild for Matthew Lee, the hero.

78
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
(Lee Hwi So)

79
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
(Messenger Mobile Secret)

80
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,459
K stole the achievements of Lee Hwi So...

81
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,059
who was involved with the secret chatroom.

82
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,399
Not only did he rig the tattoo on his heart, his fingerprints,

83
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,369
dentist records, and burn scars,

84
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,840
but also the police's database.

85
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,710
He proved he was Lee Hwi So.

86
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,070
(We will remember you forever.)

87
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:27,949
With a tearful act,

88
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,479
he made the country believe that he was Lee Hwi So.

89
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,689
He even stole Chairman Bang's money.

90
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,819
Who is Min Do Hyuk?

91
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,759
- Who is he? - Who is he?

92
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,030
You were identified as Sim Jun Seok and became wanted.

93
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,030
The whole country is attacking Sungchan Group now.

94
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you saying the whole country believes it?

95
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,869
In such a ridiculous forgery?

96
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,770
That's the power of LUCA.

97
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,609
LUCA that Lee Hwi So created.

98
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,070
"LUCA?"

99
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,510
Lee Hwi So left this to you.

100
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,450
He told me everything about LUCA is on that flash drive.

101
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,650
Unfortunately, I don't know the password.

102
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,289
I wasn't able to open it yet.

103
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,289
We'll have to solve it...

104
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,559
no matter what.

105
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,559
You're currently wanted.

106
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,600
You shouldn't meet anyone,

107
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:16,530
and you shouldn't go around carelessly.

108
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,970
We desperately need this person's help.

109
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,200
We're on our way to meet her now.

110
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,179
You're here.

111
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,950
You resemble...

112
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,550
him.

113
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,729
He was tacky. He liked soju,

114
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,529
although he was rich.

115
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,999
In the financial world,

116
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,408
he was seen as a rare genius in math and physics.

117
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,970
He became known for it then.

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
But what's the use?

119
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,749
He died in the hands of the monster he created.

120
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,379
As for me,

121
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,479
I wasn't that close to your father.

122
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,590
We were just realistic siblings.

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,359
But,

124
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,989
I was very close to your mother.

125
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,659
She was an adult I respected the most.

126
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,300
That was why I helped you.

127
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,470
To help her release any grudges.

128
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,009
I'm sorry,

129
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,779
but I don't have the capacity to look after Sungchan Group.

130
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,479
That's good news to me.

131
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,909
I can take the whole thing for myself.

132
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,720
It looks like you have no choice...

133
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,450
but to cooperate with me.

134
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,850
What do you mean?

135
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,090
Because I saved your life.

136
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,559
Not anyone can keep a wanted man alive,

137
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
let alone at a hospital to give him medical treatment.

138
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:57,069
So whether you like it or not,

139
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,369
when you're taking your revenge,

140
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,540
include Sungchan Group as well as your biological parents.

141
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,570
I'm not bargaining with you.

142
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,869
I'm ordering you.

143
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,009
TIKITAKA continues to buy out the subsidiaries of Sungchan Group.

144
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,149
The funding must be what they stole from Chairman Bang.

145
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,279
Do Hyuk.

146
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,889
It's time for you to step up.

147
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,359
Here. Take it.

148
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,269
This is the money I got for you.

149
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,699
But don't be mistaken.

150
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,300
I don't mean I accept you as my nephew.

151
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,709
I'm investing all I have...

152
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,779
on the frustration inside you.

153
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,850
You need seed money, even for revenge.

154
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,449
I won't accept it.

155
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,320
You won't? Why not?

156
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,749
You should manage the company funds yourself.

157
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,790
For now, I want to focus on K who killed my mom and my brother.

158
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,060
Also, the six that betrayed me,

159
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,430
and TIKITAKA...

160
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,229
who rose to power by stealing from Chairman Bang and Lee Hwi So.

161
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,800
I only want to think about how I will destroy them.

162
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,600
After that,

163
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,970
I'll gain back Sungchan Group in honor.

164
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,840
I'll make them pay the price...

165
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,550
for taking my biological parents' lives then.

166
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:19,279
Then...

167
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,119
do you need me to make you a new identity?

168
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,749
You can't keep living in hiding like this.

169
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,149
No.

170
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,220
Min Do Hyuk.

171
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,619
I'll go back to living with my own name.

172
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,159
Even if you end up selling all the other subsidiaries,

173
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,399
make sure you keep S Talk.

174
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,830
It's the heart of Sungchan Group.

175
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,340
We'll be able to use it as a hand against K at the right time.

176
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,518
From a wrongfully condemned criminal to an established entrepreneur,

177
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,190
Chairman Lee Hwi So of TIKITAKA is attracting attention.

178
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,258
You recently took over Sungchan Group's key businesses...

179
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,989
including construction, trading, and hotels.

180
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,399
Why don't you say something to our listeners?

181
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,330
My daughter Da Mi...

182
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,369
was a victim of deepfake technology.

183
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,739
The Korean media is...

184
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,369
in an unrecoverable state.

185
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,879
They report fake news without verifying it,

186
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,340
while the public goes wild for only stimulating news.

187
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,369
To celebrate my transformation into Lee Hwi So,

188
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,930
I'll reward each of you with five million dollars.

189
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,869
All of your dirty pasts have been cleared too.

190
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,108
Five million dollars? Is this a dream?

191
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,180
My goodness.

192
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,080
Except for you two.

193
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,290
Where will you run to with this money?

194
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
I won't...

195
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,589
You betrayed me once. I can never trust you again.

196
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,388
No, sir.

197
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,590
It won't ever happen again.

198
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:12,659
We mean it.

199
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,930
From now on, our lives belong to you.

200
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,729
That's enough.

201

202
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,940
Thank you! Thank you so much!

203
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,479
Why are you two so quiet?

204
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,909
Do I have to be moved by this?

205
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,080
I could easily make that with a couple of commercials.

206
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,779

207
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,690
Without him, your actress days would be over.

208
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
You promised us wealth and fame,

209
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,060
and our dreams...

210
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,330
really came true.

211
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,399
Thank you.

212
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,340
I shouldn't show any hostility yet.

213
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,340
Until I find Han Na,

214
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,810
I must act like I'm on his side even if it makes me churn inside.

215
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,080
I have one more good news for you.

216
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,009
Yang Jin Mo.

217
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,450
Prepare to become Seoul's Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs.

218
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,450
That pretty face of yours...

219
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,720
will pay off in politics too.

220
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:16,720
Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs?

221
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,930
And his partner will be Go Myoung Ji.

222
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,759

223
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,369
"Support him?"

224
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,940
You'll become husband and wife.

225
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,470
You'll have to live together, of course.

226
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,970
This is Ms. Geum's idea.

227

228

Don't ask, and don't argue. Understand?

233
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,729
Why aren't you answering me?

234
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,090
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

236
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,129
You can't let anyone catch on that you're a family in disguise.

237

You have a problem.

Do you have a phone phobia?

265

Can't you just keep your phone off at this hour?

266

without having to work for the rest of my life.

283
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,869
So why do I feel so empty inside?

284
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,070
It feels like there's a hole in me.

00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,169
We're K's slaves. What's the use of being rich?

What we need...

287
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,409
is freedom.

Also, she always cries and turns off the TV when you're on.

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,480
Lee Hwi So, Park Nan Young,

369
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Bang Da Mi.

370
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,619
You said you tried 1-2-3-4-7-7-7-7...

371
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,790
but still couldn't get in.

372
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,830
We must access LUCA soon.

373
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:29,230
K hired a black hat hacker...

374
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,199
to steal personal information and company secrets.

375
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:33,928
Through LUCA,

376
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,240
- he wants to gain absolute power. - LUCA.

377
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,169
Start updating.

378
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,009
So that others can't gain access,

379
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,340
he'll continuously update the system.

380
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,320
I can't imagine how far LUCA's power reaches.

381
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,320
I think I need to take this...

382
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,859
and access LUCA directly.

383
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,230
We might be able to find a clue.

384
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,759
Considering the security,

385
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,730
K's vacation home will be a better bet.

386
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,429
He rarely goes there these days.

387
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,540
Let's move tomorrow night at 10pm.

388
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
Okay.

389
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,310
You can look now.

390
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,480
This is our store now. What do you think?

391
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,990
I love it.

392
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,359
It's so luxurious.

393
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,929
Mom. It's so awesome.

394
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:39,669
I'll make lots of money and give you the best.

395
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,399
So no one can look down on you.

396
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you trust me?

397
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
- Yes. - Yes.

398
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,409
Also,

399
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,280
you'll soon have a dad.

400
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,580
A dad? Who is it?

401
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,449
Is it someone I know?

402
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:01,149
I wish he were handsome.

403
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,990
Like me.

404
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,300
It's Mr. Yang Jin Mo.

405
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Mr. Yang?

406
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,830
For real?

407
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:14,399
I love it.

408
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,969
He's the dad I always dreamed of.

409
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,280
Mom, you're the best.

410
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,649
The best.

411
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,949
I love you, Mom.

412
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,320
I love you.

413
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:40,060
If you like it,

414
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,129
I like it too.

415
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:54,510
It's my first time in a wedding dress.

416
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,980
Wearing one at my age...

417
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,549
feels quite awkward.

418
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,749
You look beautiful.

419
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,820
Who would think you're a mom of two?

420
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,919
You're not the only one doing this for the first time.

421
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,458
She couldn't try one on yet either.

422
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,060
It's not that I couldn't. I didn't.

423
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,959
Watch what you say so that weird rumors don't start.

424
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:20,369
I can't stand her attitude much longer.

425
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:21,739
- By the way. - What?

426
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,099
Mr. Nam's rejoining the Multi-region Investigation Unit?

427
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,969
Yes. Matthew pulled some strings.

428
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,779
He wants me to work at TIKITAKA too.

429
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,279
Gosh. Congratulations. What's the position?

430
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,178
A vice-chairman at least, right?

431
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,618
I don't know. It's up to Matthew.

432
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,449
It's not about what I want.

433
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:42,059
As soon as you got the order to get married,

434
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,119
you rushed to get wedding photos taken.

435
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,029
I don't get what Matthew is thinking.

436
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,629
Marriage could help his businessman image,

437
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,668
but how could he think of making a thug...

438
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,240
a deputy mayor of Seoul?

439
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
What do you mean?

440
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,270
What about my Jin Mo?

441
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,040
Are you defending him already?

442
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,749
It's not a real marriage.

443
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,810
You're pretending to be family for show.

444
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,649
Either way, I don't like badmouthing people in secret.

445
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,888
From now on, don't call my husband...

446
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:15,559
terrible things like "thug."

447
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,559
Sure. I understand.

448
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,159
Ms. Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs.

449
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,300
- Mom! - Mom!

450
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,669
We're not late, are we?

451
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,769
You look beautiful today.

452
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,138
You look so pretty.

453
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:31,810
Like a princess.

454
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:35,539
You're adorable.

455
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,279
You're a cheeky one, aren't you? I can tell.

456
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
How are your grades?

457
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:42,179
I'm not cheeky. I'm Go Phillip.

458
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,790
And can you not touch me, please?

459
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:49,689
My cheeks are reserved for my mom.

460
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,958
- My gosh. - Well done.

461
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,789
You're mean for a kid.

462
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,359
I'm everyone's pushover.

463
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:59,469
Making me feel bad for not having a kid of my own.

464
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,070
Ju Ran.

465
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,439
Relax.

466
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,939
If you're upset, gain your own following.

467
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,969
How?

468
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,009
How could I put it in words?

469
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,409
You're so silly.

470
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,779
I'm jealous of Myoung Ji.

471
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,149
Real or fake, she has a husband now.

472
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,059
She has a family she always dreamed of.

473
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,260
That's something money can't buy.

474
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,060
I wish I had a kid like that.

475
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,530
Let's shoot some photos.

476
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,739
How lovely.

477
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,070
You look great together.

478
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,740
Smile brightly.

479
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,480
Look at the bride lovingly.

480
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,689
Come over here.

481
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,419
Big smiles.

482
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,990
Good job.

483
00:30:58,859 --> 00:30:59,958
Thank you.

484
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,559
We're done, so I'll head off.

485
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Matthew called.

486
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:03,899
Wrap up.

487
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,530
There was a shoot.

488
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,109
Let me introduce...

489
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,810
Mr. Yang Jin Mo, the man I told you about.

490
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,108
It's a pleasure to meet you.

491
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,109
Hello.

492
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,780
I heard you ran an entertainment agency.

493
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,388
As Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs,

494
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:28,688
what would you like to do?

495
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:31,119
I won't do much thinking.

496
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,060
I'll just follow your instructions.

497
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,029
He brought up many famous actors,

498
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,270
so he'll be quite useful.

499
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,199
Like you, he cares a lot about the socially disadvantaged,

500
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,469
so he'll be a great partner.

501
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,580
Since you vouch for him, Matthew,

502
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,439
I'll trust in him.

503
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,850
Thank you.

504
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,218
You laid low for five years to avenge your daughter,

505
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:57,980
and you became a successful businessman.

506
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,419
If I can't trust you, who would I trust?

507
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,879
Come this way.

508
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,260
I'm not sure if it'll be to your taste.

509
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,899
If there's anything you want to eat, just tell me.

510
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,500
My mom is an awesome cook.

511
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,300
Try this.

512
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:51,500
It's braised short ribs, her ambitious new project.

513
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,469
Try the japchae too.

514
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,679
She just made the shrimp jeon.

515
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:59,050
No. Eat what I gave you first.

516
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,480
You can start eating.

517
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,609
Jin Mo.

518
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:41,990
We got married because Matthew told us to.

519
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,889
But we can never be a real family.

520
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:48,230
You don't have to put on a show at home.

521
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:49,760
Don't mind me.

522
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,030
I'm...

523
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:57,469
Do me a favor.

524
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,840
Don't...

525
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,770
hurt the kids.

526
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,609
That's all I ask.

527
00:34:07,449 --> 00:34:08,780
You can use the closet here.

528
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,520
I'll stay in the living room. I'd prefer that.

529
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Right.

530
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:27,600
Did the meeting with the mayor go well?

531
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:30,239
It was okay. I guess.

532
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,339
Jin Mo will become Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs.

533
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:35,909
But something doesn't feel right.

534
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:37,639
Yang Jin Mo, that punk.

535
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,048
Once a traitor always a traitor.

536
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,980
He'll show his claws one day.

537
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,350
Why worry when he's being watched?

538
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,350
By Go Myoung Ji?

539
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,659
She'll do anything for her kids.

540
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,759
We can use that.

541
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,159
Right.

542
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,130
She's not like you. You abandoned your kid.

543
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:10,310
Isn't that why you need me?

544
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,049
The project to make Lee Hwi So a hero.

545
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,489
Will you hear it?

546
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,000
My daughter Da Mi...

547
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,040
was a victim of Sim Jun Seok and the wave of fake news.

548
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,810
Even she who was murdered...

549
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:42,440
will support me, her father.

550
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,179
Cry.

551
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,850
From now on,

552
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,489
as Lee Hwi So, Da Mi's father,

553
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,190
I announce war on the evil...

554
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:01,630
that is fake news.

555
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,770
Bravo.

556
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:17,738
That was perfect. I love it.

557
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:19,250
It's the best project ever.

558
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:23,779
I'm pleased that you're pleased.

559
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,420
There's nothing I won't do for you.

560
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,048
You fly to the US on business tomorrow.

561
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:30,020
- Are you packed? - I'll start packing now.

562
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,589
I plan to tour all the global content producers.

563
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,429
The plan is to stay for 15 days,

564
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,029
but I might take longer.

565
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,369
Do as you wish.

566
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,129
Good work with the presentation.

567
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,369
I'll give you ten million dollars as a bonus.

568
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,610
You will?

569
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,659
Ten million dollars...

570
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:09,699
It's the best day...

571
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:13,569
of Geum La Hui's life.

572
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,899
Come over here now!

573
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,069

Did you see that?

587
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:46,589
Your stepdad killed you.

588
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:48,290
How about it?

589
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:49,759
Shall I kill him for you?

590
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,298
No.

(Bang Da Mi)

592
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,170
Don't do...

593
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,909
anything to my dad.

594
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,779
I can get rid of your birth mom too.

595
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,810
Geum La Hui. I'll kill her for you.

596
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,179
Don't.

597
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,830
Don't pretend to be good.

598
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,060
It's her fault you ended up like this.

599
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,460
For money, she abandoned you and used you.

600
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:28,999
Your mom was the one who framed and tried to kill you...

601
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
for all those ugly things.

602
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,969
All parents are hypocrites.

603
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,009
My mom.

604
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,549
She's not a bad person.

605
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,380
I bet she did that...

606
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,520
because she had a rough life.

607
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,790
Shut your mouth!

608
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,659
She deserves to die!

609
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,489
You hate her too, don't you?

610
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:57,960
Say you want me to kill her!

611
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,380
Say it! It's your last chance.

612
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,009
Say it.

613
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,750
Don't do this.

614
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,049
It was...

615
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:24,560
nice to get to see her again.

616
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,830
I'd missed her.

617
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,170
Can you...

618
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,810
kill me instead...

619
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:42,310
and...

620
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,179
let my mom live?

621
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Please?

622
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,380
Then die.

623
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,589
Why did you beg that punk?

624
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,060
What for?

625
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,830
Why?

626
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:44,469
Why?

627
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,659
Do you like this?

628
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,369
A kiss? How sweet of you.

629
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,040
Kiss.

00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,759
Mom?

638
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,770
Where are you, Mom?

639
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:31,509
Run away.

640
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,810
Why are you doing this?

641
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,119
You don't know?

642
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,460
Mom...

643
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,330
No!

644
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:51,529
I shouldn't have had you.

645
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,899
Don't hurt me!

646
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,338
- Please let me live. - Shut up!

647
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,699
Please be my mom just this once.

648
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,869
Do whatever it takes to stop it!

649
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,380
Kill if you must.

650
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,679
Don't do this.

651
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,880
It was nice to get to see her again.

652
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,119
I'd missed her.

653
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:19,230
Can you kill me instead...

654
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,429
and let my mom live?

655
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,130
Please?

656
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:28,299
Okay.

657
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,610
How could you do that?

658
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,250
How, to your own daughter?

659
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:47,520
You adored her.

660
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:49,560
So how could you do that?

661
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:51,719
Look.

662
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:55,029
Da Mi died trying to protect you.

663
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,360
You gave up on her so many times,

664
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,830
but she died protecting you.

665
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,440
Why on earth...

666
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,239
did you hate her so much?

667
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,179
Why?

668
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,380
Because...

669
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,880
she was so much like him.

670
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,349
She trusted others easily,

671
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,790
was so darn good, and even liked fish!

672
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,158
Whenever I saw her,

673
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,529
she reminded me of him, and it drove me crazy!

674
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:30,860
You call that an excuse?

675
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,900
I don't care if you call it that.

676
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:36,770
I...

677
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,868
I wanted to be successful so badly.

678
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:43,040
I wanted to live a life everyone envied.

679
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,049
What should I have done?

680
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:50,520
Since the day I was born, I never felt a mother's love.

681
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,949
What should I have done?

682
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:55,089
Look at Park Nan Young and No Paeng Hee.

683
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:58,060
See how they raised the kids that weren't theirs.

684
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,529
You were completely different from them.

685
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,830
Da Mi and Han Na...

686
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:05,429
were both precious and deserved to be loved.

687
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,830
Why did you let her die?

688
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:10,899
You're a murderer, La Hui.

689
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,369
You murdered your daughter.

690
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:15,068
You don't deserve to resent K.

691
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,109
You're not even human. You're a monster.

692
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,278
You don't deserve to live.

693
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:19,408
Die.

694
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,849
You should die, Geum La Hui.

695
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:21,979
Die, Geum La Hui!

696
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,079
You're not even human.

697
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,379
You're a monster. You're a murderer.

698
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,290
Die. You murdered your daughter.

699
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,440
What will you do now?

700
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,610
Will you go on being a monster?

701
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:49,880
Like K?

702
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,380
Will you obey K's every command...

703
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,810
and live a subhuman life?

704
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:06,259
Fine.

705
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:10,529
I'll die.

706
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:15,299
If my death will end it,

707
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:21,810
I'll die.

708
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,380
My mom.

709
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,020
Let my mom live.

710
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,170
Geum La Hui.

711
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,179
Will it end if you die?

712
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:37,819
K goes on living,

713
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,949
and you'll run away?

714
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,259
Don't you feel bad for Da Mi?

715
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,190
Park Nan Young.

716
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,230
We are her moms.

717
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,699
You...

718
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,130
and me both.

719
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,980
For poor Da Mi,

720
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:06,380
do for me what I can't.

721
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:44,719
(Decoding complete)

722
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,860
Go upstairs.

723
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:04,569
I'm connected.

724
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,469
There must be a hint to the password.

725
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:10,839
LUCA. Show what you have on Lee Hwi So.

726
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:21,989
"Lee Da Mi."

727
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,219
The password is "Lee Da Mi."

728
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,020
"Lee Da Mi?"

729
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:28,060
Lee Da Mi, not Bang Da Mi.

730
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,659
To Hwi So, Da Mi was always his daughter, a Lee.

731
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,270
I'm in. What's the code?

732
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,139
You're right.

733
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,110
I'll kill K first,

734
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:49,210
then pay for my crimes.

735
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:54,250
It's Da Mi's last day alive.

736
00:50:56,759 --> 00:50:58,159
He filmed this?

737
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,489
That monster.

738
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You two...

739
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:08,869
were alive?

740
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,270
Throw him back out.

741
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,569
I'll wire you the money right away.

742
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,750
He will drift far away to sea.

743
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,860
Kang Ki Tak.

744
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Did he make it?

745
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,330
I don't know. The wound was so deep.

746
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,810
I patched him up and sent him to where you asked.

747
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,369
His fate will decide what happens next.

748
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:51,909
Good job.

749
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:54,710
If you send me a photo, I'll wire the money.

750
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,589
This is the last thing I do for you.

751
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,100
Stand watch.

752
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,479
The alarm didn't go off, so who broke in?

753
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,980
The alarm was turned off.

754
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,650
I see suspicious footprints.

755
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:34,989
What rat would dare break into my territory?

756
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,060
They can't get caught.

757
00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:41,630
I must get them to flee.

758
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,269
Let's get out of here.

759
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,339
LUCA, delete access history.

760
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,880
- Get him! - Stop!

761
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,739
Stop!

762
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,610
- Find him! - Got it!

763
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:46,730
Get him!

764
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,029
Move it, you fools!

765
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,369
He's nearby.

766
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:36,909
Find him!

767
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:12,679
Ki Tak, it has everything on LUCA.

768
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,750
With this, I can get through Matthew's updates...

769
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,719
and figure out what LUCA really is.

770
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,489
Someone else was at the vacation home.

771
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,219
They smashed a vase to warn us that K had come.

772
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:30,659
Yes. I noticed too.

773
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,699
Who could it be?

774
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,869
Who helped us?

775
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,909
Help me.

776
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,310
Save me.

777
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,589
I'm dying.

778
00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:00,060
(Hyesan Clinic)

779
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,429
If this is my punishment,

780
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:11,839
I'll accept it.

781
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:15,369
I'll jump into the fiery pit.

782
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,179
But...

783
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,009
could you...

784
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,618
delay that just a little?

785
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,119
(Hyesan Clinic)

786
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,989
Give me one last chance to kill him.

787
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,860
Please.

788
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:37,960
So I can be human for once.

789
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,290
Am I alive?

790
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,460
I administered first aid, but you almost died.

791
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,699
Thank you.

792
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,830
Thank you for giving me a chance.

793
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,009
You need surgery at a general hospital.

794
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:23,980
If you delay it, you might lose your foot.

795
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,339
I'll send you to a friend of mine.

796
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,420
No.

797
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,520
I can't go anywhere else.

798
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,520
No one can know. Do it here.

799
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,588
I don't have the tools or an anesthesiologist.

800
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,060
I don't need anesthesia.

801
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,900
Just...

802
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,230
cut off the foot.

803
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,540
I'll take it as my punishment.

804
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080
Please, doctor.

805
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,750
Help me.

806
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:47,230
Please be my mom just this once.

807
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,659
I must walk like nothing's wrong.

808
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,889
K can't catch on.

809
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,600
You don't deserve to feel pain.

810
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,900
Stand tall, Geum La Hui.

811
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:13,199
Each step you take...

812
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,239
is your punishment.

813
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,080
Ma'am.

814
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,980
Are you okay?

815
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,589
Shall I help you?

816
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,000
You're the first person I met here.

817
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,270
I thought no one else lived here.

818
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
Right.

819
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:51,310
I roasted this. Do you want a sweet potato?

820
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,810
Did I make you wait?

821
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:59,549
Mom steamed a sweet potato.

822
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:02,790
- Ta-da. What's this? - Sweet potato?

823
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,690
Well done.

824
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,960

825
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,960
What a good girl.

826
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,060
Clap if it's tasty.

827
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,569
Give Mom a kiss.

828
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,880
It's really tasty.

829
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,250
Take it.

830
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:31,679
Go away.

These are the books you asked for.

834
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,339
Thanks.

835
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,279

Do Hyuk.

838
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,080
Michell isn't doing well.

839
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,989
We should move fast.

840
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,330
Why can't I reach her?

841
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,929
Did she go somewhere remote in the US or something?

842
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,580
I'm sure I've seen this before.

843
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,179
Come back to Korea this instant.

844
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,749
If not, I'll fly to the US myself.

845
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,888
I've warned you.

(Wednesday, December 13, 2023)

848
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,448
(I knew that Mone was dating the son of Sungchan Group.)

849
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:10,618
(I even knew that she had given birth to a baby...)

850
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:11,619
Back then,

851
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:14,290
if I hadn't ignored Da Mi...

852
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,448
Hey.

853
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,060
Would Da Mi still be alive now?

854
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:19,819
Hey, you thief.

855
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,060
The deity must really exist.

856
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:29,429
I am getting back all the things I did.

857
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,040
I was a coward,

858
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,210
and I'm only now paying the price for my sins.

859
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,040
I miss...

860
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,310

No matter what scary thing happens from now on,

863
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,690
I want to live...

864
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:50,659
like a human being, just once.

865
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:53,790
And I want to be forgiven...

01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,190

The one who should die is alive and well.

870
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:25,960
Because I have no reason to live.

871
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,989
I can't even get revenge.

872
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,889
The movie that I'm making...

873
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,600
is being used as K's propaganda.

874
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:35,699
Listen carefully.

875
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:38,540
You have to keep making the movie. That is...

876
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:40,939

We will take things step by step.

880
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,150
Becoming Lee Hwi So will actually become a nightmare.

881
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:57,119
You have to help me do that.

882
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,159
I need your power.

883
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:15,610
Did you ask to see me?

884
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,480
I ran over the moment I got your call.

885
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,250
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet, has it?

886
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:26,949
By the way,

887
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:29,849
what mission do you need me to do at this time of night?

888
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,259
Hasn't Geum La Hui returned to Korea yet?

889
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,560
It's been 15 more days since she was scheduled to return.

890
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,088
You called a guy out at midnight over such a trivial thing?

891
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:38,560
I get that you treat me like a stray dog, but...

892
01:06:39,759 --> 01:06:41,770
He sure has a knack for raising my blood pressure.

893
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:43,399
Why won't you answer?

894
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,670
Don't you have any news about Geum La Hui?

895
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:46,969
Oh, it's not that.

896
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:49,440
She returned to Korea today. And right now,

897
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:51,509
she's meeting with Ju Ran.

898
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,440
Why didn't you report that to me right away?

899
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,219
You must not have had a good time in the US.

900
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:06,318
Your complexion looks awful.

901
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:07,860
And it looks like you've lost some weight too.

902
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,360
Is it because I'm quite sensitive to the change in water?

903
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:18,469
Hey.

904
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,839
Why was your business trip so long?

905
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:25,679
And I couldn't get in touch with you either.

906
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:30,449
Sorry. There was a lot to learn.

907
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,778
I'm leaving the country again tomorrow.

908
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:34,449
I'm going to look around Europe while I'm at it.

909
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:38,259
I'm thinking about going for about a month.

910
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,060
That's okay, right?

911
01:07:42,029 --> 01:07:45,000
Oh, I just got a call from Director Michell.

912
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:48,100
I hear the shoot will resume soon.

913
01:07:48,929 --> 01:07:50,638
Since Ms. Geum has returned,

914
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,069
things will move smoothly.

915
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,979
Seeing how there were droplets of blood nearby,

916
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,880
I think they stepped on a bear trap while running away.

917
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,779
I'm sure their leg is in a bad state.

918
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,949
Why don't you bring out some whiskey?

919
01:08:13,759 --> 01:08:14,759
Could you get that, please?

920
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,460
I'm a little tired from jet lag.

921
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:19,400
Oh, sure. Why not?

922
01:08:20,459 --> 01:08:21,469
Do you want some more coffee too?

923
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:24,039
Me too.

924
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:28,469
Hey.

925
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,539
She treats me like I'm her maid.

926
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,149
Is she playing make-believe and pretending to be a princess?

927
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,280
I know.

928
01:08:37,919 --> 01:08:39,549
She used to be so eager...

929
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,189
to serve Matthew.

930
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,749
She's a little weird today.

931
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:45,789
The day before you left for your business trip to the US,

932
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:48,230
did you perhaps...

933
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:50,230
come to my vacation home?

934
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:53,329
No.

935
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,168
We were both busy,

936
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:57,740
so we only said goodbye on the phone.

937
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:06,310
I haven't seen...

938
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:08,579
those shoes before.

939
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,449
I bought them in the US.

940
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,679
They were custom-made to fit my feet.

941
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,820
I see.

942
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,589
Then, could I maybe...

943
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,730
take a look at your feet for a moment?

944
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,829
My...

945
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,299
My feet?

946
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:32,169
Yes.

947
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,969
He didn't catch on, did he?

948
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:56,429
I can't stagger.

949
01:09:57,089 --> 01:09:58,400
I can't waver either.

950
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:09,509
Take a look.

951
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:19,980
What are you so suspicious about?

952
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,259
Please.

953
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:33,259
Please.

954
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,209
Here is the whiskey.

955
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
Why?

956
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:48,549
That's enough.

957
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,128
("The Skill of Coding")

958
01:11:42,129 --> 01:11:43,298
("Coding")

959
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,400
("Coding Techniques")

960
01:14:31,339 --> 01:14:35,139
Little cabin in the wood

961
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:39,240
Little girl stood by the window

962
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:43,410
Saw a rabbit hopping by

963
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,079
Knocking at the door

964
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,889
Little rabbit, come on in

965
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,730
Rest comfortably

966
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,469
Ma'am.

967
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,060
Hey, Ki Tak. Come over here.

968
01:16:37,129 --> 01:16:38,129
What is it?

969
01:16:41,169 --> 01:16:42,200
It's a success.

970
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:43,730
Good job.

971
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:45,539
This is the main source code for LUCA.

972
01:16:46,299 --> 01:16:47,940
Introducing AI LUCA.

973
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,468
The developer, Lee Hwi So,

974
01:16:49,469 --> 01:16:52,480
entrusts final authority to system operator, Matthew Lee.

975
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:56,249
Matthew Lee has been approved as the master of LUCA.

976
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:59,579
If the master does not log in within 72 hours,

977
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:02,288
the LUCA's system will infiltrate computer systems nationwide...

978
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,520
and begin attacking.

979
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,089
That sly jerk.

980
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,419
He prepared this for emergency purposes.

981
01:17:07,759 --> 01:17:09,929
If he ends up in danger, he programmed the system...

982
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:12,829
to activate a bug and cause mass chaos.

983
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:17,900
LUCA has become K's armor and shield.

984
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,070
Do Hyuk.

985
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,539
Is there no way to stop LUCA from here?

986
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,240
That's difficult.

987
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:26,610
I have to log into LUCA's motherboard directly.

988
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:31,280
I'm sure there is a way.

989
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:34,650
We just have to take control of LUCA and K first.

990
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,120
Ma'am.

991
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,240
Ma'am.

992
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,280
- Hello. - Hello.

993
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:08,049
- Hello. - Hello.

994
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:10,620
- Hello. - Hello.

995
01:18:12,219 --> 01:18:14,320
Have you heard the news? I'm in charge of the new app.

996
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,159
Yes, it's an app to find missing children, right?

997
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,329
I think it's going to be developed as a policy project with Seoul city.

998
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,770
Making Yang Jin Mo the deputy mayor was all to build up to this.

999
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:26,969
Interesting.

1000
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:29,969
She got a haircut.

1001
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:33,309
You want to shoot an observation documentary...

1002
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:34,310
on Chairman Lee?

1003
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:37,208
Yes. I'm already finished shooting the movie,

1004
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:38,578
so I was thinking of shooting this documentary...

1005
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:40,079
in between working on the movie's post-production.

1006
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:41,748
If we start now,

1007
01:18:41,749 --> 01:18:44,320
we can proceed easily before the premiere of the movie.

1008
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,990
I understand your affection...

1009
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,299
for the death of your sister, Director.

1010
01:18:51,799 --> 01:18:54,669
But is all this really necessary?

1011
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:57,629
K is still on the run.

1012
01:18:58,339 --> 01:19:00,539
I'm scared that people might forget K at this rate.

1013
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,310
You don't want that either, right?

1014
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,879
Although I'm Da Mi's dad,

1015
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,579
I'm also a businessman.

1016
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,419
Right now, I want to focus on running my business.

1017
01:19:16,389 --> 01:19:18,359
Becoming too immersed in personal revenge...

1018
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,690
is an obvious neglect of my duties.

1019
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:23,490
So, are you turning me down?

1020
01:19:27,799 --> 01:19:28,799
No.

1021
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,129
This is worth discussing.

1022
01:19:34,499 --> 01:19:36,509
I agree with Director Michell.

1023
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,110
As Da Mi's mom,

1024
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,879
I hope more people will remember Da Mi.

1025
01:19:47,179 --> 01:19:48,389
You feel that way too.

1026
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:50,249
Right, Mr. Lee Hwi So?

1027
01:19:55,759 --> 01:19:58,359
In return, I want to introduce "Children Home,"

1028
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,530
an app TIKITAKA is developing, in the documentary.

1029
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,968
It's an app that collects people's DNA...

1030
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:04,999
and helps find missing children easily.

1031
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,339
I thought it would be nice if TIKITAKA's public service project...

1032
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,870
became widely known.

1033
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,410
Right.

1034
01:20:15,579 --> 01:20:16,650
Okay.

1035
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,850
You two have won.

1036
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,219
I'll appear in the documentary for Da Mi's sake.

1037
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,020
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,559
If you trust me with this,

1039
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,428
I will work hard to make a good documentary.

1040
01:20:28,429 --> 01:20:29,429
All right.

1041
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:33,160
I'm going to suggest the documentary to Chairman Lee today.

1042
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,969
Don't worry.

1043
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,928
I will make him do it, no matter what,

1044
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:39,969
and catch his true nature on camera.

1045
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:42,209
When Matthew's identity is revealed,

1046
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,079
you will be able to come out into the world too, Do Hyuk.

1047
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:54,689
Once the movie premieres,

1048
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:55,990
it will cause a huge stir.

1049
01:20:58,419 --> 01:20:59,918
The true faces of those who live comfortably...

1050
01:20:59,919 --> 01:21:02,389
despite the sins they've committed will come to light.

1051
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,160
Han Mone.

1052
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,230
You'll be the first one.

1053
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:12,940
I will endure and survive, no matter what...

1054
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,280
even if I am used and beaten down by K...

1055
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,679
until I meet you again, Mom.

1056
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,870
Mom, look at this.

1057
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,120
(Song Ji A)

1058
01:22:40,759 --> 01:22:42,389
Director Michell has begun making the documentary.

1059
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,289
Until the first plan begins,

1060
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,660
please do your best in each of your positions.

1061
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:04,679
Do Hyuk.

1062
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:06,980
I will make sure you can return to the world.

1063
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,249
Let's see this through to the end, Ki Tak.

1064
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:11,490
Until we catch K.

1065
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,828
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

1066
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:52,329
Erica has disappeared.

1067
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:54,900
She must've been kidnapped outside the kindergarten.

1068
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,628
Have you forgotten what kind of woman I was?

1069
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:58,900
I'm a crazy witch who even abandons the child I gave birth to.

1070
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:00,399
In situations like this,

1071
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,639
you're even more merciless than I am.

1072
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,779
The teaser of "Dear D" has finally been released.

1073
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,378
Was it all a lie from the beginning?

1074
01:24:07,379 --> 01:24:09,049
I won't die alone.

1075
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,249
Call me. I'm Hwang Chan Sung.

1076
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,719
Don't pretend to be calm.

1077
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:14,719
Today will be your downfall.

1078
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:16,850
Bye, Mone, my daughter.
