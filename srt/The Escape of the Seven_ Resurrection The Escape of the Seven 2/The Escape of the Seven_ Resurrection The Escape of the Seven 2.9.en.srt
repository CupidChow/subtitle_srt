00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,929
Are you with Da Mi now?

7
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,099

It's now your turn to choose.

10
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,080
Like Geum La Hui did,

11
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,050
will you crush your crimes and bloom,

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,250
or...

13
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:25,390
will you crush the flowers...

14
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,390
and commit more crimes?

15
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,240
- Yang Jin Mo! - Yang Jin Mo!

Look forward to it!

I'll put your livelihoods first.

25
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,830
Trust in me, Yang Jin Mo.

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,728
A handsome Seoul!

28
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,229
Look forward to it!

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,599
Number seven, Yang Jin Mo.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,699
Handsome Seoul.

31
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,638
- I will work hard... - A handsome man...

32
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,709
- for the people! - to make Seoul handsome.

33
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,710
- Hello. - Please vote.

- Enjoy the food. - Enjoy the food.

45
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:11,489
Goodness.

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840

Yang Jin Mo, 37.7 percent.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,299
In all polls, Choi Mi Nam is ahead.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,000
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

58
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,870
- Rock... - Rock...

59
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,139
Hey. Phillip.

60
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,869
Are you okay?

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,470
Who pushed my brother?

62
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,910
It was you, wasn't it?

63
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,680
Yes, it was. So what?

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,410
How could you?

65
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,579
Do you want to get in trouble with my dad?

66
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,180
Your dad is a fake.

67
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,090
That's what my mom said.

68
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,489
Do you know he only finished middle school?

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Darn you!

70
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,660
Don't talk like that about my dad!

71
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,059
That's mean!

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,200
My dad is smart!

73
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,659
My brother wants an apology.

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,869
I won't apologize.

75
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:25,869
I wasn't lying.

76
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,200
You'll get kicked out soon.

77
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,510
My mom's in charge of an online mom forum.

78
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,878
The head of a forum for moms is more powerful than anyone.

79
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,580
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,419
- My arm. - What happened?

81
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,019
What's wrong?

82
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,090
Why are you crying, baby?

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,890
My gosh.

84
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,059
Are you trying to prove you weren't taught properly?

85
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,600
Do you want me to bite you too?

86
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,668
Erica, did you really do this?

87
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:58,729
But...

88
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,100
he pushed Phillip to the ground...

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,770
and said he'd get us kicked out of the apartment.

90
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm very sorry.

91
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,719
So that it never happens again,

92
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,379
I'll teach my children some manners.

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,558
(Change Seoul, Choi Mi Nam)

94
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,628

(To a better world, Yang Jin Mo)

97
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,029
- Candidate seven, - Candidate seven,

98
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,369
- Yang Jin Mo. - Yang Jin Mo.

99
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,069
- Candidate one, - Candidate one,

100
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,369
- Choi Mi Nam. - Choi Mi Nam.

101
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,070
An orphan with a middle-school diploma.

102
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,979
He worked at a bar, and his marriage...

103
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,979
is contractual. It's an utter mess.

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,378
He discriminates between jobs, belittles those with less education,

105
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,679
and spreads fake news.

106
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,249
Who am I talking about?

107
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,789
My approval rating is way above yours.

108
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,460
Oh, dear. The election is just three days away, Mr. Yang.

109
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,729
We have three long days to campaign!

110
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,899
- Yes! - Yes!

111
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,298
Unless you want the country to go to ruins,

112
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:06,938
who would vote for someone with so many scandals as mayor?

113
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,399
Am I right, people?

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,769
- Yes! - Yes!

115
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,609
How could a teacher get into a contractual marriage?

116
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,210
How embarrassing.

117
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,350
Yes, it's true. Our marriage was contractual.

118
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,649
But compared to a couple that cheats and threatens to take their lives...

119
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,979
to get back at one another,

120
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,320
I'd say we're way happier.

121
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,389
What's wrong with you?

122
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,820
How dare you make that up?

123
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,858
What's the point in an arranged marriage...

124
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,600
based on background...

125
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,558
if the marriage is going downhill?

126
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,099
It's the kids that suffer.

127
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,470
I wasn't going to mention the kids.

128
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,869
I heard your daughter's a kindergarten bully.

129
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,738
I read about her on the forum.

130
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,409
Do a better job teaching her manners.

131
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,410
That's right!

132
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,079
What does she see at home...

133
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,079
that she's already a bully out in public?

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
- Right! - Yes!

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,059
- Were you followed? - Don't worry.

136
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,030
Hwang Chan Sung left to meet K.

137
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,770
Officially, I'm getting a massage.

138
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,140
This is Hwang Chan Sung's movements in the last week.

139
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,910
He goes to work and comes home. It's surprisingly simple.

140
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,710
What if he sent my mom abroad already?

141
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:27,220
Neither he nor his men went abroad in the last few months.

142
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,479
He could've put her on a boat.

143
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
No.

144
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,059
What if he already killed her?

145
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,059
Don't be so negative.

146
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,929
It's possible she is much closer than we think.

147
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,970
Can't we search his home and company?

148
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,439
This won't do. I'll move into Hwang Chan Sung's.

149
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:57,080
It's too dangerous to be with him.

150
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,549
Nothing's more important than finding my mom.

151
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,379
Is it because you didn't get any sun?

152
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,119
You got even paler.

153
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,920
Quit the nonsense.

154
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,359
Tell me why you're here.

155
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,430
Why won't you give me access to LUCA?

156
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,529
Upsetting me won't do you any good, Jun Seok.

157
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,379
LUCA's access code.

158
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,479
You hacked into the secret chat.

159
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,019
You did something incredible.

160
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,119
But then,

161
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,450
Lee Hwi So did it, not you.

162
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,560
He's the real genius.

163
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,090
Which is why...

164
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,200
the copyright must be clear.

165
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,869
- LUCA. - Yes, sir.

166
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,840
I approve Hwang Chan Sung's access.

167
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,268
However,

168
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,139
he needs my clear permission.

169
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,940
Hey!

170
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,710
That's not what we agreed.

171
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,149
Do you have a death wish?

172
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,220
If I die,

173
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,920
you'll have no one to clear your access to LUCA.

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,060
We should...

175
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,529
find a way to live together.

176
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,899
As long as our enemies live,

177
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,399
we can't live in comfort.

178
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,409
Min Do Hyuk?

179
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,050
How about I make an offer?

180
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,090
If I swear to kill Do Hyuk for you,

181
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,060
can TIKITAKA and Save...

182
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,090
become one?

183
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Are you...

184
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,499
suggesting a merger?

185
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,970
- Do Hyuk. - I'm listening, Kyung Soo.

186
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,609
Ki Tak disappeared.

187
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,180
Again?

188
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,779
Okay.

189
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,979
Locate Kang Ki Tak.

190
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,529
I'm sorry I hated you all of my life, Ki Tak.

191
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Also,

192
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm sorry I hated your daughter too.

193
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,210
(Bang Da Mi)

194
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Ki Tak.

195
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,479
La Hui's dead because of him.

196
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,840
- Let go of me. - Ki Tak.

197
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:25,449
- Ki Tak. - La Hui is dead.

198
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,810
- Ki Tak. - Let me go!

199
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,879
Darn you.

200
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,519
What do you know?

201
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,790
Ki Tak. Please don't do this.

202
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,460
Our enemy...

203
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,720
is K!

204
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,509
Darn it.

205
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,350
What the heck...

206
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,529
I'm sorry, and thank you...

207
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,100
for stopping me from messing up.

208
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,840
La Hui wouldn't want you do to this either.

209
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,210
Right.

210
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,810
There's still a lot to do.

211
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:37,050
Wasn't that on Da Mi's tree?

212
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,619
Have I told you...

213
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,659
that I love the sea?

214
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,389
Long ago,

215
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,259
when I saw you swim in the winter sea,

216
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,559
I thought you were insane.

217
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
I remember that.

218
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,369
Is that the fish you like?

219
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,238
I thought Geum La Hui had put it there for Da Mi,

220
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,340
but that wasn't it.

221
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,979
She put it there for you.

222
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:05,210
Once we're done,

223
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,050
I'll travel the seas.

224
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,619
I want you to see it too.

225
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,389
I'll go anywhere with you.

226
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,389
As long as you pay.

227
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,330
I'm serious.

228
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,029
Business class only.

229
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,228
I've always liked this about you.

230
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,229
I love you.

231
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,330
Delivery!

232
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:27,739
Did you tell him?

233
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,899
Ki Tak.

234
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,869
Do you know how worried I was?

235
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,440
How are you so strong?

236
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,909
As a mom, Geum La Hui made a grand exit.

237
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,749
I'd like to join in her memory.

238
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,920
We decided to trust in you, Do Hyuk.

239
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,489
You know "we" includes me, right?

240
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,590
Don't tell the others, though.

241
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,690
Attention.

242
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,830
We have some supporters.

243
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,259
Cha Ju Ran and Nam Chul Woo.

244
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,069
To take on Save and TIKITAKA,

245
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,498
we need more power.

246
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,769
I intend to use Sungchan Group.

247
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,609
Hey. It's a super moon.

248
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Gosh.

249
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Kyung Soo.

250
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,649
Let's find your mom, okay?

251
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,649
And the name of your brother who died as Sim Jun Seok.

252
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,790
Thanks, La Hui.

253
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,529
For telling the truth at last.

254
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,159
I swear on that moon.

255
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,999
K killed our daughter,

256
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,229
and I will kill him.

257
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,479
Goodness.

258
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,710
We have an early morning meeting tomorrow.

259
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,149
Shower and go to bed.

260
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,720
(Non-partisan, Yang Jin Mo)

261
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,359
Let me help. It will halve the time.

262
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,930
(Non-partisan, Number 7, Yang Jin Mo, Candidate for Seoul Mayor)

263
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,080
Your stomach will ache.

264
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,519
I'll make you a snack.

265
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,720
Do you want to join me?

266
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
You had a long day as well.

267
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,229
Join you?

268
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,840
Sounds good.

269
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,379
It's nice and cold.

270
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,289
You can have just one can and no more.

271
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,560
Your face will puff up and your voice will go hoarse.

272
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,330
Are you worrying about me right now?

273
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:08,859
You're acting like a real wife.

274
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,429
I'm being sincere.

275
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,980
If you become mayor,

276
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,649
it will be good for my kids too.

277
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,980
I should go to bed.

278
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,388
You should stop drinking too.

279
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,389
Oh, dear.

280
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,090
Sorry. My bad.

281
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,240
Erica. It's bad.

282
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,949
Mom and Dad are fighting again.

283
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,050
We can't let people find out.

284
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,250
Shall I play the recorder?

285
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:38,649
Don't be stupid.

286
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:42,419
You can't disrupt Mom and Dad having a good time.

287
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,490
Get him.

288
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,859
Okay.

289
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,359
What? Why are you grabbing me?

290
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,649
Erica, Phillip, Han Na, let's eat.

291
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,330
Go Phillip.

292
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,399
If you say anything stupid to Mom about last night or something,

293
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:26,969
you get this, okay?

294
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,240
Okay. I can keep a secret.

295
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,939
Mommy, good morning.

296
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,379
Did you sleep well?

297
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,879
Did you?

298
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:42,419
Mom. Your face is glowing.

299
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,290
Are you happy that Dad loved you last night?

300
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,219
- Hey. - Hey.

301
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:52,889
It's because...

302
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,629
I use this.

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Han Na.

304
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,609
You film today, don't you?

305
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,079
I'll come with you later.

306
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Me too.

307
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:11,909
Can I go too?

308
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,280
I don't think so, Erica.

309
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,388
The mom of the kid you hit on the playground...

310
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,850
posted something bad about you in the forum.

311
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,820
Does that mean Dad won't become mayor?

312
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,030
Phillip.

313
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,458
Erica, so...

314
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,030
Oh, I forgot.

315
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,570
My English debate is coming up.

316
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,999
I need to practice.

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,639
I have to hurry.

318
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,138
Wait. Erica.

319
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,639
What about breakfast?

320
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,830
Erica.

321
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,060
Can I tell you a secret?

322
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,070
My dead mom.

323
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:08,469
She's not my real mom.

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So what?

325
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,270
I don't feel sorry for you at all.

326
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:14,540
My dad...

327
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:16,209
only likes you.

328
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,010
My real parents.

329
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:22,919
They both abandoned me.

330
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,050
So my mom looked after me instead.

331
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,760
They abandoned you? Why?

332
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,459
A mom...

333
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,560
abandoned a child?

334
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,129
That's why...

335
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:38,969
I am...

336
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,939
more jealous of you and Phillip than anyone in the world.

337
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:46,469
Your mom...

338
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,909
actually loves you.

339
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,550
Are your real mom and dad...

340
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,750
still alive?

341
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Yes.

342
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,090
But...

343
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,459
I guess they want me dead.

344
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:05,459
That's scary.

345
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,659
Anyone who's near me...

346
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,500
becomes unhappy.

347
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,899
Hey. That's stupid.

348
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,139
You're too young to believe in superstitions.

349
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:22,409
Stop crying.

350
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,949
You have a shoot today.

351
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,219
Your face is a mess.

352
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,020
You suddenly look ugly.

353
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,770
You look much better.

354
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,669
You still have a long way to go to look as pretty as me, though.

355
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:55,240
Thank you.

356
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,730
As soon as I saw it, I knew it was for you.

357
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:18,770
Wear it on your first day of work.

358
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,439
Your new start at Sungchan Group.

359
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,369
Good luck.

360
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,740
Mom would've been proud to see this.

361
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,949
She wished her son would wear a suit to work.

362
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,179
Thanks, Ki Tak.

363
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,648
(Welcome, Vice-Chairman!)

364
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,250
(Vice-Chairman Kang, welcome to Sungchan Group.)

365
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,919
(Vice-Chairman Kang, welcome to Sungchan Group.)

366
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,089
Try to act more dignified.

367
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,888
How about trying not to throw yourself at him?

368
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,730
Don't you worry.

369
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,730
I'm Sim Mi Young.

370
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,030
I'm not an easy catch.

371
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:34,070
Ki Tak!

372
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,080
I missed you so much.

373
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,179
Do you know how much I waited for this day?

374
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,850
The board of executives just voted to accept you.

375
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:47,919
Vice-Chairman Kang Ki Tak.

376
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:52,859
You...

377
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,760
When did you come in?

378
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,730
I have been with him since he left home.

379
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,929
Were you?

380
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,040
I'm the type that only has eyes for one man.

381
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,010
Let's go.

382
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:14,310
I'm Chief Secretary Cho Jong Rak.

383
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,550
Hello.

384
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,750
Chairman Sim Yong...

385
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:20,490
should've seen this day.

386
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,530
Do Hyuk.

387
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,730
Goodbye.

388
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
No!

389
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,129
Get out of here, Do Hyuk.

390
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,379
I joined Sungchan Group at last.

391
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,280
I won't run away anymore.

392
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:49,980
However painful it becomes.

393
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,208
I'll prepare breakfast today, Ms. Han.

394
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,209
You can go.

395
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,979
I'm sure Chan Sung will like it too.

396
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
You can rest.

397
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,489
If Mom's alive,

398
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,760
there should be some kind of hint here.

399
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,969
I must find it. There must be something.

400
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,679
You're up.

401
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,790
What are you doing here?

402
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,389
You said you wanted tteokbokki.

403
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,260
I'll make you some to enjoy before work.

404
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,350
Try it.

405
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,659
It's nice and spicy.

406
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:14,459
It's the best tteokbokki I had.

407
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:17,859
You should have some too.

408
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,800
No, thanks.

409
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,800
I don't feel like it.

410
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:24,840
Why not? Is something wrong?

411
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:29,840
My mom...

412
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,750
used to make me tteokbokki.

413
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,790
I barely remember her face now.

414
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:43,219
I was such a horrible daughter...

415
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,060
that she wouldn't even appear in my dreams.

416
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,929
Mone.

417
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,240
Sorry. I shouldn't bother you before work.

418
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,139
He'll do anything I want.

419
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,080
I must get to him.

420
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,010
Then I can find Mom.

421
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:11,850
You know...

422
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,159
you're the only person I can talk about this to.

423
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I know that.

424
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:21,730
I'll make it up to you.

425
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,159
So you never have to cry.

426
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,330
I have to go now.

427
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,429
Eat it all before going to work.

428
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,669
Good luck with the shoot.

429
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,480
Don't look at me like that.

430
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,250
You know I'm not a bad person.

431
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,919
I'm your future son-in-law.

432
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:58,459
Mother. Eat.

433
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,959
Mone's mother makes you my mother too.

434
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,270
Consider this your place and make it your home.

435
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,340
Can I borrow your phone?

436
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Oh.

437
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:17,939
You want to make a call? To whom?

438
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,750
You can't call Mone yet.

439
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,480
I'll let you see her when the time's right.

440
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,990
Min Do Hyuk.

441
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,060
Will you write it down?

442
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,469
Min Do Hyuk.

443
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:45,139
Call him for me.

444
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:48,980
What for?

445
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:59,290
He'll be very worried that I disappeared.

446
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,119
Tell him not to worry,

447
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,590
that I'd like him to look after Mone...

448
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,290
and Han Na for me.

449
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,469
I can't do that for you.

450
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,169
I don't like Do Hyuk that much.

451
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:22,679
Stop talking...

452
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,649
and eat.

453
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,330
He's a nice person.

454
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,368
He saved Han Na...

455
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,939
and reunited me with Mone. I'm so grateful to him.

456
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Enough.

457
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,389
I told you to stop talking about him.

458
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,129
I'm here.

459
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,399
He's a very dangerous person.

460
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:21,030
Why did you meet with Do Hyuk?

461
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,570
Were you tailing me?

462
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,010
No! Don't hit her!

463
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:06,709
Why did you hit my daughter? What did she do to you?

464
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,159
I'm about to lose my mind because of Min Do Hyuk,

465
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,690
so I don't need you to make things worse.

466
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,730
Don't touch my daughter.

467
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,500
I don't care what you do to me.

468
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:29,940
You can hit me instead.

469
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
I see.

470
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,949
I should hit you instead?

471
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,779
That's a great idea.

472
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,290
You're on Do Hyuk's side too, aren't you?

473
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,989
You said he was a nice person.

474
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,929
That you're grateful toward him.

475
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:25,460
I beg of you. Don't do anything to my daughter.

476
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,699
Please don't do anything.

477
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,509
As long as Mone keeps her word.

478
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,819
But...

479
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,549
there's something I need you to do.

480
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Goodness.

481
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,100
Hello, reporters.

482
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,170
Hello.

483
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:09,369
- Can we talk? - Sure.

484
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:11,968
Are you here to look after Han Na yourself?

485
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,739
Yes, of course. The election is important,

486
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,310
but Han Na is very important to me too.

487
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,679
She has a painful past,

488
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:23,080
and I want to provide her with a caring home.

489
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,779
That's how I feel.

490
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,020
Does that mean Han Na could become part of your family for good?

491
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,920
For example, would you adopt her?

492
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Adopt her?

493
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,440
I haven't considered that yet.

494
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,139
But don't mention that in the article.

495
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,080
I don't want to hurt her unnecessarily.

496
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,988
(Waiting Room, Han Mone)

497
00:36:58,989 --> 00:36:59,989
Ms. Han.

498
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,060
Mr. Hwang sent you this.

499
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,389
What is it?

500
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,799
A lunchbox he worked very hard to get.

501
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,650
This is my reply to your morning surprise.

502
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,020
I hope the food is to your taste.

503
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,230
Mom.

504
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,900
Mom. It's you, isn't it?

505
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,839
You made this.

506
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,449
Mom...

507
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,489
Mom...

508
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,089
Mom...

509
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,739
Han Na.

510
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,810
Do you like living with us?

511
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,409
What if...

512
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,319
I were to ask you to be my daughter?

513
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,690
Would you not like it?

514
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:20,960
Sorry.

515
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,159
I shouldn't have said that.

516
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,360
You haven't forgotten your mom yet.

517
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:28,130
Forget what I just said, okay?

518
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,069
Han Na.

519
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,369
Can I be your daughter?

520
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,279
Didn't you dislike me?

521
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,529
Your fake dad can see you off.

522
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,830
- I must hold back. - It must be nice to act.

523
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:04,600
- I'll hold back, for Dad. - Look at her.

524
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,238
Why won't you react?

525
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,909
Is it because there are others watching?

526
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,679
Go home while I'm being nice about it.

527
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,549
Before I bite you again.

528
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,279
I'm not scared of you.

529
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,849
If you bite me again,

530
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,949
my mom said she'd bring her forum friends...

531
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,219
and make sure your dad doesn't get elected.

532
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,818
If you're so confident,

533
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,360
come and bite me. Come on.

534
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,860
How dare you? You can't ignore me!

535
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,770
S Talk 4.0?

536
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,009
Unless we lead the mass media and have more information,

537
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,779
we can't beat Matthew.

538
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,150
The new S Talk 4.0...

539
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,020
will become a powerful weapon.

540
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,089
It so happens...

541
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:55,960
that many people are deleting their TIKITAKA chatting app.

542
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,929
It's the perfect time to build up S Talk's membership.

543
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,889
You genius.

544
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,500
You're bringing Sungchan Group back to life.

545
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:05,929
Just name it.

546
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,969
I'll make you anything but chairman.

547
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,839
I'm happy enough being a software engineer.

548
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,520
Okay, got it.

549
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,719
Let him in.

550
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,459
Is someone here?

551
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,489
The person you wished to meet but couldn't.

552
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:36,259
I'm a woman with many connections.

553
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,679
Welcome, Mr. Jang. Ex-mayor of Seoul.

554
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
It's a pleasure to meet you.

555
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,190
Min Do Hyuk?

556
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,839
Matthew Lee isn't Lee Hwi So?

557
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:20,310
Then I can tell you even less.

558
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,339
This could put my whole family in danger.

559
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
Let's say...

560
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:27,610
this meeting never happened.

561
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,949
We won't force you to make a statement.

562
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,949
We just want to know one thing.

563
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:35,020
Why Matthew wants Yang Jin Mo...

564
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,190
to become the next mayor.

565
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,819
I don't know why.

566
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,089
And I don't want to know why.

567
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,799
Do you want there to be more victims like you?

568
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,069
As Matthew said,

569
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,039
did you really become mayor for your own gain?

570
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,540
Do you believe that punk?

571
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,810
I was wronged!

572
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,179
A man who remains a coward...

573
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,650
has no right to complain.

574
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,130
Gagok District.

575
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,900
He wanted to resume...

576
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,730
the Gagok District development plan.

577
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,869
Why is Gagok District so important?

578
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,839
He wants to create another nation...

579
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,110
that not even the president can control.

580
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,610
A city where he can control...

581
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,850
all the information including the nation's top secrets.

582
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,119
If that becomes a national project,

583
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,319
he can get his hands on an incredible power source for free.

584
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,210
As we thought, Save announced its merger with TIKITAKA.

585
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:09,379
Everyone is wondering who you'll support...

586
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,719
in the upcoming by-election.

587
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:13,218
Could you give us a hint?

588
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:16,790
I'd say that's a very dangerous question to ask.

589
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,589
Here at Save, we stay neutral. We don't...

590
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:22,699
support anyone.

591
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,600
I invited you both today...

592
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,699
to help you with your campaign.

593
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,109
If things keep going this way,

594
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,610
you won't become mayor, Mr. Yang.

595
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,610
Numbers don't lie.

596
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,150
Matthew's influence alone isn't enough.

597
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:46,850
Do you know of a way to turn the tables?

598
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,759
Have you heard of the subliminal effect?

599
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,489
I have. It works on the subconscious.

600
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,730
That's right.

601
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,029
We'll plant the idea in the subconscious of everyone...

602
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,739
who logs onto Save that Jin Mo is the ideal mayoral candidate.

603
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:05,909
Algorithms are actually quite formidable.

604
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,610
The election is right around the corner.

605
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,409
Is there enough time?

606
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,109
How much time do you think...

607
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,380
the average person spends on their phone daily?

608
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,259
We'll move aggressively and overwhelm the users.

609
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,920
I'll be honest.

610
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,460
I don't see why you'd do this.

611
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,330
What do you want?

612
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
I'll tell you...

613
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:34,069
once you win the election.

614
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:41,009
What do you say?

615
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,350
Should we work together?

616
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,080
What...

617
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,580
do you need us to do?

618
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,920
There's a computer in the basement of K's home.

619
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,460
Attach this to it.

620
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,460
Inside this...

621
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:04,500
is software that will cancel out Save's security program.

622
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,900
K's home?

623
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,569
I can't do it.

624
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,299
I said I'd side with you, not that I'd give you my life.

625
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,678
If La Hui did it, why can't I?

626
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:19,880
Honey. Don't do anything that means putting your life on the line.

627
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,210
You coward.

628
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,349
Back out if you're too scared.

629
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,580
I'll do this on my own.

630
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,750
I can't guarantee the program I made will work.

631
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,618
If something goes wrong...

632
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,130
You say too much.

633
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:35,659
I said I'd do it.

634
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:37,429
No.

635
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,900
I'll do it.

636
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:46,440
I won't let you do something so dangerous.

637
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:49,310
Matthew!

638
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:51,679
Matthew!

639
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:53,350
Ju Ran.

640
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,479
- Matthew! - Stop it.

641
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,879
What's wrong with you?

642
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,779
Don't stop me tonight.

643
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,250
Matthew! Hey!

644
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,118
Jun Seok!

645
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,130
Cha Ju Ran!

646
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:07,889
What do you think you're doing?

647
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,600
Oh, dear.

648
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,799
Chairman.

649
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:17,670
News of the merger must've upset her...

650
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,238
and made her drink.

651
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,040
Please don't kill her.

652
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,810
- How about you do some explaining? - No!

653
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,650
Why would you merge with Save?

654
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,980
I may have been your puppet,

655
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,218
but how could you treat me like this?

656
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,618
- Ju Ran. - Do you know...

657
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,158
how humiliated I felt?

658
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:38,818
I heard about it from the news too.

659
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:41,230
That's a lie. Do you take me for a fool?

660
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,860
You sided with Hwang Chan Sung...

661
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,069
so you could ditch us all!

662
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:54,040
Chairman Lee. Please don't abandon me.

663
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,009
Is Cha Ju Ran the medical doctor not good enough for you?

664
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,080
Chairman.

665
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,118
I feel a splash of diarrhoea coming on.

666
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,790
You two are such a mess. The toilet's that way.

667
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,420
Give me just five minutes. This way?

668
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,290
Don't look away.

669
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,360
Look at me. Focus.

670
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,029
A scorned woman...

671
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,769
could do anything.

672
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,770
What?

673
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:30,779
I'm taking over this place tonight!

674
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,909
Darn it.

675
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,679
How about I smash this?

676
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,548
Hey, this too...

677
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,549
No!

678
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:43,259
- Put that down. - Chairman.

679
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:45,588
Do you like this or me?

680
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,459
- Put it down. - Chairman.

681
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,460
Put it down.

682
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,630
Chairman.

683
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,229
- Chairman. I'll... - Put it down.

684
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,230
Put it down!

685
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:56,298
Am I not good enough, sir?

686
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:58,969
- Catch me if you can. - Are you insane?

687
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:01,909
I'm ready.

688
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,080
Do you see my face?

689
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,779
Grab the front leg of the silver horse in front of you,

690
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,210
and push it forward.

691
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,219
Okay. Where is it?

692
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,080
The horse.

693
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:15,049
This one?

694
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:16,690
I push it?

695
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,489
It's moving.

696
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,469
It's opening.

697
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:30,440
What did the psycho build in that house?

698
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,298
This is so much fun!

699
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:34,310
Get off the bed!

700
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,779
Chairman, I like...

701
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:46,790
Let's see.

702
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:50,060
It's not here.

703
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,989
I found the USB port.

704
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:55,929
You have exactly three minutes to stop LUCA.

705
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,259
Any longer than that...

706
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,029
and Matthew will be alerted.

707
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,900
- Are you ready? - Yes.

708
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,239
One,

709
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:05,839
two,

710
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:07,409
three.

711
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,580
Yes.

712
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,719
Shoot.

713
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:24,759
What now? It failed.

714
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,730
Open the second program.

715
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,029
Okay.

716
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,239
It failed again.

717
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,969
I shouldn't have trusted you.

718
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,610
A minute and 27 seconds to go.

719
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,380
Stop it!

720
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,349
- What are you doing now? - This is pretty too.

721
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,189
- Open the door! - Chairman.

722
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,949
What's wrong with you? Let me in!

723
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:57,790
Are you insane?

724
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,960
What's taking so long? Hurry up, Chul Woo.

725
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,429
Please...

726
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Yes!

727
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,868
It worked!

728
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,239
You are my brother's son!

729
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,940
I'm heading out.

730
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,210
Wait.

731
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,380
What now?

732
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,579
Get info on Gagok District.

733
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,350
There's no time for that. We'll get caught.

734
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
He has 30 seconds.

735
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:28,549
It must be done.

736
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,719
Get it.

737
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,329
- Hey. - What, sir?

738
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,659
You've lost your mind.

739
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,400
No. Sir!

740
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,230
Why you...

741
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Nam Chul Woo.

742
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,179
No.

743
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,279
I got you, Chairman Lee.

744
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:04,388
Nam Chul Woo. Why aren't you back yet?

745
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,889
Let go of me!

746
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:17,739
Darling.

747
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:19,069
Oh, gosh.

748
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,069
What's the matter with me?

749
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:24,739
Sorry.

750
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,009
I almost died pooping.

751
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,080
I must have haemorrhoids.

752
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,819
Who cares if you do?

753
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:32,850
I love them too, darling.

754
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:40,889
What a couple of cockroaches.

755
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,589
Erica. Were you hurt?

756
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,230
Shall I call Ms. Go?

757
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
No, don't.

758
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,199
I wasn't hurt.

759
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:22,730
Then why are you sweating so much?

760
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:27,409
You're bleeding.

761
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,480
It hurts.

762
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,179
Erica. What happened?

763
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,380
Who did this?

764
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,319
It's nothing.

765
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,259
How is it nothing when it's so deep?

766
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,529
Who did this? Tell me.

767
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,929
The moron whose mom owns a forum.

768
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,799
I wanted to beat him up.

769
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,439
But he said his mom would call the other moms.

770
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,600
So I held back.

771
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,839
Don't tell Dad, though.

772
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:05,880
He'll only get upset.

773
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:08,250
You held back...

774
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:10,049
because of your dad?

775
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,290
In case it hurt his chances?

776
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,420
Yes. Because I like Dad.

777
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,330
Erica.

778
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,199
I had no idea you were suffering.

779
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,230
I'm sorry.

780
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Mom is so sorry.

781
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,009
I can't breathe, Mom. Let go.

782
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:54,960
Go and sleep in the room.

783
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:56,529
I'm comfortable here.

784
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,330
Have I made some kind of mistake?

785
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,139
No, I'm the one who has made a mistake.

786
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,309
Consider what happened last night like it never happened.

787
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,310
We are...

788
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,279
just a pretend couple.

789
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,179
That will never happen again.

790
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:21,989
Right.

791
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,719
Goodnight.

792
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,279
Get your act together, Yang Jin Mo.

793
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,920
Does a jerk like you even deserve to have a family?

794
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,690
After you killed Paeng Hee, who are you trying to sacrifice now?

795
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,360
A family is just a luxury for you.

796
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:09,130
The boxed meal was warm.

797
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,270
Min Do Hyuk is right.

798
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:15,239

Hey, Chan Sung.

801
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,389
I was just about to call you.

802
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,190
The boxed meal you sent me earlier was so delicious.

803
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,900
Where did you buy it?

804
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,759
I know a lady with great cooking skills.

805
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:46,270
I'll send your favourite dishes often from now on.

806
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,310
You can't fall ill before the wedding.

807
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:55,009

The kids just went to kindergarten.

918

01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,210
I have something to say.

924
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:37,779
What if...

925
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,219
we officially adopt Han Na?

926
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,389
Han Na will be starting school soon too.

927
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,429
Let's raise her as our own child.

928
01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:51,299
I think...

929
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,069
I could really become a good mom.

930
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,600
Of course, I'll have to try even harder.

931
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,670
You don't have to try hard.

932
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:04,779
Pardon?

933
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,509
Do you think you have the right to become Han Na's mom?

934
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,779
What is it that you know how to do?

935
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:13,419
Other than lying, defrauding, and killing people,

936
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,819
what is it that you're good at?

937
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,219
How could you say such a thing...

938
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,560
We're just a fake couple that Matthew put together.

939
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,028
Since the election is over, our relationship is over too.

940
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:24,299
Let me make this clear,

941
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,630
but I've never once considered you to be Han Na's mom.

942
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,299
So, don't even think to tarnish that position...

943
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,270
and quietly file for divorce.

944
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,040
Honey.

945
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,739
Can't you reconsider for the sake of the children?

946
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:42,150
Erica needs a dad.

947
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,719
She was so worried she might cause you harm...

948
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,489
that she endured the pain of a bruise on her arm all night long.

949
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,750
Because she likes you.

950
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,020
Because she likes her dad so much!

951
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,529
Look at this.

952
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,600
It's a cake the kids made themselves.

953
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:08,009
It has nothing to do with me.

954
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:11,080
Did you forget that I almost lost the election because of Erica?

955
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,339
If the kid is sick, take her to the hospital.

956
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,699
That jerk.

957
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,739
You, Erica, and Phillip will all be in danger if you stay by my side.

958
01:05:43,779 --> 01:05:46,679
Even if things go wrong, I must die alone.

959
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:51,549
Mr. Gu.

960
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,919
Whether it's in Australia or Europe, find a boarding school...

961
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,449
for a six-year-old child to go to. As soon as possible.

962
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:17,509
You will severely regret...

963
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,350
what you said today.

964
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,080
You kept ignoring my calls.

965
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,020
So, what brings you here at this time of night...

966
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,520
looking like that?

967
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:02,520
Don't you think...

968
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,989
it'd be the same reason...

969
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:08,230
why you were so desperate to see me?

970
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,029
What could that mean?

971
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,770
Yang Jin Mo has joined hands with Hwang Chan Sung.

972
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:20,069
He has already betrayed you.

973
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,139
He will no longer move...

974
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:27,080
the way you want him to.

975
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:32,020
Why are you...

976
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:33,949
telling me that?

977
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,690
I want to...

978
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:43,389
see Yang Jin Mo fall miserably.

979
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,069
So he can never make a comeback,

980
01:07:49,929 --> 01:07:51,040
crush him...

981
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,440
again and again.

982
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,790
Han Mone sent me an email.

983
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:15,929
It's Hwang Chan Sung's schedule.

984
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,459
He must've taken a route he doesn't usually take...

985
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,030
in order to hide Ms. Yoon Ji Sook.

986
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,328
There's nothing like that.

987
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:23,940
He's just staying at home more and more.

988
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:25,870
His call records...

989
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,310
don't show anything special every day.

990
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:30,070
Is my sister really going to marry that psychopath?

991
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,280
There are only two weeks left until the wedding.

992
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:39,650
(2 weeks later)

993
01:09:19,419 --> 01:09:21,789
Min Do Hyuk, I'm getting married.

994
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,100
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand.

995
01:09:29,429 --> 01:09:30,740
I didn't have the courage to tell you.

996
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,539
In case I lose my nerve...

997
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:36,509
if you tell me I can't go through with it.

998
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,179
In case that makes me not want to marry.

999
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,619
I'll only think of my mom now.

1000
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,078
There's nothing more dangerous than finding my mom.

1001
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:48,048
Ms. Geum La Hui saved me.

1002
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:49,120
Even if it's for her, I must...

1003
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,990
But why does my heart ache so much?

1004
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:57,530
I know I'm being shameless,

1005
01:09:58,259 --> 01:09:59,259
but I think...

1006
01:10:00,259 --> 01:10:02,530
I... You...

1007
01:10:33,759 --> 01:10:37,370
I've prepared the best present for you today.

1008
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,499
You will probably be surprised.

1009
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:43,139
Fine, let's see this through.

1010
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:46,440
I'll willingly go into the fiery pit that you've created.

1011
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,049
Han Na.

1012
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:53,079
Where's Han Na?

1013
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,259
Oh, Erica. Han Na...

1014
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,360
Where is Han Na?

1015
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:03,329
Well...

1016
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:04,959
She's...

1017
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:11,799
Where is Han Na?

1018
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:15,069
You should change first. We have to go to Mone's wedding.

1019
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,708
Mr. Hwang invited us.

1020
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:18,139
I asked you where Han Na was.

1021
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:19,678
She's leaving the country today.

1022
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,179
Have you packed her stuff?

1023
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:23,509
Han Na...

1024
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:25,150
isn't here.

1025
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:27,520
She left already.

1026
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:28,749
She left?

1027
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:30,419
Where to?

1028
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,620
What are you talking about right now?

1029
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:36,059
Mr. Hwang said...

1030
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:39,730
you promised to give him Han Na.

1031
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,570
So,

1032
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,070
I gave her away just now.

1033
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:48,339
Go Myoung Ji, are you insane?

1034
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:51,879
What right do you have to hit me?

1035
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,709
You were the one who was selfish from beginning to end.

1036
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:56,049
I told you.

1037
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,379
I will kill anyone who hurts my kids.

1038
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,449
We can get divorced. No.

1039
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,719
Let's get divorced right now.

1040
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:03,189
Get out of my house.

1041
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,219
Right this instant!

1042
01:12:04,889 --> 01:12:06,719
If anything happens to Han Na,

1043
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,660
I will never leave you alone.

1044
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:43,450
It's connected.

1045
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:44,919
Good.

1046
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,429
This is maximum-level security.

1047
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,530
It will take a long time.

1048
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,168
Leave this to us.

1049
01:13:56,169 --> 01:13:57,169
You should get to the wedding hall.

1050
01:13:57,839 --> 01:13:59,799
I'll call you as soon as we find Ms. Yoon Ji Sook.

1051
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,509
Bring Mone out then.

1052
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:02,810
Okay, Ki Tak.

1053
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,480
Kyung Soo, I'll leave this to you.

1054
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:05,910
All right, Do Hyuk.

1055
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,089
Ki Tak.

1056
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,419
Mom will be here, right?

1057
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:23,160
Let's do as much as we can.

1058
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,758
It's now time for us to meet the leading man and woman...

1059
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:33,159
of this wedding that combines the beauty of West and East.

1060
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,829
The leading man of today.

1061
01:15:35,299 --> 01:15:37,429
The groom. Please enter!

1062
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,070
Kyung Soo, look inside.

1063
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,270
Okay.

1064
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,410
It won't open.

1065
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:36,759
Han Kyung Soo.

1066
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:52,679
Kyung Soo.

1067
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:53,910
Get out of the way for a minute.

1068
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,759
Hwang Chan Sung, that piece of garbage.

1069
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:12,700
Next, the bride will enter.

1070
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,668
She must be the one person who is more nervous...

1071
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:17,429
and anxious in this moment.

1072
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:21,869
I'm sure a warm round of applause and cheers will help...

1073
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,310
the bride find her courage.

1074
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:26,138
Today, on the most important day of their lives,

1075
01:17:26,139 --> 01:17:29,810
the bride and groom have prepared another event.

1076
01:17:30,049 --> 01:17:33,418
The bride will enter...

1077
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:35,389
with her mother.

1078
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:37,860
The bride's mother?

1079
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,089
But Mone's mom...

1080
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:44,660
died back then, at the reservoir.

1081
01:17:45,459 --> 01:17:47,799
Everyone, please turn to look at the back of the room.

1082
01:17:47,999 --> 01:17:49,969
Here comes the bride.

1083
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,339
Mom!

1084
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:03,379
Mom.

1085
01:18:18,499 --> 01:18:19,499
Mom?

1086
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,370
Mom.

1087
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,370
Mom.

1088
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:30,139
What?

1089
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:36,709
No way.

1090
01:18:37,549 --> 01:18:38,879
Mom, are you okay?

1091
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,219
Mom.

1092
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,159
Next, in place of the officiant's speech,

1093
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,799
the bride's mother has prepared a message of congratulations.

1094
01:18:56,429 --> 01:18:59,538
Let us listen to the speech by the mother of the bride,

1095
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,910
who has mastered English, French, and German.

1096
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:06,110
(Korean speech)

1097
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,310
My daughter, congratulations on your wedding.

1098
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:14,079
Live happily ever after with your amazing husband.

1099
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,360
Sweetheart,

1100
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,289
congratulations on your wedding.

1101
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,459
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your wonderful husband.

1102
01:19:49,419 --> 01:19:50,588
Something to brag about my mom?

1103
01:19:50,589 --> 01:19:52,190
- Yes! - Yes!

1104
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,190
She's a perfect person.

1105
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:58,530
She's fluent in English, French, and even Spanish.

1106
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,869
She starts working out every morning at 5am.

1107
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,599
She works so hard to stay in shape.

1108
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,399
I'm her daughter, but even I can't see her without makeup on.

1109
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,798
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1110
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:10,610
My mom and my family are everything I have in life.

1111
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,490
- No... - With this, your life...

1112
01:20:21,919 --> 01:20:23,690
has become perfect without any lies.

1113
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,490
With your daughter to whom you gave birth,

1114
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,230
and your cultured and skilled mother.

1115

1116

(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

1117
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,649
Refrain from leaving the house from now on.

1118
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:30,949
That was an order from Mr. Hwang.

1119
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,190
I need a safety catch of my own too, don't you think?

1120
01:21:33,259 --> 01:21:35,088
Don't tell me he hits you.

1121
01:21:35,089 --> 01:21:36,788
I brought Han Na as you ordered.

1122
01:21:36,789 --> 01:21:38,559
You should also keep the promise you made me.

1123
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,229
Everyone has become miserable because of you, you shameless punk.

1124
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,729
Does an enemy's enemy make them a friend?

1125
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,638
As of now, we will cut off all ties with Mone.

1126
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,469
Fine, I'll willingly go into the fiery pit that you've created.

1127
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:50,770
Han Mone.

1128
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,138
You must pay the price.

1129
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:53,139
Mom!
