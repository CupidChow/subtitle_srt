00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,919
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,318
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,119
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,388
- Han Na. - Han Na.

6
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,458
(Episode 11)

7
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,989
- No Han Na. - Han Na?

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,130
- Where are you? - Han Na?

9
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,959
- Han Na. - Han Na.

10
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,469
- Han Na! - Han Na.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,370
Excuse me,

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,300
have you seen a seven-year-old girl?

13
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,609
Her hair is about this long,

14
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,069
and she's quite adorable.

15
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,440
Yes, I saw her.

16
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:14,979
Isn't her name...

17
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:17,679
Han Na?

18
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,360
Why are you hiding, Ms. Go?

19
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,800
Not my children.

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,869
Don't hurt them.

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,868
I was a child back then as well.

22
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,168
(Bang Da Mi)

23
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,169
So why...

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,440
Why did you hate me so much?

25
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,479
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,809
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,809
I wronged you.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,729
Myoung Ji.

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,160
What about Han Na?

30
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,069
Is she alive?

31
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,669
She's alive. Don't worry.

32
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,509
Get Matthew.

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,109
Confess to my wrongdoings if that's what it will take.

34
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,750
This isn't the time for such nonsense.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,150
Think about staying alive.

36
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:30,449
I realized it the second I was shot.

37
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,060
I understood...

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,859
why Geum La Hui did what she did.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,900
I'm done with it all.

40
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,970
I want to make up...

41
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,069
for wronging Da Mi.

42
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,539
I mean that.

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,250
I don't think I can make it.

44
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,560
Don't talk nonsense.

45
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,259
I won't forgive you if you die like this.

46
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,889
Think of Erica and Phillip.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,430
Jin Mo...

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,430
I'm...

49
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,299
so sorry...

50
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,739
I don't want to lose someone precious again.

51
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,530
Myoung Ji.

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,630
Myoung Ji.

53
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,229
Myoung Ji!

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Go Myoung Ji.

55
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,419
You risked your life for Han Na...

56
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,489
who isn't even your daughter.

57
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,470
Quickly bring Erica and Phillip to the hospital.

58
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,100
Leave that to me. I'm an expert with children.

59
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,510
Han Mone, check how Han Na is doing.

60
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,809
Kyung Soo should have her.

61
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:33,439
Right, I'll call him.

62
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,150
Ki Tak, find out where Hwang Chan Sung is.

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,910
I'll escort them to the hospital and head to the police station.

64
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,350
I'll contact Detective Oh Sang Sik at Gangnam Police Station.

65
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,350
He's not someone that can be bought off.

66
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,419
- You can trust him. - Got it.

67
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,660
Yes, this is Gangnam Police Station.

68
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,729
I'd like to report an attempted murder.

69
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,959
The wife of the current mayor of Seoul...

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,030
has been shot.

71
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,200
The shooter was Matthew Lee, CEO of TIKITAKA.

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,199
(Operating Room)

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,239
Just a second.

74
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,470
I trust...

75
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,739
that you'll come back to me.

76
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,679
I'll be waiting for you right here,

77
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,350
so hang in there.

78
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,080
You can wait for her out here.

79
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,320
(Restricted Area, Staff Only)

80
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,400
I still have so many things to say to you.

81
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,100
So please...

82
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,369
Please give me one last chance, Myoung Ji.

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
What?

84
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,549
Those punks took Go Myoung Ji?

85
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,710
What about No Han Na?

86
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't tell me you also lost her as well.

87
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,549
I'm sorry, sir.

88
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,020
Seriously?

89
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,160
Why do something you have to apologize for?

90
00:05:57,059 --> 00:06:00,030
They must've already reported us to the police.

91
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,160
You are to hide where no one can find you.

92
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,530
Stay hidden and don't make a sound!

93
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
LUCA.

94
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,668
Erase all recent security footage...

95
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,580
from outside the residence and the neighbourhood.

96
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,409
And delete our call history.

97
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,850
- This instant! - Yes, Chairman.

98
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,979
Min Do Hyuk.

99
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,289
Try all you want.

100
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,320
You'll never get to tie me to Go Myoung Ji.

101
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,530
Chairman Lee,

102
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,070
this is Detective Oh Sang Sik from Gangnam Police Station.

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,699
We're here regarding a possible shooting...

104
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,970
that reportedly occurred at your residence.

105
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,799
What should we do?

106
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,270
How can they be here so soon?

107
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,510
Are you home?

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Without a search warrant,

109
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,410
they will not be allowed to step into my house.

110
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,749
Are you home?

111
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,229
(Restricted Area, Staff Only)

112
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,239
Bullet located.

113
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,169
Removing bullet.

114
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,679
- Be prepared for any bleeding. - Yes, doctor.

115
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,379
- Take the bullet to the police. - Sure.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,820
Doctor, we have bleeding.

117
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,019
- Her BP is dropping. - Keep her stable.

118
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,519
We've been giving her blood from the start,

119
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,089
but it'll take time for an additional unit to arrive.

120
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,919
- Give her more platelets for now. - Okay.

121
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,890
How is it going? Is she still in surgery?

122
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,799
Mom!

123
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,960
Mom, don't die.

124
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,970
Mom won't die, will she?

125
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,369
Is Mom still alive?

126
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,910
Will the surgery soon be over?

127
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,070
Your mom won't die.

128
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,580
Nothing will happen. I promise you that. Okay?

129
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,210
Come here.

130
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,530
You must be Ms. Go's guardian.

131
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,459
Yes, that's me. What's going on?

132
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
We're lacking blood,

133
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
so I'm here to make an urgent request.

134
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,760
We've had too many surgical patients yesterday and today.

135
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,229
What's her blood type?

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,529
I'm type O.

137
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,369
It won't clump or get a haemolytic reaction.

138
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,669
But you have anaemia.

139
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,140
I'll donate.

140
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:25,438
She's type B.

141
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,109
I have the same blood. Take all that you need.

142
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:28,840
- Please hurry this way. - Wait.

143
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,479
Can't you...

144
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,950
take this to my mom?

145
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,279
She might be able to hear my voice.

146
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,090
Can you play this for her?

147
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Mom,

148
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,680
it's Erica.

149
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,279
Mom.

150
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,119
I'm sorry about everything.

151
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,090
You're all that I need,

152
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,659
but I was mean to you because Dad wasn't around.

153
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,830
I'm sorry I gave you a hard time.

154
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,369
I was happy...

155
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,670
to have you as our mom.

156
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,269
Now,

157
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,879
it's our turn to protect you.

158
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,749
We'll wait for you, Mom.

159
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,680
I'll wait for you too and won't cry.

160
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,619
Hang in there, Mom. We love you.

161
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,529
How did it go?

162
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,560
Chairman Lee wasn't home,

163
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,690
and the security cameras nearby...

164
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,999
had been out of order for about a week.

165
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,830
He probably wiped them clean.

166
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,600
The car found on site is an unregistered car,

167
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,599
and unless we have definitive proof...

168
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,169
that he hurt Ms. Go...

169
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,269
Here's your proof.

170
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,840
It's the dashcam footage from a witness.

171
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,350
His name is Baek Ik Ho. If you look him up,

172
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,320
you'll soon find out he works for Matthew.

173
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,159
- Detective Jung. - Yes?

174
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,690
Look into Baek Ik Ho,

175
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,759
and arrest Matthew if you find anything.

176
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,359
Yes, sir. Let's go.

177
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,899
You won't get away with it this time around.

178
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,599
Chairman Lee, do you admit to the attempted murder...

179
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
of the mayor's wife?

180
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,969
- What is your relationship to her? - Over here!

181
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,008
Over here, sir!

182
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,508
- Any words? - Sir!

183
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,138
Stop articles from surfacing.

184
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,879
You'll get the boot if I see a single headline.

185
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,278
I'll handle it, sir.

186
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,349
- Mr. Lee! - Any words?

187
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,079
- Chairman Lee! - Can you look this way?

188
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Do you admit to the charges?

189
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,790
- Are you guilty, sir? - Chairman Lee!

190
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:53,249
Are you ready?

191
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,159
Get rid of Hwang Chan Sung too.

192
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Got it.

193
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,960
It's on.

194
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,129
Okay.

195
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:05,398
("Abusive Husband Hwang Chan Sung...")

196
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,700
("Refuses Police Investigation, Is It a Privilege for the Rich?")

197
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,868
(Poor Mone. She doesn't deserve to be beaten.)

198
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,769
(She doesn't deserve to be beaten. Her marriage was a nightmare.)

199
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,109
(Someone should snap his arm.)

200
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,248
(Watch your back at night. I'm coming for you.)

201
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:18,249
(Being rich doesn't mean you can hit people!)

202
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,529
What happened?

203
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,070
She passed out on our way home.

204
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,570
Hearing the gunshot must've alarmed her.

205
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:42,899
How is she otherwise?

206
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,540
She was suffering from malnutrition.

207
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,109
They must've starved her for days.

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
By the way,

209
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,080
is she really my niece?

210
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,809
How could I have been the only one in the dark?

211
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,878
Was Mom aware of it too?

212
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,779
Keep your voice down. Can't you see she's sleeping?

213
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,359
Han Na.

214
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,930
I missed you so much.

215
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,889
Open your eyes soon and look at your grandma.

216
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,029
I've been waiting so long to see you.

217
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,170
Don't even try to weasel out of this one.

218
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,470
Your hand was positive for gunshot residue.

219
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,609
You shot Ms. Go...

220
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,950
and then had these people clean up the mess.

221
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,249
I exercise my right to remain silent.

222
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,320
You can talk to my lawyer instead.

223
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:34,190
Are you accusing Mr. Lee on the basis of this footage alone?

224
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,789
Present evidence...

225
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,690
that directly links him to the crime.

226
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,229
Baek Ik Ho.

227
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,498
We have more than enough evidence...

228
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,330
that proves he does your dirty work for you.

229
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:48,369
A warrant is out for his arrest, so he'll soon be caught.

230
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:56,440
(Forensics)

231
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,550
Detective Jung, how did it go?

232
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,680
Go Myoung Ji wasn't seen in the entrance security footage.

233
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,389
What did the luminol show?

234
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,690
There aren't any prints or traces of blood.

235
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,119
Got it.

236
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,759
Call me as soon as you find anything.

237
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,330
What's wrong?

238
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:14,960
Isn't there any evidence?

239
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,799
How can there be...

240
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,769
when nothing happened at my place?

241
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,869
It's time you wrapped this up, Detective.

242
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,210
If you do, I won't take it up with your boss.

243
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,170
Shall we, sir?

244
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,379
Sit down, Mr. Lee Hwi So.

245
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,540
I'm not done questioning you.

246
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,609
There aren't any detectable fingerprints...

247
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,749
only because someone wiped all the surfaces.

248
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,720
What were you trying to clean up?

249
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,889
Was it Ms. Go's blood?

250
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,330
Call Hwang Chan Sung immediately.

251
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,930
Now that our companies have merged, he will help me at all costs.

252
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,200
I doubt he'll be able to help.

253
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,239
Hwang Chan Sung.

254
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,080
What are you doing here?

255
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,879
As if you need to know.

256
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,619
Mr. Hwang will be investigated for domestic abuse.

257
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,820
I don't think there's anyone who can help you right now.

258
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,960
Follow me to the interrogation room.

259
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:22,060
You colossal idiot.

260
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,649
I only thought about you, Han Na.

261
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:41,519
It must've been tough to stay strong in such a scary place.

262
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,290
Every night, I pictured meeting you.

263
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,489
That kept me strong.

264
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,759
Wait. What about Ms. Go?

265
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,499
She's the one who rescued me.

266
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,700
The chairman hurt her, didn't he?

267
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,769
Because I'm his daughter.

268
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,070
My mom...

269
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,070
and Ms. Go...

270
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,180
I'm the reason they got hurt.

271
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,889
Calm down, Han Na.

272
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,430
Your grandma isn't going anywhere.

273
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:28,859
I'll be with you by your side.

274
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,399
Grandma...

275
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,440
What do I do?

276
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,879
I'm the reason Ms. Go got hurt.

277
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,970
Mom.

278
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I...

279
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,279
I've been living my life all wrong.

280
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,290
That's on me.

281
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,029
Your family has been a burden to you.

282
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,769
No, I'm being punished...

283
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,499
for what I did to Da Mi.

284
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,909
I want to make it right,

285
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,739
but there's no way of doing that.

286
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,560
Actually, you know how you can be forgiven.

287
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,968
Stop this all for Han Na's sake. You must go back.

288
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:17,639
Right now, I couldn't be more grateful.

289
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:23,340
Han Na's lucky enough to have so many people helping her.

290
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,080
How is she lucky...

291
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,980
when her dad wants her dead...

292
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,020
and her mom's a piece of trash?

293
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:39,689
This is the first time you called yourself her mom.

294
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,359
I always knew.

295
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,540
I knew you were her mother.

296
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,340
Why did I make all the wrong choices?

297
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,379
How did it all begin?

298
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,649
How did I become a monster?

299
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,550
How?

300
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
How did the surgery go?

301
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,490
(Restricted Area, Staff Only)

302
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,959
Their mom is okay, isn't she? Tell me she's okay.

303
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,030
Her heart stopped during surgery which had us worried,

304
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,259
but she held on strong...

305
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,459
and that resulted in a successful surgery.

306
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,600
Thank you, doctor.

307
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,939
However, she was shot close to the heart,

308
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,639
and I can't guarantee anything as of this moment.

309
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,409
She could suddenly become septic...

310
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,409
and might need a heart transplant.

311
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,820
For now, we'll have to wait and see.

312
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,830
(Restricted Area, Staff Only)

313
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,240
If ruining your hand will help her get better,

314
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,570
I won't stop you.

315
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,840
Protect Ms. Go and the children...

316
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,240
with that desperation you have.

317
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,820
Hey.

318
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,060
How is Go Myoung Ji?

319
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,090
They aren't sure when she'll regain consciousness.

320
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,060
I'm fuming, to say the least.

321
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,000
Her testimony alone could end him.

322
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,969
The police can only hold K for the next 40 hours.

323
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,070
Until then,

324
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,040
we must have Baek Ik Ho arrested.

325
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,280
How can we capture that weasel when even the police can't find him?

326
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
I'll testify...

327
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,919
that I gave birth to K's child...

328
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:23,760
and that K is Matthew.

329
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,230
I should've spoken up seven years ago.

330
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,770
If I had, we wouldn't have been in this mess.

331
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Let's do it together.

332
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,109
I'll also reveal...

333
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,409
that I'm Sungchan Group chairman's son.

334
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,649
Let's do whatever we can to prove K's real identity.

335
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,750
You know what?

336
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,389
I'll speak up as well.

337
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,358
I can't take it anymore.

338
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,888
I'd rather spill about my past...

339
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,789
and clean up the mess I made.

340
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,458
I'm a police officer in this nation.

341
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,928
One that graduated from the academy at the top of his class.

342
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,669
Okay, count me in as well.

343
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Let's do whatever we can while Matthew is in custody.

344
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,269
Even Go Myoung Ji who only cares for her own children...

345
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,138
risked her life for the sake of someone else's daughter.

346
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,040
That means we can do whatever is necessary.

347
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,779
(Geum La Hui)

348
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
Geum La Hui.

349
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,719
This is the seed you sprouted.

350
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,550
See how we take K down...

351
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,090
from above.

352
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,889
During the next 40 hours,

353
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,659
we'll each find what we can use...

354
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,490
to take K down.

355
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,399
Ki Tak, find us a venue for a press conference.

356
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,030
Sure. What else?

357
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,040
People should know about what happened to Ms. Go.

358
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,709
None of the reporters are writing articles about it.

359
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,639
That just shows you how deep Matthew's power has taken root.

360
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:24,409
We can write...

361
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,379
the articles ourselves.

("Shocking! National Hero Matthew Lee Is Now Murder Attempt Suspect?")

S Talk has revealed the suspect in the case of...

366
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,859
the wife of Seoul's mayor.

367
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,928
The suspect revealed by S Talk...

368
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,128
is TIKITAKA's Chairman Matthew Lee.

369
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,368
It has been confirmed that the police have arrested him...

370
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,070
and are questioning him now.

371
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,809
There haven't been any known connections...

372
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,579
between Chairman Lee and the victim, Ms. Go.

373
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,178
However, there have been rumours of a close relationship...

374
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,179
between Chairman Lee and Seoul's mayor, Yang Jin Mo.

375
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,219
We've decided to join forces in capturing K.

376
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,050
We'll stop things from behind.

377
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,790
Yang Jin Mo. Do whatever it takes to go forward.

378
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,899
You'll hang in there, right?

379
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,600
Win the fight against yourself.

380
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll win my fight too.

381
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,810
After this war is over,

382
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:28,879
let's hurry back to our kids.

383
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,179
Please let me keep the first promise...

384
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:36,520
I made as a dad.

385
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,229
(City of Seoul)

386
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,060
Bring me the entire list of Gagok District's owners.

387
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,959
Even if it takes us all night,

388
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,169
we will get rid of the rotten roots for certain.

389
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,040
(Almost all owners' addresses and phone numbers unknown or deleted)

390
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,070
Find out which of these people only let others use their names.

391
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,608
Tell those who come clean about the truth...

392
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,310
that they'll be shown clemency.

393
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,409
Then, who do you think is the actual owner?

394
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,350
There is only one person who owns this land.

395
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,550
Matthew Lee.

396
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,189

399
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,340
I've been waiting for you to ask me.

400
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,169
It took you quite a while,

401
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,070
nephew.

402
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,580
Could I borrow Sungchan's power...

403
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,449
in destroying K?

404
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,550
What do you mean, borrow? What are you borrowing it for?

405
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,750
This whole thing belongs to you.

406
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,919
I was going to sell Sungchan and run off overseas.

407
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,359
I'm begging you.

408
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,730
Please just catch that hoodlum, Sim Jun Seok.

409
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,229
Not even knowing how to be grateful to those who raised him,

410
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,569
that jerk killed his father and mother.

411
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,570
I can't watch him acting like he's all that any longer.

412
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,240
What do you need?

413
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,570
You can use everything.

414
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,540
The chairman position?

415
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,109
You can have that too.

416
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,849
Oh, right.

417
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,550
You never know what that crazy jerk might do to Go Myoung Ji,

418
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,919
so we'll have to increase the security at the hospital first.

419
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,590
Hang on.

420
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,050
What else is there for me to do?

421
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,030
Thank you.

422
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,459
How shy you are.

423
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,669
Is it so hard for you to call me your aunt?

424
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,939
My brother and sister-in-law should've seen you now.

425
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,169
I won't run away any longer.

426
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,980
I'll admit that Sungchan...

427
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,209
is my root.

428
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350

00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,619

- Go on. - I'll be back.

431

We don't have time.

432
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
My man.

433
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:11,969
He's totally cool.

434
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:21,280
That little monster.

435
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:23,119
We don't know what he might do.

436
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:24,949

438
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:50,639
I'm going to have to leave this place now.

Without me, Korea is a total mess.

440
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,550
Just say the word.

441
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,689
You should clean up the mess you made.

Why are you doing this to me?

454

The reason you must die...

455
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,830
is because you have an unlucky name.

456
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,909
No, please!

I'll take the blame for everything.

461
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,080
No way. Did he do this on purpose?

462
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,449
You'll continue to plead the fifth?

463
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,179
Let's start over from the beginning.

464
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,649
It was you who shot Ms. Go Myoung Ji at home, correct?

465
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,119
Why did you do that?

466
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,989
You're just a murder attempt suspect for now,

467
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,199
but if Ms. Go doesn't wake up, you'll become a murderer!

Tell him to get some good rest in jail for the time being.

481

This was undoubtedly Matthew's doing.

492

493
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:06,830

(Trustworthy police, a safe nation)

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,310
What happened?

498
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:20,510
You were the one who fired the gun?

499
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,019
Yes.

500
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,649

You're not the culprit!

502
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,519
Why would you shoot Go Myoung Ji?

503
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,889
What do you gain from doing this?

504
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,219
Because Mayor Yang ruined my plans.

505
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,229
I invested everything I had in the Gagok District...

506
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,230
so I could make some money.

507
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,399
But because he turned everything upside down, I was ruined.

508
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,869
I had to kill his wife in order to vent some of my anger.

509
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,199
Then, why would you shoot an innocent person?

510
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,669
That woman's name was also Go Myoung Ji.

511
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,969
I was going to kill all the Go Myoung Jis in the world.

512
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,209
What an annoying name. Go Myoung Ji.

513
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
Don't lie.

514
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,609
Chairman Lee!

515
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:56,649
I'm sorry!

You can't get worked up, Detective Oh.

519
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:05,060
Detective, here is the gun we found on the scene.

520
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,928
First, we'll have the gun used in the crime...

521
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,260
sent to the National Forensic Service.

522
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:10,929
Take him away.

523
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,100
What?

524
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,369
The landowners of the Gagok District are all saying...

525
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,639
that it is their land as if they agreed to say so.

526
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,480
In fact, they're saying they'll file a lawsuit for damage claims...

527
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,379
against you and the city of Seoul for stirring up speculation.

528
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:30,649
They're lying.

529
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,790
They've all been bought out by Matthew.

530
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,159
Mayor.

531
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,689
The real culprit who attacked your wife has been caught.

532
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:41,859
What?

533
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,868
The culprit in the shooting case of the wife of Seoul's mayor...

534
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,468
has been arrested.

535
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:50,299
The culprit confessed that he was enraged by Seoul's announcement...

536
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,840
that the Gagok District wouldn't be developed,

537
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,540
leading him to commit several crimes in a row.

538
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:57,378
The bullet casings found at the scene of the crime...

539
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,379
in Gangnam Station...

540
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,509
were proven to be the same bullet casings...

541
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,020
as the ones used during the crime against Ms. Go Myoung Ji, wife of...

542
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,719
It's like we expected.

543
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,020
Baek Ik Ho took the fall instead of K.

544
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,619
Then, this is totally favourable for Matthew.

545
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,888
Still, they won't let him go right away, will they?

546
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:14,490
Baek Ik Ho is Matthew's man too.

547
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,199
Since the real culprit has been caught, he'll be out soon.

548
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,628
How in the world can they let a culprit go free...

549
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,698
after he's been caught?

550
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:21,230
Under what kind of law?

551
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:23,438
I'm certain someone is working for Matthew at the police station.

552
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:26,709
If not, how could a captured man pull off such a stunt?

553
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:28,539
Matthew has been released.

554
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,510
He has taken back his position as chairman right after getting out.

555
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,709
This fast?

556
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,990
Matthew must be very angry.

557
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,449
What will happen to us now?

558
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,189
There he is!

559
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,189
(Gangnam Police Station)

560
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,290
Chairman, how do you feel about being suspected of murder again?

561
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
It feels awful.

562
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,540
The victim, Ms. Go Myoung Ji, was Da Mi's homeroom teacher.

563
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,070
And she sincerely felt sorry for Da Mi's passing.

564
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,770
How could I...

565
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,209
do such a terrible thing to someone like her?

566
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,249
What action will you take against Mr. Min Do Hyuk of S Talk...

567
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,779
for spreading an exaggerated story?

568
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,520
How did your relationship become this bad?

569
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,679
The reason is...

570
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,889
something only Min Do Hyuk knows.

571
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,419
I warn Sungchan Group,

572
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,029
which maintains an unapologetic attitude.

573
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,029
I, Lee Hwi So,

574
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,699
will seek legal action until the end...

575
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,759
as Da Mi's dad...

576
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,230
and the head of TIKITAKA.

577
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,940
What utter nonsense.

578
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,539
Is that crazy jerk playing politics again?

579
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,610
He's nothing but a criminal.

580
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,040
Our stock prices will fall again.

581
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,179
Why would our stock prices fall?

582
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,380
I'm going to use all of my money on getting rid of that jerk.

583
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,319
Tell him to brace himself.

584
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,719
I'm going to show him how strong a grudge the Sim family can hold.

585
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,520
Is there anything else you want to say to Mr. Min Do Hyuk, sir?

586
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,829
- Could you give one last statement? - Chairman Lee!

587
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,859
- How do you feel right now? - One more question, sir!

588
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,060
Please give us one last statement!

589
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
You're grateful, aren't you?

590
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,610
If I hadn't bought off that detective,

591
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,880
you would've been thrown in jail, for sure.

592
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,779
It was also my idea to broadcast it live on a billboard...

593
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,350
at Gangnam Station.

594
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:21,489
Go ahead and boast all you want.

595
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,389
I'll hear you out for today.

596
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,889
There are just two things that I want.

597
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
LUCA.

598
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:31,759
And Min Do Hyuk.

599
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,339
I'm going to kill that punk with my own two hands.

600
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,810
As long as you don't betray me,

601
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,770
I'll gladly let you have him.

602
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,810
But don't forget.

603
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,409
You're still guilty of domestic violence.

604
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,560
Let's pull up the press conference.

605
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
Didn't you hear?

606
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,198
Matthew has been released.

607
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,059
He will do anything he can to stop the press conference.

608
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,429
So, do you want to give up?

609
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,069
Are you afraid of telling the truth?

610
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,369
The truth?

611
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:10,900
What is the truth? Oh, right.

612
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,610
The thing about how I lied and said Bang Da Mi was pregnant?

613
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,509
How this man threw Lee Hwi So in jail for drugs?

614
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,079
On top of that,

615
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,480
the truth includes how I made Scarlet Letter and spread fake news.

616
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,619
I'm already prepared to reveal the truth.

617
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,920
I will reveal the fact...

618
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,960
that Min Do Hyuk is Chairman Sim Yong's biological son.

619
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,969
We've already finished the DNA tests.

620
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,400
How did you know to come here?

621
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,169
How could I stay out of this?

622
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,908
That jerk, K, is making me out to be some kind of madwoman.

623
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:50,639
I should live up to expectations and go truly mad.

624
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,679
Don't forget.

625
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:55,749
Do Hyuk, you are the biological son...

626
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,519
of Sungchan Group's Chairman Sim Yong.

627
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,920
That jerk, Matthew, is a fake.

628
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,819
Stop!

629
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:02,920
Hang on. Honey.

630
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,629
This won't do. We have to use that card.

631
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,089
- What? - Last night,

632
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,629
he snuck into the police...

633
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,399
and collected a strand of Matthew's hair.

634
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,068
With that, we won't have to reveal our wrongdoings...

635
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:15,368
and still prove that Matthew is Han Na's biological father.

636
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,299
Then, that would automatically prove that he's the fake Lee Hwi So.

637
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,610
- Hey. - Ms. Cha Ju Ran.

638
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:22,540
Don't touch Han Na.

639
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,638
Do you want to brand that young girl...

640
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,350
as the child of the serial killer, K?

641
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,949
Is that what matters right now?

642
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,679
We're all about to go down.

643
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:32,290
If anyone should go down, it should be Matthew...

644
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
and Mone.

645
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,690
This whole thing began because of the two of you.

646
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,290
Isn't that right, Han Mone?

647
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:40,489
Honey.

648
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,330
I don't care what happens.

649
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,939
You should stay out of it. I'll do this by myself if I have to.

650
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,269
Didn't you all join this cause to atone for your crimes?

651
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,508
If you owe your life to Lee Hwi So,

652
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,409
you should just keep your mouth shut.

653
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:00,710
Yang Jin Mo. Are you okay with losing your position as the mayor?

654
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,178
Think of how you've gotten this far.

655
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,919
You're willing to give all that up?

656
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,520
I don't want to climb any higher or gain anything else.

657
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:09,859
And what is there to hold you back?

658
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,360
We have nothing more to lose!

659
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,460
We...

660
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,770
killed people!

661
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,770
Have you forgotten?

662
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:26,270
Have you forgotten about that horrific event in Jeju?

663
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:28,409
- Hey, you punk! - Let go!

664
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:29,580
Out of the way!

665
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,610
Die!

666
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,719
Matthew has that video.

667
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,020
The moment we tell the truth,

668
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,719
he'll reveal everything.

669
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,928
I know you're mad because of Go Myoung Ji.

670
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,298
I got worked up for a while too.

671
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:55,170
But think realistically.

672
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,799
At this rate, we'll all end up in jail.

673
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,810
Do you really want to turn the twins into orphans?

674
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Just like you?

675
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:03,179
So,

676
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,880
you mean you'll keep watching K's evil deeds?

677
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,920
You can only utter that nonsense because you have nothing to lose.

678
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:14,449
No.

679
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,920
To be exact, you're the one who turned K into Lee Hwi So.

680
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,689
If you had only verified things correctly at first,

681
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,429
things wouldn't have gotten this far. But now,

682
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,960
you want us to take all the blame?

683
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,069
What kind of ridiculous logic is that?

684
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:32,908
Do you mean this ruckus is all Vice-Chairman Kang's fault?

685
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,210
It's because of you people!

686
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,509
You were blinded by the profit dangling before your eyes...

687
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,079
that you stood by his side...

688
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,810
while knowing he was the devil! It's your fault!

689
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,460
Anyway, I'm never going to do it!

690
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,889
I don't want to die by Matthew's hand either!

691
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,698
And I don't want to go to jail.

692
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:57,929
So, if you want to do this, just do it by yourselves.

693
00:39:58,299 --> 00:39:59,369
I'm going to stay out of this.

694
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,130
Honey.

695
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,770
Hey, Cha Ju Ran!

696
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,980
I have to go with Ju Ran.

697
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,350
Sorry.

698
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,219
What will you do now?

699
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:29,029
There's no difference.

700
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,960
We have to put things right before it's too late.

701
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,400
I think so too.

702
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,939
Hwang Chan Sung must be out too.

703
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,239
The police investigation is over.

704
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,810
It's highly likely that he and K are on the same side already.

705
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:44,310
I'm not afraid of Hwang Chan Sung anymore.

706
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,980
How will I live at least one day like a human being?

707
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,150
That's all I'm going to think about.

708
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,719
(Obongjip)

709
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
It's so delicious.

710
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:00,290
It's strange but lately,

711
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:02,928
I've been craving long-legged octopus and bossam every night.

712
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,299
My appetite is so strong.

713
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:05,699
Is it that delicious?

714
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,699
You must've been stressed.

715
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,310
You eat a lot when you're stressed.

716
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,509
The fact that you said no to the others...

717
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:16,040
must be weighing on you.

718
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,610
That must be it.

719
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,549
Why would that be weighing on me?

720
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:22,420
The pang of my conscience?

721
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,949
It's a thousand times better than going to jail.

722
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:28,218
My head is already in a jumble, so leave if you plan to make it worse.

723
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,259
I'm going to eat everything myself.

724
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,690
Let's eat.

725
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,529
It's good.

726
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Honey...

727
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Why are you crying?

728
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,219
I'm scared.

729
00:41:58,179 --> 00:41:59,190
About what?

730
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:05,060
Having to admit how terrible a person I was.

731
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:07,259
At one point in time,

732
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,830
I really lived my life to the fullest.

733
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,270
I cherished human lives over money.

734
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,170
And I considered that my life's calling at one time.

735
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,239
You can't bargain with a life.

736
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,909
I will never give up.

737
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,380
Get your heads in the game. Let's all buck up.

738
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,179
Hang in there just a little longer.

739
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:36,258
As of today, I've been assigned to Seogang Police Station.

740
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:38,190
I'm Nam Chul Woo!

741
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,790
I'll become the best police officer I can be!

742
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:42,330
Salute!

743
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,210
How did I end up like this?

744
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:55,110
How?

745
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Come here.

746
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,880
Do as you wish.

747
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,750
I won't force you to do anything.

748
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,069
Why did you come here?

749
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,940
I'd like to pay for Ms. Go Myoung Ji's hospital bills.

750
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:25,770
What right do you have?

751
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:26,969
Get out of here this instant!

752
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,610
Calm down.

753
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
There are lots of eyes on you.

754
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:31,409
It'll only be unfavourable to you.

755
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,750
I'm doing this from my heart. Please accept it.

756
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,349
She was the homeroom teacher whom Da Mi loved.

757
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,350
She'd want this too.

758
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:40,948
Enough of your nonsense.

759
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:43,089
She is listening and feeling everything that's going on.

760
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,888
Stop bothering someone who's fighting for her life,

761
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,630
and get out of here, you jerk!

762
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,699
Ms. Go Myoung Ji.

763
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,109
Code blue. Main Hall, third floor, ICU.

764
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,239
Ms. Go Myoung Ji. Currently administering CPR.

765
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,749
Code blue. Main Hall, third floor, ICU.

766
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,020
Ms. Go Myoung Ji. Currently administering CPR.

767
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,619
Reporters,

768
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,020
please wish for Ms. Go Myoung Ji's quick recovery as well.

769
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,799
I won't have to bother with making any moves.

770
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,600
You won't be able to see Go Myoung Ji ever again.

771
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,009
- Charge to 100 joules. - Charge to 100 joules.

772
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:34,469
Stand back.

773
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:37,440
One, two, three. Clear!

774
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,110
- Charge to 200 joules. - Charge to 200 joules.

775
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,179
Stand back.

776
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,270
Please contact family members.

777
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,179
You need to prepare to say goodbye.

778
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,600
Myoung Ji.

779
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:43,709
Hurry up, honey!

780
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,610
- Okay, let me see you. - Okay. I'm coming.

781
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,009
Mom.

782
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,520
- Mom. - Mom.

783
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,920
Mom.

784
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,119
Ms. Go is in critical condition.

785
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,389
She's in critical condition.

786
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:00,659
What?

787
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,529
Is that true?

788
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:05,330
Is Ms. Go not going to wake up?

789
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,069
I want to see her.

790
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,569
Let me see her.

791
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,710
Mom! We're here.

792
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:24,619
Can you hear my voice?

793
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,350
Mom.

794
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,319
Stay strong. Don't die.

795
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,989
Mom. Wake up soon.

796
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,860
Let's go home.

797
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,159
I'll be a good kid from now on.

798
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:41,429
I won't eat so much food,

799
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,699
and I won't fight with Erica.

800
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,509
I don't even know hangul yet.

801
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,440
You need to teach me.

802
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:53,009
I can't do it by myself.

803
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,650
Kids. Come here.

804
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:23,509
If you haven't changed your mind,

805
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,980
I want to be your daughter.

806
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:45,060
(Intensive care unit)

807
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:57,779
We're really running out of time.

808
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,480
We must have a press conference...

809
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,279
while Ms. Go is still alive.

810
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,750
You two won't get involved, right?

811
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:13,290
It doesn't matter. Do what makes you comfortable.

812
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,690
Let's proceed with it right away.

813
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,830
I'll join too.

814
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,440
The press conference.

815
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,940
Han Na.

816
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,080
I'm proof.

817
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:36,080
Proof that he was a really bad man.

818
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,119
Because...

819
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,589
I'm his daughter.

820
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,690
No, Han Na.

821
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,420
I know...

822
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,600
who did that to Ms. Go.

823
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,230
You didn't remove your nail polish today.

824
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,540
- Han Na! - Those crazy punks.

825
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,909
Han Na. Hurry.

826
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:12,319
Mom!

827
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,190
Mom!

828
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,730
I'll tell everyone.

829
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,900
So please take me to the press conference.

830
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,270
Please?

831
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,069
Even you can't stop me this time.

832
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:36,110
I want to do this for Ms. Go.

833
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:39,779
That bad man hurt Ms. Go.

834
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,219
I want him to be punished.

835
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,369
It's all because of us. We've been bad people.

836
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,409
No. We won't do that again.

837
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,650
Really.

838
00:50:15,651 --> 00:50:17,779
From now on, our lives are in your hands.

839
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,150
Each of you will get 100,000 dollars.

840
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:36,940
I understood...

841
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,509
why Geum La Hui did what she did.

842
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,179
I realized it the second I was shot.

843
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,750
I'm done with it all.

844
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:54,250
I want to make up...

845
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,319
for wronging Da Mi.

846
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:07,429
Hey, No Han Na.

847
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:09,969
Why are you getting involved? This is between us adults.

848
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,299
You punk.

849
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,338
Adults should take care of things like this.

850
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:16,909
That's what adults should do. You're just a kid.

851
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,350
Have you changed your mind?

852
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,218
- This is why I love you. - Oh, my.

853
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,049
Hey, that hurts.

854
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,419
For the press conference, we'll invite just a few reporters...

855
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,960
at the executive level.

856
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,989
Both the location and time won't be determined until later.

857
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:37,699
We'll keep things secret as much as possible for security.

858
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:39,259
What will not change...

859
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,940
is the fact that we'll have a press conference...

860
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:45,699
and our sincerity.

861
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,179
We cannot invite reporters who are friendly with K and TIKITAKA.

862
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:54,080
Same for reporters who just copy articles from Save.

863
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,750
(Jang Young Kyu, Lee Hyun Ki, Kim Sun Hwa, Choi Eun A, Han Ye Ji)

864
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,549
Please get better and wake up, Go Myoung Ji.

865
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,119
If you just die like that, I won't forgive you.

866
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,360
Since we'll be in front of a camera for the first time in a while,

867
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:14,699
you should show off your beauty.

868
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:16,739
This way.

869
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,469
Please take a seat.

870
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,310
- Here. - You're right.

871
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,980
Good luck comes to those who smile.

872
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,350
Let's be positive about all of this.

873
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:34,448
How do I look?

874
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:36,119
Do you think I'll look good on camera?

875
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,889
Of course.

876
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:39,830
Because you have a kind heart...

877
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Oh, my eyes!

878
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,060
Your face radiates light. It's so shiny.

879
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,730
We have decided on the list of reporters.

880
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,600
Only ten reporters whose identities have been confirmed...

881
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,468
can enter the press conference.

882
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:54,639
(1 hour before the press conference)

883
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,009
You need your strength. Eat up.

884
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,290
It's been a while since I've eaten your food.

885
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,230
Eat up.

886
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,469
It's suspiciously quiet.

887
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:28,639
Go Myoung Ji is almost dying, and those beasts are staying quiet?

888
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,279
You have an incoming video call from CEO Hwang Chan Sung.

889
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,580
Connect me.

890
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,449
What is it?

891
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:40,089
Did you call to show off again?

892
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:41,949
The reporters are being suspicious.

893
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,719
What's suspicious about them?

894
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,218
A few reporters who were in a meeting...

895
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:46,929
with the PR team suddenly left.

896
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,259
As if they had been contacted by someone.

897
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,699
Do you think it could be Yang Jin Mo's doing?

898
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,000
Hold on a minute.

899
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,230
LUCA.

900
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,040
Figure out what Yang Jin Mo is doing right now.

901
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:58,900
Yes, Chairman.

902
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,810
He's preparing to have an emergency press conference.

903
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,279
- Where? - Sungchan Group.

904
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:07,049
- The time? - I cannot verify that.

905
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:08,710
We have to stop them.

906
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,318
LUCA. Send the Jeju Island murder video...

907
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:12,979
to Min Do Hyuk, Han Mone,

908
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,750
Yang Jin Mo, Cha Ju Ran, and Nam Chul Woo. Immediately!

909
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,129
If you get on my side now,

910
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,659
I'll let Go Myoung Ji live.

911
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:26,529
I can even bury all of your past wrongdoings.

912
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:29,940
What?

913
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,339
(Don't be stupid.)

914
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,469
What? "Stupid?"

915
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,139
Gosh.

916
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,949
Look at these punks.

917
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,118
(30 minutes before the press conference)

918
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,219
This is good exercise.

919
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,460
Gosh. What is this?

920
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:58,859
(Matthew Lee, Have you forgotten that I have this video?)

921
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,298
(Unless you want the whole country to see this video,)

922
00:55:00,299 --> 00:55:01,569
(don't even think about having a press conference.)

923
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,299
This punk.

924
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,839
Honey!

925
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,569
Matthew sent me a video!

926
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:11,210
Look at this ridiculous punk.

927
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,279
I'm not scared of this.

928
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,610
Seriously.

929
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:17,350
It's almost time. We should go.

930
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:18,719
Okay.

931
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:22,420
I feel so good.

932
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,589
I feel so much lighter now.

933
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,400
(Geum La Hui)

934
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,670
I'll apologize through my actions.

935
00:55:42,569 --> 00:55:44,540
Please watch what I do...

936
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,009
from now on, Da Mi.

937
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:53,219
And...

938
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:55,449
Ms. Geum.

939
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:11,469
Are you sure you won't regret this?

940
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:14,210
Money and popularity.

941
00:56:15,569 --> 00:56:17,339
I've enjoyed all of that already.

942
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,449
In a few hours, I'll truly be free.

943
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,420
Right?

944
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,460
Let's go.

945
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,170
(10 minutes before the press conference)

946
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,909
(Sungchan Group Emergency Press Conference)

947
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:51,239
Safe!

948
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:53,879
Oh, you arrived right on time.

949
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,279
It's exactly ten minutes before the press conference.

950
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,319
Jun Seok. Gosh, I'm so sorry about this.

951
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:04,419
Sadly, you came to the wrong place.

952
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,860
This isn't where they're having the press conference.

953
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,759
How does it feel to be fooled by false information?

954
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,270
You bastards!

955
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,499
(Counting down to the press conference)

956
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,500
This way.

957
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:22,369
Next.

958
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:28,549
(Kim Seok Jin, Our Future Daily Identity confirmed)

959
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:55,068
(Counting down to the press conference)

960
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:58,480
(The press conference begins.)

961
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,000
We are here today...

962
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,900
to tell the truth...

963
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,600
about a lie that started...

964
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,610
seven years ago.

965
00:58:31,279 --> 00:58:32,909
To be exact, it started 30 years ago...

966
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,310
when the child of Sungchan Group's Chairman Sim Yong...

967
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:39,279
was mistakenly switched for another at the hospital.

968
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,949
I'm that child of Sungchan Group's Chairman Sim Yong...

969
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:46,360
who was mistakenly switched at the hospital.

970
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,500
I can testify to that.

971
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:01,069
I have the DNA test results here.

972
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,040
If you want,

973
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,549
I'll get more tests done until I run out of blood.

974
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:08,850
What?

975
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:09,979
- What? - What's going on?

976
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,179
Are they serious?

977
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:13,150
Why are you here, Mone?

978
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:15,020
Who are these other people?

979
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,889
I will now tell you my true story.

980
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:22,259
The person who gave birth...

981
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,659
seven years ago at Myeongju Girls' High School...

982
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,869
was me, Han Mone.

983
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,338
Bang Da Mi wasn't the teen mom?

984
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:35,409
Han Mone was the one who had the baby?

985
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:37,778
At the time, I gave birth...

986
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:39,480
to Sim Jun Seok's baby at the age of 20,

987
00:59:39,779 --> 00:59:41,080
but I had to hide that...

988
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:43,209
in order to become a star.

989
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,880
What can I do?

990
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,350
Meet me at the park behind the school.

991
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,190
You cannot let anyone see you.

992
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,960
Hurry.

993
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,170
The baby's father is K,

994
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:06,170
Sim Jun Seok.

995
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,110
Oh, my goodness.

996
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
Then...

997
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:14,109
Hey, look at the back. Is she new?

998
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,880
I noticed Da Mi, a powerless transfer student.

999
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,350
Your name is Bang Da Mi, right?

1000
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,819
Do you want to be friends?

1001
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:22,319
Me?

1002
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,119
Why would you want to?

1003
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:26,830
I drew up a plan...

1004
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:29,360
to frame Da Mi for everything.

1005
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,230
What happened?

1006
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,839
Did you give birth to this baby?

1007
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:40,069
Da Mi. What should I do?

1008
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:41,610
I saw it.

1009
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:44,040
Bang Da Mi giving birth.

1010
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:45,739
And Go Myoung Ji...

1011
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:48,279
lied to the school...

1012
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,380
about seeing Da Mi give birth.

1013
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,480
And I...

1014
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,718
spread fake news about statutory rape...

1015
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,119
and teenage pregnancy...

1016
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,920
and made a lot of money off of it.

1017
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,560
Cheers!

1018
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:06,259
Hey.

1019
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,170
I thought of a way to make a lot of money.

1020
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,100
Fake news.

1021
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:15,369
Create fake news during an online live stream.

1022
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:16,980
Joo Yong Ju, Hong Man Doo.

1023
01:01:17,179 --> 01:01:18,339
Why don't we combine your family names...

1024
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:19,779
and call it "Scarlet Letter?"

1025
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,920
All right. Cheers.

1026
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:30,460
Something provocative would be good, right?

1027
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:32,520
Your first target is...

1028
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,360
a high school student who gave birth.

1029
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,428
(Ran Women's Hospital)

1030
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:44,068
(Prenatal tests for a healthy birth)

1031
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:45,069
I found out...

1032
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,940
she had given birth.

1033
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:48,440
What are you saying?

1034
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,638
No, I haven't!

1035
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,079
Test me again. Let's do the test again!

1036
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,409
Why is everyone doing this to me?

1037
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,219
Actually, there was something I couldn't tell you before.

1038
01:01:58,779 --> 01:02:02,219
Da Mi came to my hospital recently.

1039
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:03,960
I even have her chart.

1040
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:07,989
You disgraceful...

1041
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:12,658
I used my position as a gynaecologist...

1042
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:13,799
to lie...

1043
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:17,600
to Da Mi's grandfather about her giving birth.

1044
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:20,139
If I had...

1045
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,009
told the truth then,

1046
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,480
Chairman Bang...

1047
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,819
would've taken Da Mi's side right away.

1048
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:36,088
You worked so hard. You must be tired.

1049
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,318
Here. Have one of these as a refreshment.

1050
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,319
Thank you.

1051
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:45,130
I, Nam Chul Woo,

1052
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,529
drugged Lee Hwi So to frame him as the culprit.

1053
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,100
I did those things in my plot to harm him...

1054
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,239
when I was a captain...

1055
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,770
at Deokseon Police Station.

1056
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,110
Our lies came together...

1057
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,779
and completely destroyed...

1058
01:03:03,049 --> 01:03:04,679
a warm, happy family.

1059
01:03:53,259 --> 01:03:54,969
By getting plastic surgery,

1060
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:57,569
Lee Hwi So transformed into Matthew Lee.

1061
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,540
But Matthew Lee...

1062
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,639
isn't Lee Hwi So.

1063
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,169
- What? - What?

1064
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,880
Matthew Lee isn't Lee Hwi So?

1065
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:06,279
What do you mean by that?

1066
01:04:08,049 --> 01:04:10,080
Everything you've seen and believed until now...

1067
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:12,580
was all a lie.

1068
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:14,650
So who is Matthew Lee?

1069
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:15,949
Sim Jun Seok.

1070
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:18,790
K.

1071
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:20,488
- What? - That's impossible.

1072
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,360
- K... - How does that make sense?

1073
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:24,000
Everyone.

1074
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,759
It's all true.

1075
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,129
It was also us who helped Matthew Lee...

1076
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,199
become the nation's hero...

1077
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,940
as Lee Hwi So.

1078
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:35,139
Indulging in the sweet success and wealth he offered,

1079
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,480
I continuously fooled everyone...

1080
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,210
by spreading fake news.

1081
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,310
The reason a low-life hoodlum like me...

1082
01:04:43,819 --> 01:04:45,750
was able to become the mayor of Seoul...

1083
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
was because I had support...

1084
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,489
from Sim Jun Seok, K.

1085
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:58,630
Please look at the truth.

1086
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:00,400
Please take a close look...

1087
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,529
at our faces.

1088
01:05:03,429 --> 01:05:04,440
We are...

1089
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:07,839
the real offenders who ignored the truth about the Bobble incident,

1090
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,710
consistently told lies,

1091
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,679
and made the serial killer K...

1092
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,509
into a national hero.

1093
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,989
As of today,

1094
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:24,920
I will permanently retire from the entertainment industry...

1095
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,860
and gladly receive any punishment...

1096
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:31,330
for the crimes I have committed.

1097
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:12,299
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

1098
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,908
Humans are naturally vulnerable to fake news.

1099
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:18,579
Because it's more provocative and exciting.

1100
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:21,209
It's up. The article on Min Do Hyuk and Han Mone's affair.

1101
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,149
You should surrender now before you lose everything.

1102
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,179
I can give her that heart.

1103
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,988
What do you think?

1104
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:30,119
Would you like a chance to work for me as a loyal servant?

1105
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,988
Min Do Hyuk is very angry.

1106
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,928
Sometime soon, he's going to mess with you big time.

1107
01:06:33,929 --> 01:06:35,758
You should be prepared for that.

1108
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:38,299
Sim Jun Seok is a complete...

1109
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,860
brainless fool.
