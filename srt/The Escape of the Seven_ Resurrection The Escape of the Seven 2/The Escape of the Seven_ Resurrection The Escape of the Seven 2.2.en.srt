My goal has been set.

10

Now,

11
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,050
it is time to punish those who drove Da Mi to her death.

12
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,619
No one, including me, can enjoy happiness.

13
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,520
From now on,

14
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,360
I will begin that story.

Chairman Lee!

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,340
You're so cool!

19
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,569
Chairman Lee!

20
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,910
He's so awesome.

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
That's good.

Here they come.

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,690
- Hello. - Hi.

26
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,319
- It's nice to meet you. - Come here.

27
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,089
You're so adorable.

28
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,288
- Goodness. - How cute you are.

29
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:39,329
Eat up.

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,130
There you go.

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
There.

32
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,900
Take this too.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
There.

34
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,600
What is the reason why you keep doing volunteer work for kids?

35
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,169
Kids are...

36
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:51,840
our future.

37
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,009
Whether they have parents or not,

38
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,280
kids should be protected within the system.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,250
We, at TIKITAKA, just help to build that system.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,419
That is why we, at TIKITAKA,

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,589
have developed an app to find missing children...

42
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,289
called "Children Home."

43
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,659
Through a simple procedure, you can insert a GPS chip...

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,229
and prevent kids from going missing.

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,500
It's sad that the app hasn't been widely advertised yet, but...

46
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,180
With the hope...

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,710
that no other parents live in pain after losing a child,

48
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,079
all of the service costs will be paid for by TIKITAKA.

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,690

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,889
Let's stop there for today.

52
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,358
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

53
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,030
- Thank you, everyone. - Thank you.

54
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,600
Thank you.

55
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,068
We're so lucky to have a world-renowned director...

56
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,899
working on our documentary.

57
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Of course.

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,739
It's a continuation of my movie, "Dear D."

59
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,979
That's true. It's premiering soon, right?

60
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:03,548
Yes.

61
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,509

Mom!

65
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:28,470
- Did you have fun today? - Yes.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,868
Did you eat well?

67
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,869
Yes.

68
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,479
It's a clown!

69
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,209
- It's a clown! - Make me an animal!

70
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,709
Make me a puppy.

71
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,209
Make me a sword.

72
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,609
Make me a puppy.

73
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,548
Make me a sword.

74
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,919
Mom, I got this.

75
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,150
That's cool.

76
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,260
What about Erica? What did Erica get?

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
- It's so cute! - Make me a puppy!

78
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,530
Phillip, where is Erica?

79
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
I don't know.

80
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,299
I want to go and get another one.

81
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,539
You were just with your sister.

82
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:01,970
Where is she?

83
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,910
Yes, I got a sword!

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,809
- Hey, look. - Make me a sword too.

85
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,608
Make me a puppy.

86
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:11,879
Make me a big one.

87
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,150
(Mayor of Seoul, Jang Jin Gu)

88
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,460
It's not much different from a missing child app.

89
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,058
People register their kids' fingerprints,

90
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:23,359
and when a missing child case occurs,

91
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,330
it gets automatically transferred to the police station.

92
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,029
But if TIKITAKA created it,

93
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,498
many people would sign up.

94
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,270
Wouldn't it bring public confidence to Seoul's bidding?

95
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,469
It's already been decided that we're going with "Hello to Korea."

96
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,840
The mayor also agreed that it was original.

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,239
That's not an original technology.

98
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,409
TIKITAKA also has the ability...

99
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,049
to link security cameras nationwide through IoT technology.

100
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,719
Shouldn't this bidding be decided from the viewpoint of the citizens?

101
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,249
I'm the Deputy Mayor for Administrative Affairs.

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,449
This is not within your authority...

103
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,489
as the Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs, Mr. Yang Jin Mo.

104
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,020
Did you perhaps...

105
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:00,059
get a request from "Hello to Korea" or something?

106
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:03,058
The son of the Deputy Mayor for Administrative Affairs...

107
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,168
was a scholarship recipient from "Hello to Korea."

108
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,628
There isn't anyone who doesn't know about that.

109
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,869
How dare you?

110
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,470
Mr. Mayor, I'll leave you to make the decision.

111
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,010
I...

112
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,619
agree with the Deputy Mayor for Administration.

113
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,549
Proceed with "Hello to Korea."

114
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,629
I apologize. One moment.

115
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,728
Honey.

116
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm in an important meeting. Later.

117
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,470
Erica has disappeared.

118
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,200
What?

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,210
She must've been kidnapped outside the kindergarten.

120
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:45,809
Where are you right now?

121
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,080
Deputy Mayor Yang!

122
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,080
Where are you going in the middle of a meeting?

123
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,910
My daughter has gone missing. I will be right back.

124
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,179
Did you report her missing?

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,819
Missing?

126
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,048
- What's going on? - She's missing?

127
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,089
Breaking news.

128
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,118
The daughter of Yang Jin Mo, Seoul's Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs,

129
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,090
has been abducted.

130
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,960
The child who has been abducted is known to be a child star.

131
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,759
It has been confirmed that the kidnapper sent the family...

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,700
a ransom text asking for two million dollars.

133
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,868
Currently, the police are using the app, "Children Home,"

134
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,599
which was created by TIKITAKA...

135
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,700
in order to track the location of the abducted child.

136
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,340
She's at Seoul Culture Forest.

137
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,479
In child abductions, it's over if we miss the window of opportunity.

138
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,238
Everyone, set out. Hurry!

139
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,239
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

140
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,379
This is Chief Nam Chul Woo of the Multi-region Investigation Unit.

141
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,879
We've located the whereabouts of the child...

142
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,520
who was abducted outside the international school.

143
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,058
(Children Home, Go Erica, Seoul Culture Forest)

144
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,390
Make a right 1km ahead.

145
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
Yes, sir.

146
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,459
I implore whoever had a momentary lapse in judgment...

147
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,559
and took Erica.

148
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,700
Please return Erica.

149
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,369
Nothing bad should happen to innocent children.

150
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,999
Please, I beg you.

151
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,710
All children in this world are our kids.

152
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:57,010
Please let Erica come back to her parents safe and sound.

153
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,220
I ask everyone to pay attention and cooperate.

154
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,189
(Police)

(Children Home, Go Erica, Seoul Culture Forest)

156
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,410
We've found her!

157
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,379
- It's all right. - Out of the way!

158
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,449
I'm a police officer.

159
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,549
You're okay. I'll untie you soon.

160
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,679
It's all right. I'm a police officer.

161
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,690
There.

162
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,720
Is the child okay?

163
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,960
She must've been so scared.

164
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,729
Erica!

165
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,699
She must be the mom.

166
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,300
- Erica! - Mom!

167
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:53,899
Over here!

168
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,899
The child is fine.

169
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,040
Are you okay?

170
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,840
Nothing happened, right?

171
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,340
Were you hurt?

172
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,149
I fell asleep, so I don't remember anything.

173
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,379
I was so scared.

174
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,950
- Please answer some questions. - Sir.

175
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,489
Please give us a statement.

176
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,689
Deputy Mayor.

177
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,290
- Please. - Give us a statement.

178
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,659
How do you feel to see your child again?

179
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,869
The daughter of Seoul's Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs, Erica,

180
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,800
has returned safe and sound after a few hours.

181
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,868
In the plan to save Erica,

182
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,469
the quick location tracking of TIKITAKA's app, "Children Home,"

183
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,608
played a major role.

184
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:34,609
Go and sit over there.

185
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,179
- Since Erica's kidnapping incident, - Next person,

186
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,008
- new registrations for the app... - come in!

187
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,479
have multiplied by 30 times in a single day.

188
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:43,378
Through a simple procedure,

189
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,449
"Children Home" registers the parents' and child's DNA...

190
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,988
as well as their fingerprints.

191
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:49,059
The service ensures the safety of children.

192
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,589
People are expecting it to help...

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,759
in solving long-term missing children's cases as well.

194
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,758
The spokesperson of the Blue House...

195
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,398
has made an official statement that they will cooperate with TIKITAKA...

196
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,868
for the safety of citizens and expand...

197
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:03,070
the development of the AI-based missing persons platform nationwide.

198
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:06,769
Right.

199
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,679
Cheers!

200
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,249
- Cheers! - Cheers!

201
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,748
Through this project, the stock prices of TIKITAKA...

202
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,149
have been on the rise for the first time in a while.

203
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:23,060
We've also safely procured the bidding for Seoul city.

204
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,190
Through Erica's kidnapping,

205
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,729
the general opinion wants "Children Home" now.

206
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,930
I'm sure we'll get flashy bonuses too, right?

207
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,680
What do you think you're doing?

208
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,080
You shouldn't have touched my child, at least.

209
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,550
How could you do such a thing without letting me know?

210
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,148
So?

211
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,820
Did Erica get hurt or something?

212
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,119
Is she traumatized?

213
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,759
Erica was the one who willingly said okay.

214
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,999
Was it you that lured her in?

215
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,529
Have you forgotten what kind of woman I was?

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,739
For success,

217
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,570
I'm a crazy witch who even abandons the child I gave birth to.

218
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,639
So, why shouldn't I be able to do such a thing?

219
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,508
Da Mi and my kids are different.

220
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,509
Don't compare them!

221
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,450
What's different about them?

222
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,190
It's just the same that your kids have a trashy mother.

223
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,960
See?

224
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,659
You admit it too.

225
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,529
How ridiculous.

226
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,998
Where are you going? I'm not done talking!

227
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,228
- Hey, Myoung Ji. - Myoung Ji.

228
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,868
Don't get so worked up.

229
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:42,169
Erica and I just went on a safe little drive.

230
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,439
We also had some good food.

231
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,070
She said she wasn't scared at all since it was like acting.

232
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:49,478
From now on, don't ever think of using...

233
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,749
or laying a finger on my kids!

234
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,018
Even if it's your orders, Matthew, I can't cooperate.

235
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,050
No, I will ruin everything.

236
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,330
Go Myoung Ji.

237
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,830
Be sure to keep this hand in check from now on.

238
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,070
I'll let it slide once but not twice.

239
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:12,830
You must be mistaken.

240
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,470
I'm not really your husband.

241
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,269
For the same reasons, Erica and Phillip aren't my kids either.

242
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,239
So don't cross the line.

243
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,580
Yang Jin Mo!

244
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,148
Why did you do that?

245
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:28,720
What good will come of getting on Matthew's bad side?

246
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,479
We're enjoying a time of peace.

247
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,590
If you just shut your eyes once,

248
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,920
this is paradise itself.

249
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,590
Still, Yang Jin Mo was against this plan until the end.

250
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,529
That was why we proceeded without letting him know.

251
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,359
I'm sure he was as surprised as you were earlier.

252
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,700
I think he was confused whether it was the real deal or not.

253
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,570
- Let's go. - We'll be going first.

254
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,659
You shouldn't have touched my child, at least.

255
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,159
How could you do such a thing without letting me know?

256
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,728
From now on, don't ever think of using...

257
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,930
or laying a finger on my kids!

258
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,239
No Han Na...

259
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,399
Are you even alive?

260
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,128
She must not have any money.

261
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,430
Why don't you ever contact me?

262
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:52,970
Are you dead or alive?

263
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:59,509
Did something bad happen to you?

264
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,879
Please be safe.

265
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,050
Dad, did you sleep well?

266
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,190
Yes.

267
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,519
You were very worried yesterday, weren't you?

268
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,729
I slept well, and I'm totally fine.

269
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,700
Erica.

270
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,729
Phillip, come and eat breakfast.

271
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,070
It's my favorite, duck!

272
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,840
Yesterday,

273
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,080
I got a little too heated.

274
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:36,609
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,680
I texted you today's schedule.

276
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,950
This evening, there is an event at Sihan Gallery for couples...

277
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,290
Go alone.

278
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,489
Won't you eat breakfast?

279
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,460
What did you talk about with Dad?

280
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,060
I didn't talk about anything.

281
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,629
Didn't he even ask if you were okay?

282
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:03,070
Why would he ask that? It's so tacky.

283
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,070
He can tell that I'm okay just by looking at me.

284
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,210
I'm so happy that you married Dad.

285
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,850
I'm happy that my dream came true.

286
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,290
But...

287
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,590
do you think Dad thinks so too?

288
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,159
Why?

289
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,889
Don't you think that's true for Dad?

290
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,028
No, just because.

291
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,859
He always seems to be thinking about something else.

292
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,540
We got married because Matthew told us to.

293
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,909
But we can never be a real family.

294
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,309
You don't have to put on a show at home.

295
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,639
Don't mind me.

296
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:42,979
I'm...

297
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,359
- Go Myoung Ji. - Yes?

298
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Have you forgotten about the reports on Yang Jin Mo?

299
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,499
He just went to work.

300
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,470
There aren't any particularly suspicious movements.

301
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,420
One, two, three.

302
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,229
It's tiring, isn't it?

303
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,070
Let's go!

304
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,170
Why is a day so long?

305
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,539
They're shoving the camera in my face from the early morning.

306
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,879
How can I live my life when it's so annoying?

307
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,450
Are you planning on going around to every orphanage in the nation?

308
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,479
Lee Hwi So made this pledge.

309
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,050
That darned Lee Hwi So!

310
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,460
It's like a nightmare, isn't it?

311
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,060
But you will have to keep feeling this.

312
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:08,330
The restraint of Lee Hwi So that you created yourself.

313
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,929
I'm curious about something.

314
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,369
What is the real reason for developing the app, "Children Home?"

315
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,639
Why are you curious about that?

316
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,050
It doesn't suit you at all.

317
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,919
What are you planning to gain...

318
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,350
from the nation's fingerprints and DNA?

319
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,090
Well,

320
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,060
you'll find that out once time passes.

321
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,629
(Ms. Geum, the teaser video for "Dear D" has been released.)

322
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,040
The teaser for "Dear D"...

323
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,840
has finally been released.

324
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,108
Ms. Bang, who has gained attention for the Bobble case,

325
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,179
has been shot just now.

326
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:01,080
Min Deul Re is the one who had a baby.

327
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,918
I'm sorry for not being able to keep your secret until the end.

328
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,020
That's not it...

329
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,188
(At the beginning of the incident is Sungchan Group's only son, K.)

330
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,350
("Dear D")

331
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:17,669
What's up?

332
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:20,570
Put Matthew on the phone. Put him on the phone now!

333
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:22,899
He's not someone you can demand to talk to.

334
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
Today's schedule was too tough.

335
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,280
If you have something to say, come home and talk to me.

336
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,409
Hello?

337
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Hey...

338
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:34,750
Darn it.

339
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,929
(Michell)

340
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,929
Michell, I told you.

341
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,000
Matthew is K. He's Sim Jun Seok.

342
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:55,669
Right now,

343
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:58,240
you're helping the killer who murdered your sister.

344
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,169
You still want me to believe you?

345
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,780
You just tricked me so you could survive.

346
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,519
What you did to Da Mi and Ji A...

347
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,179
are all in the movie.

348
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,719
I hope you watch it with a fluttering heart.

349
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,859
Stop talking nonsense.

350
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,659
I will stop it no matter what it takes.

351
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,590
That's just your pipe dream.

352
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,499
As soon as the preview event is over,

353
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,429
I'm planning on streaming it worldwide on a global OTT.

354
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,469
Aren't you looking forward to the aftermath?

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,599
Your enemy is K.

356
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,139
Why are you so hell-bent on taking me down?

357
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,780
Michell, I'll help.

358
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,209
So that we can prove that Matthew is K.

359
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,250
If what you say is true, you should prove it yourself.

360
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,319
Be confident enough to bring your daughter...

361
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,148
and have a DNA test with Chairman Lee.

362
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:46,250
Then, I'll believe you.

363
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,530
The child has disappeared.

364
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,199
I don't know where she is either.

365
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,869
Then, there's nothing more to say.

366
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,469
Michell!

367
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,109
Darn it.

368
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,649
You can't just burst out of nowhere like that.

369
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,320
Aren't you the one who burst out of nowhere?

370
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:19,919
Ms. Han Mone?

371
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,359
I won't ask you to pay for dry cleaning, so get lost.

372
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,260
Then, should I just buy you the same exact outfit?

373
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,898
Call me.

374
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,300
Don't go changing your tune later on.

375
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,010
I'm Hwang Chan Sung.

376
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:52,619
Why are you so late?

377
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,389
Look at how supple my skin is.

378
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,459
Why?

379
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,429
Did something happen?

380
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,070
Matthew promised that he'd stop the movie from premiering.

381
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,939
So why would a teaser be released?

382
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,469
I'm sure Matthew had no choice either.

383
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:12,969
It's the work of a world-renowned director.

384
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,840
Stop talking like this has nothing to do with you.

385
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,209
Aren't you the CEO of my agency?

386
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,379
Hey. Your attitude is really getting on my nerves.

387
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,719
Your arrogant attitude, as if you've become...

388
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,590
second only to Matthew or something.

389
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,530
I'm sorry that I rebelled against you until now, Ms. Geum.

390
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,668
Please block the teaser.

391
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,840
No. Stop the movie's release.

392
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,368
We made it to mess with Sungchan Group.

393
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:47,669
There's no point in it now.

394
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,580
If you help me get over this crisis,

395
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,709
I'll do any job you want.

396
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,219
I'll be in any ad or drama you pick.

397
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,590
Can you...

398
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,530
really do that?

399
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,330
Yes. I promise.

400
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,199
Okay. I'll talk to Matthew.

401
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,199
If the movie's released, it won't do any of us any good.

402
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
In return,

403
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,010
stay out of Matthew's sight for a while.

404
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,909
Thank you, Ms. Geum.

405
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,409
Can I really trust you?

406
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,780
You can.

407
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,750
You're my daughter.

408
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,300
I want Han Mone out.

409
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,129
Are you serious?

410
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,499
Since the teaser came out,

411
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,599
people have been speculating online...

412
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,939
that Min Deul Re is Mone.

413
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,109
The Myeongju High alumni are gathering too.

414
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,309
If the movie gets released,

415
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,909
more people will wonder if Mone dated Sim Jun Seok.

416
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,850
If we get rid of Mone,

417
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,149
we'll also be under attack for signing her to work...

418
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:06,750
for TIKITAKA Studio.

419
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,959
We can say she duped us too.

420
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,889
We'll say we found out the truth later.

421
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,559
We planned to cast Mone as the bully...

422
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,929
and then reveal the truth at the preview in a dramatic manner.

423
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,040
Geum La Hui.

424
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,240
In situations like this,

425
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,969
you're even more merciless than I am.

426
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,080
We can't let a kid like Mone take us down.

427
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:31,649
Shall we...

428
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,209
bury her properly this time?

429
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
By the way,

430
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,020
how is the meeting with Save's CEO Hwang Chan Sung coming?

431
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
Even today,

432
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,830
their main article is an attempt to knock me down.

433
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,859
It's hard to arrange.

434
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,639
He's arrogant and snobby, I can't even reach him.

435
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,399
You said you'd put your life on the line to reinvent my image,

436
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,439
and you can't even bring Hwang Chan Sung to me?

437
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,480
Save owns 95 percent of the portal site market.

438
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,310
Its level of influence...

439
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,219
exceeds that of TIKITAKA, a social media-based platform.

440
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,020
It's sickeningly displeasing, and I can't stand it.

441
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,830
If I can somehow take over Save and merge with TIKITAKA,

442
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,659
then I can get my hands on the weaknesses...

443
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,699
of everything in the country.

444
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,629
Then...

445
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,570
without becoming the president with a limited term of five years,

446
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,240
I can...

447
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,510
keep the country under my feet and control it as I wish.

448
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,480
So that was...

449
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,250
what you wanted.

450
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:44,949
My gosh.

451
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:48,560
I finally see the big picture.

452
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,730
The reason you were obsessed with "Children Home."

453
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:56,560
You need the personal info of every single national.

454
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,770
Your dream.

455
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
I'll make it come true.

456
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:08,580
So far, the only thing I wanted but couldn't obtain...

457
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,909
was you.

458
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,570
Grandma.

459
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,509
Did I make you wait? Are you hungry?

460
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,148
Han Na wants zucchini jeon.

461
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,990
I thought so, so I got lots of zucchini and potatoes.

462
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:57,689
You're the best.

463
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,929
Oh. I got bored, so I drew your face.

464
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,639
Ta-da.

465
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:14,609
Am I that pretty?

466
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,379
Yes.

467
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,709
After my mom, you're the prettiest.

468
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:30,359
Where are these from?

469
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:31,889
I don't know.

470
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,659
Someone left them here.

471
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,969
The sketchbook smells really nice.

472
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,579
You can't meet anyone.

473
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,010
If someone comes in, you must hide, okay?

474
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,379
Don't worry, Grandma.

475
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,580
I'm smart.

476
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,030
("Dear D")

477
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,740
(2nd teaser of "Dear D," from world-famous director Michell)

478
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:21,040
It was Min Deul Re who had the baby.

479
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,580
Believe only me from now on.

480
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:26,379
I'm sorry.

481
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,379
(A girl with an angel's face)

482
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,520
I can't talk to him today either?

483
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,060
Chairman Lee would really like to meet your CEO Hwang Chan Sung.

484
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,459
We'll make the time, whenever it may be.

485
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,030
Please pass the message to Mr. Hwang.

486
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,000
Tell him Save has nothing to lose.

487
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,570
Bye.

488
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:56,780
- What is it? - You said you'd cancel the teaser.

489
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,980
The second one was just released.

490
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,219
You're actually so naive.

491
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,259
Why would Matthew...

492
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,489
who finally became Lee Hwi So cancel the movie?

493
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,059
To him, the movie...

494
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,600
is the best way to show his daughter's innocence.

495
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,459
Isn't it?

496
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,329
You said you'd help me.

497
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,040
Was it all a lie from the beginning?

498
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,010
Girls from Myeongju High remember the mess.

499
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:29,179
Da Mi named you the teen mom and then died.

500
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,179
How can I silence 500 people?

501
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:35,178
You can flee abroad even now.

502
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,350
I'll talk to Matthew in person.

503
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,250
Don't bother.

504
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,760
Matthew won't see you.

505
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:51,969
Ms. Geum.

506
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,800
You think I won't do anything?

507
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,469
I'll tell everyone what kind of mom you were to Da Mi.

508
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,149
How?

509
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:14,419
Do you have proof?

510
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,790
Who would believe a bully?

511
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,889
Whatever you yelp and squeal,

512
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,159
you can't beat me.

513
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,240
Bye, Mone, my daughter.

514
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,030
I won't die alone.

515
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,369
Hi, Mone. Do you need me to do something?

516
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,909
You know where Michell stays, right?

517
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,580
Go there and get me everything on Ji A.

518
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,750
Bring me things like her diary!

519
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,850
Or else we're dead.

520
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:30,429
Chairman Lee would really like to meet your CEO Hwang Chan Sung.

521
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,070
We'll make the time, whenever it may be.

522
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,669
Hwang Chan Sung?

523
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,208
(Save CEO Hwang Chan Sung)

524
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:42,209
"Save."

525
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,149
The deities are still on my side.

526
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,560
Sneaking into someone else's home at night like a little cat.

527
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:03,959
What do you want?

528
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,169
This was the only way to see you.

529
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,010
I want you to cancel the movie.

530
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,179
Why should I do that?

531
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,350
Michell knows...

532
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,719
you're Sim Jun Seok,

533
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,159
and that you killed Song Ji A.

534
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:32,459
I told her.

535
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,830
La Hui's foresight is truly astonishing.

536
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
You were...

537
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,270
working against me.

538
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,070
However,

539
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,669
Michell's knowing doesn't change anything.

540
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,369
The image I built up as Lee Hwi So...

541
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,340
won't crumble so easily.

542
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,750
I'm Lee Hwi So.

543
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:53,179
The nation's hero.

544
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,179
Lee Hwi So.

545
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:58,019
Didn't you find it odd that someone...

546
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,789
as big as Michell would spend days...

547
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,990
filming you for a documentary?

548
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,019
She stuck to you 24-7 to film you,

549
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,229
to catch something that gives away...

550
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,859
that you're Sim Jun Seok.

551
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:12,199
Michell was observing me?

552
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,300
That makes it simple.

553
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:22,580
Her for filming and you for talking.

554
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,449
I'll just kill you both.

555
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:35,189
Did you come here this late at night to say that?

556
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,419
If you're done,

557
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,230
stop wasting my time and go to bed.

558
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,000
What if I arrange a meeting with Save's CEO Hwang Chan Sung?

559
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,409
You?

560
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,679
When even La Hui failed?

561
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,250
I'm Han Mone.

562
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:04,780
I can call him right now.

563
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,698
(CEO Hwang Chan Sung)

564
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:16,699
(Speaker)

565
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,070
Hi, Mone.

566
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,699
You said you'd call, so I waited all evening.

567
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,510
Sorry, Chan Sung.

568
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,270
Are you free tomorrow?

569
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,840
Let's meet.

570
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,409
I can't make the time tomorrow.

571
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,149
Just a moment.

572
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,149
(Mute)

573
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,990
(CEO Hwang Chan Sung)

574
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,859
Michell...

575
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,290
I'll take care of her for you.

576
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,600
Where is it?

577
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:03,540
Did Mone send you?

578
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:05,209
To steal Ji A's diary?

579
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,750
Darn it.

580
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,320
Who are you?

581
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,969
How did it go?

582
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,739
It was a success, of course.

583
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,350
Good job.

584
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:41,779
So,

585
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,719
why do you want Michell?

586
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:46,790
I just made a move before Mone did.

587
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,759
It's TIKITAKA Studio's first feature-length movie,

588
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,989
and I can't let Mone bury it.

589
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,029
Are you going to ditch Mone?

590
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,100
She was a school bully.

591
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,339
It's not fair if the likes of her were to move in our society...

592
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,770
as if she's better than most.

593
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,169
Keep Michell safe until tomorrow,

594
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,540
and bring her to the cinema for the preview.

595
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:11,279
So she can do the exposing,

596
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
I'll just...

597
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:16,449
provide the stage.

598
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,759
She scares me more each day.

599
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,929
Why does she hate Mone so much?

600
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,929
No one likes Mone.

601
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,230
Who's he?

602
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,008
What happened?

603
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,609
What's this? What's happening?

604
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,610
Hey.

605
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,610
- What was that? - I can't see.

606
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:48,619
What is this?

607
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,719
(Work in progress. Do not approach)

608
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,230
Darn it.

609
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:01,889
The window's broken.

610
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:05,259
Oh, gosh.

611
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,630
The mirror too?

612
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,900
You lunatic!

613
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,738
Can't you ride properly?

614
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,908
Do you know who I am?

615
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,940
I'm chief of the Multi-region Investigation Unit!

616
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,679
Darn you!

617
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,380
You! Apologize!

618
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,079
I'm not scared!

619
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,719
You punk.

620
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Hey, you.

621
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,489
What are you doing?

622
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,319
Darn it!

623
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,028
Come on, honey!

624
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:33,289
Get them!

625
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,289
Yes. Let's get them.

626
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,360
I'll make them pay.

627
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,330
Get in.

628
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,369
Wait.

629
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:44,400
Darling.

630
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,869
Michell's gone.

631
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
What?

632
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,049
- She was right here. - Call La Hui.

633
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,218
Come on, call her now!

634
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:58,219
No.

635
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,449
She'll only scream at us.

636
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,719
Why set her off already?

637
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,159
Ignore her calls for a while.

638
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,029
Let's back out of this.

639
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:08,900
Should we?

640
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,500
Darn it.

641
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:24,509
Min Do Hyuk.

642
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,250
Protect Michell.

643
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:28,779
Only then can you show yourself.

644
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,259
(Redevelopment of Deokseon Zone 3 infringes property rights.)

645
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,630
(Deokseon Zone 3 redevelopment planning)

646
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,750
Min Do Hyuk?

647
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,589
What happened?

648
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,500
You were being kidnapped.

649
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,130
Mone sent Kim So Yeon to steal Ji A's diary.

650
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,170
She was going to blackmail you...

651
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:57,900
with that diary.

652
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,509
She wanted to reveal that your father...

653
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,580
died by your hand and not Ji A's.

654
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,009
I don't care.

655
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,650
If that will help me expose Mone,

656
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,210
she can do all she wants.

657
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,319
Too many people are after you right now.

658
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,690
You should back out.

659
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:15,089
I don't want to.

660
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,360
I'll play a part in your plan to the end.

661
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,299
It's the final version of the documentary.

662
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,429
Play it at the movie preview.

663
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,369
I'll lure Matthew.

664
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,170
Okay, then. Tomorrow is D-day, the day of the preview.

665
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,279
If we pull this off,

666
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,719
you can show yourself again.

667
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,690
K.

668
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,819
When we meet again,

669
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,989
I wonder what face you'll make.

670
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,698
(Dear D)

671
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,429
(Dear D)

672
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,599
(Dear D)

673
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,469
(Han Mone)

674
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,338
(Geum La Hui)

675
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,509
We put a lot of effort into it.

676
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,609
Seat people from Myeongju High in the front rows.

677
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,619
Yes, Ms. Geum.

678
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:20,920
You still don't know where Michell is?

679
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,889
I think she went into hiding.

680
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,960
I bet she's hiding somewhere until she can attend the preview.

681
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,900
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

682
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,600
I have people there already.

683
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,869
They'll get her.

684
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,469
I didn't invite you to sit.

685
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,639
Did you ask to see me about last time?

686
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,750
I admit I was out of line,

687
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,449
but you shouldn't have used my child.

688
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,088
Have you forgotten...

689
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:56,119
who cut off the corrupt teacher tag that followed you around?

690
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,290
If I hadn't taken down everything about you,

691
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,159
do you think you'd have been...

692
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,000
able to act like a decent person in society?

693
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:06,299
I did everything you asked.

694
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,499
I married Jin Mo for show,

695
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,299
and I'm reporting to you every day.

696
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,409
To say it never happened,

697
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:16,210
my ego took too big a beating.

698
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,119
I need to know you're well and truly subservient to me.

699
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,389
I need you...

700
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,889
to show it.

701
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,060
(Dear D)

702
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:37,029
(Dear D)

703
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:45,569
Hello.

704
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,949
(Everyone was mistaken.)

705
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,819
(Dear D)

706
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,559
Hello.

707
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,289
Thank you for attending...

708
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,900
the premier preview of the much talked about movie, "Dear D."

709
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,669
Based on the Bang Da Mi incident...

710
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,068
that saddened everyone,

711
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:16,968
Is Chairman Lee not here yet?

712
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,000
He'll come.

713
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,540
He's so punctual.

714
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,110
Oh, so you don't know.

715
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,480
We just talked.

716
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,118
He's ten minutes out. The traffic's holding him up.

717
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,818
Let me introduce the producer...

718
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:33,289
of "Dear D," Ms. Geum La Hui.

719
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,319
Welcome her with some applause.

720
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,589
There won't be a preview today.

721
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,230
Matthew will put a stop to it.

722
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,830
Don't pretend to be calm.

723
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,469
Today will be your downfall.

724
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:50,339
You'll never imagine...

725
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,610
what's waiting for you.

726
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,420
- Are you ready? - Yes.

727
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,960
I'm ready.

728
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:23,839
Let's go.

729
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:31,679
("Dear D")

730
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,088
If you see Michell, take her away...

731
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:41,548
so she can't come near the movie preview.

732
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:42,589
Yes, sir.

733
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:53,770
Director Michell?

734
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,770
Are you at the movie preview?

735
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,469
Of course, I am.

736
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,610
To catch you, K.

737
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:03,009
What?

738
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,339
Come to the fourth-floor hallway.

739
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
Alone.

740
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,448
If you don't, the audience will watch...

741
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:10,319
a video that proves you're Sim Jun Seok.

742
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,928
("Dear D")

743
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,029
Welcome, everyone.

744
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,129
Thank you all for making the time in your busy schedules...

745
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,929
to celebrate this preview with us.

746
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:30,969
"Dear D"...

747
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,339
was based on a true story.

748
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,810
It's the story of my daughter, Da Mi,

749
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,310
who was killed by Sim Jun Seok of Sungchan Group.

750
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,119
Also...

751
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:48,020
This movie calls out...

752
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,719
a cruel school bully.

753
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,190
I am a producer,

754
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,630
but I'm also an ordinary mom.

755
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,830
So many emotions...

756
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,738
are welling up inside of me right now.

757
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,369
(Everyone was mistaken.)

758
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,179
("Dear D")

759
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,790
K...

760
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,929
- What? Who? - What?

761
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,659
Nothing. I must be mistaken.

762
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
What is it?

763
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:37,469
What?

764
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,170
- Who is that? - What?

765
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,509
It's him, isn't it?

766
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,239
Sim Jun Seok, the son of Sungchan Group.

767
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:46,310
I think so, but that doesn't make sense.

768
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:48,579
Matthew is Sim Jun Seok.

769
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,380
How can there be another Sim Jun Seok?

770
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:52,350
Aren't I right? Hey.

771
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,549
Hey. Wait.

772
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:58,989
("Dear D," The story of the faceless murderer)

773
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:02,489
Oh, my.

774
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:04,928
Look. It's him, isn't it?

775
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:05,929
Catch him!

776
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,670
Stop right there!

777
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,670
What?

778
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,778
("Dear D," Your hair is all wet. You must be cold.)

779
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,080
(It wasn't me. I didn't do it.)

780
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,319
(Do you want to be friends?)

781
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,028
Where did you get the guts...

782
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:34,659
to come meet me alone?

783
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,330
You said you knew who I was.

784
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:40,069
Are you trying to get revenge for Song Ji A or something,

785
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:41,769
Ms. Song Ji Sun?

786
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,169
I'm warning you.

787
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,868
Don't let me hear my sister's name come out of your dirty mouth,

788
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,540
you crazy psychopath.

789
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,310
It must've been hard to hold back your desire to murder.

790
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:53,150
Kill me, just like you killed my sister.

791
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,219
Hurry up and kill me.

792
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,049
Why are you hesitating?

793
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,719
Kill me!

794
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,818
("Dear D")

795
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,560
It's so funny that you're provoking me like this.

796
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,429
Attempting me to kill you...

797
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,429
must be part of your scenario.

798
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,770
Do you think I'm that dumb?

799
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,900
Do you?

800
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:31,880
Today, we have...

801
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,150
Da Mi's classmates...

802
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,159
from Myeongju Girls' High School.

803
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:38,658
Could you please stand up?

804
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:41,389
(Everyone was mistaken until now.)

805
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,199
("Dear D")

806
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,730
Thank you so much for being brave and coming,

807
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,969
Da Mi's friends.

808
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,540
(Everyone was mistaken until now.)

809
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:53,639
Now,

810
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,310
I'd like to welcome the chairman of TIKITAKA...

811
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:58,540
and the true producer of this movie,

812
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:01,048
Chairman Matthew Lee.

813
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:02,409
Please welcome him with a round of applause.

814
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:13,659
Well...

815
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,130
Chairman Lee? Are you not here yet?

816
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,670
Could I come up...

817
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,270
instead of Chairman Lee?

818
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,810
- What? - Who is that?

819
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,250
Well, yes.

820
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:41,049
My apologies.

821
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:43,259
Chairman Lee...

822
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,619
is currently in great shock.

823
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,560
That's why I've come up here in his place.

824
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,860
Right.

825
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,299
I'm Go Myoung Ji. I was Da Mi's homeroom teacher...

826
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:54,600
at Myeongju Girls' High School.

827
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:58,440
You want me...

828
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,310
to dishonor my student again?

829
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,509
I absolutely cannot do that.

830
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,710
You can't?

831
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,009
If so,

832
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,449
divorce Yang Jin Mo...

833
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,790
and give back all of the money you've gotten from me.

834
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,818
With interest, you and your kids...

835
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,690
will have to live on the streets.

836
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,319
Will you be okay?

837
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:22,159
Chairman Lee and I...

838
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:26,100
found out something very significant today.

839
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,830
We finally figured out...

840
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,639
who gave birth to Sim Jun Seok's baby...

841
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:33,940
and framed Da Mi for it.

842
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,679
It was a student named Song Ji A,

843
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:41,080
a school bully at Myeongju Girls' High School...

844
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:43,119
who bullied Da Mi.

845
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,489
Did you see that?

846
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,619
You can never beat me.

847
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,020
Matthew is on my side.

848
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,060
Han Mone.

849
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,759
This is all you have?

850
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,230
The more surprising thing...

851
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,170
is that Song Ji A's older sister...

852
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,999
is Director Michell.

853
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,309
- What? - What did she say?

854
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,738
- Her older sister? - Oh, my.

855
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,909
That's not all.

856
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,310
Director Michell murdered her own father in the past...

857
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,908
and framed her younger sister...

858
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:19,080
who was 13 years old at the time and would be charged as a minor.

859
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,849
Then she was adopted by American parents,

860
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,219
which allowed her to change her identity.

861
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,389
She's despicable.

862
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,089
Song Ji A's bullying behavior and flawed character...

863
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,929
came from the trauma of being abandoned by Director Michell.

864
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,040
You're a piece of trash until the end, I see.

865
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,480
I never planned to release this movie.

866
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,650
What I wanted to do...

867
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,319
was to find evidence that you were Sim Jun Seok.

868
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,019
Thankfully, I captured...

869
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,689
a lot of your true face in my documentary.

870
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,429
You wretched girl!

871
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,469
Accordingly, Chairman Lee...

872
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:10,670
has made a bold decision to cancel the release of "Dear D,"

873
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:13,170
a movie that cost 100 million dollars to produce.

874
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,480
He clearly stated his wish...

875
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,679
to dispose of the movie,

876
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,778
despite great financial loss.

877
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:22,880
("Dear D")

878
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,819
Save me!

879
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:28,389
Save me!

880
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:31,889
Save me! Sim Jun Seok is trying to kill me!

881
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,529
- What is going on? - Oh, my.

882
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:35,528
- Stay away! - Oh, my.

883
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:36,529
- Look! - Michell?

884
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:45,940
Congratulations on becoming the star of my posthumous work,

885
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:47,509
K.

886
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:04,290
- Oh, my. - What happened?

887
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:18,469
This wasn't part of the plan.

888
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,079
- Someone's there. - Who is that?

889
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,009
- Isn't that Matthew? - Matthew.

890
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,980
- He pushed her. - He killed her.

891
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,449
That crazy girl.

892
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,919
- He killed her. - Oh, my.

893
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,488
- It was him. - What did you do?

894
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,959
- What did you do? - Oh, my goodness.

895
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,489
Sir. We made these egg tarts.

896
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:43,999
Gosh. That egg smell. Put it away.

897
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,830
They're very delicious. Please give it a try.

898
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,400
Get lost!

899
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,069
(Warm neighbors, social service, volunteer work)

900
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:52,939
Gosh. Lee Hwi So, that bastard.

901
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,040
He's tormenting me, even from his grave.

902
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,139
Darn it.

903
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,649
- Oh, no. - I think that's Matthew.

904
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,650
- Murderer! - You're a murderer!

905
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:19,199
What?

906
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:22,529
No way.

907
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,839
How could I...

908
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,880
That bastard...

909
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
It's a trap.

910
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,519
There's a guy with Sim Jun Seok's face in here.

911
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,560
Catch that guy.

912
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,029
(Matthew and 6 others)

913
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:51,029
(It's a trap.)

914
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,068
(There's a guy with Sim Jun Seok's face in here.)

915
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:54,069
(Catch that guy.)

916
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,499
I saw him too. It was definitely K.

917
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,738
(I saw him too. It was definitely K.)

918
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:59,599
K? No way.

919
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,170
Matthew is K.

920
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,739
I saw him too. He disappeared like a ghost.

921
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,979
How could that be? What happened with Michell?

922
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,949
I'll personally check whether Michell is dead or not.

923
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,250
What?

924
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,190
Michell disappeared!

925
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:24,929
What?

926
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,130
What happened?

927
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,258
How can I help you?

928
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:52,089
Sim Jun Seok, the serial killer, has appeared.

929
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,389
I need the security camera footage.

930
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,969
You're bleeding a lot.

931
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:07,468
It's okay.

932
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,040
Why did you do something that wasn't in our plan?

933
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,380
You were supposed to stall him until the video started playing.

934
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,480
You could have died.

935
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:18,080
This was the best I could do.

936
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,229
- Oh, no. - He killed her.

937
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,460
- Isn't that Matthew? - Matthew.

938
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,730
- He pushed her. - He killed her.

939
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:32,829
That crazy girl.

940
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,068
- He killed her. - Oh, my.

941
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:36,330
- It was him. - What did you do?

942
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,810
He killed her!

943
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,810
- What's going on? - Oh, no.

944
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,110
What's happening?

945
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:56,020
Even if I die, I won't regret it.

946
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,589
Today's mission...

947
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:01,929
was my last piece of work as a director.

948
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,270
Ji A did what she needed to ask for Da Mi's forgiveness.

949
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,040
So you can...

950
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,179
let go of that burden now.

951
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,448
- It's over for you now. - There they come.

952
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:24,679
Call me a lawyer.

953
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:26,279
It wasn't me.

954
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,889
I didn't do it.

955
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,960
I didn't do it.

956
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,319
Hey! Goodness.

957
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,658
- You killed her. - You murderer.

958
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:35,559
- He killed someone. - Look at him.

959
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,528
- He killed her. - He's a murderer.

960
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:39,129
Murderer!

961
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,798
- Oh, my goodness. - Let's go.

962
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:41,799
What have you done?

963
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:43,540
Oh, it's Matthew!

964
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,198
Wait. Please tell us what happened.

965
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:47,908
- Chairman Lee. - Please make some room for us.

966
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:49,209
Don't just drag me away.

967
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,880
Call my lawyer!

968
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:52,179
Mr. Lee Hwi So.

969
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,479
Sim Jun Seok wasn't found at the scene.

970
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,749
You're under arrest for being caught at the murder scene.

971
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,690
Are you really Lee Hwi So?

972
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,658
Director Michell called you Sim Jun Seok.

973
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,158
Do you have anything to say about that?

974
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,988
They should check his identity again.

975
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:08,888
She definitely called you Sim Jun Seok.

976
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:10,359
- Please tell us what happened. - He must really be a murderer.

977
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,698
Are you a serial killer?

978
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,968
- Please explain. - Please tell us the truth.

979
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:15,099
Tell us.

980
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,100
Wait.

981
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:19,839
This culprit...

982
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,610
isn't Chairman Lee.

983
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,989
As Michell said, the culprit is Sim Jun Seok,

984
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,449
not Chairman Lee.

985
00:57:36,049 --> 00:57:38,659
You'll see from the security camera footage.

986
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:41,230
This video was taken just before.

987
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:53,969
Sim Jun Seok came to kill Director Michell personally.

988
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,040
He took Michell somewhere...

989
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,940
after he killed her...

990
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,409
to stop the movie from being shown.

991
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,080
We saw Sim Jun Seok ourselves.

992
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:06,690
Didn't we?

993
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,130
She's right. I saw him too.

994
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,630
The real Sim Jun Seok appeared at the event today.

995
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,670
But it was his original face without plastic surgery.

996
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,569
I saw him too.

997
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,269
I'm the Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs.

998
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,569
I clearly saw him too.

999
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,639
I'm the chief of the Multi-region Investigation Unit.

1000
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,080
I saw him too.

1001
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,750
Is this the man you saw, Chairman Lee?

1002
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:39,049
Yes.

1003
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:40,650
It was definitely Sim Jun Seok.

1004
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:42,790
Sim Jun Seok without plastic surgery.

1005
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,790
I feel devastated...

1006
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,489
that I couldn't stop the murder,

1007
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:49,330
even though I was at the scene.

1008
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,130
We must've made a mistake.

1009
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:57,540
My apologies.

1010
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:05,339
What was the video earlier?

1011
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,409
The documentary that looked like it was filmed by Director Michell.

1012
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:09,310
That wasn't...

1013
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,319
filmed by Director Michell.

1014
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,880
That was a deepfake video.

1015
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,850
Once again,

1016
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,619
Sim Jun Seok tried to make it seem as if I was Sim Jun Seok,

1017
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,618
just as Chairman Sim Yong did.

1018
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:20,989
CEO Geum La Hui.

1019
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,399
Are you taking back your assertion that Sim Jun Seok...

1020
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,960
underwent plastic surgery to look like Min Do Hyuk?

1021
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:28,529
Yes, I admit it.

1022
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,600
I, too, was fooled by fake news.

1023
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:36,540
Sim Jun Seok did not get plastic surgery.

1024
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,110
Min Do Hyuk is innocent.

1025
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,179
I'm very sorry.

1026
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:46,619
Min Do Hyuk.

1027
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:49,489
This is all I can do for you.

1028
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,860
Chairman Lee.

1029
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,459
What would you like to say to Min Do Hyuk,

1030
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,830
who is still on the run after being mistaken as Sim Jun Seok?

1031
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,230
I can only say sorry.

1032
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:03,969
If Mr. Min Do Hyuk is currently in hiding somewhere,

1033
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:05,440
I'll help recover his honor...

1034
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,710
and use all of the power that TIKITAKA has...

1035
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:10,679
to ensure his safety and livelihood.

1036
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,420
He's already dead anyway.

1037
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:21,388
Serial killer Sim Jun Seok...

1038
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:24,059
committed yet another crime for the first time in a year.

1039
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,459
He appeared at the preview event of the movie, "Dear D."

1040
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,559
Contrary to what is known,

1041
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,059
he appeared without any signs of plastic surgery.

1042
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,559
He pushed Director Michell over the handrail...

1043
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,130
and went into hiding.

1044
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,599
The police will charge him...

1045
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,400
Who was that guy earlier?

1046
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,339
There is no way...

1047
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:42,739
What am I thinking?

1048
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,279
What is this?

1049
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,409
Who dares to pretend to be Sim Jun Seok?

1050
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,429
Long time no see, K.

1051
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,770
Good job.

1052
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:47,739
You revealed me to the world.

1053
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:50,069

I feel bad for Medusa.

1060

Medusa used to be very pretty.

1061
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,610
But she was cursed,

1062
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,139
and her hair turned into snakes.

1063
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,880
But she scared people...

1064
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,279
and did bad things.

1065
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,549
She did those things because she was so lonely...

1066
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,489
from living in hiding because she felt too embarrassed.

1067
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:13,960
