(Remaining time, 2 hours 53 minutes)

7
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,490
- Can you still not find her? - No.

8
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:00,999
Gosh, this is strange. Why isn't it working?

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Hey.

10
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,170
- Where is that brat now? - Well...

11
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,068
(Episode 4)

12
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,199
She isn't showing up.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,940
He must've lied on purpose that he registered her in our system.

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,240
In order to damage the reputation of TIKITAKA's system.

15
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,339
Wait! There she is!

16
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,610
- Look. - What?

17
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,648
(No Han Na)

18
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,550
But there isn't just one location.

19
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,050
What's wrong with it?

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,250
(No Han Na)

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,058

(About us, Find missing child, Register, Report center)

23
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,168
At present, it has been over 12 hours since No Han Na...

24
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,240
- was kidnapped by Sim Jun Seok. - Go in!

25
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:48,440
Neither the police nor TIKITAKA have made much progress.

26
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,309
It is a devastating situation.

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,380
The whole nation is watching in desperation.

28
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,179
(No Han Na)

29
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,058
(No Han Na)

30
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,059
Got it.

31
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,289
This is...

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,999
(Seonjam-ro 28-1)

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,300
That's my vacation home. That darned jerk!

34
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,139
(Remaining time, 25 minutes)

35
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,259
Lee Hwi So?

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,699
It was your doing, indeed.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,068
Someone with that level of skill?

38
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,799
Right, you're the only one.

39
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,269
Thanks for the recognition.

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,139
Finally, there are two of us, Lee Hwi So.

41
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,250
Two?

42
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,479
No.

43
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,220
I'm the only Lee Hwi So on this planet.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,590
All of your family members who can help prove that are dead.

45
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,059
All of the information on Lee Hwi So in Korea's system...

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,389
have been completely switched out to match me.

47
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,929
All you have is that nasty and mangled face of yours.

48
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,000
How will you prove yourself?

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,639
You will be the one to prove yourself, as a fake.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Oh, right.

51
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,978
If you're thinking of using LUCA to get to me,

52
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,079
don't even bother.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,650
LUCA is no longer the AI you created in the past.

54
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,850
It has progressed to become so advanced that you can't touch it.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,220
Do you really think so?

56
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,019
You're just a little punk...

57
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,829
who was nothing without me.

58
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,729
What is this?

59
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,769
Why, you little...

60
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,319
(Sim Jun Seok, tracking location)

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
(Tracking location, Tracking complete)

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
(Location: Seonjam-ro 28-1)

63
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,789
(Police forces dispatched)

64
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,929
Darn, you little...

65
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,249
Lee Hwi So, you jerk...

66
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,979
I will repay you bit by bit...

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,090
the things I've suffered.

68
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,160
It's only the beginning now,

69
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,289
K.

70
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,179
What is it?

71
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
You... You died back then.

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,689
I did.

73
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,160
From a double effort by Geum La Hui and Cha Ju Ran.

74
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,429
- What is he saying? - What?

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,858
Honey, did you perhaps do something to Kang Ki Tak too?

76
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,929
Then, Chairman Bang and Kang Ki Tak...

77
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,470
You killed two?

78
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,970
Were you the man behind Min Do Hyuk?

79
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,739
I should get back what's mine. TIKITAKA.

80
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,169
The world has changed.

81
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,010
No one will believe your words.

82
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,650
I'm sure you don't have the time to hang out like this.

83
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:48,619
We alerted the police that this was K's secret hideout.

84
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,119
Wouldn't your fake hero, who's locked up in there,

85
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,119
be in a sticky spot?

86
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,289
- Hurry up. - What?

87
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:00,799
- Hurry! - Right.

88
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,059
Darn it.

89
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,299
- Matthew! - Chairman!

90
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,498
- Gosh, it's so dark. - Matthew!

91
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,509
- Get the lights. - Where?

92
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,809
Matthew!

93
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,209
- Matthew. - Where is it?

94
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,039
- It's here. - Are you okay?

95
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,150
Over there... Lee Hwi So is over there.

96
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,780
With that punk, Min Do Hyuk...

97
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,950
They're back.

98
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,720
Where?

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,359
No one is here.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,189
He ran away.

101
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,530
That little rat!

102
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,260
Kang Ki Tak was alive too.

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,660
What? Kang Ki Tak?

104
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,570
Those jerks were all alive.

105
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,970
- They were alive! - Matthew!

106
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,100
That's not the problem.

107
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,070
The police are on their way.

108
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,510
If your fingerprints are all over this vacation home,

109
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,609
they'll suspect you.

110
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,080
Those punks intended to reveal my secret hideout to the world!

111
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,589
Teams 2 and 3, move in.

112
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,590
Over.

113
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,259
Surround the entrance.

114
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,859
- Go! - Checkpoint.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,859
What do we do? Hurry up.

116
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,340
What are you doing?

117
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,140
How will we explain that we missed Sim Jun Seok?

118
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:20,639
We have to say that we were ambushed...

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
while trying to catch Sim Jun Seok.

120
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,539
This darned life as an actress...

121
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,809
- Gosh. - What?

122
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,879
Gosh.

123
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,590
Me too?

124
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,460
Get target in sight. Copy.

125
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,070
All of you, hands up!

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,499
Help us.

127
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,280
We came to catch Sim Jun Seok,

128
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,850
but we were ambushed.

129
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,609
Are you all right?

130
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,119
Blood?

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,619
Sim Jun Seok got away.

132
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,419
What about the child? Was she alive?

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,989
I think so.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,859
We couldn't even save the girl.

135
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,189
Sim Jun Seok attacked us!

136
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,530
I'm Chief Nam Chul Woo of the Multi-region Investigation Unit.

137
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,629
Sim Jun Seok ran off upstairs.

138
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,969
Chase after him!

139
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,999
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

140
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,239
We've found No Han Na.

141
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Where are you?

142
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
What?

143
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,010
- My gosh. - Why did you hit me so hard?

144
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,179
Gosh, what's going on?

145
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,319
Hey, there she is!

146
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,649
- Is it No Han Na? - Yes, that's her!

147
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,789
- Han Na, over here! - Han Na!

148
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,919
- Han Na, look here! - This way!

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,988
- It's Min Do Hyuk! - Han Na!

150
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,430
- She's coming out now! - It's Min Do Hyuk!

151
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,059
Han Na, has Sim Jun Seok been holding you hostage?

152
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,859
How did you know where Han Na was?

153
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,258
I tracked down Sim Jun Seok's secret hideout.

154
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,060
And I chased after Sim Jun Seok as he ran away.

155
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,659
After a fierce fight, I managed to save Han Na.

156
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,600
I can honestly say that I'm a good fighter.

157
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,100
All of this was...

158
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,210
thanks to my mom who taught me taekwondo from an early age.

159
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,079
Han Na was able to stay safe...

160
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,609
thanks to the people of Korea who prayed for her with one heart.

161
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,950
Everyone, I implore you.

162
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,090
Please remember Han Na's face.

163
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,519
And protect her from...

164
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,960
the madman, Sim Jun Seok.

165
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,499
This was his plan all along.

166
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,769
So, you want to play the hero?

167
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,739
I'll face you, a fake hero, as another fake hero.

168
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,409
He's trying to make Han Na...

169
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,249
a child that no one can touch.

170
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,279
Why is he doing all that for one little girl?

171
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:15,979
Why?

172
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
No way.

173
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,359
(No Han Na rescued safe and sound after 12 hours of being kidnapped)

174
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,369
Hey.

175
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,439
Find out which hospital No Han Na has been taken to.

176
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,070
- As soon as possible. - Mr. Yang Jin Mo.

177
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,239
Just answer one thing.

178
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,850
Is No Han Na...

179
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:46,810
Matthew's child?

180
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,349
No. Han Na is No Paeng Hee's child.

181
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,920
She will continue to stay that way from now on.

182
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,289
- Over here. - Coming through.

183
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,290
- Please give us a word. - Back up!

184
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,759
- Is Han Na doing okay? - I'm sorry. Please back up.

185
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,528
Don't touch Han Na ever again.

186
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,029
- Is Han Na okay right now? - Mr. Min Do Hyuk.

187
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:08,470
- Let them through. - Chairman Lee.

188
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,299
Min Do Hyuk, the victim of Sim Jun Seok,

189
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,768
saved No Han Na.

190
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,570
What have you done in the meantime, Chairman Lee?

191
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,878
Min Do Hyuk was able to save No Han Na...

192
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,249
because of TIKITAKA's app, Children Home.

193
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,449
I was attacked by Sim Jun Seok, so I couldn't catch him, but...

194
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,748
Do you admit that you let Sim Jun Seok go before your eyes?

195
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,320
If it hadn't been for Min Do Hyuk, we wouldn't have found No Han Na.

196
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,358
Some people are calling the Children Home app useless.

197
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,689
What is your explanation for that?

198
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,629
This case was a heinous crime targeting a young child.

199
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,600
Even if I must use my own money, I promise to...

200
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,930
Watch out!

201
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
- Chairman Lee! - Chairman Lee!

202
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,008
- Can we ask you a few more things? - Could you answer our questions?

203
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,070
Please tell us how you feel right now.

204
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:48,710
- Chairman Lee, just a few more... - Chairman Lee, give us a statement.

205
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:51,778
(No Han Na rescued safe and sound, Children Home unable to help)

206
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,649
What an impressive idea, Min Do Hyuk.

207
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,690
Let's back up Min Do Hyuk too.

208
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,560
The fallen hero, Matthew Lee.

209
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,690
The new hero, Min Do Hyuk.

210
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,228
(No Han Na rescued safe and sound, Children Home unable to help)

211
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,399
Post this on the main page of Save.

212
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,670
And add No Han Na's picture in every article.

213
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:15,440
So that every single person in Korea...

214
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,238
can remember No Han Na's face.

215
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,269
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,119
Where's Han Na? I came to see her.

217
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,388
Out of my way! I must see her.

218
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,960
I will only feel at ease once I see her face.

219
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,129
What right do you have to show up here?

220
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,670
You didn't even care about Han Na.

221
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,509
You.

222
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,810
If you intend to go up against Matthew, just stop.

223
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,850
He's not an opponent you can handle, no matter how much you try.

224
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:03,249
Things have totally changed since a year ago.

225
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,389
Now, if Matthew wishes,

226
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,689
he can even change an angel into the devil.

227
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,720
That's how strong he is.

228
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,559
Oh, is that why you're begging for your life to a jerk like him...

229
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,330
and living like a parasite?

230
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,479
Yes, what is it?

231
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,479
We have to gather at Matthew's house right now.

232
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,479
Okay. I'll be right there.

233
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,519
Hey, go and console him.

234
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,749
Your fake hero must be totally pissed off.

235
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,119
And tell him something for me.

236
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,358
Even if I end up in the fiery pit,

237
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,790
tell K, I promise to take his head with me.

238
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,609
Mister.

239
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,040
Han Na.

240
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,279
Jin Mo.

241
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,489
- Are you okay? Didn't it hurt? - Yes.

242
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,070
Lee Hwi So is different from Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak.

243
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,339
Your existence itself could be in danger.

244
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,170
Shut it. You think I don't know that?

245
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:34,779
- LUCA. - Yes, Chairman?

246
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,850
Log out of all programs starting now.

247
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:39,909
If Lee Hwi So keeps attacking,

248
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,619
you might be critically damaged.

249
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,080
Yes, Chairman.

250
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,090
LUCA is logging out.

251
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,960
How will you fight without LUCA?

252
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,759
We need LUCA to catch Lee Hwi So.

253
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,259
And what if he gets to us?

254
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,930
We have to stop Lee Hwi So accessing LUCA.

255
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,670
In order to reactivate LUCA,

256
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,999
you need Save's security program.

257
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,009
Save's security program?

258
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,440
The reason why I can't hack into Save is...

259
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,148
because of the cutting-edge security program...

260
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,779
developed by Hwang Chan Sung.

261
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,018
It hasn't been commercialized yet,

262
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,850
so Lee Hwi So can never get through that program either.

263
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,320
Isn't that why you kept Mone alive?

264
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,590
Because there's something to steal from Save.

265
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,499
Right.

266
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,479
Ms. Geum.

267
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm really not working with Min Do Hyuk.

268
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:54,119
I've never contacted Min Do Hyuk.

269
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,229
That girl didn't live with my mom because I wanted it.

270
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,999
I've never once thought of that girl as my daughter.

271
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,899
So, please...

272
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,639
Don't hurt my mom.

273
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,440
I guess your mom is precious to you.

274
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Thank you...

275
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,249
for telling me what's most important to you.

276
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,479
What?

277
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,190
Ms. Geum.

278
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,350
Ms. Geum! No!

279
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,420
Wait a minute, Ms. Geum!

280
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,229
Ms. Geum!

281
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:32,989
Ms. Geum!

282
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,200
Ms. Geum! No!

283
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,040
Is it true that Kang Ki Tak and Lee Hwi So are back?

284
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,869
We saw Kang Ki Tak, and Matthew saw Lee Hwi So.

285
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,310
What's going on?

286
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,478
Including Min Do Hyuk, three guys are back...

287
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,879
that we must handle.

288
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,749
Is it Easter Sunday every day?

289
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,080
Oh, my head.

290
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,550
Oh, my head.

291
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,618
On social media right now, "Humiliated Matthew,"

292
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,159
and "Sexy Do Hyuk" are trending already.

293
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:03,988
A poll on Save...

294
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,060
has concluded that Min Do Hyuk is the nation's hero.

295
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,699
People are praising him as the best fighter in Korea.

296
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,369
Save's Hwang Chan Sung is attacking Matthew with ill intentions.

297
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,840
He has always been against TIKITAKA.

298
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,550
Bring her out.

299
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,659
What happened?

300
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,060
Why is Mone like that?

301
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:42,230
Everyone, get a good look.

302
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,469
This is the price you pay for betraying me.

303
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,939
What did Mone do to betray you?

304
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,600
We...

305
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,669
will never betray you.

306
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,570
We're all in the same boat.

307
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,439
Whether we live or die, we do it together.

308
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,850
We have to cover this up with a new issue.

309
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,178
First, we could use the resignation of the mayor of Seoul...

310
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,820
What bigger issue could there be than the appearance of Sim Jun Seok?

311
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,790
Everything else is useless.

312
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,060
Catch Lee Hwi So this instant.

313
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,330
Catch him and bring him before me.

314
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,800
The one who catches Lee Hwi So first...

315
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,830
gets TIKITAKA Hotel.

316
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:20,500
The hotel? The one with an annual sales of a billion dollars?

317
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,469
But how and where will we find Lee Hwi So?

318
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:27,540
Do I even have to tell you how to do your jobs?

319
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,109
If that were the case, why would I keep you around?

320
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,379
You are utterly useless idiots.

321
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,480
What are you doing? Get out there right now!

322
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,919
What are you doing?

323
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,459
- Drag her inside. - Yes, sir.

324
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:55,540
Matthew.

325
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,340
I...

326
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,869
I'm really not working with Min Do Hyuk.

327
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Please.

328
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,980
Please don't hurt my mom.

329
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,780
- Please, Matthew. - Drag her back inside.

330
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,149
Matthew, please.

331
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,219
Not my mom.

332
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,119
Matthew...

333
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,990
Please, Matthew.

334
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,590
Matthew.

335
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,230
First, we have to stop Min Do Hyuk...

336
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,540
from going around and acting like he is Sim Jun Seok.

337
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,469
If we can't catch Sim Jun Seok,

338
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,070
TIKITAKA will continue to be under attack.

339
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,749
I'm Sim Jun Seok. How are we supposed to catch him?

340
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,780
That jerk, Min Do Hyuk.

341
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,189
I've got a good idea.

342
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,959
If he doesn't exist, we can create one and catch him.

343
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,730
We have the perfect person too.

344
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,439
No way.

345
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,080
We should put a huge reward on Sim Jun Seok's head.

346
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,480
The greater, the better,

347
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,109
Enough to make people go crazy.

348
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,149
That's a good idea.

349
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,919
I will...

350
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,820
take Mone.

351
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,760
She's still worth keeping around.

352
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,119
We should use her well.

353
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Remember.

354
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,269
You're still suspected of helping Do Hyuk...

355
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,639
and hiding Han Na.

356
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:15,480
I'll watch your every move.

357
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,280
Who you meet... What you talk about...

358
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,179
Even bathroom trips...

359
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,879
require my permission.

360
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,889
Okay. I understand.

361
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,820
Hwang Chan Sung called quite a few times.

362
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,060
Ask him to meet up.

363
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,399
Your first mission...

364
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,830
is to steal Save's security program from him.

365
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,469
You're to become a swan.

366
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,810
All elegant on the outside,

367
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,609
but paddling endlessly beneath the surface to stay afloat.

368
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,149
A swan.

369
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,149
Prove to us that you have...

370
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,219
a reason to live.

371
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,129
Geum La Hui won.

372
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,859
What do you mean Geum La Hui won?

373
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,730
Mone will die soon.

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,969
Matthew would never let a traitor live.

375
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:15,669
What's all this...

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,409
about Mone betraying us?

377
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,139
Do you know anything?

378
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,810
Wait.

379
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,779
Everyone but I know?

380
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,619
The reason Matthew wants the kid dead.

381
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,389
The reason Min Do Hyuk wants to protect the kid from him.

382
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,590
There's just one.

383
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,260
It's because she's Matthew's kid.

384
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,760
Matthew's kid was alive?

385
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,899
Then did Mone...

386
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
raise her in secret?

387
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,530
No.

388
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,899
It wasn't Han Mone.

389
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,109
Yang Jin Mo. It was you, wasn't it?

390
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:01,820
You left Han Na with Sim Jun Seok's victim.

391
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,979
That's why her mom died,

392
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,119
and that's why you met Mone in secret.

393
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,990
Because you wanted Han Na to remain a secret.

394
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,189
Isn't that it?

395
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:16,600
Quit pretending to be a great detective.

396
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,429
Focus on the mission we're faced with.

397
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Find Lee Hwi So.

398
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:29,080
One thing has become clear from this.

399
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,249
Once Mone dies,

400
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,980
the next target will be you, Yang Jin Mo.

401
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,919
What kind of novel are you writing?

402
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:40,888
Why would he save Matthew's kid?

403
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:41,919
You...

404
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,419
Are you keeping tabs on him?

405
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,689
I see why. He'll soon be Mayor of Seoul,

406
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,358
and that means he'll get promoted,

407
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,729
second only to Ms. Geum.

408
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,169
Second to Geum La Hui?

409
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,740
You're an ambitious one, aren't you?

410
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,070
How did you keep that hidden so far?

411
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:02,709
Leave my store immediately.

412
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Leave?

413
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,080
This used to be my store.

414
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,618
I gave you my list of VIPs, and they're keeping you in business.

415
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:12,990
I didn't get it for free.

416
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,218
I paid extra for it.

417
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,219
Well...

418
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,790
Fine, then.

419
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,399
Support him as best you can.

420
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,230
It won't last.

421
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,570
You're not leaving?

422
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,409
What? I'm leaving too.

423
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,918
Sim Jun Seok's location is yet unknown,

424
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,250
and Chairman Matthew Lee put up a reward of ten million dollars.

425
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,289
- Some say Sim... - He'll cover up his mistake...

426
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,888
by offering a reward for his capture?

427
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:55,059
Can Chairman Lee do as he said...

428
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,529
- and find Sim Jun Seok... - That's so very...

429
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,600
- within a week? - typical of him.

430
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,869
Medusa.

431
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,869
Why haven't you called today?

432
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,479
(Will the 10-million dollar reward capture Sim Jun Seok?)

433
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,109
Everything you said happened.

434
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,810
How did you know?

435
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:15,179
Who on earth...

436
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,050
are you?

437
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Ki Tak.

438
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,510
Ki Tak.

439
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:46,709
Where were you?

440
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,878
I got us dinner.

441
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,949
Where's Ms. Yoon?

442
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:50,379
She's not here?

443
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,189
She was a while ago.

444
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:53,919
Ms. Yoon.

445
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Hang on.

446
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,659
What's that?

447
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,499
I thank you again...

448
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,439
for protecting my Han Na.

449
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,939
I think leaving Mone and Han Na...

450
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:16,510
is the best for my daughter and granddaughter.

451
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,609
One day,

452
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,780
I'll get to see Mone and Han Na again.

453
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,550
I look forward to that day.

454
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,429
We must find her quickly.

455
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,260
If K gets to her,

456
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,659
there is no way he'd let her live.

457
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,669
You check on Mone and her brothers.

458
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,570
I'll check the train station and bus terminal.

459
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:52,550
Your first mission...

460
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,179
is to steal Save's security program from him.

461
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,219
Prove to us that you have...

462
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,320
a reason to live.

463
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,240
How did you find me here?

464
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,300
Darn it.

465
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,840
Will you please stay out of my life?

466
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,810
You got me in a huge mess.

467
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,320
If you hadn't called me, none of this would've happened!

468
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,750
This is just crazy.

469
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,669
Matthew might kill you, Mom.

470
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,709
Please, get out of here.

471
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,639
You must stay alive.

472
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,399
Sorry for not being in touch.

473
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:58,169
As you know, we had some internal issues.

474
00:28:58,969 --> 00:28:59,969
I understand.

475
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,709
Shall we have some wine?

476
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,619
I wanted to meet with you...

477
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,419
to get to know you better.

478
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,389
I heard a lot about it.

479
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,329
To model for Save,

480
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,000
you have to meet with you in person.

481
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,199
I also heard you also cancelled the contract...

482
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,469
if you found out the model lied.

483
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,340
Facts are what I care about.

484
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,609
I'm ready.

485
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,510
Ask me anything.

486
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,449
Your mother.

487
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,320
What is she like?

488
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,119
My...

489
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,560
mother?

490
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,270
Is it a hard question to answer?

491
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,969
No. I'll answer.

492
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,219
What do you think you're doing?

493
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:19,250
My mom.

494
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,490
She's always saying she's sorry.

495
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,230
She always thinks she's below others.

496
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,300
But her love for me...

497
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,830
is sincere.

498
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,428
Weren't you in the news?

499
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:35,438
It said you were Mone's mother.

500
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,439
Why are you here?

501
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,638
Are you here to see Mone?

502
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,969
I am not Mone's mother.

503
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,409
I'm one of the people she donates to.

504
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,810
I was shameless enough to rely on her handouts at my age.

505
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,820
And I...

506
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,790
always denied her.

507
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,230
My mother's name...

508
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,800
is Yoon Ji Sook.

509
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,510
She's penniless, under-educated,

510
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,280
pitiful, and hearing impaired.

511
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,580
The Han Mone you know is a fake.

512
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,169
- Han Cheong Soo. - Yes?

513
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,149
Do you know where your mother is?

514
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,480
No.

515
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:57,719
Take a seat.

516
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,000
I have a feeling...

517
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,570
she sided with Min Do Hyuk.

518
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,770
That really complicates things.

519
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,810
It'll be safe to bring your mother...

520
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
to my house.

521
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:24,080
Of course, I'll keep her very safe.

522
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,909
Will you really?

523
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,280
You bet.

524
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,990
Why would I lie when I care for you so much?

525
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:35,259
Your sister messed up.

526
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,859
Your mother did nothing wrong.

527
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,490
If you hear from your mother,

528
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:39,889
call me right away.

529
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,429
And I'll make sure she can relax.

530
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:45,570
Even if she refuses,

531
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:47,030
you must bring her over.

532
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,969
Yes, sir.

533
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:50,939
Good. Cheers.

534
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:57,379
Get back to work now.

535
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:10,359
The idiot actually believed that?

536
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,759
I need you to take my place and die as Sim Jun Seok...

537
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,100
with your mom.

538
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,899
My dad was trash.

539
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:25,070
He drank, gambled, and had affairs.

540
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,040
Every day, he beat my mom who couldn't even scream for help.

541
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,879
And he took her money.

542
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:37,219
I spent so long running away from Dad's creditors...

543
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,219
that I was two years older than my classmates.

544
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,560
Only after my dad died...

545
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,230
was I able to escape the abuse.

546
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,199
I worked part-time since I was in middle school.

547
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:54,230
I did any work I could get.

548
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,869
But still, we got poorer and poorer.

549
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,040
That's when I made up my mind.

550
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,639
Mom.

551
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,780
Let's move to Seoul.

552
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:08,449
Let's go where no one knows us and start over.

553
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,750
I want to be a singer.

554
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,420
I want to act too.

555
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,659
I'll become the hottest star in the country...

556
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,089
so no one can look down on us.

557
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:22,900
Ten million, 100 million, a billion dollars.

558
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,299
I'll rake in all the money there is.

559
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,500
Until then, I might have to pretend I don't know you.

560
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,339
Do as you wish.

561
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,880
I'm okay with anything.

562
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,009
It's okay.

563
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,150
I'll make lots of money and make you happy, Mom.

564
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,250
I'll make you proud.

565
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,330
From now on, my name is Han Mone, not Han Hui Su.

566
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
"Han Mone?"

567
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:58,770
Han...

568
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,199
Mo...

569
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,830
Ne.

570
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,310
Okay?

571
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,150
Your family is fake too?

572
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:14,549
Yes.

573
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,679
I'm fake, from head to toe.

574
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,589
But do you think you'd be any different?

575
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,489
Can you say for sure you wouldn't have done the same?

576
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,670
I'm a bit confused.

577
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,339
I need time to think.

578
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:01,929
What happened?

579
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,658
Why did he leave already?

580
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:04,659
Did it go wrong?

581
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,610
You had me followed?

582
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,150
I told you...

583
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,949
I'd watch your every move.

584
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,420
He left early due to urgent business.

585
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,759
We'll schedule another meeting. Don't worry.

586
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,279
Mom.

587
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,889
Cheong Soo. It's Mom.

588
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,650
I wanted to see you. I'm glad you called.

589
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,589
I'll go back to the countryside.

590
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,560
I want to see you before I go.

591
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,529
Then come to Kyung Soo's place.

592
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,659
Hanbit Apartment Unit 1007 in Gaepo-dong.

593
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,169
Okay.

594
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,170
See you there.

595
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,469
She's not at the train station or bus terminal.

596
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,839
What about you?

597
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,638
She's not at Mone's place either.

598
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,909
The lights are turned off.

599
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
That's odd.

600
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,119
I can't find her on any CCTV cameras.

601
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,678
You keep looking.

602
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,690
I'll go to Mone's brother's place.

603
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,158
Let's make lots of money, okay?

604
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,330
The weather is amazing today.

605
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,929
It's lovely.

606
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,670
Why does that woman look like that?

607
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,770
Is she homeless?

608
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,439
I guess?

609
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,939
Where's the security guard?

610
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,649
She's ruining our quality of life.

611
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,650
I can't stand it.

612
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,419
Kyung Soo. What's your mom like?

613
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,119
Will she give me a hard time?

614
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,059
I'm warning you. I'll stay away from your family.

615
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,729
The word "mother-in-law" makes me want to puke.

616
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,028
Don't worry. My mom's the hands-off type.

617
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,599
She can't say a word to us.

618
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,659
- Really? - Yes.

619
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,329
She looks dreadful.

620
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,400
- Did you see her shoes? - Keep walking.

621
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,908
Let's make lots of money so we don't end up like that.

622
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:26,909
Okay?

623
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Hurry up.

624
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,459
Where did I see that woman?

625
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,230
I saw her somewhere.

626
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,630
How about we have a beer?

627
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,429
I'll get some.

628
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,429
- Shall I come too? - No. I can manage on my own.

629
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,670
I won't be long.

630
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,239
Mom.

631
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,409
Mom.

632
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,509
- Mister. - Yes?

633
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,449
Did you see someone standing here?

634
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,819
She wore something pink...

635
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,258
Oh, the lady who can't talk?

636
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:17,259
Yes.

637
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,789
Was that your mom?

638
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,230
Yes. Which way did she go?

639
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,600
She went that way.

640
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,630
She stood there for a long time.

641
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,540
Be good to her while she's alive.

642
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,569
Once she's gone,

643
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,139
you can't even if you want to.

644
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,179
Why would she die?

645
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,639
How dare you say something like that?

646
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,750
Where are you, Mom?

647
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,719
Where are you?

648
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:51,659
Mom.

649
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:53,929
Darn it.

650
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Mom!

651
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,869
("Regret")

652
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,279
I looked for you everywhere.

653
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:12,079
I told you to wait outside Kyung Soo's.

654
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,179
Why are you over here?

655
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,508
I saw Kyung Soo already.

656
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:17,548
Come with me.

657
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,019
- I'll take you somewhere. - Where? Why?

658
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
Get in the car.

659
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:23,420
It's fine. Get in.

660
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Hello, sir.

661
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,330
Where shall we go?

662
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,699
I'll send you the address. Bring her over.

663
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:37,339
Bye.

664
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:15,369
(Min Do Hyuk)

665
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:21,110
Can you find my mom for me?

666
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,739
I'm worried something will happen.

667
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,299
As you said,

668
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,029
I gave Mom a sleeping aid.

669
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:21,069
You brought in...

670
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,199
your mom yourself?

671
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,350
What a shame.

672
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,980
You could live for so much longer.

673
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,989
- It's done. - What do you mean?

674
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,000
How exciting. This is so darn exciting.

675
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,040
I haven't felt...

676
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,739
this good in such a long time.

677
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,049
Here you go.

678
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:12,619
Let's see.

679
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
I'll paint them...

680
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,190
really nice for you.

681
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:24,529
Here.

682
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,810
It feels as if I'm finally free...

683
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,279
from that monster for good!

684
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,219
You're evil to the core.

685
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,719
You'll die by Do Hyuk's hand.

686
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,619
Because I'll help.

687
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,750
My gosh.

688
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,719
Did Matthew start killing again?

689
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,389
Who is it?

690
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,190
It's Mr. Han his driver.

691
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,589
No.

692
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:28,860
He died as Sim Jun Seok.

693
00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:31,029
The rest...

694
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,699
is on you, Nam Chul Woo.

695
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:38,639
Faking a body is a piece of cake.

696
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:40,569
Matthew got me...

697
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:43,080
back into the force to help out.

698
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,339
Wait.

699
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,509
Who's that in the back?

700
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,380
- In the back? - What?

701
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:52,480
That is Sim Jun Seok's last victim.

702
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:55,690
You don't need to know who it is.

703
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:58,759
What?

704
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,889
The sun will rise soon.

705
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,199
You must finish up by then.

706
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Hurry!

707
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:09,869
Darn it.

708
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:24,949
Push!

709
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:18,569
We have a news flash.

710
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:21,238
The Yongin police just received...

711
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,980
a letter in Sim Jun Seok's name.

712
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,939
In it, Sim Jun Seok expressed...

713
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,580
his hatred and torment caused by Chairman Matthew Lee...

714
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,519
and announced he'd go out...

715
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,489
in a grand finale with one last offering.

716
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,989
Do Hyuk. Let's wait.

717
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,428
We don't know anything yet.

718
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:41,289
What could you do at the scene?

719
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,460
Something's not right.

720
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,100
I'll see for myself...

721
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,960
whose body it is.

722
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,670
(Deokseon Appliances)

723
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,278
Serial killer Sim Jun Seok was found dead...

724
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,880
at Yongin Reservoir.

725
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,419
Police sent a large team to the reservoir...

726
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,859
near the vacation home Sim had mentioned in his letter...

727
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,290
to search the area.

728
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,258
Four heavy machineries...

729
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:15,258
- and 12 workers were hired... - Sim Jun Seok is dead.

730
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,698
for the initial search.

731
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,028
- Who is it? - After 90 minutes,

732
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:20,169
- The man who died instead. - a car was pulled out.

733
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,528
I wonder.

734
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:22,769
Who could it be?

735
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,440
He was identified as Sim Jun Seok.

736
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,039
Sim was found dead...

737
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,969
- I wonder too. - in the driver's seat.

738
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,138
This just came in.

739
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:33,178
Inside Sim's car that was pulled out of the water,

740
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,249
police found serial killer Sim...

741
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,580
and the body of one other person.

742
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,419
Some speculated it was Director Michell,

743
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,388
but an ID card was found in one of the pockets,

744
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:45,019
identifying the victim.

745
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,330
The deceased is Yoon Ji Sook who was born in 1967.

746
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:50,960
I'll repeat that.

747
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,429
The deceased is Yoon Ji Sook who was born in 1967.

748
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,250
No.

749
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,420
No way.

750
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,159
No.

751
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:49,489
Mom!

752
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,230
No. It can't be.

753
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:04,339
It's not. No way.

754
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,270
No.

755
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,310
Mom...

756
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:10,909
Mom.

757
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
Mom.

758
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,049
Mom.

759
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,650
Mom.

760
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,759
I found Yoon Ji Sook.

761
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,860
Where do I go? I can go right now.

762
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:27,960
Yongin Reservoir.

763
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,460
What?

764
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,369
What did you just say?

765
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,500
Say it one more time.

766
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:38,638
The one who died at Yongin Reservoir...

767
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,810
was Yoon Ji Sook.

768
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,480
The one who died with her was Mone's little brother.

769
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,279
You knew this, didn't you?

770
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,250
You knew this would happen.

771
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,290
Why didn't you stop it?

772
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,659
You killed them.

773
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,100
You killed them. Why?

774
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,130
Why didn't you stop it?

775
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,770
Why didn't you...

776
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,690
Han Mone.

777
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:38,529
It's your turn to feel...

778
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,230
the pain Da Mi went through.

779
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,069
Until your skin burns...

780
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,270
and your bones grind,

781
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,009
I'll let you experience it firsthand.

782
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,488
- It's out! - Move back.

783
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,059
- It's out! - Hurry.

784
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,658
- Hurry and take a picture. - Block them.

785
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:09,699
Mom?

786
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,298
Mom!

787
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:14,299
Did you get it?

788
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,270
Let's carry her out.

789
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:18,500
Mom!

790
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,509
- Mom... - Calm down.

791
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:22,508
- Mom! - Let's move.

792
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:23,509
Mom!

793
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:25,738
Mom!

794
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,509
Please stop.

795
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,580
Hurry up and take a picture!

796
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,949
Mom...

797
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,489
Mom!

798
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,560
Mom! No...

799
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:39,830
Mom...

800
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:50,469
Darn it.

801
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,969
Please leave.

802
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,639
Mom...

803
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:56,778
Mom...

804
00:52:56,779 --> 00:52:58,139
Please don't cross the line.

805
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,350
Wait.

806
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,420
Do Hyuk, stop.

807
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,619
- Do Hyuk! - I'm going to kill him right now.

808
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:08,619
- Let go! - Hold back.

809
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,290
Behaving like this will only spoil everything.

810
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,960
There are people watching.

811
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:15,360
It's my fault. I'm going to kill him.

812
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:20,270
It's not your fault, Do Hyuk.

813
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,600
Only think of Lee Hwi So.

814
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,839
For now,

815
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,969
let's only think of Lee Hwi So.

816
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,809
(TIKITAKA, Seoul City)

817
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,480
(Rest in peace)

818
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,218
- Hello? - Eat.

819
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:20,029
I'm calling from the VIP room of Youngsung Funeral Home.

820
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,860
I need 300 extra orders of food.

821
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,759
Please send it to us fast.

822
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:27,869
Welcome.

823
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,100
Mone didn't show up in the end.

824
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,670
She didn't even show face at her own mother's funeral.

825
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,739
How cruel and scary.

826
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:38,710
You know,

827
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:41,409
it gave me goosebumps to think...

828
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,480
the body in the back was Mone's mother.

829
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:48,319
It's a bloody punishment to give Mone a warning.

830
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:49,619
No.

831
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,360
It's a warning for all of us.

832
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:53,830
Betrayal means...

833
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,369
Myoung Ji.

834
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,868
That kid named No Han Na...

835
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:07,569
I heard she was going to a foster home.

836
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,810
Did you hear anything else?

837
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,339
It's nothing for you to worry about.

838
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,480
You're not eligible anyway.

839
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,810
You don't have a family.

840
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,048
Why am I not eligible?

841
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:18,819
Because I'm not married? I could get married now.

842
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,920
We'll take care of Han Na.

843
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:28,429
It has been settled with Matthew.

844
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,730
What? Who says?

845
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:33,299
No matter what happens this time,

846
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:35,600
I'll protect her, Paeng Hee.

847
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:39,068
Chairman Lee, please say a few words.

848
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,939
Please tell us how you feel.

849
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,408
- Over here. - Could you share your thoughts?

850
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:44,738
- How do you feel? - Please say something.

851
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:46,908
- Please comment. - Chairman Lee.

852
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:48,879
- How do you feel? - Why weren't you at the scene?

853
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,049
Tell us how you feel.

854
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:03,830
I'm sorry...

855
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:06,969
I couldn't stop the accident.

856
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,940
We never imagined...

857
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,299
Sim Jun Seok would go this far.

858
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,569
Where is Han Mone?

859
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,639
Mone is...

860
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,639
I said, where is that wench?

861
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,480
Move!

862
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:28,250
Are you done?

863
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,690
Get lost!

864
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:32,520
Move!

865
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,190
Never seen someone whose mother died?

866
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,400
(Yoon Ji Sook...)

867
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,670
I'm going to kill Han Mone.

868
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,940
(Yoon Ji Sook, please be happy where you are.)

869
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,210
- What is this? - Do you think you're any different?

870
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:52,739
- Move. - You don't have the right.

871
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,310
The one you should be furious about isn't Mone.

872
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,619
It's the one who killed your mom and your brother.

873
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:04,659
My brother?

874
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,330
Are you saying Cheong Soo is dead?

875
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,330
Who did it?

876
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,969
Tell me who it is!

877
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:16,869
Matthew.

878
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,169
(Yoon Ji Sook, we'll never forget you.)

879
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,580
(Lee Hwi So)

880
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:30,719
(Lee Hwi So)

881
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:37,119
(Room 9)

882
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,088
Lee Hwi So?

883
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,330
(Lee Hwi So)

884
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,339
Good work, Min Do Hyuk.

885
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,739
But remember this.

886
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,440
I'm also an assailant who killed Da Mi.

887
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,980
(Lee Hwi So)

888
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,489
Was it Matthew who killed my mom?

889
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,549
Or was it you?

890
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,790
Can I be honest with you?

891
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,989
It was me.

892
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,290
I killed her.

893
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:20,699
Why?

894
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:22,670
Why did you do that?

895
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,369
My mom was innocent.

896
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,969
You don't have to be bad to die.

897
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,610
If you think it's unfair, you can take your best shot at me.

898
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,350
I'll take you on.

899
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:22,529
Han Mone!

900
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:31,500
Don't blame yourself so much.

901
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,670
I may not understand all your reasons...

902
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,339
for leading your life this way.

903
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,080
But even if I were in your shoes,

904
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,619
I might have done the same.

905
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:57,659
Mone!

906
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,069
Drive to the hospital. Hurry.

907
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,670
Come on in, Han Na.

908
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,909
Welcome.

909
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:47,850
Let's try to get along.

910
01:00:48,279 --> 01:00:51,020
We used to go to the same kindergarten before.

911
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,179
Do you remember?

912
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:55,020
You're more famous than my sister.

913
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,388
You're much more beautiful too.

914
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,489
What did you say? I'm going to hit you.

915
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,259
It was tough getting here, wasn't it?

916
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:07,900
What do you like?

917
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:09,830
Is there anything you want to eat?

918
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,690
Have you come to?

919
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,029
I have to go see my mom.

920
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,830
Mom. I have to see Mom.

921
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,239
Calm down. You need rest.

922
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,040
Mom must be waiting for me.

923
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,040
I have to apologize to her.

924
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,080
I have to beg for forgiveness.

925
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,880
That I was crazy.

926
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:57,080
That I was out of my mind!

927
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,420
Come to your senses!

928
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:07,589
Use me if you need to.

929
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:11,230
Make use of me as much as you can...

930
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,029
and try everything you want.

931
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,400
I'll happily become...

932
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:22,839
your puppet.

933
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,460
Enjoy.

934
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,389
It's three dollars.

935
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:45,029
Thank you.

936
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,670
Right. I have to make the delivery.

937
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,069
- Go. - I'll be back.

938
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,020
Wait.

939
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,750
I think you're hot.

940
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,919
- Where are you trying to go? - Wait.

941
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,889
- Stay still. - What's the matter?

942
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,560
- Let's see. - No, not this.

943
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,798
- What is it? - Just snatch it from her.

944
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:20,799
- Hey. - Gosh.

945
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,529
- Is that your boyfriend? - Hold on.

946
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,540
You should go on your way.

947
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:28,969
Just leave. Hey!

948
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,810
Is he crazy?

949
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,980
Hey.

950
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,040
Thank you for your help.

951
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:05,080
Hey, you're bleeding...

952
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:10,819
It's okay.

953
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,819
Please let me pay for the ointment.

954
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:16,589
You can pay me back later when you become successful.

955
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,489
I'll find you to get it,

956
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:22,290
Han Mone.

957
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:25,259
But how do you know my name?

958
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,250
Sim Jun Seok.

959
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:55,630
What is this?

960
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,580
Congratulations!

961
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,909
You look beautiful!

962
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,849
She's remarrying a rich guy.

963
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,420
Does this mean it'll boost her back up to where she was?

964
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,520
It's very like her to do this.

965
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,919
I knew she had a trick up her sleeve.

966
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,730
She nearly drowned, but she's back on her feet now.

967
01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:04,659
Meanwhile, someone's ambitions will only end as a daydream.

968
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:03,860
Get up.

969
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,130
Congratulations.

970
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,239
Your mother must be happy while watching over you.

971
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:22,940
Good job. Come here.

972
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,080
I'm proud of you.

973
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,049
You're struggling so hard to survive.

974
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,460
That's my daughter, Mone.

975
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,889
Now,

976
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,830
you're the only mother I have in this world.

977
01:07:49,929 --> 01:07:50,940
Mom.

978
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,650
From now on,

979
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:09,549
my life will be focused...

980
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,060
on killing you, Geum La Hui.

981
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,200
Darn it.

982
01:09:08,509 --> 01:09:14,549
Thank you for loving Mone.

983
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:17,289
Thank you.

984
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:21,030
Thank you...

985
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:53,620
Bring me an unclaimed dead female within an hour.

986
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,129
Do it as fast as possible.

987
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,449
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

988
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,150
I won't hold back any longer.

989
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,749
Wait.

990
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,190
No matter what happens, coax Mone into coming back.

991
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,620
So this is LUCA?

992
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,758
I've been receiving information from Medusa.

993
01:10:26,759 --> 01:10:28,829
Are you sure doing this...

994
01:10:28,929 --> 01:10:30,429
will give them a big blow?

995
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,660
What happened?

996
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,998
You're promising me Geum La Hui's life, right?

997
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:36,799
You die within a minute upon drinking this.

998
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,870
Now go ahead and beg me to save you.
