00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,919
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,349
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,050
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,689
(Episode 14)

6
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,889
I'm going to kill that punk, Min Do Hyuk.

7
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,440
- Do Hyuk. - Get going right away.

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,539
Do Hyuk!

9
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,380
Yang Jin Mo, that bastard. How dare he try to mess up my plan?

10
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
Darn it.

11
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,390
Min Do Hyuk. You're dead today.

12
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,789
A traffic accident has been reported.

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,130
A police car is coming this way.

14
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,759
What?

15
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,430
LUCA. Delete all of the security camera footage along Highway 7.

16
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,100
I was never here.

17
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,269
Make it look like...

18
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,739
I went straight home from Seoul City Hall.

19
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,069
It is too late.

20
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,380
The police have already acquired a part of the camera footage.

21
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,509
Then delete all of the footage from the cameras nearby!

22
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,609
All the footage containing the crash!

23
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,180
Yes, Chairman Lee. It has been completed.

24
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,150
Now, I just need Yang Jin Mo to die.

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,750
Find out which hospital he was taken to.

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,460
Darn it.

27
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,660
Here.

28
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,139
Please take care of the children.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,798
You can't open the curtains,

30
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,269
and you can't respond if someone comes by.

31
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,269
Nobody will suspect that you came back home.

32
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,009
I'll be back.

33
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,049
It was Yang Jin Mo earlier, right?

34
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,949
I'm sure it was him.

35
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,049
He didn't die for us, did he?

36
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,850
We can't be sure of anything for now.

37
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,029
Call me if something happens.

38
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,030
Okay.

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,929
I feel so bad for Yang Jin Mo.

40
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,699
That poor thing. He finally just got a family.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,979
I never imagined I would owe my life to Yang Jin Mo of all people.

42
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,810
Wait.

43
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,680
Honey. You're covered in cold sweat. What's wrong?

44
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,350
Are you still feeling sick?

45
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,190
Let's go to the hospital.

46
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,888
No, I'm okay.

47
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,889
No.

48
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,160
Honey. Ju Ran.

49
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,059
Wake up. Cha Ju Ran! Honey!

50
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,030
We have an emergency patient! Please move.

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,270
Please open the door.

52
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,070
(Operating Room)

53
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,239
(Operating Room, Restricted Area, Staff Only)

54
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,629
How are you feeling? Are you feeling any better?

55
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,600
You scared me.

56
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,030
You should take some calming pills.

57
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm okay. I don't need them.

58
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,600
Should we ask Mi Young...

59
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,410
to send a doctor over?

60
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,739
I'm a doctor.

61
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,808
I'm a gynaecologist with a 25-year-long career...

62
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,510
who was even selected for "The Best Doctor of Our Time."

63
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,879
I understand my own condition.

64
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,350
Condition?

65
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,270
I'll make you better.

66
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,570
If it gets worse, I'll make money...

67
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,640
and make sure you get better.

68
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,179
I'm going to take care of you...

69
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,379
until the end of my life.

70
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,679
I'm...

71
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,189
pregnant.

72
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,989
What?

73
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,830
What are you saying?

74
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,829
I've delivered babies all my life,

75
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,729
but I've never given birth to one, so I didn't know.

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,070
You're going to be a father.

77
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,140
We're...

78
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,439
going to be parents.

79
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,239
A father?

80
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,460
A father.

81
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:43,400
(Restricted Area, Staff Only)

82
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,850
The patient was just declared brain dead.

83
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:57,020
The heart is able to be transplanted.

84
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,890
Yang Jin Mo is brain dead.

85
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,128
Nice!

86
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,900
We've gotten rid of one annoying rat.

87
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,400
Keep updating me on Min Do Hyuk's movements,

88
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,700
and check Yang Jin Mo's body for yourself, just in case.

89
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:19,840
LUCA.

90
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,609
Call Prime Minister Kang.

91
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,410
(Prime Minister Kang)

92
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:27,580
Oh, Prime Minister.

93
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,320
You're going to ignore my call?

94
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,820
We express gratitude to Mr. Yang Jin Mo,

95
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,229
the brain-dead patient for his organ donation.

96
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,628
We will now begin...

97
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,160
the heart transplant surgery for patient Go Myoung Ji.

98
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,470
Scalpel.

99
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,340
I'll make an incision on the chest.

100
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,910
Matthew caused trouble again.

101
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,979
He tried to kill Mayor Yang.

102
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,220
We'll get dragged in the mud if we don't cut ties with him.

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,049
We need to cut ties as soon as...

104
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,689
If we cut ties, that'll be up to me, Prime Minister.

105
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,799
Gosh.

106
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,600
Hang up.

107
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:20,899
How did you find out a communications network...

108
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,270
was installed in the Gagok District?

109
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,340
Sim Mi Young came by and showed me the evidence.

110
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,280
Why didn't you tell me?

111
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,109
What are you planning to do with that?

112
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,309
Don't act dumb.

113
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,349
Are you really asking because you don't know...

114
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,619
what I'm planning to do with a hacking network?

115
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,759
You really shouldn't have cancelled today's press conference.

116
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,659
Everything was good to go, and you ruined it.

117
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,999
You're going to have to fix it.

118
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,700
How am I supposed to do that?

119
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,399
Politics isn't children's play. I can't just change my mind.

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,409
People will be suspicious.

121
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,269
You'll have to figure it out yourself...

122
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,040
unless you want to die here.

123
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,779
If people find out that I'm Sim Jun Seok,

124
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,090
having one more murder on my hands doesn't change anything.

125
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,959
Unless you want to be my last victim,

126
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,229
you're going to have to be smart.

127
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,330
Okay.

128
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Hold on.

129
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,440
You're the one who needs to die.

130
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,470
I will no longer work with you.

131
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,979
Shoot me if you have the courage.

132
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,450
If I die,

133
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,590
LUCA will expose all information about you.

134
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,388
Everything from the fact that you begged me to bring down...

135
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,729
Seoul Mayor Jang Jin Gu, the next presidential candidate,

136
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,299
to the fact that you gathered members...

137
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
and planned Gagok District.

138
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:01,499
If you want your political life or your actual life to end,

139
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,340
do as you please.

140
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:14,879
From now on,

141
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,920
you can point this gun at Min Do Hyuk.

142
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,659
If you do, I'll take you to the presidential election.

143
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,690
Once you get on the same boat as me, you can't get off.

144
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:27,029
Right.

145
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,229
There's good news.

146
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,430
Yang Jin Mo died.

147
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,239
His heart will be transplanted to his wife.

148
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,670
This means...

149
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,379
we can fabricate the accident, just as we've done so far.

150
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,279
This is a piece of cake for us now.

151
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,149
Well then,

152
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,350
could you call the members again?

153
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,670
Gather for an emergency virtual meeting in an hour.

154
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,899
The host is Chairman Matthew.

155
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:10,399
Tell all members to be present.

156
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,209
Also, put an embargo...

157
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,909
on the news of Mayor Yang's death...

158
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,749
until I order otherwise.

159
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,180
Mayor Yang died?

160
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,719
I confirmed that they just started...

161
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,050
the heart transplant operation for the deceased Seoul Mayor.

162
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,950
Okay.

163
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,659
I'll be right there.

164
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,830
What did you just say?

165
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,460
Yang Jin Mo died?

166
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,869
Who was the culprit?

167
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,070
It was Matthew, that bastard, wasn't it?

168
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,710
I'll have to go there myself to find out the details.

169
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
I'll come with you.

170
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,839
I must see with my own two eyes whether Han Na is safe or not.

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,580
We can't even figure out where they are right now.

172
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,810
I'll go and check first.

173
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,950
Hey.

174
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,119
You killed Yang Jin Mo, didn't you?

175
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Are you insane?

176
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,489
Do you know what you've done?

177
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,229
That's why we need to clean this up together.

178
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,398
If I go down, you go down with me.

179
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
Didn't you know that?

180
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,600
Are you telling me...

181
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,009
to get involved in your crime?

182
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,009
If you don't cooperate, I can't help but doubt you.

183
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,950
Come to my house right away. Let's talk in person.

184
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,249
I have to go see K.

185
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,560
He doesn't seem to trust me after Lee Hwi So's verification.

186
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,190
I'll figure out where Han Na is as well.

187
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Okay.

188
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,279
Be careful.

189
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,810
I will.

190
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,019
(Duration of surgery, current time, duration under anaesthesia)

191
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:12,859
Please inject cardioplegia.

192
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:16,159
Yes. Starting cardioplegia. Injecting 1,500ml.

193
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,149
(Duration of surgery, current time, duration under anaesthesia)

194
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,619
(Operating Room, Restricted Area)

195
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,589
What took you so long?

196
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,528
I almost died from worry.

197
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,930
What happened with Ms. Go?

198
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,658
She's in surgery now.

199
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:50,699
If they had started a bit later,

200
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,800
she would've died before they could even do the transplant.

201
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,170
Did you call the police?

202
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,600
Something is up.

203
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,039
The mayor of Seoul died,

204
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,470
and I haven't seen even one news article about it.

205
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,979
The Prime Minister has really sided with Matthew.

206
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,080
Prime Minister, that bastard.

207
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,350
He told me he would cut ties with Matthew right away.

208
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,979
That deceitful bastard.

209
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,590
Hwang Chan Sung was just called over to Matthew's house.

210
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,529
I removed the bug just in case.

211
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,499
Hwang Chan Sung went to K's house.

212
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,399
He'll follow the Prime Minister's orders.

213
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,040
Things will get chaotic like a storm.

214
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,710
They'll become even more meticulous and deceitful.

215
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,970
We need to come up with a new plan as well.

216
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,609
A plan to get them all at once.

217
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,800
(Secretary Chae: I have checked Yang Jin Mo's body.)

218
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:02,999
Hey.

219
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,810
Don't you know who I am?

220
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,310
How ridiculous.

221
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,680
What do you think you're doing?

222
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,850
I need your cooperation.

223
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,690
Our information may be getting leaked.

224
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,149
Are you suspecting me?

225
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,589
I'm still feeling uneasy about the error with LUCA...

226
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,790
that happened a few days ago.

227
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,790
It can't hurt to be careful.

228
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Everything is clear.

229
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,029
Wait outside.

230
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,129
Let's go in. People are waiting.

231
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,350
The Prime Minister, the Prosecutor General,

232
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,759
the Police Commissioner, the Head of the NIS,

233
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,229
and even the leaders of the ruling party and the opposition party.

234
00:15:58,889 --> 00:15:59,889
Everyone.

235
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,629
This is Save CEO Hwang Chan Sung.

236
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,210
Welcome to the billion-dollar family.

237
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,009
All those who control Korea...

238
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,979
are all gathered here, I see.

239
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,379
By "billion-dollar family,"

240
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,950
are you saying the size of the cartel that will benefit...

241
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,649
from the Gagok District is one billion dollars?

242
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,550
It'll probably be more than that.

243
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,790
As long as we handle the current situation well.

244
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,859
There's no need to be scared.

245
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,430
We're connected by money, a bond stronger than blood.

246
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,799
Stop saying useless things.

247
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Yes, sir.

248
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,399
CEO Hwang.

249
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,868
I asked you to meet us because there was something...

250
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:48,139
I needed you to do.

251
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,450
Tell me, Prime Minister.

252
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,050
They will try...

253
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,019
to fabricate Yang Jin Mo's death in some way.

254
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
Do you think...

255
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,489
they'll make you the culprit?

256
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,060
You're right. They'll frame me as the murderer.

257
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,959
They'll show Mi Young's investment in Gagok District as evidence...

258
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,059
to say that the key player of the illegal cartel...

259
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
was Sungchan Group.

260
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,629
These crazy bastards!

261
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,070
What's your plan?

262
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,469
I want to make...

263
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,810
K's dream come true.

264
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,310
You must already know...

265
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,580
that Mayor Yang died.

266
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,219
I saw you placed the embargo yourself.

267
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,689
Yang Jin Mo's cause of death will be fabricated.

268
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,490
Save will need to manipulate the press.

269
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,199
Do you think that'll be possible?

270
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,639
The accident happened in the middle of the day.

271
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,199
How are we going to keep...

272
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:53,109
Min Do Hyuk, Kang Ki Tak, and the other witnesses quiet?

273
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,379
Why do you think that's impossible?

274
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,309
We have power, authority, and money.

275
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,679
On top of that, we have LUCA.

276
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,179
Go Myoung Ji is having transplant surgery right now.

277
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,520
If the surgery is successful, she'll soon wake up.

278
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,419
How do you plan to appease Go Myoung Ji?

279
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,760
She is also a victim who almost died at your hands.

280
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,100
Do you think I can't handle that woman?

281
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,399
It was concluded that Go Myoung Ji's attacker...

282
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,070
was Baek Ik Ho.

283
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,669
We even got his confession.

284
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,369
I assure you there will be no reinvestigation.

285
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,980
Baek Ik Ho's trial will proceed without issue as well.

286
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,549
The murder of the mayor of Seoul is a big case.

287
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,980
We'll need it to be wrapped up without people getting suspicious.

288
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,419
The culprit has already been decided.

289
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,590
Min Do Hyuk.

290
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,459
In order to make this happen,

291
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:53,699
Save will have to be a reliable supporter for us.

292
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,939
To fabricate Yang Jin Mo's accident without issues...

293
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,070
and to get rid of Sungchan Group for good,

294
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:03,080
we must work together.

295
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:05,149
What do you think?

296
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,750
Will you join us?

297
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,730
If we can make Min Do Hyuk the culprit,

298
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,030
there's no reason for me to hesitate.

299
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Are you crazy?

300
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,469
Do you plan to go to jail or something?

301
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,839
What if you really ruin your life?

302
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,409
If the police have me in custody,

303
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:37,280
they'll let their guards down and fabricate the accident.

304
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,608
All those linked together by the chains of evil...

305
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,020
will come out one after another.

306
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:42,520
We'll have to wait and see...

307
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,449
who was conspiring while hiding behind K.

308
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,719
I'm going to let them play...

309
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,520
until they show...

310
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,590
who they are.

311
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,730
Are you saying you'll use yourself as bait?

312
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,800
It's time for the tides to fall.

313
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,929
Once the dirty water is gone,

314
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,639
you can see who is swimming naked.

315
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,340
From now on,

316
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,980
it'll be a fight between Sim Jun Seok and me.

317
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,020
Just the two of us.

318
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,969
LUCA.

319
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:33,629
Yes, CEO Hwang.

320
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,419
Bring up the footage...

321
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
of the billion-dollar family meeting.

322
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,219
Yes, sir.

323
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,490
LUCA.

324
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:57,290
Delete my face...

325
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,030
from the footage.

326
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:00,159
Deletion in progress.

327
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,800
That fool.

328
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:13,409
He's so obsessed with killing Min Do Hyuk...

329
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,080
that he hasn't even noticed that I installed a backdoor program.

330
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,850
This makes...

331
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,379
things too easy.

332
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,059
CEO Hwang Chan Sung's face has been deleted...

333
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,659
from the billion-dollar family meeting footage as ordered.

334
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,439
(Sim Yong, Min Do Hyuk)

335
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,480
Prime Minister. Lift the embargo.

336
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,250
We'll now begin our plan to make Min Do Hyuk a murderer.

337
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,090
This is a breaking news.

338
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,218
Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo who disappeared shortly before...

339
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,429
the emergency press conference was found dead.

340
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Police see it as a murder disguised as a car accident,

341
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,829
and following a witness statement,

342
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,070
decided to arrest Sungchan Group's Min Do Hyuk.

343
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,639
First, we'll take hold of the media.

344
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,039
Chairman Lee.

345
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,979
- Are you the witness? - Then we create...

346
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,379
- a trustworthy witness. - Did you see the accident?

347
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:25,709
Mayor Yang and I...

348
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:27,779
were looking into...

349
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,919
the cartel surrounding the Gagok District.

350
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,820
We realized that...

351
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,689
Min Do Hyuk and Sungchan Group were at the core.

352
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,919
Seeing he was cornered,

353
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,730
Min Do Hyuk kidnapped Yang's children and blackmailed him.

354
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,669
I drove after Min as best I could...

355
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,270
and managed to save the mayor's kids.

356
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,070
But I failed...

357
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,070
to save Mayor Yang.

358
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,510
The children were transferred to police custody...

359
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,850
and are at a secure safe house.

360
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,889
This is Min Do Hyuk's wallet we found in Mayor Yang's car.

361
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,159
Other than this,

362
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,689
we recovered various evidence such as hair and fingerprints.

363
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,230
Evidence can be faked.

364
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,260
Get the kids as soon as possible.

365
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,368
Track Cha Ju Ran and Nam Chul Woo.

366
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,530
They'll lead you to them.

367
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes, sir.

368
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,369
Min Do Hyuk.

369
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:28,639
You're now a trapped little mouse.

370
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:32,149
Add to that a slight lie,

371
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,379
it will become perfect.

372
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,619
Save officially announced S-CURI has some issues.

373
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,550
Can you share exactly what they are?

374
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,958
As an online safety expert,

375
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,090
I think S-CURI is nothing but a malicious code.

376
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,359
If you download it,

377
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,500
your phone will become very slow, or it might even reset.

378
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,429
There's a possibility your personal info could get leaked.

379
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,340
Delete it.

380
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:57,909
(Delete application? Yes)

381
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,439
Min Do Hyuk was arrested on suspicion of murder.

382
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,580
There's no way he developed an app with good intentions.

383
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,399
Hello.

384
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,270
Min Do Hyuk.

385
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,939
You're under arrest for suspicion of murdering Yang Jin Mo.

386
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,869
You can remain silent,

387
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,240
and hire a lawyer.

388
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Detective.

389
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,480
What proof do you have?

390
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,619
We have CCTV footage and witness statements.

391
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Let's go.

392
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,520
Why bother with something like this?

393
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,790
I won't run away.

394
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,560
You know better than anyone who's lying.

395
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,060
You should be ashamed.

396
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,030
See you.

397
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,459
You'll be called in for questioning too.

398
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,469
A travel ban will be placed on you.

399
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,570
Don't think of fleeing abroad.

400
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,168
Did you eat?

401
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,198
Aren't you hungry?

402
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,810
There's an awesome bean sprout soup and rice place.

(Gangnam Police Station)

404
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Is it true you killed Mayor Yang Jin Mo?

405
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,178
Did you kill him because...

406
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,549
he scrapped plans to redevelop the Gagok District?

407
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,320
Is Sungchan Group the cartel Mayor Yang mentioned?

408
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:19,689
No.

409
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,290
Sungchan Group had nothing to do with any of the said profits.

410
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,259
There's circumstantial evidence...

411
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,530
that Sim Mi Young invested in the Gagok District.

412
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,830
- Is that a fact? - Yes.

413
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,070
Former chairwoman Sim did invest.

414
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,668
Are you admitting to real estate speculation?

415
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,070
Why did you kidnap Mayor Yang's children?

416
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,239
What were you going to do to them if Chairman Lee hadn't saved them?

417
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,509
- That plan... - When did you plan it?

418
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,678
Tell us.

419
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:45,679
Mr. Min.

420
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,809
Any other comments?

421
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,249
- Come on. - Speak up.

422
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,349
Why did you kidnap them?

423
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,419
Do explain.

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,859
Post it on Save's main page.

427
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760

Min Do Hyuk.

Let's meet right now.

437

I have something to tell you.

438
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,780
Why did you want to meet?

439
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,780
I saw Hwang Chan Sung connect to LUCA from home.

440
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,490
How?

441
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,149
That, I don't know.

442
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,260
I tried to log on too but couldn't.

443
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,330
I think he got something important from LUCA.

444
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,889
It must be K's weakness.

445
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,770
LUCA contains details on every crime K committed.

446
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:15,600
Everything from Da Mi's death to Yang Jin Mo's.

447
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,199
Then...

448
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,709
if we reveal LUCA,

449
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,480
we can reveal that K killed Jin Mo.

450
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,480
And prove Do Hyuk's innocence.

451
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,310
But to log onto LUCA,

452
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,850
we need an encrypted password.

453
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:33,290
Only Do Hyuk can figure it out.

454
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,490
We can have him brought to my place.

455
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,990
Even for a short while? Can't that be done?

456
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,230
I'll find a detective we can bribe.

457
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:43,159
K already has full control of the police.

458
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,030
Don't do anything.

459
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,240
Don't contact me either.

460
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,499
The moment Hwang Chan Sung starts to doubt you,

461
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,840
everyone will be in danger.

462
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,139
Do Hyuk won't want that.

463
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,010
No. I'll do anything it takes.

464
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,219
If that's the only way to help Do Hyuk,

465
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,189
I'll get him out somehow...

466
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,490
and sit him at Chan Sung's laptop.

467
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,990
You're not afraid.

468
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,830
If LUCA is exposed,

469
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,869
the whole world will find out...

470
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,840
what you did to Da Mi.

471
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:28,780
You don't mind?

472
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,179

474
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,000
Do you recognize me?

475
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:26,669
Yes.

476
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,070
Do you remember?

477
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,240
You were shot...

478
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,580
by Matthew.

479
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,379
Your heart was severely injured.

480
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,449
I remember.

481
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,359
What about the kids?

482
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:53,730
What about him?

483
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,840
Jin Mo...

484
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:06,540
is with you.

485
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,709
What do you mean?

486
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,070
Nothing...

487
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,409
happened to him, right?

488
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,709
No, right?

489
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,609
Tell me he's fine.

490
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,850
Calm down.

491
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
I can't...

492
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,820
stay here for long.

493
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,550
Matthew has lost his mind and is lashing out.

494
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:58,530
He made Do Hyuk a murderer.

495
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,429
Jin Mo's killer.

496
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,669
Matthew took care of it all...

497
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,369
and organized Jin Mo's funeral.

498
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,080
Calm down. You can't get stressed.

499
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,179
My kids.

500
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,449
Call them for me.

501
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,020
Not now.

502
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,590
What I can say is that they're safe.

503
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,560
I came to tell you that.

504
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,030
No.

505
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,330
My kids.

506
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,030
- Bring them here. - No.

507
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
You can't.

508
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,270
If you're frustrated and angry,

509
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,240
survive however you can.

510
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:50,040
In this fight, surviving is winning.

511
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,550
You need to stay in control.

512
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,750
Only then can you and the kids survive.

513
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,480
Do you know what I'm saying?

514
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:09,729
She woke up.

515
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,000
What? Why didn't you buzz for us?

516
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Ma'am, calm down. Try to relax.

517
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,199
Relax and breathe.

518
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,368
Calm down, Ms. Go.

519
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:21,369
- Ms. Go. - Ms. Go.

520
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:22,779
Do you hear me?

521
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,040
Do you have trouble breathing?

522
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,780
- Check her blood pressure. - Okay.

523
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:42,199
Ki Tak.

524
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,730
- Were you followed? - No.

525
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,928
Secretary Chae handled...

526
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,500
Gagok District's borrowed name accounts.

527
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,438
He holds the key.

528
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,439
What's he up to?

529
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,938
He's contacting everyone involved...

530
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,678
and getting them to do their bidding.

531
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:58,479
It's what they did when Lee Hwi So died.

532
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,250
They're controlling the media with fake news,

533
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:02,319
framing Do Hyuk for murder,

534
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,520
and covering up what they did.

535
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:08,219
In a split second Jin Mo died,

536
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,959
Do Hyuk got arrested,

537
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,889
and the company became a mess.

538
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,590
I can't stand it.

539
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What is it?

540
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,399
What?

541
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:22,869
Okay.

542
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,100
This guy bugs phones.

543
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,609
The police put you on the wanted list.

544
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:32,208
For burying a network under Gagok District.

545
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,108
They buried the network.

546
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:35,580
I wish I could behead them all.

547
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,619
They'll find this place soon too.

548
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,050
You must get away.

549
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,889
Go back to Sungchan Group and man the chairman's office.

550
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,119
Fight tooth and nail to keep things going.

551
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,629
Do Hyuk said...

552
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:49,060
evil will be revealed in ten days.

553
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:52,730
It's almost time.

554
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,699
Let's go.

555
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,669
(Suspect Statement)

556
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,208
Where is Kang Ki Tak hiding?

557
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:08,379
Shouldn't you go home?

558
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,949
You've been here for days.

559
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,250
Don't pretend to be calm.

560
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,089
What are you so proud about?

561
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,019
You're worked up because you're ashamed...

562
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,790
that you're working for the likes of Matthew.

563
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,330
You lunatic!

564
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:28,069
What do you know?

565
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,069
You're so darn strong.

566
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,408
Let's be honest. I'm right.

567
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,810
That's why you can't go home.

568
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,310
You're ashamed to face your kids.

569
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,818
Patting their heads with hands that took dirty money.

570
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,218
Kissing their faces with lips that spoke lies.

571
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,889
That fact is just...

572
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,989
- It's torture. - Shut your mouth!

573
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,529
If you have time to mock me, worry about your future.

574
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:55,529
You've become a murderer.

575
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,699
No one will complain if I beat you to death in here.

576
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,170
The country might even rejoice.

577
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:04,699
No.

578
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,369
You could never rejoice.

579
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,739
Because you're a police officer.

580
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:13,679
Nam Chul Woo said...

581
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,349
you'd never fall for any bribe or favour.

582
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,750
That you...

583
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:20,949
could be trusted.

584
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,190
That's the impression I got when I first saw you.

585
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,290
You're not the culprit!

586
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,028
Why would you shoot Go Myoung Ji?

587
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,968
What do you gain from doing this?

588
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,669
You're just Matthew's henchman.

589
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,100
He made you do this, didn't he?

590
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,569
You can sway and waver.

591
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:41,369
But don't break.

592
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,710
I still think...

593
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,949
you're a pretty good police officer.

594
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:50,549
Why was it so noisy in here?

595
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:52,989
Detective Oh.

596
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,389
Are you all right?

597
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,420
Put him back in the cell.

598
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,860
Can we get going?

599
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,298
This afternoon, the prime minister halted...

600
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,770
the trade of Sungchan's shares.

601
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,270
It's yet undecided when trade will resume...

602
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:15,909
They halted trade so soon?

603
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,710
Don't freak out.

604
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,809
We expected this much.

605
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,909
Not like this.

606
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,049
We're here to execute a search and seizure warrant.

607
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,360
Get to it.

608
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:30,759
What?

609
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,389
Take everything you see!

610
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,400
- Wait. - That side too.

611
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,729
- Take this too. - Not that.

612
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,069
We didn't do anything!

613
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,299
(The late Yang Jin Mo)

614
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,079
(The late Yang Jin Mo)

615
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,278
No.

616
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:24,939
(Mayor Yang, may you rest in peace.)

617
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,250
You can't be here.

618
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,589
How could you leave me alone?

619
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,060
What am I to do without you?

620
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,900
How can I manage on my own?

621
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,969
The kids...

622
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,540
I don't want your heart.

623
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,750
I want you back.

624
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,250
What good is this heart...

625
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,589
if I don't have you?

626
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,759
Jin Mo.

627
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,330
Come back to me.

628
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,029
Come back!

629
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,610
Jin Mo...

630
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,719
Can I help you?

631
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,389
I'm Go Myoung Ji.

632
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,429
I want to give a victim statement.

633
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,369
The person who wanted me dead was Chairman Matthew Lee.

634
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,000
That day,

635
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,600
I was in his living room, and he shot me.

636
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,210
I was the detective on that case.

637
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,610
Talk to me.

638
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,110
I...

639
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:11,719
I took Han Na to Matthew.

640
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,819
I felt betrayed by my husband.

641
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,020
But it was all a misunderstanding.

642
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,589
My husband only tried to protect us from Matthew.

643
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:22,960
And now...

644
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:25,929
We have the culprit.

645
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,199
Baek Ik Ho turned himself in.

646
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:34,739
Baek Ik Ho?

647
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,238
He shot you because Mayor Yang...

648
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,908
scrapped plans to develop Gagok District.

649
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:39,909
That's a lie.

650
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,119
Matthew shot me.

651
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:45,920
Baek Ik Ho just moved me.

652
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,989
I remember everything that happened.

653
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,919
I'm the victim.

654
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,630
I have no reason to lie.

655
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,659
You were unconscious for a long time.

656
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,860
Your memory isn't clear.

657
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:01,770
It's not like that! I said I remembered!

658
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,580
Why won't you believe me?

659
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,449
You're a police officer.

660
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:16,119
If you don't help people like me,

661
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,420
who will help me?

662
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,389
The case was transferred to the prosecutors.

663
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,759
I won't talk to you either.

664
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,730
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

665
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,500
I'll talk to the prosecutor.

666
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,639
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

667
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,139
Didn't Go Myoung Ji come to see you?

668
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,679
She did.

669
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,750
I was about to call you.

670
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:49,448
She wants to see the prosecutor.

671
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,449
What shall I do?

672
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,920
The guy's a known weirdo.

673
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,360
You used to be a known weirdo too.

674
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,960
But look at you now.

675
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,690
How cunning have you become?

676
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,199
I'll handle the prosecutor.

677
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,069
You keep an eye on Do Hyuk.

678
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:09,369
I'll call in for a report every hour on the dot.

679
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Okay.

680
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,520
A weirdo prosecutor.

681
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:26,719
They're all the same. How crazy could he be?

682
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Prosecutor General.

683
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,000
I need you to do something for me.

684
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,900
Can you give the case to a prosecutor on our side?

685
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:43,040
You want me to hand over the case? Just like that?

686
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,940
That's perplexing. Whose order is it?

687
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,368
I won't be long.

688
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:49,479
I need to see the prosecutor.

689
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,679
- You can't go in. - Let me in, please.

690
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:55,049
Prosecutor Kang.

691
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:57,449
Bye.

692
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,449
(Prosecution Service)

693
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,389
Are you Prosecutor Kang Ki Joo?

694
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,159
I'm Go Myoung Ji.

695
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,189
Now that I've recovered,

696
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,359
shouldn't you hear from the victim?

697
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,659
The process for that...

698
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,330
Ms. Go?

699
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,868
Yes. I'm Go Myoung Ji.

700
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:14,698
I'd heard about the transplant.

701
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,770
I was waiting for you to recover.

702
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm sorry about what happened to Mayor Yang.

703
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,270
I offer my condolences.

704
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,249
Matthew killed my husband too.

705
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,549
It wasn't Min Do Hyuk.

706
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,948
Matthew tried to kill me,

707
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,449
and he killed my husband too.

708
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,920
I'm the victim and witness.

709
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,719
Why won't you believe me?

710
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:38,989
I'm sorry,

711
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,460
but another prosecutor took the case.

712
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,259
I'm not in charge anymore.

713
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:45,699
What?

714
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:48,770
What do you mean?

715
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,569
I don't know why that is.

716
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,770
I was just informed myself.

717
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:04,679
(Prosecution Service)

718
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,790
This case reeks badly.

719
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,860
It looks like...

720
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,270
you have a hard fight ahead.

721
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,069
I'll help in any way I can.

722
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,900
I swear on my conscience as a prosecutor.

723
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,440
I don't trust prosecutors in this country.

724
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,480
Right now, you'll have to trust me.

725
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,679
The Prosecutor General is behind the other side.

726
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,549
I'll promise you one thing.

727
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,449
I will see this case through to the end, no matter what.

728
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,219
No matter what it takes.

729
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,500
Chairman Lee is waiting for you.

730
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Welcome.

731
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,679
It's so nice to see you looking healthy again.

732

You jerk.

733
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:08,449
I will kill you!

734
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:15,989
You won't make Yang Jin Mo's death mean nothing, will you?

735
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,659
Shut your mouth, you piece of trash.

736
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,389
Isn't Yang Jin Mo the piece of trash?

737
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:24,559
Who was it that made that punk out to be a hero...

738

I don't know anything!

742

I miss them like crazy too.

743
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,380
Do you think it makes sense that you don't know where your kids are?

744
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,909
Even Cha Ju Ran and Nam Chul Woo disappeared too.

745
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,020
You know where they are.

746
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,779
Shut your mouth and bring my husband back to life first.

747
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,150
Why did you kill him?

748
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,719
And then, you framed Min Do Hyuk for it?

749
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:55,529
Aren't you even afraid of the skies, you crazy psychopath?

750
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,060
Stop acting up.

751
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,900
From now on, your kids' fates will change...

752

Do you think I'd be afraid of anything in this situation?

754
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:08,469
As long as I'm alive,

755
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,839
you will never be able to lay a finger on my kids.

756
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,409
I'm warning you.

757
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,618
Let go of Yang Jin Mo's death right here.

758
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,319
Don't think of digging into it anymore.

759
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,190
The murderer is Min Do Hyuk.

760
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,319
If you acknowledge that, you and your kids...

761
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:25,488
will be treated with the utmost courtesy as the family...

762
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,230

Then, I'll have to change the scenario a bit.

765

over the Gagok District.

767
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,448
Then, your kids will have to live with the scar of being the kids...

768

773
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,729
and get shoved in the gutter before they even bloom.

774

00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,790
And your mom and brother too.

914
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,690
All of them.

915
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,600
You must be punished.

916
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,638
You can never take a step outside this house ever again.

917
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,210
You will rot in this house,

918
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:06,980
next to me, for life.

919
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,080
In this room where your mom...

920
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,350
was locked up.

921
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,850
You crazy jerk.

922
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:45,650
You're a total lunatic.

923
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:48,389
Did you just say that to me?

924
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:54,130
Shall I show you what a real lunatic is?

925
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,239
With one phone call,

926
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,509
your mom will die without anyone knowing...

927
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,580
in a place where no one can help her.

928
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,290
Because of her brat of a daughter who didn't keep her promise,

929
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,589
she will die a most miserable death.

930
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,719
Watch it with your own eyes.

931
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,469
No!

932
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,830
No!

933
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,770
Let me go!

934
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,639
Where is Yoon Ji Sook?

935
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,339
Capture her right now.

936
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,080
I will kill that wench myself.

937
01:01:01,529 --> 01:01:02,529
Darn it...

938
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,869
I came here to kill you.

939
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:13,670
I don't care if my life is ruined!

940
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:17,509
But I can't stand you tormenting my mom and Min Do Hyuk anymore.

941
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,679
I've never loved a monster like you, not even for one moment.

942
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:25,880
Please...

943
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:28,989
Please just die!

944
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Darn it...

945
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:44,569
A monster?

946
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,710
Me?

947
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,210
I can't die like this alone.

948
01:01:55,009 --> 01:01:57,080
If I must die, I will die with you.

949
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,719
Because we'll be together forever.

950
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,460
You are going to...

951
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,989
die by Kang Ki Tak's hands without me, anyway.

952
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,299
You didn't know, did you?

953
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:15,900
That jerk is Bang Da Mi's real dad.

954
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:20,969
What?

955
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:23,440
Instead of dying by his hand,

956
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,549
just...

957
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,619
Just...

958
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,889
die with me.

959
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:51,369
Darn it!

960
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,210
Kang Ki Tak, you jerk...

961
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:28,639
I love you.

962
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,719
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

963
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,459
We will have to speed up the investigation now.

964
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,329
In order to swallow the Gagok District whole, that is.

965
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,758
You had to come all the way to my house.

966
01:04:24,759 --> 01:04:25,899
- Where's Mr. Hwang? - He fell asleep...

967
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,000
after taking some medicine.

968
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:28,169
Those who are helping K...

969
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,368
I won't let a single one of them get away.

970
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:32,238
The truth never matters.

971
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:34,568
You should at least seem like a monkey in a zoo...

972
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:37,039
for people to believe that you died out of shame.

973
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,939
This is strange. I can't reach Kang Ki Tak.

974
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,649
I think something is wrong.

975
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,609
You promise to come back?

976
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:44,149
We have to go to Somang Hospital.

977
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,249
Who's there?

978
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,249
You will die, no matter what.

979
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,790
In the way that I want.
