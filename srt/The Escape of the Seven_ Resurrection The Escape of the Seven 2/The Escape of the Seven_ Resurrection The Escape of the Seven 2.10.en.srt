00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,148
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

2
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,888
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,318
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,050
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,140
There's no need to get so worked up.

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,770
What have you done to my mom?

7
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,069
How come she can't even recognize me?

8
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,508
All I did was use some drugs...

9
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,050
to complete your lies.

10
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,149
It was all for your sake.

11
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:30,289
From now on, you must become...

12
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,089
the perfect mother that Mone mentioned.

13
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,270
If you want Mone to be happy,

14
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,440
you should listen to me, right?

15
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,009
That was for my sake?

16
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,919
What on earth is it that you want from me?

17
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,490
Facts.

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,789
What I want are the facts.

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,399
I don't trust women.

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,299
Women always...

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,269
tell lies.

22
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,639
They're only after my money and power.

23
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,810
They don't have an ounce of truth.

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,350
Of course, I'm sure you're different.

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,880
I need a safety catch of my own too, don't you think?

26
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,549
Bring my mom here this instant.

27
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,989
If not, I'm going to kill you.

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,160
Can't you hear me?

29
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,789
Bring my mom here, you psycho jerk!

30
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:46,030
(Episode 10)

31
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,100
This place is a nightmare.

32
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,500
A small and dirty hole in the wall that a person can't live in.

33
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Hey, Do Hyuk.

34
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,609
Ki Tak, Ms. Yoon appeared at the wedding,

35
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,780
but she was in a weird state.

36
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,919
Ms. Yoon Ji Sook?

37
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,190
We found the place where she was locked up too.

38
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,989
As you said, it was inside Hwang Chan Sung's house.

39
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,619
Hwang Chan Sung snuck Ms. Yoon away again.

40
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,630
I'm on their tail.

41
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,960
Okay, be careful.

42
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,060
Hwang Chan Sung is a madman.

43
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,630
Did he find my mom?

44
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,069
Let's get out of here first.

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,169
You hung out with a thug like Min Do Hyuk.

46
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,239
Hasn't your mouth gotten too filthy?

47
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,350
Do you want your mom to die?

48
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,750
If you want, I'll kill her right away.

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
No.

50
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,989
I was wrong.

51
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,689
I must've gone crazy for a minute.

52
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,399
I'll do anything you want.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,829
I'll do anything you tell me to.

54
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,169
Just don't do anything to my mom. Please?

55
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,070
Please.

56
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,669
Your mother has been through so much pain.

57
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,150
Because you met with that piece of trash, Min Do Hyuk,

58
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:42,379
she went through the pain that you should have instead.

59
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,850
I will never meet Min Do Hyuk again.

60
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,489
Really. Believe me, please?

61
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,729
Don't do this.

62
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,738
You've done nothing wrong.

63
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:01,739
This is all...

64
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,609
because of that jerk, Min Do Hyuk.

65
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,179
Don't cry.

66
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,419
Well, then.

67
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:20,660
We should get rid of Min Do Hyuk first, right?

68
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,830
Call that jerk.

69
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,760
To stop following your mother right this instant.

70
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,220
Han Mone, listen up.

71
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:53,150
Hwang Chan Sung has been keeping your mother locked up in his house.

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,919
Stop chasing after my mom.

73
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,960
No, I can catch him right away.

74
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Hello?

75
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,999
Stop it.

76
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Who asked you to find my mom?

77
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,770
Why are you acting out of place and interfering in my business?

78
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,799
Stop it!

79
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,539
Why are you making me repeat the same thing over and over?

80
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,510
You.

81
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,309
Do you perhaps like me?

82
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,350
Is that why you're trying to get my attention like this?

83
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,689
But that's too bad.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,320
A thug like you...

85
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,900
is someone I despise the most in this world.

86
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
So...

87
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,200
stop butting into my life, and get lost!

88
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:44,470
Hwang Chan Sung is by her side.

89
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:49,109
But... I'm helping you right now.

90
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,649
Hey, okay. I get it, Mone.

91
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,748
She's your mother,

92
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,548
so you can find her or not. Do whatever you want.

93
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,549
I'm backing off.

94
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,129
Han Mone. Are you okay?

95
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,369
You did really well.

96
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,570
If you keep listening to me, I won't get angry at you.

97
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,809
And you'll be able to meet your mom soon too.

98
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,919
We can't even go on a honeymoon because of the shoot.

99
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,689
You're very disappointed, aren't you?

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,789
Instead, tonight,

101
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,320
let's spend time in a nice hotel room.

102
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,669
Thank you for coming.

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,139
- Congratulations on your marriage. - Thank you.

104
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,779
- Congratulations. - Your bride is so beautiful.

105
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,978
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

106
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,749
- Congratulations. - You look so pretty.

107
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,449
Congratulations.

108
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,450
Thank you.

109
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,619
Thank you.

110
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,919
I can't get worked up.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,459
As long as Han Na is in Hwang Chan Sung's grasp,

112
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,590
I'm in a weaker position.

113
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,229
If I go at him rashly, Han Na might get hurt.

114
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,769
Speak.

115
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,799
Min Do Hyuk, listen to me carefully.

116
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,799
Hwang Chan Sung took Han Na.

117
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,299
What do you mean?

118
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,109
I gave her away.

119
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,769
The mayoral election is over,

120
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,378
and I've gotten all my use out of her.

121
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,080
There's no need for me to keep holding onto her.

122
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,280
I figured I should let you know.

123
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,290
(Drive slowly)

124
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,639
Oh, Mayor Yang! Are you all right?

125
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,399
Why, you!

126
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,940
It's fine. Head inside first.

127
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,269
But still...

128
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,009
I said it was fine.

129
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,159
What do you think you're doing right now?

130
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,290
Why would you give Han Na to that jerk?

131
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,790
You don't even feel guilty about Madam No, do you?

132
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,659
If only you hadn't been the heir to Sungchan Group's chairman,

133
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,499
Paeng Hee and Han Na would've all been happy.

134
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,340
Everyone has become miserable because of you, you shameless punk.

135
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,440
The reason why K wants you in the mayor's seat...

136
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,680
I know it's because of the Gagok District.

137
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,850
I know all about what K plans to do there too.

138
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:42,979
So what if you know?

139
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,050
You won't be able to stop Matthew anyway.

140
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,720
I've also bet my life on the Gagok District too.

141
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,560
I intend to get as much as I can out of that.

142
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,290
And I'm going to get rid of anything that stands in my way!

143
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,769
Even if Paeng Hee returns from the dead,

144
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:00,070
there won't be any exceptions.

145
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,840
It was only for a little while,

146
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,680
but I had hopes that I could be on the same side as you.

147
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,710
I was a fool.

148
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,920
Try it, then.

149
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,879
I'll aim to win too.

150
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,290
Fine.

151
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,519
Get going.

152
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,899
Min Do Hyuk.

153
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,080
Do you know why I even abandoned Myoung Ji and the kids...

154
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,050
to become the mayor?

155
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,279
Only then could I stop K's monstrous plan...

156
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,190
of owning the Gagok District.

157
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,119
On here,

158
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,489
there's evidence that Hwang Chan Sung met with me.

159
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,460
You'll be able to shake up Hwang Chan Sung with this.

160
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,670
I'm a piece of trash that can't even be recycled,

161
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,499
but even if it's for Myoung Ji...

162
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,369
and the kids...

163
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:19,909
Do Hyuk.

164
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,090
Can a piece of trash like me...

165
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,119
become a dad too?

166
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,139
I can't believe you're my wife.

167
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,239
I'm so happy.

168
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:55,519
I'm sweating a bit.

169
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
Let me go and wash up quickly.

170
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:06,629
It's okay.

171
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,820
It must be something urgent.

172
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,350
You should go and check.

173
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,619
Hang on for a minute.

174
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,029
Who is it?

175
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,440
Mr. Hwang. Something bad has happened.

176
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,009
What is it?

177
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,739
I've committed a grave sin.

178
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,080
The child has disappeared.

179
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,350
How could so many of you lose a little brat?

180
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,050
I thought she was asleep...

181
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,159
and left her alone for a minute.

182
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,359
Do you call that an excuse?

183
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,029
Why are you standing around and not looking for her right now?

184
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

185
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,540
Have you perhaps had any calls from Han Na?

186
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,409
Han Na?

187
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,310
I brought her to the hotel as you told me to.

188
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,820
Has Han Na disappeared, perhaps?

189
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,220
If you happen to hear from Han Na,

190
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,859
call me right away.

191
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,739
Is something the matter?

192
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,300
Is it something bad?

193
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,710
I'm so sorry about this.

194
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,409
Something urgent came up. I'm going to have to step out.

195
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,580
Don't worry about me and go take care of business.

196
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,350
I'll go home.

197
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Okay.

198
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,629
Why aren't you eating?

199
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,499
You like ice cream.

200
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,170
I want to go home.

201
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,479
No.

202
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,310
You're not a member of our family.

203
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:42,519
Then,

204
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,749
where am I going?

205
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,790
The place you originally belonged.

206
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,859
If you go there,

207
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,499
Yang Jin Mo will be the least happy.

208
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,579
From now on, refrain from leaving the house...

209
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,180
other than for your shoots.

210
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,720
This is an order from Mr. Hwang.

211
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,258
(The Ten Commandments of Marriage)

212
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,289
(1. Contacting Min Do Hyuk is prohibited.)

213
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,359
(2. Lying is prohibited.)

214
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,489
This crazy jerk.

215
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,499
I want to be alone.

216
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,898
I've had orders from Mr. Hwang...

217
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,800
never to leave your side.

218
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,950
Will you follow me to the bathroom too?

219
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,619
No, ma'am.

220
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,519
I'll organize your belongings first.

221
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,950
How...

222
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,450
How could he keep a person...

223
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,790
locked up in a place like this?

224
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,350
How could he keep a person locked up in a place like this?

225
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,399
Mone, run away.

226
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,869
I'm okay.

227
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,169
Keep Han Na safe.

228
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Mom.

229
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,050
This is my fault. I'm sorry.

230
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,779
(Mone, run away. I'm okay. Keep Han Na safe.)

231
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,919
Wait just a little.

232
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,419
I'll be sure to find you.

233
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,489
As long as I keep the Ten Commandments,

234
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,760
that jerk won't touch me.

235
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:41,730
I have to go along with him as much as I can.

236
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,600
Only then can Mom and Han Na stay safe.

237
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:48,869
Min Do Hyuk.

238
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,300
You'll help me, right?

239
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,939
You know what it is I'm trying to do.

240
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,379
Please.

241
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,790
Han Mone.

242
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,929
Just stay alive in any way.

243
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,500
As of now,

244
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,830
we will cut off all ties with Mone.

245
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,300
What are you talking about, Do Hyuk?

246
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,399
You want to keep my sister by that jerk's side?

247
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,310
That makes no sense.

248
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,540
We have to rip this jerk to pieces first.

249
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,480
And I will bring Mom and Mone back.

250
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:32,709
Kyung Soo.

251
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:35,980
Right now, believing in your sister...

252
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,388
is the only way to save both your mom and sister.

253
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:40,589
And what if they all die?

254
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,619
No, they won't die.

255
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:43,790
They have someone they must keep safe.

256
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,790
Kyung Soo.

257
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,300
I also believe that Han Mone can handle this.

258
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:00,409
What's the next plan?

259
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
First,

260
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,609
we will bring Han Na.

261
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:07,480
We have to find Go Myoung Ji first.

262
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:18,230
You're like my mother.

263
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,859
How sweet of you to say so.

264
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,969
Be grateful for Chairman Lee's generosity.

265
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,300
Who are you?

266
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,439
It'll be hard for you to fall asleep easily from now on.

267
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,889
You got here later than I thought.

268
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,189
I brought Han Na as you ordered.

269
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,730
You should also keep the promise you made me.

270
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,230
Of course.

271
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,500
As soon as the Gagok District case is resolved,

272
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,270
I'll take care of Yang Jin Mo, nice and neat.

273
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,969
I also need a place to hide for the time being.

274
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,070
I have to protect my kids.

275
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,109
I've already prepared a safe place.

276
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,750
A place that neither Yang Jin Mo nor Hwang Chan Sung can find.

277
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,320
I won't turn down the offer. Bye, then.

278
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Ms. Go.

279
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,619
Did I do something wrong?

280
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,929
Listen to Chairman Lee.

281
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:34,800
Then, you won't have any problems.

282
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:37,668
Ms. Go!

283
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,669
Stay still.

284
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:40,638
- Chairman Lee hates noisiness. - Let go of me.

285
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,639
Let go of me!

286
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,310
Keep her out of my sight as much as possible.

287
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,879
Yes, Chairman Lee.

288
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,320
Let go! I said, let go!

289
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:53,919
I said, let go!

290
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,658
Ms. Go!

291
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:57,659
It's not my fault.

292
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,929
I will never regret this.

293
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:10,000
Ki Tak, I don't think anyone is here.

294
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,010
You should look inside.

295
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:13,939
Okay, Ki Tak.

296
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:28,060
Ki Tak, even the closet is completely empty.

297
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,718
I think they ran away in a hurry.

298
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,159
It's the same for the kids' rooms.

299
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey.

300
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,270
Go Myoung Ji's family has disappeared.

301
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,570
Her cell phone is off too.

302
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,939
Min Do Hyuk. Kang Ki Tak.

303
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,310
What is it today?

304
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,708
I was so excited on my way here after getting your message.

305
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:54,879
What should we do?

306
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,079
- Hey, before that. - Yes?

307
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,379
I have a question.

308
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,389
That woman who came to the wedding was Mone's real mom, right?

309
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:03,389
The body found at the reservoir was someone else, right?

310
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,359
That's right.

311
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,229
See? I told you.

312
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,359
Unexpectedly,

313
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,600
Han Mone's mother appeared.

314
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:13,600
And we will use this to our advantage.

315
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,070
- What? - We're going with plan B.

316
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,069
Is it another spy movie this time? Or a thriller? Horror?

317
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,280
- I'm looking forward to this. - Gosh.

318
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
What?

319
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
What's this?

320
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,919
It's Yang Jin Mo and Hwang Chan Sung.

321
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,149
What?

322
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,349
Do they meet up for meals too?

323
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,889
Spread rumours that they're even closer than that.

324
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,689
We should get things running so that Hwang Chan Sung...

325
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,359
won't be able to keep his head on straight.

326
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:43,030
You two should just start the fire.

327
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,699
Then, this thing called a rumour...

328
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,569
- will spread its wings on its own. - This is a secret.

329
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,240
The sponsor of Mayor Yang Jin Mo...

330
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,510
is Save's Hwang Chan Sung, you know.

331
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,039
Gosh, that makes no sense. Who said so?

332
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,280
Hwang Chan Sung is such a clear-cut man.

333
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,250
I saw it with my own eyes.

334
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,718
Here. The two of them having a meal...

335
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,878
at a luxury restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.

336
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:05,989
It's the CCTV footage. I even took a photo as evidence.

337
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,119
- I was right, weren't I? - The person who hears the secret...

338
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,059
won't be able to keep the secret to himself.

339
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,659
They say Save helped Mayor Yang become the mayor of Seoul.

340
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,629
No way. Save declared that they were neutral.

341
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,330
It was all a lie.

342
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,340
I overheard someone who works for the city talk about it.

343
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:24,969
Really?

344
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,980
That means Hwang Chan Sung sponsors his political funds.

345
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,810
Hwang Chan Sung and Yang Jin Mo...

346
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,780
are from the same hometown.

347
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,050
You're right.

348
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:36,919
The more the word spreads, the harsher and more exaggerated...

349
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:38,519
it becomes.

350
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,649
Do you know what news I heard today?

351
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,688
- Seoul... - The powerful mom blogs...

352
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,118
will delude themselves into thinking...

353
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,389
that they could change the world.

354
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,799
Hwang Chan Sung supported him to become the mayor...

355
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,269
so he could benefit from it.

356
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,199
We can't just sit and watch.

357
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:55,000
We must seek justice.

358
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,840
Please inform the other members of our blog.

359
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,770
When you hear such a thing from an acquaintance,

360
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,240
it boosts its credibility.

361
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,350
Hwang Chan Sung toyed with the algorithm to help Yang Jin Mo.

362
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,819
A friend of mine was a close university friend...

363
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,448
of Save's Hwang Chan Sung.

364
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,149
I heard it from them.

365
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,090
No wonder.

366
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,189
Through macro,

367
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,000
that rumour will be inputted to open chat rooms.

368
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,340
The source of the rumour has to be TIKITAKA.

369
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,480
That way, K and Hwang Chan Sung will be at each other,

370
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,550
and they'll fight more fiercely.

371
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,080
(Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo and "S" portal...)

372
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:47,250
Min Do Hyuk,

373
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:49,020
is this your doing?

374
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,030
Does an enemy's enemy...

375
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,030
make them a friend?

376
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,129
Thanks to him,

377
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,939
I'll get my hands on Save easier.

378
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,608
You asked me to cook the meals myself,

379
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,050
so I worked until dawn.

380
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:15,449
How do you like it?

381
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:16,949
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,290
You don't have to do this anymore.

383
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,149
I'll eat at the office.

384
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,590
I don't mind.

385
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,889
Seeing you put in the effort is good enough.

386
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,590
Just keep it up.

387
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,760
(Secretary Nam)

388
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:32,730
You're getting a call.

389
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,309
Secretary Nam, if it's not urgent...

390
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,409
There's a big problem, sir.

391
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:42,679
There's a tabloid about you and Mayor Yang going around.

392
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,909
"A tabloid?" What's the source?

393
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,378
It's spreading like wildfire through TIKITAKA's S Talk.

394
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,319
There are slandering postings against you and Save flooding...

395
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
on social media.

396
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
TIKITAKA?

397
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,020
All right. I'll be right there.

398
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,659
Min Do Hyuk finally made a move.

399
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,399
It's my turn next.

400
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,129
I have a shoot today.

401
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,330
Is it okay for me to go out?

402
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,399
Do as you wish.

403
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,389
Hwang Chan Sung, it's going to get tough for you.

404
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,419
Stay back.

405
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:32,489
- Mr. Hwang! - Mr. Hwang!

406
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,589
Please make a comment.

407
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,800
- Mr. Hwang! - Mr. Hwang!

408
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,898
Is it true you sponsored Mayor Yang Jin Mo?

409
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,769
A rumour claimed...

410
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,669
Save manipulated the algorithm to post favourable articles on Yang.

411
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,809
Save doesn't manipulate any algorithms.

412
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,168
What about the rumour that claims...

413
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,679
you met Mayor Yang in secret during his campaign?

414
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,050
It's only a stock market tabloid...

415
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,480
and an irresponsible tip-off.

416
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,679
How dare you question me...

417
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,689
just based on rumours?

418
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,560
Here's the evidence. Will you still deny it?

419
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,060
Please fact-check for us.

420
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,029
- Please answer us. - Could you please comment?

421
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,628
- Please say something. - Mr. Hwang!

422
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,928
It'd be best to leave for now.

423
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,468
- Mr. Hwang! - Please say something.

424
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,840
- Is it true? - Mr. Hwang!

425
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,669
Look for a place for me to lie low for a while.

426
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,169
A place reporters can't find.

427
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,270
- Yes, sir. - Mr. Hwang! Please!

428
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,439
Please tell us!

429
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,908
- Do you admit to it? - Where are you going?

430
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,079
- Please explain. - Mr. Hwang!

431
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,579
- Mr. Hwang! - Is the rumour true?

432
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,480
- Did you meet with Mayor Yang? - Mr. Hwang!

433
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,250
Okay, Chan Sung.

434
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,648
I'll tell the reporters you're unwell...

435
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,189
and that you're recuperating.

436
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,159
Don't worry about me and hide well.

437
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,199
We're shooting today, but Han Na isn't around.

438
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,109
- Director. - Hey, Mone.

439
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,279
Thank you for coming to my wedding.

440
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,709
Of course, I should attend.

441
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,280
By the way, our shooting schedule is relaxed.

442
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:01,918
Why did you postpone your honeymoon?

443
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,350
It wouldn't feel right when everyone was working hard.

444
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,049
I can go later.

445
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,619
Well, we can only thank you for being considerate.

446
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,560
Gosh, what happened to your arm?

447
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,230
Gosh.

448
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,230
I fell by mistake.

449
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:17,959
Did you really fall?

450
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,399
Mayor Yang Jin Mo, resign right away!

451
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,540
- Resign! - Resign!

452
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,939
Did you prepare what I asked?

453
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,480
You've turned fearless since becoming the mayor.

454
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,149
You asked for personal chats between citizens.

455
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,219
Who are those punks?

456
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,590
None of your business.

457
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,958
Why did you bother hanging out with Hwang Chan Sung?

458
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,330
It won't do you any good.

459
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,699
Now that you're the mayor,

460
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,899
you should officially start the redevelopment of Gagok District.

461
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,540
Why should I?

462
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,010
People are already in my face telling me to resign,

463
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,240
and you want me to redevelop the problematic Gagok District?

464
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,939
I can't give up the mayor title for something that petty.

465
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,679
But if you still want to move ahead with the project,

466
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,619
bring me 100 million dollars.

467
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,179
"100 million dollars?"

468
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,830
This is why I like you.

469
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,969
You can smell money well.

470
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,929
It's easier to talk this way.

471
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
By the way,

472
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,109
shouldn't you look after Han Na?

473
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,070
Han Na.

474
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:36,810
She's with me right now.

475
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,020
You have Han Na? Not Hwang Chan Sung?

476
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,878
Of course. I'd never give away such a weakness...

477
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:47,119
to a jerk like Hwang Chan Sung.

478
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,030
Where is she right now?

479
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,699
I hid her well in a place no one knows about.

480
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,030
All right.

481
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:03,399
Will this make it easier for us to talk?

482
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,310
Is she safe?

483
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,740
Don't you dare touch a hair on her.

484
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,840
Don't you worry about that.

485
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,149
Just pass over Gagok District to me,

486
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,320
and I'll hand Han Na over to you.

487
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,350
Do you want to pinky swear?

488
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,959
If you don't want to lose Han Na,

489
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:28,090
it'd be in your best interest to get on the project soon.

490
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,529
Sir, the meeting room is this way.

491
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,199
Let's go.

492
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,310
Go Myoung Ji...

493
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,090
There's no need to think about it.

494
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,060
Why should I feel sorry for Han Na?

495
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,500
Guys, should we order fried chicken?

496
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,369
No, I don't feel like it.

497
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,369
What about you, Phillip? Do you want some meat?

498
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,469
Or how about a buffet?

499
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,980
I'm not hungry either.

500
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,080
You're not hungry?

501
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,020
Are you sick?

502
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,149
You eat spicy chicken even when you have a cold sore.

503
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,219
Do you have a fever?

504
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,119
I'm so bored.

505
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,260
This isn't fun at all.

506
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,600
I don't want to swim or go to a buffet.

507
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,429
I miss Dad and Han Na.

508
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:42,270
I'd rather sleep with Han Na...

509
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,770
than sleep at a hotel.

510
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:46,810
So please,

511
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:50,540
can you make up with Dad and bring him back?

512
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,709
I told you, didn't I?

513
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,609
It'll be just the three of us again.

514
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,050
We can be happy all on our own.

515
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,189
But we miss them day after day.

516
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,820
How can we be happy?

517
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,230
Mom,

518
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,359
you're so foolish!

519
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,969
I miss Dad too.

520
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,500
Can't we live together again?

521
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:19,169
I miss Dad's pasta.

522
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,619
Gosh. Slow down.

523
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,119
Hey.

524
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,259
You always eat so much,

525
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,560
so why do you always get beat up by Erica?

526
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,859
Come on, I let her win...

527
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,399
because she's my older sister.

528
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:49,169
Outside of home,

529
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,070
I'm known as a fighter.

530
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,439
Sure.

531
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,480
Since you're a fighter,

532
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,649
you must protect your mom and your sister...

533
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:03,179
if anything ever happens. Got it?

534
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:04,520
Of course I will.

535
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,659
What about you, Dad?

536
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,530
Won't you protect us?

537
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,629
I'm learning how...

538
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:22,899
to do that.

539
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,869
Hurry up and eat.

540
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:29,040
You kicked him out, didn't you?

541
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,609
I hate you.

542
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,409
I like Dad.

543
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,750
Mom and Dad are going to get a divorce.

544
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:41,219
Dad and Han Na aren't coming back,

545
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:42,990

727
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:22,880
we'd like Mr. Hwang Chan Sung to come out...

728
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,440
to explain himself.

729
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,449
If he doesn't, we'll keep on suspecting him.

730
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,079
Why are you getting involved in this case?

731
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,350
What's your relationship with Han Mone?

732
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,560
I was also a victim of the press.

733
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,689
Since I learned Ms. Han Mone might be a victim,

734
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,759
I couldn't sit still.

735
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,298
Since she's a public figure,

736
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:46,199
she's unable to take action on her own.

737
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:48,170
This is a message for Hwang Chan Sung.

738
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,170
I'll give you exactly three hours.

739
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,770
Please reveal to the press that her mother is safe by then.

740
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,940
Don't try to cover it up by saying she went abroad.

741
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,679
There are no records of Yoon Ji Sook leaving the country.

742
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,979
I won't step down until we see her mother.

743
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,350
Please explain the picture to us.

744
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,060
I'm starting to see my brother in him.

745
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,159
He grew up in someone else's hands, but he grew up well.

746
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:16,799
That's my nephew.

747
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,029
This is a message for Hwang Chan Sung.

748
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:22,100
I'll give you exactly three hours.

749
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,699
Please reveal to the press that her mother is safe by then.

750
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:28,139
So this was Min Do Hyuk's plan B.

751
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:30,540
Making Hwang Chan Sung a criminal of domestic violence.

752
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,250
Do you think Hwang Chan Sung will bring my mom?

753
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,360
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

754
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,860
Han Mone...

755
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:56,139
She fooled me and conspired with Min Do Hyuk behind my back.

756
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,540
She'll have to pay for this.

757
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,949
Send Yoon Ji Sook to a country where no one can find her.

758
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
We can't do that.

759
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,719
If she doesn't make an appearance, the suspicion will only grow.

760
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,889
Then there is only one solution.

761
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:19,230
Have her stand in front of the press briefly,

762
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:21,989
then we'll get her on my private jet.

763
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,669
National hero Min Do Hyuk's sudden disclosure made...

764
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,769
the stock prices of...

765
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,198
TIKITAKA and Save plummeted, despite its merger announcement,

766
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:33,310
before the stock closed for the day.

767
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:36,509
- Min Do Hyuk said... - "Domestic violence?"

768
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,710
Hwang Chan Sung, that fool.

769
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:42,250
He's ruining my company.

770
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,860
The only thing I have left now is Gagok District.

771
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
I must...

772
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,790
get my hands on the area no matter what.

773
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,690
Ma'am.

774
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,889
If you just follow my orders,

775
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:27,889
you'll get to see Mone.

776
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
So...

777
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,369
just do what you practiced...

778
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,830
in front of everyone.

779
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Mom?

780
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,560
That crazy bastard!

781
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:07,400
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

782
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,069
I have to crush them!

783
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:11,469
Calm down.

784
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:14,008
Don't act on your own, got it?

785
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:15,270
You can't stop me.

786
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,080
- Mom. - Darn it.

787
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:26,790
Mom!

788
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,069
Help! Help my mom.

789
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,739
Get her!

790
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,589
(Won Eui Foods)

791
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,499
(Won Eui Foods)

792
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,270
(Building scheduled to be demolished for redevelopment)

793
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,060
Where are you going?

794
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,869
Drag her away.

795
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:04,580
I'm going to kill Han Mone.

796
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
Darn it!

797
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:25,100
- Darn it. - It's too dangerous, sir.

798
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,210
I'm only a burden...

799
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,909
on my kids.

800
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,880
Without me, Mone will be free.

801
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:58,869
Mone.

802
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,139
Make sure...

803
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:03,239
you survive.

804
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,850
Mom...

805
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,920
It looks like something happened over there.

806
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,549
- We better check it out. - Okay.

807
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,719
We should get out of here before someone witnesses us.

808
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,630
She'll die at this rate.

809
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,429
What happened?

810
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,710
(Building scheduled to be demolished for redevelopment)

811
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:36,909
Hey...

812
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:43,949
Mom?

813
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,650
Mom!

814
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,060
- Mom! - No.

815
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,659
- No! - Mom, no!

816
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,989
- Mom! It's Mom! - You can't.

817
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,199
No!

818
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:58,259
- Mom! - Mone.

819
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,869
Mom!

820
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Mom!

821
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:05,339
Mom!

822
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:07,339
Mone.

823
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,139
Mone, stay right here. Don't come in no matter what.

824
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:14,710
Hey!

825
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,699
I won't let her die...

826
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,969
like my mom.

827
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:35,100
I won't make that mistake again.

828
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:36,940
I'll make sure...

829
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,040
to save her.

830
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:05,299
Mom...

831
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,799
My mom and little brother are inside.

832
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,000
No...

833
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,069
Move back.

834
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,069
Jae Hyuk.

835
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:33,630
What is this?

836
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,489
What are you doing there?

837
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:38,659
No way.

838
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,830
Min Do Hyuk ran in to rescue her.

839
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,839
- No! Mom! - Stop.

840
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:45,369
Mom...

841
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,770
Let me go.

842
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:48,540
I have to go save Mom.

843
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,810
Let go!

844
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,009
Please...

845
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,089
Ma'am, wake up.

846
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:04,219
Ma'am!

847
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,509
- Mom! - Do Hyuk!

848
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:29,150
- Open your eyes. - Mom.

849
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:30,480
Mom, are you all right?

850
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,319
It's okay.

851
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,600
It's okay.

852
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,739
I think she inhaled a lot of poisonous gas.

853
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,610
She needs treatment right away.

854
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,839
The fire truck will be here in the next five minutes.

855
00:52:58,179 --> 00:52:59,409
Take her to a hospital right away.

856
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:01,279
We'll chase after Hwang Chan Sung.

857
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:02,779
- Okay, leave it to me. - Hurry.

858
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:06,449
Ma'am.

859
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,290
Be careful.

860
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:14,659
Are you okay?

861
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:31,679
You should get going.

862
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,779
She'll be okay.

863
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:37,679
What about you?

864
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,520
Are you okay?

865
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,420
Yes...

866
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,719
I'm fine, of course.

867
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:44,679
What is this?

868
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,549
Aren't you done with cursing?

869
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,449
Apologize to Erica.

870
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,819
I'm sorry for biting and bullying you.

871
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,860
I won't make fun of you again.

872
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,429
You should apologize too, Mom.

873
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,029
I'm sorry.

874
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,739
No parent can keep composure when their child gets hurt.

875
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,810
I was afraid my apartment's price would drop too.

876
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:10,509
You understand me, don't you?

877
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,739
I'm not obligated to understand you.

878
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:14,909
We're tired. Please make way.

879
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,219
Even if that's the case, your husband is too much.

880
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:20,289
He abused his authority to dig into my personal information.

881
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,850
A peasant like me has no power.

882
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:26,560
I was so scared he would wreck my family.

883
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,159
Let's go.

884
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,239
He couldn't have.

885
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:42,239
No way. That's impossible.

886
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,409
He'd never do something like that for us.

887
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,179
Let's go, kids.

888
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,579

889
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,118
for the Gagok District redevelopment tomorrow.

Which company will the city pick?

891
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,388
Everyone's attention is on the result.

892
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,988
Sell all the Gagok District land we own.

893
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:58,989
Great...

894
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,060
What? Sell them?

895
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,529
But they're announcing the construction company tomorrow.

896
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,529
We're about to hit gold!

897
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,869
Do as you're told.

00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
Sir.

900
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,259
You should leave now to make the announcement.

901
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,630
Let's go.

902
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:45,798
- Resign! - Resign!

903
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:47,669
Yang Jin Mo should step down!

904
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,540
Go away!

Currently, we're seeing...

908
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,699
excessive investments being made...

in order to expose the shady individuals...

919
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,589
behind controlling the Korean real estate market.

921
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,569

937
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,610
Yang Jin Mo.

938
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:35,480
You're going to regret this.

939
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,750

943

1003
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,380
I brought this unto myself...

1004
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,949
by working with you.

1005
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,549
Han Na ran away.

1006

Is she alive?

1040
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,119
She's alive. Don't worry.

1041
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,060
I don't think...

1042
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:12,799
I can make it.

1043
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,100
It's shameless of me to ask,

1044
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,040
