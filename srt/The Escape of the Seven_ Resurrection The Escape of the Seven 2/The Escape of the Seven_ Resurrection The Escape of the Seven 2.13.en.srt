00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,148
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

2
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,919
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,218
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,020
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,420
(Episode 13)

6
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,528
(Mom, wake up soon, so we can have tasty food together. Phillip)

7
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,870
(Ms. Go, get well soon. Han Na)

8
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,640
Mom, we went camping.

9
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,780
We ate meat and blew bubbles too.

10
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:16,610
And bang! We played with water guns.

11
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,080
It was so much fun.

12
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,580
Oh, we met a pretty rich lady too.

13
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,990
She says she's a really close friend of yours.

14
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,690
And we promised Dad...

15
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:29,959
that we'd go again with you.

16
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,789
So,

17
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,360
get up soon so we can go camping again.

18
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,369
Hey, No Han Na. Don't you have anything to say?

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,830
Our mom is listening to everything.

20
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,610
Ms. Go.

21
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:49,410
When you told me to be your daughter,

22
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,949
I was so happy.

23
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,080
I can still be your daughter, can't I?

24
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,220
Hey, no!

25
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,589
You can't be Mom's daughter.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,729
Then, you and I can't get married.

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,360
Hey, being a family is even better.

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,130
We can see each other for life.

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,030
For life?

30
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:12,729
For real?

31
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,299
Can we keep living with Han Na?

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,639
I'm so excited!

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Hey, No Han Na. You should be Mom's daughter.

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,350
I'm so excited!

35
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,090
What if we officially adopt Han Na?

36
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,630
Han Na will be starting school soon too.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,060
Let's raise her as our own child.

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,500
I think...

39
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,329
I could really become a good mom.

40
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,210
Get up soon...

41
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,880
so that we can enjoy this happiness together.

42
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,289
Kids, show your mom what you've prepared.

43
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,630
- Okay. - Okay.

44
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,238
- Dashing through the snow - Dashing through the snow

45
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,139
- In a one-horse open sleigh - In a one-horse open sleigh

46
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,039
- O'er the fields we go - O'er the fields we go

47
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,210
- Laughing all the way - Laughing all the way

48
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,979
- Bells on bobtails ring - Bells on bobtails ring

49
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,119
- Making spirits bright - Making spirits bright

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,350
- What fun it is to ride and sing - What fun it is to ride and sing

51
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,210
Ki Tak.

52
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,539
Our plan will continue to go on.

53
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,479
With everyone's hearts as one.

54
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:09,220
We should get back Lee Hwi So's name first.

55
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:12,549
K will become even busier.

56
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,190
There are already groups that are demanding the truth from Matthew.

57
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,559
He will be hellbent on proving that he's Lee Hwi So from now on.

58
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,129
The app is complete too.

59
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,470
Now is the time to reveal the truth about TIKITAKA's secret chat.

60
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,369
Have you decided on a name for the app?

61
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,770
S-CURI.

62
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,279
If you use this app,

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,079
you can find out right away if your secret chat is being spied on.

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,780
You can block the user accessing your chat as soon as you find out.

65
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,749
S-CURI is finally making its way into the world.

66
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:45,919
You've worked hard, Do Hyuk.

67
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,419
No,

68
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,320
Mr. Min.

69
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,689
"Mr. Min?" How cheesy.

70
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,270
I am...

71
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,469
so proud of you.

72
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,739
I haven't done anything.

73
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,438
This was all thanks to Lee Hwi So.

74
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,510
I just...

75
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,580
interpreted Lee Hwi So's secret chat processor.

76
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,580
I wish everyone in this world could know...

77
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,049
just how cool and great he was.

78
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,419
And...

79
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,760
how great a dad he was too.

80
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,470
Ki Tak, you can't get this emotional already.

81
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,299
It's only the beginning.

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,280
There's something I haven't told you.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Da Mi...

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,450
She's my daughter that Geum La Hui gave birth to.

85
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,460
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,999
But Da Mi was Chairman Bang's granddaughter, right?

87
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,030
I only found out recently too.

88
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,169
After Geum La Hui died.

89
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,270
Then, did Geum La Hui trick Chairman Bang?

90
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm sure that was the only way she had back then.

91
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,309
She would've needed money like crazy,

92
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,879
but there wouldn't have been anywhere to get money from.

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,020
- Ki Tak. - I know too.

94
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,590
That Geum La Hui can't be forgiven.

95
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,289
That she's someone who deserves to die in Chairman Bang's eyes.

96
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,489
But...

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm even worse than she was.

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,129
I was the one who made La Hui spiteful.

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,239
All of this began because of me.

100
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,070
I...

101
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,309
If I had only lived honestly...

102
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,309
Ki Tak, don't blame yourself. This wasn't your fault.

103
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,510
I wasn't...

104
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,220
able to meet her while she was alive.

105
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,119
I never once called her name,

106
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,320
ate a meal with her,

107
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,729
or even held her hand.

108
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,970
All I saw...

109
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,369
were her last moments when she was dying alone...

110
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,379
with no one there to help her.

111
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,520
Ki Tak.

112
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,220
The Bang Da Mi that I remember...

113
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,229
was a very brave girl.

114
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
She was so confident.

115
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,070
She was someone who knew how to speak up for herself.

116
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,840
She was very kind too.

117
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,010
Just like you.

118
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,879
Do Hyuk.

119
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,179
You saw her. So, please, tell me.

120
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,919
That my Da Mi...

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,289
wasn't just unhappy.

122
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,059
That she had more happy days.

123
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,200
That it was a good thing...

124
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,999
that she had the best dad in the world...

125
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:20,869
like Lee Hwi So.

126
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,039
Even if I had raised her,

127
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,450
I wouldn't have been able to give her that kind of love.

128
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,899
I'm sorry for inviting you too late, Uncle.

129
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,239
Have you been well until now?

130
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,340
First, please receive my bow.

131
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,279
Gosh, there's no need to bow...

132
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,710
Oh, my...

133
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,550
Gosh.

134
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:10,080
Thank you for finding me like this.

135
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,389
Ever since my parents passed away,

136
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,389
I thought it was a shame that we lost touch.

137
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:16,820
It's so nice to see you like this.

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,399
It was so lonely not to have any family or relatives.

139
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,330
I never got to be an uncle to you. I'm ashamed about it.

140
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,600
Now, I can die in peace.

141
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,040
Don't say that.

142
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,609
We were reunited after so long. You must live for a long time.

143
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,879
He has cancer.

144
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,979
He's been battling his illness for ten years.

145
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,009
Because of that, we sold all of our land.

146
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,119
We have more than 100,000 dollars in debt for medical bills.

147
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,790
Don't worry. I'll take care of it all.

148
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,118
Secretary Chae.

149
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:50,489
Pay off all of their debt with my personal funds.

150
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,930
And move them into the best apartment near their current house.

151
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,359
Yes, I will do so.

152
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,099
My goodness! Is that true?

153
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,470
Goodness, how grateful.

154
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,739
These are our children.

155
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,540
They're all very smart, but they haven't found jobs yet.

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,310
Would you perhaps have any good positions at the company here?

157
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,850
Of course.

158
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,590
Also, my youngest is getting married next month.

159
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,690
Congratulations.

160
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,119
My youngest must have good fortune.

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,330
She met her rich cousin right before her wedding.

162
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,769
Secretary Chae will take care of the wedding preparations as well.

163
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,470
I'm even more grateful for giving me the chance to do my duty.

164
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,909
Then,

165
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,080
could I also ask you to look after our Myeongju Lee clan?

166
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,779
I'm going to die soon,

167
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,080
but our clan has faced its decline.

168
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,279
That weighs on my mind.

169
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,190
The family burial grounds are about to be sold off to pay off debt too.

170
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,489
Darn it, you're having a field day.

171
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,330
You say you're about to die soon, so why do you want so much?

172
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,389
If you lost touch for 40 years, you're as good as strangers.

173
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,899
Of course, I should look after the clan's affairs as well.

174
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,440
Why don't I build you a new office building for the clan too?

175
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,710
That one is our uncle's third son.

176
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,080
He's studying to retake his college entrance exams for the third time.

177
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,350
And he is...

178
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,989
- my nephew's second son. - Hello.

179
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,489
Oh, goodness. Kids.

180
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,158

As an advisor of Sungchan Group,

537
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:47,389
Sorry.

538
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,429

539
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:57,899

541
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,369
What happened?

542
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:03,600
LUCA would never mess up.

543
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,540
That's odd.

544
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:10,708
It was so long ago. I guess I got muddled up.

545
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,709
No.

546
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,550
You could never get this muddled up.

547
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,619
Because Lee Hwi So...

548
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,490
never met Lee Jong Dae.

549
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:26,629
They are complete strangers.

550
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,760
If K uses information from the secret chat,

551
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,330
we can use it against him.

552
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:32,699
How?

553
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,299
We'll feed LUCA fake info.

554
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,439
We can do that much remotely.

555
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,540
There's just one problem.

556
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,810
A warning message will pop up for one minute.

One minute.

558
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,820
Leave it to me. I know someone.

559
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,378

563
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,230
Did LUCA give you false information?

564
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,969
Do you remember who I am?

565
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,500
You said we were all friends.

566
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,969
Hey. The friend who called me a friend.

For my daughter Da Mi, I changed my face...

574
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,290
and started a company. That is my only sin.

575
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,899

From now on, your enemy isn't Do Hyuk.

No.

662
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,130
I'm here to give you a chance.

663
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,130
Prove you're different from K.

664
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,529
Your statement will do it.

Testify Matthew wanted Go Myoung Ji dead.

666
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,369
Then I won't bother you anymore.

667
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:26,549

668
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,380
Evil is ordinary.

669
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,879
If you came to lecture me, stop!

671
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,850
I don't like it.

672
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,619
Before it's too late,

673
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,130
I want you to testify about who was behind Go Myoung Ji's shooting.

674
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,630
Then I'll help you too.

675
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,639
Wherever I hide, Chairman Lee will find and kill me.

676
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,909
We can bring him down first.

677
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:56,110
No. You have no idea...

678
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,609
just how immense his power is.

679
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,549
Or how far he can reach!

680
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,449
As long as they live, I will die.

681
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,119
There's not just one link in the chain of evil.

682
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,060
So...

683
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,589
if you want to live, don't fight Matthew.

684
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,860
That's my last piece of advice.

685
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,170
Tiger.

686
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,020
I got the money for Mom's surgery. Don't worry.

687
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,489
I can send you the tuition and living expenses this week too.

688
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,159
Your big sister will take care of it.

689
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Who are you?

690
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,029
- I'll scream. - Scream.

691
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,569
Who will come? Matthew?

692
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,600
Do you think he can help you?

693
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,509
I know you're doing Matthew's bidding...

694
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,869
to treat your sick mom.

695
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,080
But it's wrong.

696
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,649
As much as you care for your mom,

697
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,080
Go Myoung Ji is someone's precious mom and wife.

698
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,650
Is this the best you can do when you want to save your mom?

699
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,719
What else could I do?

700
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,690
I can't get the money any other way!

701
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,190
What would your mom say if she were to know?

702
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,559
If she were given a new life with money made by doing evil,

703
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,699
would she appreciate it?

704
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
What about your siblings?

705
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,339
Would they want to live and study with a murderer's money?

706
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,639
I hope...

707
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,409
you're not that much of a lowlife.

708
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,089
Baek Ik Ho refused to testify.

709
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:47,790
Go Myoung Ji's helper will testify.

710
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,560
She's with my aunt.

711
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,460
Even now, in order to live,

712
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,159
K will use Da Mi's weakness to escape.

713
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:59,000
We must find just how far...

00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,429
his web reaches.

715
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:07,069
The verification...

716
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,409
won't be a problem, Prime Minister.

717
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,580
You know what I'm capable of.

718
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,549
What is it that you want?

719
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,419
Get the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport...

720
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,190
to make Gagok District a national project...

721
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,830
and get the government to vouch for my identity.

722
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,000
I could've gone straight to the President,

723
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,230
but to save face,

724
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,330
I came to you first.

725
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,409
Do you have to go this far?

726
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,239
Yes. I must do this.

727
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,909
Because I'm about to go down.

728
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,718
The politicians high up...

729
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,420
know I'm Sim Jun Seok and not Lee Hwi So.

730
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,949
And yet, at each election,

731
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,818
you asked me for something...

732
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,219
to use against your opponents.

733
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,859
I'm giving you people a chance...

734
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,560
to help the man who put you in power.

735
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,029
Watch what you say.

736
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,500
Who do you think you're threatening?

737
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:10,170
I'm saying...

738
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,409
we're accomplices.

739
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,909
Without my help, neither you nor the President...

740
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,440
would be where you are now.

741
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:22,549
You don't want us to end up in a small room...

742
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,779
wearing the same clothes with steel bars...

743
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,389
on the windows, do you?

744
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:38,000
Make Gagok District a national project?

745
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:40,529
The government can't tell a mayor what to do.

746
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,670
That's crossing a line.

747
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,000
The order came from the prime minister's office.

748
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,440
If you refuse, MOLIT will jump in.

749
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,409
Change your mind...

750
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,679
and announce you'll build a high-tech complex...

751
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,250
in the Gagok District.

752
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
Don't tell me...

753
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,049
Matthew bought...

754
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,020
you too.

755
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:02,049
Do as you're told, sir.

756
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,619
I'm advising you so you can save your life.

757
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,159
Did you do it on purpose?

758
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,529
You gave me the wrong information.

759
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,000
What are you saying?

760
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:20,069
I'm the one who busted my brain trying to solve the problem.

761
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:23,508
Maybe LUCA suddenly turned stupid.

762
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,580
LUCA would never do that.

763
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,710
It never had such an error.

764
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,879
If Do Hyuk had hacked the system,

765
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,489
a message would've popped up.

766
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:35,420
There was no warning message.

767
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,920
I only read what LUCA showed.

768
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,330
If you're innocent,

769
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,659
prove it.

770
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,259
Share all of Save's data with TIKITAKA.

771
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,029
Then I'll believe you.

772
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,069
Why should I do that?

773
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
I refuse.

774
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,008
I don't care if you believe me or not.

775
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:55,009
Our...

776
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,409
companies merged!

777
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:00,508
Before Do Hyuk gets in our way with his new app,

778
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:02,750
we must take everything we can.

779
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,119
Until the hacking network under Gagok District is complete,

780
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,889
we must help each other!

781
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,619
A hacking network?

782
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,690
How can we help each other when we don't even trust each other?

783
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,730
Have you forgotten?

784
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,969
I have the prime minister's backing.

785
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,969
I even know his weakness.

786
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,409
That's why I can get my hands on the Gagok District.

787
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,880
I'll show you. This time,

788
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,650
Gagok District won't fail.

789
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,659
Matthew built a hacking network under the Gagok District.

790
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,489
I think the prime minister's backing him.

791
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,389
He really did have a backer.

792
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,460
Thanks. Let's stay in touch.

793
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,199
Do Hyuk.

794
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:57,699
We have proof.

795
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,310
It's under the Gagok District.

796
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,710
K buried a hacking network.

797
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,609
Are you sure about that?

798
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,610
I'm sure.

799
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,949
Just in case, call Yang Jin Mo.

800
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,850
I'll go straight to Gagok District.

801
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,380
We must get the proof.

802
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Okay.

803
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:24,000
(Min Do Hyuk)

804
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,670
You can't talk to him.

805
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,009
Chairman Lee will be here soon.

806
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,610
Wait until then.

807
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,710
That's not what you're like.

808
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,350
Why would an aide do this on the government payroll?

809
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,389
Are you bowing to that punk just for money?

810
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,259
If it were just for money,

811
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,389
I'd have quit this idiocy long ago.

812
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,659
I'm being threatened with my family's life.

813
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,460
What choice do I have?

814
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,339
I brought snacks for the kids.

815
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,080
Goodness. Kids.

816
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,489
Ta-da.

817
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,060
Guys.

818
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,388
Ms. Cha is very tired today.

819
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:32,400
Would you mind eating takeout just for one meal?

820
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,969
I'm totally okay with that.

821
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,540
We've been eating stewed beef for days.

822
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,569
I was sick to death of it.

823
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,279
What did you get us?

824
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,080
You're so greedy.

825
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,750
Ms. Cha would feel hurt if she heard that.

826
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,949
I got something Phillip would like.

827
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,789
Pizza, fried chicken, and hamburgers.

828
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,118
- Awesome! - Awesome!

829
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,060
That sounds so good!

830
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,159
- I love it. - Let's eat.

831
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:03,499
Hang on.

832
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,830
(Detective Oh)

833
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:17,739
Detective Oh.

834
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:19,850
What's up?

835
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:22,850
I have bad news. I think Matthew bribed the guards.

836
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:25,679
The kids are in danger. You must get them out of there.

837
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,259
I didn't notice anything odd when I came in just now.

838
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:32,259
What should I do?

839
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,988
Get the kids and move.

840
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:35,290
I'll text you an address.

841
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:36,600
Go there.

842
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,730
Go out the back so the guards don't notice, okay?

843
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay.

844
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:43,639
We'll go now.

845
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,639
- What is it? - Pack for the kids.

846
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,419
Kids. Shall we go somewhere else for a while?

847
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,190
Let's go. It's okay. Come with me.

848
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,889
Is your family doing well?

849
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,299
Is your wife still unconscious?

850
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:12,400
Let me make this clear.

851
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,830
There will be no changes to the Gagok District plan.

852
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,170
I don't care whether the MOLIT or the President gets involved.

853
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,798
I'm going to see this through to the end.

854
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:19,940
So get out of my face.

855
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:24,380
I think you're getting too into playing Mr. Mayor.

856
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,778
You should care about your family too.

857
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:28,310
The kids didn't do anything wrong.

858
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,880
Why do they have to be on the run like that?

859
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:31,619
What?

860
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,790
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

861
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,349
(Detective Oh)

862
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,790
Detective Oh. Put the kids on the phone.

863
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:39,759
Yes, sir.

864
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:44,859
- Dad. - Yang Jin Mo.

865
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,528
- Mr. Yang. - Dad.

866
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:47,529
- Erica. - Dad.

867
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,500
We're all together.

868
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:51,769
- Yang Jin Mo. - Dad!

869
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:52,869
- Dad! - Mr. Yang!

870
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,139
Dad...

871
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:55,440
Detective Oh.

872
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,338
Please let the kids go.

873
00:47:58,339 --> 00:47:59,850
It's enough to hold the two of us as hostages.

874
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,909
How could you lie to me?

875
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,880
I was a police officer too.

876
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,049
How could you betray me like this?

877
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,020
I had no choice either!

878
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,020
I had to protect my family!

879
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,460
You bastard.

880
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,960
If you even put a finger on my kids,

881
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,400
I'm going to crush you to pieces.

882
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,000
Worry about your own life.

883
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:29,909
Don’t be too upset with your secretary.

884
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,850
It's understandable to be scared when your weakness is targeted.

885
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,779
Okay, Mr. Mayor.

886
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:39,589
You should listen to me now, don't you think?

887
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:43,489
Bring back Gagok District to me.

888
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,920
There's no other way for you to negotiate with me.

889
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,130
You don't have time for this. The kids are in danger.

890
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,560
Hurry up and decide.

891
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
The person you reached...

892
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:17,159
Do Hyuk.

893
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:21,189
Cha Ju Ran and Nam Chul Woo have gone missing with the kids.

894
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,029
- When? - I don't know.

895
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,860
I went into the house because the guards were too quiet.

896
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,170
And apparently, they disappeared without anyone knowing.

897
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,139
What is going on?

898
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,210
Do you think those two could have betrayed us?

899
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:38,139
No, there's no way. Something must've happened.

900
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,350
Mr. Min!

901
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,818
Mr. Min.

902
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:45,749
There are rumors that Seoul City will give the Gagok District...

903
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,850
development contract to TIKITAKA!

904
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:50,619
They announced that they would soon have...

905
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,159
an emergency press conference.

906
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,429
Why are they suddenly having a press conference?

907
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,130
The helper is with me.

908
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,400
Did Yang Jin Mo tell you anything?

909
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,299
No, I can't get a hold of him, either.

910
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,509
It's K.

911
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:09,779
K has kidnapped the kids and is threatening Yang Jin Mo.

912
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,850
Fine.

913
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,949
I'll do as you ask.

914
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,790
But I want to see the kids' faces to make sure they're okay.

915
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,389
I don't trust you.

916
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,059
I can't agree to the press conference...

917
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,259
until I see them with my own eyes.

918
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,969
I can do that for you.

919
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,830
Let him video call them.

920
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,310
Kids. Are you okay?

921
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,779
Just wait a little. I'll...

922
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,049
I'll come to get you soon.

923
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,150
Be careful too, Dad.

924
00:50:50,779 --> 00:50:52,080
We're all together,

925
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,250
but you're alone.

926
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,889
We're not scared at all...

927
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,659
because we're with Mr. Nam and Ms. Cha.

928
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:02,460
You know I'm brave, right?

929
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,759
Please stay safe, okay?

930
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,670
We'll be able to see each other soon, right?

931
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,069
Of course, we will.

932
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,239
Don't worry. We'll see each other soon.

933
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,549
Yangju, bridge, steel tower.

934
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,020
Hang up already.

935
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,420
Yangju...

936
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,868
The kids' location. Yangju, bridge, steel tower.

937
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:44,968
Factory. Number 14. Hurry.

938
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:45,969
(We have to find them! Hurry!)

939
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:48,909
(Bridge, steel tower, factory, number 14)

940
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:53,710
I found them.

941
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,480
I'll take off right away.

942
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,479
I'll contact Ki Tak separately.

943
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,989
Please take care of Gagok District in Ki Tak's place.

944
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,589
Okay. Leave it to me.

945
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,219
You must not get hurt.

946
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,290
Gosh.

947
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,630
Gosh. What is he doing?

948
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:11,929
Goodness.

949
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,299
Hey, Mole.

950
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,199
Ki Tak!

951
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,310
- Long time no see. - What brings you here?

952
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,380
Do you still rob graves?

953
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:29,580
I have a favor to ask.

954
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,520
I need to dig up something.

955
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:41,259
I need to find the communication network.

956
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,830
It should be one connected network.

957
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,499
If you find it, I'll pay you a million dollars.

958
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,730
A million?

959
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:48,830
Leave it up to me.

960
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,469
Where are you?

961
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:01,080
Min Do Hyuk. Please save the kids.

962
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:02,549
Please.

963
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,079
(Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo)

964
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,250
The press conference will begin in 30 minutes.

965
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:08,750
The preparations are going well without any issues.

966
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,719
Sounds good.

967
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,889
Shall we start to head over to the conference location?

968
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,969
(Prime Minister)

969
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:24,239
Yes, Prime Minister.

970
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,299
Chairman Matthew.

971
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Is it true that...

972
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:30,739
you installed a hacking network in the Gagok District?

973
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,850
I'm not sure what you mean...

974
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:35,310
Don't lie to me!

975
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,179
I have the picture right in front of me.

976
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,790
Was this why you tried so hard to get Gagok District?

977
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,489
Give up on Gagok District now.

978
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,429
I'm going to cancel the press conference as well.

979
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,259
I'm going to stop it.

980
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,830
Hello? Prime Minister.

981
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:57,900
What is it? Did things not work out the way you wanted?

982
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,199
What...

983
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,239
did you do with Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak?

984
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:08,580
Fine, you bastards.

985
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,679
Let's see things through today.

986
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:22,989
Thank you, Prime Minister.

987
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,759
You take care of things so neatly.

988
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,529
Cutting ties with Matthew as soon as possible...

989
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,940
is necessary if you want to stay in office.

990
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,270
There...

991
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,130
What are you doing? Hurry!

992
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,170
Hurry! Run!

993
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,540
They're escaping!

994
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,549
Hey, Oh Sang Sik. You...

995
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,860
Did you hear the news?

996
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,689
The Gagok District announcement was suddenly canceled.

997
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,790
What happened?

998
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,529
Mone. Listen calmly.

999
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,630
I just found out as well.

1000
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:10,339
Matthew kidnapped Han Na.

1001
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,069
What?

1002
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,310
Where is Han Na right now?

1003
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,080
I'm not sure about that.

1004
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,779
But we'll be able to find her soon.

1005
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,250
I'm doing everything I can.

1006
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:35,389
Sim Jun Seok, that crazy bastard!

1007
00:56:36,389 --> 00:56:37,429
I'm going to kill him.

1008
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:39,659
Calm down, Mone!

1009
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,630
I'm sorry.

1010
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,639
I should've cared more.

1011
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,139
From now on, Sim Jun Seok is my enemy.

1012
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,509
I'm going to crush...

1013
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,380
whoever messes with my family.

1014
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:02,619
It's okay now.

1015
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,199
What happened?

1016
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,799
I'm sorry, Chairman Lee.

1017
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,130
They got away.

1018
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:16,568
Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak somehow found us here.

1019
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,600
What were you doing, letting them get away like that?

1020
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:23,009
Did you put location trackers on the kids?

1021
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,839
Yes, I planted them without anyone noticing.

1022
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,008
I'll go after them right away, Chairman Lee.

1023
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:29,179
Forget it. I'll take care of it now. You stay out of it.

1024
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,949
Chairman Lee.

1025
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,029
Do Hyuk. Chul Woo.

1026
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,008
It's me.

1027
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:56,710
K is tailing your car, and I'm tailing his.

1028
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:03,818
I can see him. Yang Jin Mo.

1029
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:04,819
Are you okay?

1030
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:07,319
Let me talk to him.

1031
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,449
I want to talk to Dad.

1032
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,619
I want to hear Dad's voice too.

1033
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:14,529
Hold on. The kids want to talk.

1034
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,360
- Here. - Mr. Yang.

1035
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,100
Kids. Are you okay?

1036
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,400
Mr. Yang.

1037
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,599
- Dad! - Dad!

1038
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,939
- Mr. Yang. - Yang Jin Mo.

1039
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,170
- Dad! - Yang Jin Mo!

1040
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,779
Hello?

1041
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,319
It's okay. It'll be okay.

1042
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:43,889
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message...

1043
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:51,330
I'm going to kill that punk, Min Do Hyuk.

1044
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:55,270
I have a bad feeling about this.

1045
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,670
He's closing in on us.

1046
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,540
Yang Jin Mo, that bastard.

1047
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:07,940
- Do Hyuk. - Get going right away.

1048
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,040
Do Hyuk!

1049
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,860
Darn it.

1050
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,520
Yang Jin Mo.

1051
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,980
Yang Jin Mo!

1052
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Yang Jin Mo.

1053
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:59,060
You're okay. You're going to be okay.

1054
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,560
I called an ambulance.

1055
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,730
Let's wait a little here. Okay?

1056
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:05,960
I'm glad...

1057
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,230
I saved you guys.

1058
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:11,139
Now I can die in peace.

1059
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:21,750
Why am I so foolish?

1060
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,619
I'm always late.

1061
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:27,889
With Paeng Hee.

1062
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,520
And Myoung Ji too.

1063
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:32,020
I should've shown the kids...

1064
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:35,690
how I felt...

1065
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,130
a bit sooner.

1066
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,830
Yang Jin Mo.

1067
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,569
It's not too late.

1068
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,469
I was an orphan,

1069
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:51,080
but I had a family that I wanted to protect...

1070
01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:58,580
and precious friends who would fight beside me.

1071
01:02:00,589 --> 01:02:02,520
I really made it before I died.

1072
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,159
Yang Jin Mo.

1073
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,730
Stay with me. Jin Mo.

1074
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,360
Do Hyuk.

1075
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:15,799
I'm sorry...

1076
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:19,400
for what I did to your family.

1077
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:23,639
I didn't know...

1078
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,009
what taking a family from someone...

1079
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:29,810
meant at the time.

1080
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:33,350
Should we keep Min Do Hyuk's family alive?

1081
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:34,949
Get rid of both.

1082
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,630
Don't forgive me.

1083
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,230
Live.

1084
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:50,029
Live, Yang Jin Mo.

1085
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,339
Survive...

1086
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,739
Survive this and get punished for it.

1087
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,179
Just walk away from me.

1088
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,179
Just think of yourself.

1089
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:07,290
Also,

1090
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:09,790
I want to give...

1091
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,759
my heart to Myoung Ji.

1092
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,630
Please help me...

1093
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,330
not to be late this time.

1094
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
Please.

1095
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:29,110
Yang Jin Mo!

1096
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,610
Yang Jin Mo!

1097
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,270
Please inject cardioplegia

1098
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,279
(Yang Jin Mo)

1099
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,949
I will remove the heart.

1100
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,259
(Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo)

1101
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,319
Myoung Ji.

1102
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,529
Do you recognize me?

1103
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,060
Yes.

1104
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,469
Do you remember?

1105
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,080
You were shot by Matthew.

1106
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,949
Your heart was severely injured.

1107
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,850
I remember.

1108
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:30,889
What about the kids?

1109
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,060
What about him?

1110
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:43,400
Jin Mo...

1111
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,170
is with you.

1112
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,350
What do you mean?

1113
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,130
Thank you...

1114
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,069
for letting me be a dad in this life.

1115
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,170
- Dad. - Dad.

1116
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:18,739
Yes.

1117
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:20,839
Gosh.

1118
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:22,770
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1119
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,580
Yes. Sleep well.

1120
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,909
Let's go to bed, kids. I'll read you a bedtime story.

1121
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,219
Hey. If you guys don't come to bed,

1122
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,619
I'm going to tell you a ghost story today.

1123
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:39,520
Let's get Erica and Phillip.

1124
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,500
I was so happy...

1125
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,730
that my wife was Go Myoung Ji.

1126
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,298
Goodnight, Dad.

1127
01:07:53,299 --> 01:07:54,310
Dad!

1128
01:07:55,469 --> 01:07:56,639
Let's go.

1129
01:07:57,639 --> 01:07:58,639
Right.

1130
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,639
We'll take the pictures now.

1131
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,240
Oh, my.

1132
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,350
What? Mom's face got red.

1133
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:00,770
(Our...)

1134
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,410
(first family portrait)

1135
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,020
I love you,

1136
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:19,990
my family.

1137
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:46,280
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

1138
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,489
Yang Jin Mo's cause of death will be fabricated.

1139
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:52,489
Save will need to manipulate the press.

1140
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,918
The culprit has already been decided.

1141
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:54,928
Min Do Hyuk.

1142
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:56,659
I want to make K's dream come true.

1143
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,699
Are you crazy?

1144
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,729
Do you plan to go to jail or something?

1145
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,428
Welcome to the billion-dollar family.

1146
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:03,899
We're connected by money, a bond stronger than blood.

1147
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,199
This makes things too easy.

1148
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,369
If you're frustrated and angry, survive however you can.

1149
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,740
Surviving is winning.

1150
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,208
We'll now begin our plan to make Min Do Hyuk a murderer.

1151
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:13,309
Don't do anything.

1152
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,678
The moment Hwang Chan Sung starts to doubt you,

1153
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:15,879
everyone will be in danger.

1154
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,079
Mone.

1155
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,150
You know that I love you a lot, don't you?
