00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:48,148
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

2
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,989
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,288
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,950
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,789
(Episode 7)

6
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,959
Let me ask you one more time.

7
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,770
Who were you with earlier?

8
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,500
I'll ask you for the last time.

9
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,300
Why...

10
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,640
did you meet with Do Hyuk?

11
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,780
Were you tailing me?

12
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:07,899
All right.

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,129
Let me repeat the rules.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,130
One...

15
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:24,579
Get up.

16
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,659
Don't you dare touch my man.

17
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,000
Stop acting like a thug!

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,470
Are you okay?

19
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,900
You're bleeding.

20
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,280
I told you to stay out of my sight.

21
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,609
Should I report you for stalking me and breaking and entering?

22
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,949
Do you need to be humiliated to come to your senses?

23
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,389
It's you who needs to come to her senses.

24
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,130
I'm sorry for ruining our dinner.

25
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,930
I'll make it up to you next time.

26
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,139
If you show up in front of me again,

27
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,650
it won't end with just a slap.

28
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,919
Min Do Hyuk, please get away from me.

29
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,419
It's what's best...

30
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,519
for both of us.

31
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,600
What are you thinking, La Hui?

32
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:56,059
Don't tell me...

33
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,299
you saw Da Mi's video that day.

34
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,439
I mean the last record of Da Mi...

35
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,710
that K had.

36
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:14,850
I'm being punished.

37
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,189
Punishment for what I did to my daughter.

38
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,299
- La Hui. - Don't touch me.

39
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't need your help.

40
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,950
Don't you know who I am?

41
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,780
I'm the heartless...

42
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,919
Geum La Hui.

43
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:11,970
It was you, wasn't it?

44
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,609
You saved us from K's vacation home.

45
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:17,650
Was it you or not?

46
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,210
La Hui!

47
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Kang Ki Tak,

48
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,590
you'll never know...

49
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,928
how I came to start this project.

50
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,830
(Geum La Hui)

51
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,270
I can never forget the day...

52
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,340
I begged for K's mercy to spare me.

53
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,239
That was the beginning of my nightmare.

54
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,080
In order to turn him into a national hero,

55
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,478
- I poured in my heart and soul. - Matthew Lee.

56
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,510
(Matthew Lee, our national hero who overcame crises and difficulties)

57
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,280
My decision to choose K had to be right.

58
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,689
But that day, I came across something.

59
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,429
On K's hard drive...

60
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,359
was everything about Lee Hwi So.

61
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,470
To avenge Sim Yong who abandoned him,

62
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,069
K had to steal Lee Hwi So's abilities.

63
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,269
(Wife: Park Nan Young)

64
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,039
He also had to turn Lee Hwi So into a criminal.

65
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,410
That was why he killed Da Mi.

66
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,010
(20180928 Bang Da Mi's death)

67
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,410
I shouldn't have watched it.

68
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,179
No.

69
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,479
I should've smashed it to pieces.

70
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,650
It was...

71
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,059
nice to get to see her again.

72
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,989
I'd missed her.

73
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,059
But,

74
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:42,629
I couldn't.

75
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,400
- Please... - I couldn't get myself...

76
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,469
Please don't kill my mom.

77
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,900
to forget those eyes.

78
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,369
(Bang Da Mi)

79
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,520
I wanted to die.

80
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,450
I thought someone like me should die.

81
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,189
But before that,

82
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,890
I had to kill K first.

83
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,960
It's Da Mi's last day alive.

84
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,499
- But at that place, - He filmed this?

85
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,330
- That monster. - I found you.

86
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,739
You were alive and watching Da Mi.

87
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,869
Da Mi's last moment...

88
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,979
You didn't know Da Mi was your daughter,

89
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,210
but you were crying...

90
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,249
as if it was fate.

91
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,580
I thought I should save you.

92
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,759
I begged in prayer...

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,430
to allow me to stay alive...

94
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,369
until I could kill K.

95
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,899
That was the last...

96
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,300
and only wish I had...

97
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,269
as an inhumane beast.

98
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,710
I can hardly call this suffering.

99
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:05,508
It's incomparable to the pain...

100
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,979
Lee Hwi So felt as he pulled the trigger on his daughter.

101
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,549
It's incomparable to the pain Park Nan Young felt...

102
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,350
as she burned to death after losing her husband and child.

103
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,019
My losses...

104
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,920
are trivial.

105
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,259
In order to deceive K,

106
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,999
I had to get back on my feet in a short amount of time.

107
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,300
I endured and persisted with all of my strength.

108
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,070
Then, I decided to bring Hwang Chan Sung,

109
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,070
the CEO of Save, to my side.

110
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,479
What business do you have with me?

111
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,320
I know that you want TIKITAKA.

112
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:43,950
If you help me,

113
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,989
I'll give it to you.

114
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,989
Including all of my shares.

115
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,100
In return,

116
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,700
give me all the information about Save you can manage.

117
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,940
It's a reasonable deal, right?

118
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,639
It's not necessarily a coveted deal either.

119
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,279
Let's add one more condition.

120
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:14,180
Hand Han Mone to me too.

121
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,920
I'll think about it then.

122
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,489
I had to accept the next best option rather than settle with the worst,

123
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,489
even if Hwang Chan Sung was evil.

124
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,800
That was how I became Medusa.

125
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,729
I acted like Park Nan Young in front of Min Do Hyuk...

126
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:34,700
and hoped he would punish me and the others.

127
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Because Geum La Hui...

128
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,369
doesn't have the right to avenge anyone.

129
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,979
(TIKITAKA Matthew Lee)

130
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,290
(TIKITAKA Matthew Lee)

131
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,659
("Multi-region Investigation Unit Chief Arrested for Drug Use")

132
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,259
- Matthew. - Yes.

133
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:04,999
Have you seen the news?

134
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,470
Nam Chul Woo's drug use is all over television.

135
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,399
Also, Save revealed the relationship between Yang Jin Mo and TIKITAKA.

136
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,139
That's not all.

137
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,238
Cha Ju Ran is involved...

138
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,609
in the Gagok District investment fraud.

139
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
What?

140
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,519
If word gets out,

141
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,050
we won't be able to get the permit to develop the area.

142
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,590
It will damage TIKITAKA's reputation,

143
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,060
and people will find out about you too.

144
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,290
This is unspeakable.

145
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,389
How can all of this happen at once?

146
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,229
It's Medusa's doing.

147
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,769
Medusa must be working with Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak.

148
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,970
Hwang Chan Sung must be their aid.

149
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
For now,

150
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,239
keep your distance from them and don't do anything.

151
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,909
I'll either threaten or bribe the journalists...

152
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,680
to stop the commotion.

153
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,009
You're sure...

154
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,850
I can trust you to handle it, right?

155
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,199
Everything is going the way I planned.

156
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,199
(K, Han Mone, Cha Ju Ran...)

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Everyone,

158
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:14,070
thank you for waiting so long.

159
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,899
(Expose the fake marriage)

160
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,440
You can look forward to it.

161
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,040
Hey! Geum La Hui!

162
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Darn it.

163
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:27,420
A thief is living in this house!

164
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
Everyone, listen up!

165
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,590
A wicked witch stole all of my money!

166
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,358
Hey, you better come out...

167
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,430
before I set your house on fire. You hear me?

168
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
Hey! Geum La Hui!

169
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,170
You.

170
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,440
You schemed everything, didn't you?

171
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,108
You got my ex-husband involved...

172
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,009
and met him in front of me...

173
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,810
all on purpose.

174
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:00,249
Where's my money?

175
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,820
You better give back...

176
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,320
all the money you stole, you witch!

177
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,590
How do you have the time for this?

178
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,529
You'd have to work even after death...

179
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,029
if you want to clear all the debt.

180
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Why...

181
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,899
Why are you doing this to me?

182
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,670
What did I do so wrong to you?

183
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,769
We weren't on bad terms.

184
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:30,779
Gosh.

185
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,479
You were dying to ruin Mone.

186
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,080
I guess it's my turn now.

187
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:39,649
I see.

188
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,060
You're going to offer everything to Matthew...

189
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,229
so you can live the good life.

190
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,960
You're evil!

191
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:02,609
Until now,

192
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,909
you lived a privileged life that didn't suit you.

193
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,879
It's time to go back to living as the poor Cha Ju Ran.

194
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,550
You'll be drowning in debt at all times.

195
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:17,389
Back to being a lousy person...

196
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,629
always afraid of creditors showing up.

197
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,129
Hey, lady!

198
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,269
How much was your private loan again?

199
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,769
It looks like it'll be a long night.

200
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:29,899
Take care of it...

201
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,310
so she never acts up again.

202
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,680
Let go. Let go of me.

203
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,979
Hey. Geum La Hui!

204
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,050
I'll kill you.

205
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,619
I'll rip you to pieces with my own hands!

206
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,989
You hear me?

207
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,489
Geum La Hui!

208
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,060
Hey!

209
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
What's the matter?

210
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Did something happen?

211
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,609
Do Hyuk.

212
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,220
I found out who Medusa is.

213
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,519
What?

214
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,600
It was Geum La Hui.

215
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,330
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,200
The person who helped us out of K's vacation home...

217
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,139
was also Geum La Hui.

218
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:12,609
That was when...

219
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,139
she badly hurt her leg.

220
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
What?

221
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,820
Why did she help us?

222
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,950
I bet she has an ulterior motive.

223
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:29,488
She even brought Hwang Chan Sung into the picture.

224
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,930
What if she's regretting it?

225
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,229
What if that was why she contacted you?

226
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,479
It's too late...

227
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,479
to pardon her wicked deeds.

228
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Never.

229
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,329
Save revealed that mayoral candidate Yang Jin Mo...

230
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,428
- Gosh, look. - used to work at a bar,

231
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,968
- No wonder. He's so handsome. - while raising the suspicion...

232
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,799
of a connection between Yang Jin Mo and TIKITAKA.

233
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,039
- He can't be the mayor. - Both Yang Jin Mo and TIKITAKA...

234
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,438
have not made any official comments on the matter.

235
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,208
If what Save disclosed turns out to be true,

236
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,810
it'll have a great impact on the Seoul mayor election.

237
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,678
Is it true candidate Yang worked at a bar?

238
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,319
It was fact-checked.

239
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,448
We're ready to provide additional evidence.

240
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:34,589
Is it true Chairman Lee was behind appointing Yang Jin Mo...

241
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,889
as the Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs?

242
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,129
It's the role of the press...

243
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,030
to find that out.

244
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Please excuse me.

245
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,569
- Do you mean it's true? - Please say a few more words!

246
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,329
- Please tell us more. - Mr. Hwang!

247
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,698
- Please say a few more words! - Is it true?

248
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,939
Gosh, all the old photos were deleted.

249
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,079
I remember there was a rumour of an affair between Ms. Go...

250
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,580
and the son of the chairman of the board.

251
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,810
They're soulmates.

252
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,218
We bought so many paintings from her.

253
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:04,850
What a waste of money.

254
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,119
(Wasn't your husband a professor? How are you a single mom?)

255
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,330
Rumour says your marriage to Yang Jin Mo is fake.

256
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,458
Are you a fake couple?

257
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,959
(Are you a fake couple?)

258
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:26,909
(Was everything on television a show?)

259
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:27,909
(Aren't they embarrassed?)

260
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:28,909
(What's the truth?)

261
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,378
(Settings)

262
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:32,878
(Delete account)

263
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,648
(Are you sure you want to delete your account?)

264
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:35,820
(Confirm)

265
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,020
What's taking Geum La Hui so long? Call her again.

266
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,158
What took you so long?

267
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,560
Do you want to see us get killed?

268
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,059
All of my past is being dug up.

269
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,000
- What should we do? - What's your plan?

270
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:53,399
Did you assure us because you had a plan?

271
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,399
For now,

272
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,080
- we won't take any action. - What?

273
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,050
You don't care since it's not about you.

274
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,879
I don't trust you. I'll settle this with Matthew.

275
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,149
Are you trying to pull all of us down with you?

276
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,119
What if the press catches you meeting Matthew?

277
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,530
It'll only prove he was involved in your appointment.

278
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:23,760
This was why I was against appointing...

279
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,800
a bully like you as the deputy mayor.

280
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:28,869
Hey.

281
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,469
I don't care about becoming the mayor.

282
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,439
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to?

283
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Enough!

284
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,280
Nothing will get resolved from fighting each other.

285
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,878
This is all Medusa's doing.

286
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,019
Medusa knows everything about us.

287
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,648
Just a while ago, one comment accused us...

288
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,590
of having a fake marriage on my social media account.

289
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,919
If word spreads,

290
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,589
our image will be damaged for good.

291
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,259
They'll never find out if our marriage is fake or not.

292
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,698
We registered our marriage,

293
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,699
and we lived like a real couple for a year.

294
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,270
People might have noticed that we were acting.

295
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,969
Let's hold a press conference right away.

296
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,340
We'll have to use Han Na.

297
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,909
What are you talking about?

298
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,280
We'll have her talk at the press conference.

299
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,350
She can confirm that our family is normal.

300
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,319
Everyone will believe her.

301
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,060
Go Myoung Ji, are you crazy?

302
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,629
Don't bring Han Na into this mess.

303
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,129
Well, do you have any other ideas?

304
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,429
I have to protect my children!

305
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,899
If you disagree,

306
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,230
I'm ready to divorce you.

307
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,438
Will you end this...

308
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,570
as a bar host Yang Jin Mo,

309
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,570
or will you overcome it with me?

310
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,340
The choice is up to you.

311
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,580
(Recording)

312
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,149
Just as I thought, you two will never change.

313
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,320
Evil only births bigger evil.

314
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:56,189
Save's articles on Chairman Matthew Lee.

315
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:59,060
"Chairman Lee, Yang Jin Mo's sponsor."

316
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,358
"Unqualified Yang became..."

317
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,858
"Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs..."

318
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,570
"because Chairman Lee put him there."

319
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,399
"How are Chairman Lee and Yang connected?"

320
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,739
"What government business is TIKITAKA trying to get?"

321
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,209
Stop. That's enough!

322
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,879
I'll kill that punk Hwang Chan Sung.

323
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,679
As soon as the facts are confirmed,

324
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,419
upload the special articles.

325
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:22,879
Mr. Hwang!

326
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,149
You can't be here.

327
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,419
Mr. Hwang!

328
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,030
Chairman Lee. I see you're very angry.

329
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:35,500
Can you all excuse us?

330
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,330
It won't take long.

331
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,510
You're just Medusa's minion.

332
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:55,379
Who is Medusa?

333
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,750
Who put you up to this?

334
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,490
I'm Medusa. What's it to you?

335
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,090
I couldn't stand the psycho serial killer...

336
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,659
Sim Jun Seok being revered as national hero Lee Hwi So,

337
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,300
so I decided to get involved.

338
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,540
Why?

339
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,770
Is something wrong?

340
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,540
Sim Jun Seok?

341
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,189
You knew I was Sim Jun Seok, and you kept quiet all this while?

342
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,189
Don't be stupid.

343
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,490
You're not Medusa.

344
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,490
You're just a psycho like me.

345
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:44,699
Right.

346
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,070
There was a time when we hung out together.

347
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,168
When I didn't know you were Sungchan Group's fake heir.

348
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,209
Why would you mention Sungchan Group?

349
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,379
Do you think I don't know why you created Save?

350
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,179
It's so you could put articles you like on the front page...

351
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:08,689
and toy with and control the rich and powerful.

352
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,530
Is that a bad thing?

353
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,100
Didn't you make TIKITAKA to do just that?

354
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,570
To use people's secrets...

355
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,830
for your personal gain.

356
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Yes.

357
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,740
We always had the same goal.

358
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:27,409
Money.

359
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,010
And the weaknesses of people who would make us money.

360
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,719
I'll give you what you want.

361
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,379
Whatever Medusa offered,

362
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,750
I could give you much more.

363
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,060
Shares. Anything.

364
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,459
No, thanks.

365
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,730
You're a jerk who never keeps his word.

366
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,669
You're a sly snake.

367
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,439
Secretary Nam.

368
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,439
Secretary Nam!

369
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,639
Yes, sir.

370
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,649
The visitor is leaving.

371
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,149
If he refuses to leave,

372
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,419
beat him up and drag him off.

373
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,090
Oh. He's an attention-seeker.

374
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,189
Would he like to be filmed?

375
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:41,149
Hurry.

376
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,169
You'll die if you stay here.

377
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:09,909
The people are possessed and acting weird.

378
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,179
Do you want to live where no one recognizes anyone?

379
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,750
We must get away.

380
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,080
Is it that easy for you, Mom?

381
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,750
What?

382
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,119
Because you abandoned me,

383
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:24,590
can you leave that easily?

384
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:25,929
I told you.

385
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,888
I didn't abandon you.

386
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:30,300
You didn't abandon me? Then don't go.

387
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,000
Stay here and protect me.

388
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,570
After you left,

389
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,510
Mister and his wife,

390
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,780
and Grandma and Grandpa were there for me.

391
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,850
I cried because I missed you, Mom.

392
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:46,709
But you weren't there.

393
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:49,580
The people here are my family.

394
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,119
There's no time.

395
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,850
We might both die.

396
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,859
Mom, now's the time. Go.

397
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,369
Okay!

398
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,300
Han Na, that was awesome.

399
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,570
You're an acting genius.

400
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,990
Reporter Kim. I'll send you a video.

401
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,290
Write up a nice article for me.

402
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,490
The title is "From Sim Jun Seok's victim..."

403
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,530
"to genius child actor, No Han Na."

404
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,300
"Behind her was Yang Jin Mo, candidate for Seoul mayor."

405
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,230
Are you taking it down?

406
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,409
My husband won't go down that easily.

407
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Never ever.

408
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,520
(Missed Call: CEO Hwang Chan Sung)

409
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,990
You didn't get the message?

410
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,929
Fine. I really will report you for stalking me.

411
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,300
I came to give you this.

412
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,129
Press it when you're in danger.

413
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,698
I don't need anything like this.

414
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,000
Take it back, Min Do Hyuk!

415
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,080
If you keep breaking the rules,

416
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,580
that will be problematic, Mone.

417
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,949
You don't know what I'll do.

418
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,289
(Han Na is so cute. Looking forward to the movie.)

419
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,759
(Yang Jin Mo was fostering Han Na?)

420
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,290
(That's so sweet.)

421
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,698
(Hot Issue!)

("Behind Her Was Yang Jin Mo, Candidate for Seoul Mayor!")

424
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,840
Now for the next step.

425
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,280
Set up a press conference.

426
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,419
Since you have a fixed address...

427
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,090
and it's your first offence, we'll let you go home.

428
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,659
Come back here for questioning tomorrow morning at 9am.

429

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,869
(My love Ju Ran)

431
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,919
- The person you have reached is... - Shoot.

432
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,219
Something's not right.

433
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I refuse.

434
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,688
Ju Ran suddenly...

435
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,629
- met a new guy. - Darling.

436
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Ju Ran!

437
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:51,230
And that night, the bag found its way to me.

438
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,469
It feels like someone's controlling us.

439
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,270
It can't be.

440
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,149
Darn it.

441
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,080
Move. I'm here to see the chairman.

442
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,149
Don't you know who I am?

443
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,888
Leave.

444
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,060
We have orders not to let you in.

445
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,260
Pass this to him now.

446
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,030
I found Medusa.

447
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,230
The proof is right here.

448
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,599
If you don't leave, I must call the police.

449
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,639
Darn you.

450
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,369
You junkie.

451
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,408
Hey. Drag him outside!

452
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,409
- Okay. - Okay.

453
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,408
Hey, wait.

454
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,178
Pass this to him for me, then.

455
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,480
That's all I want.

456
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,918
It's important!

457
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,949
I'm Nam Chul Woo! Put me down, punks.

458

459
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:08,939
Captain Nam.

460
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,209
Why do you forget your place?

(Geum La Hui's fingerprint analysis)

462
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:22,760
Not bad.

463
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,820
Did I underestimate you?

464
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,230
Medusa.

465
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,959
You're Medusa, right?

466
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,359
Where's Ju Ran?

467
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,139
She left you for someone else.

468
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:39,409
Are you still worried about her?

469
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:42,639
Worry about yourself.

470
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,310
You've lost your job, honour, and love.

471
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:47,209
All of it.

472
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,350
I decide if she lives or dies.

473
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,219
Where's Ju Ran?

474
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,359
What if I tell you?

475
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,129
What will you do for me?

476
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,490
What?

477
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,530
Hand over everything you own.

478
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,169
House, buildings, and bank accounts.

479
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,469
Then I'll let you see Ju Ran.

480
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:15,139
I'll even kill her for you if you want.

481
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,209
I'll kill her myself.

482
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,250
I'll give you everything you want.

483
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,719
Tell me where she is.

Losing your mom...

and having your heart ripped out of your chest...

Are you any closer to finding Medusa?

496

I was too distracted to ask.

497
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
You should hurry.

498
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,639
You know how impatient Matthew is.

499
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,580
Are you getting along well with Han Na?

500
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:33,980
She's a lot like you.

and boldness.

503
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,959
Or should I say she's like K?

504
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,959
Shut your mouth.

505
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,898
The press is calling her a genius child actor,

506
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,399
so you can't replace her now.

Or sprain an ankle and get fired.

510

Before you do anything, Han Na could get you by the throat.

To her,

512
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,550
you're the archenemy who got her mom killed.

That makes you my archenemy because you killed my mom!

514

I killed her?

515
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,630

Did you think I wouldn't know if you hid it?

519
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,420
You killed your mom.

520
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
Your mom died...

521
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,089
because you neglected her.

00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,770
You can't.

No.

I loved you so much.

536
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:23,980
How could you do this?

537
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,690
I grovelled and bowed to Matthew and Geum La Hui,

538
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,389
but I didn't mind because I was with you.

539
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Why did you...

540
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:35,529
do this to me?

541
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:39,270
Is betrayal all I get in return for loving you?

542
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,500
I won't forgive you, Cha Ju Ran!

543
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,080
Okay. Don't forgive me.

544

For what I did to you,

545
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,650
I shouldn't be forgiven. I should die for it.

546
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
Dying at your hand...

547
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,049
wouldn't be a bad way to go.

548
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,790
Do it.

Why didn't you kill me?

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,460
How could I kill you?

553
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,730
How could I live...

554
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,199
after killing you?

555
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:48,369
I'm sorry. I wronged you horribly.

556
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,940
I deserve to die.

557
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,670
No.

558
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,710
Mone, I'm so pleased...

559
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,350
you came.

560
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,250
So...

561
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,989
I sincerely apologize for what happened last time.

562
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,690
I must've lost my mind.

563
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,360
I love you so much.

564
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:14,989
It won't happen again.

565
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,199
What happened?

566
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,630
I forgot all about it.

567
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:25,770
You're so bold and cool.

568
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,170
Name anything you want.

569
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
A wish, perhaps.

570
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,880
A wish?

571
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:36,580
Can it be anything?

572
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Of course,

573

and don't meet Min Do Hyuk.

576

577
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:54,000

I don't think I'll need it.

580
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,810
Of course not.

581
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,710
You have me.

582

583

What's your wish?

585
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:23,929

(Press Conference to Reveal the Truth)

593
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,630
Are you ready?

594
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,770
Just say what I told you to.

595
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,139
That you live happily with us in a warm home, as a family.

596
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,619
That you have a great mom and dad and every day is full of joy.

597
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,250
Do you get that?

598
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,119
Shall we go now?

599
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:31,259
No.

600

Change your mind.

601
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,799
I can't put Han Na through this.

602
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Han Na.

603
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Let's go home.

604
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,369
If you don't do this,

605
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,509
our family will crumble.

606
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,509
You can't live with Han Na anymore.

607
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,380
She'll go to an orphanage...

608
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:47,380
or another foster family.

609
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:50,949
It would be fortunate if she finds nice parents.

610
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,488
But they could be people...

611
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,489
who want to use her star status to make money.

612
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,889
You know...

613
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,989
how evil people can be.

615
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:03,028
Still, this is wrong.

616
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,329
You said you wanted to protect Han Na.

617
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,869
You protect her, then!

618
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,869
Don't fight.

619
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,880
You and Han Na both stay here.

620
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,219
I'll do it.

621
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,588
Whether I get crapped on or ridiculed,

622
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:28,989
this is for me to handle.

623
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Send Han Na home.

624
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,088
What will you do on your own?

625
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:35,330
Jin Mo!

626
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:43,199
Today,

627
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:45,839
I arranged this press conference to clearly explain...

628
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,610
the fake news surrounding my family.

629
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,009
First, the rumour that I used to work at a bar...

630
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
is true.

631
00:41:57,179 --> 00:41:58,849
- So, it was true. - The tabloids said so.

632
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,989
Growing up as an orphan,

633
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,889
I did all kinds of work since I was young.

634
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,489
I even worked part-time at a bar in my 20s.

635
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:09,000
However, there is no profession that is above or below another.

636
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,060
Just because I worked at a bar...

637
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,799
doesn't mean the value of my labour should be belittled.

638
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:15,569
Second,

639
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,440
I worked on the movie, "Dear D," with TIKITAKA.

640
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:22,540
But the fact that I became Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs...

641
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,779
has nothing to do with Chairman Lee. I want to make that clear.

642
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,609
- He's digging himself into a swamp. - Third,

643
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,249
the rumour that my marriage is only contractual...

644
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,278
(Rumours about contractual marriage, entirely false)

645
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,719
is entirely false.

646
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,249
No Han Na is proof of that.

647
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,318
Post an alarm on Save.

648
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,860
- If my marriage had been fake, - Yes, sir.

649
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,889
how would we have thought to foster No Han Na?

650
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,730
Don't you think so?

651
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,659
From now on,

652
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,500
I will punish anyone spreading fake news about my family...

653
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,040
with legal measures.

654
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,600
I will never agree to favourable settlements.

655
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,639

Is that Save's alarm?

658
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,948
What is this? Is this for real?

659
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,088
- Is that really on Save? - What is this?

660
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:07,349
It's a recording.

661
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,948
Just a while ago, one comment accused us...

662
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,758
of having a fake marriage on my social media account.

663
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:13,028
- Is this really true? - If word spreads,

665

666

They'll never find out if our marriage is fake or not.

667
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:20,499
We registered our marriage,

668
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,639
and we lived like a real couple for a year.

669
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,939

What?

736
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,190
You're not serious, right? You stashed some away, didn't you?

737
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,460
No, I didn't.

738
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,528
I took the express bus on my way here,

739
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:11,130
and I spent every penny to buy you this freshly caught seafood.

740

741

743
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:22,040

Then,

758
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:11,060
you'll get the whole of TIKITAKA as you wanted.

759
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,100

762

and kill Min Do Hyuk.

not in the bargain.
