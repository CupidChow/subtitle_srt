00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,049
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection )

2
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,888
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,248
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,050
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,399
System unlocked. Escape now.

6
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:01,859
Medusa is helping us.

7
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,230
Ki Tak, jump!

8
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:22,619
They survived.

9
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,319
Gosh darn it!

10
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,690
How dare you ruin my plan?

11
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,330
Medusa is among you.

12
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,030
Who is Medusa?

13
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,869
Who's the traitor?

14
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,839
(Episode 6)

15
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:54,919
Do Hyuk.

16
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,050
Do Hyuk.

17
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:57,919
Do Hyuk!

18
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,909
Who dared to pretend to be on my side and tricked me?

19
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,439
Who lived off of me like a parasite,

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,839
enjoyed riches they didn't deserve,

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,180
and gained honour as they lived in luxury like a rat?

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,478
Who was it that rang the emergency alarm,

23
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,119
manipulated my tablet PC,

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
and saved Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak...

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,549
as if they knew no fear like a crazy psycho?

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,519
Who is Medusa?

27
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,259
Matthew, I...

28
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,259
only just found out about the existence of Medusa.

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,659
The same goes for me.

30
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,870
I don't want to hear that garbage!

31
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,839
Just find out who Medusa is!

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,299
Then, I'll let you live!

33
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,668
Nam Chul Woo, do something. You're a police officer.

34
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:52,940
Why should I have to do it?

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Well...

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,949
What about testing the tablet PC for fingerprints?

37
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,220
If I get caught now,

38
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,259
all my plans will go up in smoke.

39
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,199
The people that Medusa wanted to kill were you and me.

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,829
Who among these people would want to kill us the most?

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,069
A person who might dream of revenge because of desperation and rage.

42
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,179
If I had been Medusa,

43
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,079
I would've already killed you.

44
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,319
It's not me.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,289
Then,

46
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,460
what about the possibility that the tablet PC was hacked?

47
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,630
Hacked?

48
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,430
Thanks to Medusa, I found out Han Na's location,

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,970
and I also found out that Yoon Ji Sook was in trouble.

50
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,729
And how does Medusa know that?

51
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,139
I don't know.

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,710
All I know is that Medusa uses Save's server to contact me.

53
00:03:58,609 --> 00:03:59,710
Save.

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,979
Hwang Chan Sung?

55
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,380
Did you just say "Hwang Chan Sung?"

56
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,220
Medusa contacted Min Do Hyuk using Save's server.

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,560
Then, Hwang Chan Sung is Medusa.

58
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,959
Save has criticized and talked badly about Chairman Lee...

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,830
since the very beginning.

60
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:23,868
It's also suspicious that they made...

61
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:25,669
Min Do Hyuk a national hero through a Save vote.

62
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:26,869
I am sure...

63
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,739
Hwang Chan Sung rigged the vote.

64
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,769
That's right. I'm sure Hwang Chan Sung is Medusa...

65
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,009
or on Medusa's side, one or the other.

66
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,010
What if...

67
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,239
Mone is on the same side as Medusa?

68
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,249
Among us, the person who's the closest to Save...

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,720
is Mone.

70
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,259
Indeed, you're the only person...

71
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,590
who'd come up with this kind of scheme.

72
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
You have lost...

73
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,429
your mom.

74
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,299
I don't know anything about Medusa!

75
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,070
But anyone could be the traitor.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,470
Joining hands with the devil...

77
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,879
is something any of us would do, as long as it benefits us.

78
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:13,919
Don't trust me either.

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,449
Doubt over and over again.

80
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,619
Gosh! I'm so sick and tired of all the doubting!

81
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,989
Oh, this might also be...

82
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,729
Medusa's big picture.

83
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,729
An impure intention to split us apart.

84
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,059
Right.

85
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,070
The seven of us must stand united.

86
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,470
We can't be jerked around by Medusa,

87
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,900
whose identity we don't even know.

88
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,470
As Jin Mo said,

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,669
the tablet PC being hacked seems to be the most likely explanation.

90
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,410
We'd know if we do some digging on Hwang Chan Sung.

91
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Han Mone.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,789
This has been decided as your second mission.

93
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,419
Go and find out!

94
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,890
Whether Hwang Chan Sung is Medusa...

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,789
or just simply helping out.

96
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,929
If you don't find out,

97
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,299
you'll be the first to die.

98
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,600
And if Hwang Chan Sung is Medusa?

99
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,770
Of course I'll kill him!

100
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,789
Do Hyuk.

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Are you awake?

102
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,929
Ki Tak, are you okay?

103
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Are you hurt?

104
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,340
I'm just a little sore.

105
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
How about you? Are you okay?

106
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,210
Ki Tak.

107
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,410
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,280
I only thought about wanting to meet Medusa.

109
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,979
I should've doubted it at first.

110
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,320
From the moment it said to come with you.

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,059
Don't blame yourself.

112
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
What's important is...

113
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,189
that Matthew also knows about Medusa's existence.

114
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:07,030
And we missed that.

115
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,760
It's okay.

116
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:17,510
What's this?

117
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Oh, right.

118
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,309
The person who brought us here was Mr. Hwang.

119
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,450
You would've been in serious trouble if I had not gotten there in time.

120
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:34,760
Wait a minute.

121
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,789
How did you know to come to us?

122
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,660
That we were in an accident?

123
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,729
I guess I have to tell you.

124
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,910
I am...

125
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:53,910
Medusa.

126
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,489
Darn it.

127
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak are already gone.

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,700
Darn, those lucky punks. All right.

129
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,510
Why didn't you...

130
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,609
discuss this matter with me?

131
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,719
That person called Medusa is targeting my life too.

132
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,350
I also have a right to know!

133
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,690
Are you still hanging around here to nag me about that?

134
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,389
I should try to avoid being killed senselessly.

135
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,859
Both you and I.

136
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,829
More people will go astray from now on.

137
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,359
That will never happen.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,060
I will really start to push ahead from now on.

139
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,430
What do you mean?

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,300
Getting your hands on Save?

141
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,639
Before that, we have to make Yang Jin Mo the mayor of Seoul.

142
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,440
That way, we can get the development rights for the Gagok District.

143
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,810
Then,

144
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,909
even if Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak act like crazy punks,

145
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,320
they will never be able to beat me.

146
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,420
Why is the Gagok District...

147
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,659
so important?

148
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,259
That is...

149
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
You said...

150
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,229
to doubt over and over again.

151
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,970
Before we catch Medusa, I won't trust anyone.

152
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,009
You're Medusa?

153
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,210
You clearly said you weren't last time.

154
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,220
When did you know that we were back?

155
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,519
Why did you help us?

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,519
Do you know that Save's security program is installed...

157
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
on Matthew's system?

158
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,759
I'll answer your first question first.

159
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,600
I've been checking the facts on the Bang Da Mi case the whole time.

160
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,229
And when I found out that K appeared...

161
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,300
at the première event of the movie, "Dear D,"

162
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,810
I instinctively knew that you had returned.

163
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,879
That's because Matthew...

164
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,009
is K.

165
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,420
You knew?

166
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,850
About Matthew's real identity?

167
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,060
Everyone denounced Chairman Sim Yong's sincerity as a lie,

168
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,190
but I believed the Chairman's last words.

169
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,529
So,

170
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,100
I analysed Matthew and Lee Hwi So through Save's big data.

171
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,200
The result was a mismatch.

172
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,540
Why did you do all that?

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,109
Do you have some kind of resentment towards K?

174
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,940
This could be the answer to your second question.

175
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,950
I was once duped by Sim Jun Seok's lie.

176
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
What's certain is...

177
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,359
that we have the same goal.

178
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:56,859
K's...

179
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:58,729
death.

180
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,229
I will kill K with my own hands for sure.

181
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,970
I can do that without your help.

182
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,139
I'll answer your third question.

183
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,739
The person who passed Save's security program through Mone...

184
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,379
was me.

185
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,879
Of course, K thinks that Mone stole the security program.

186
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,550
That's for Mone's safety.

187
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,450
For her safety...

188
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,960
LUCA is a masterpiece of the century created by Lee Hwi So.

189
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,659
Taking away that kind of weapon from K...

190
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,600
is the way to save humanity.

191
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,769
LUCA's secret key.

192
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
You know it, don't you?

193
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:53,009
Now is the time for us to join forces and get LUCA.

194
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:54,649
So,

195
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:58,420
I'd like to scout you to work at Save, Mr. Min.

196
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,060
Won't you join me...

197
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,960
in fighting against Matthew?

198
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,100
(Beasts who deserve to die)

199
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,070
Min Do Hyuk, Kang Ki Tak.

200
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,239
After all I did to help you, you lost to Matthew like fools?

201
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:52,940
I warned you...

202
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,979
not to tell Kang Ki Tak.

203
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,749
But you believed the message that Matthew sent?

204
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,090
I don't need you two anymore.

205
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,320
I'll do it on my own.

206
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Ki Tak.

207
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,700
How much do you trust Hwang Chan Sung's words?

208
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,769
To a certain degree.

209
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,670
If we join hands with Hwang Chan Sung,

210
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,739
we can get LUCA sooner.

211
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,479
Do you really think Hwang Chan Sung is Medusa?

212
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,249
I'm not sure about that.

213
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:32,950
I'm not sure either.

214
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,979
The fact that he was watching us...

215
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,989
and that he asked us to join forces...

216
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,519
Do you still think...

217
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,190
that Park Nan Young is Medusa?

218
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,290
The man who worked at the cemetery definitely said it was a woman.

219
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,200
She had a limp and had something...

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,930
wrapped around her face.

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,540
Anyway, what we know for certain...

222
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,070
is that she has something to do with Da Mi.

223
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
Do Hyuk, wait.

224
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,029
Could it be...

225
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,229
Why?

226
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,729
No, it's nothing.

227
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Min Do Hyuk.

228
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,450
Why isn't he accepting my offer right away?

229
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,320
It's a golden opportunity to grab Matthew by the neck.

230
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:52,690
(Beasts who deserve to die)

231
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,329
(K, Han Mone, Cha Ju Ran)

232
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,998
(Nam Chul Woo)

233
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,569
(Yang Jin Mo)

234
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,800
(Go Myoung Ji)

235
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,009
I will destroy what's precious to you,

236
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:07,440
one by one.

237
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,810
For Matthew, it's Children Home and the Gagok District.

238
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:14,180
For Han Mone, it was your mom.

239
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,149
Next is Cha Ju Ran.

240
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,119
It's your turn.

241
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,320
Gosh, I can't stand this.

242
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,128
Matthew is the one who always causes trouble,

243
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,489
and I'm the one who cleans things up.

244
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,258
If it was going to be like this,

245
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,499
I should've been named president, not a mere director.

246
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,169
Look here! Drive carefully!

247
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,800
You're not supposed to drive here.

248
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,109
It is a nice car, though.

249
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,379
Ju Ran!

250
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,710
Cha Ju Ran.

251
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,720
This voice is...

252
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,790
Ju Ran.

253
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,729
I've missed you, honey.

254
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,149
("Escape")

255
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,989
It's dangerous here right now.

256
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,060
Everyone has gone crazy.

257
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,759
If you want to go,

258
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,529
go by yourself, Mom.

259
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,029
I'm going to stay here.

260
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,739
If you stay here, you'll die!

261
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,310
I don't know what it is, but everyone is possessed by something.

262
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,279
We have to run away.

263
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,149
Erica.

264
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,479
Mom!

265
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,790
Goodness, have you been a good girl?

266
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,590
Erica, the election campaign for the mayor of Seoul will begin soon.

267
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,359
Then, can you help Dad, Erica?

268
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,899
If it's for Dad, of course, I should do it.

269
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,530
Dad will be the mayor of Seoul, and I'll be a superstar.

270
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,100
Oh, just a moment.

271
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,310
You're No Han Na, right?

272
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,179
Yes, she is. She's No Han Na.

273
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,550
She lives with us in our house.

274
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,679
Can we take a picture with you?

275
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,290
My niece is a huge fan of yours.

276
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,089
- Let's take a picture. - I want to be in it too.

277
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,119
Come on. Let's take a picture.

278
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,459
One, two, three.

279
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,590
- One, two, three. - Why, that little...

280
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,628
Who does she think she is?

281
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,629
Two, three.

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,599
One, two, three.

283
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Mom.

284
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,129
Can you lend me your shoes?

285
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,969
What? Why do you want my shoes?

286
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,540
Just give me them.

287
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,939
Ladies.

288
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,740
Gentlemen.

289
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,010
You're working so hard.

290
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,310
Have something to drink while you work.

291
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,919
- I think I broke my ankle! - Erica!

292
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,188
- Mom, it hurts so much! - Did you hurt yourself?

293
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,489
Where? Here?

294
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,859
Where does it hurt? Here?

295
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,128
I'm dying!

296
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,029
You can tell her ankle is broken.

297
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,529
- Take her to the hospital. - It hurts.

298
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,070
What about the shoot? Today's the first shoot of the movie.

299
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:22,740
We'll have to switch to a different actor.

300
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,740
But where will we find a child actor this instant?

301
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,468
Oh, Han Na.

302
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:29,979
I saw her running through Erica's lines with her earlier.

303
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,679
She's as good as any actor.

304
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,250
No! I'm going to do it!

305
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,879
I'm going to act!

306
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,189
Hey, No Han Na!

307
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,359
Don't you dare take my spot!

308
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,519
I won't let it slide!

309
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,529
Please help me out! We have to hurry!

310
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,689
Please help.

311
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,560
No, I'm going to do it!

312
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,600
It's mine!

313
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,668
Please watch Han Na for me.

314
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:53,669
Phillip! Let's go!

315
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,299
- Erica! Director! - Mom!

316
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,369
- Let's go! - Mom!

317
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,449
Do you have a reservation?

318
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
Mr. Kim Do Jin.

319
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,679
Are you a guest of Mr. Kim's?

320
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,889
She's with Mr. Kim.

321
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,560
Hello!

322
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,990
- Hello. - Hello.

323
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,330
Ju Ran!

324
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Honey!

325
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:37,780
You're here, Mr. Kim.

326
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:39,149
Yes.

327
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,750
This is my wife.

328
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,649
I'm sorry I didn't know, ma'am.

329
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,520
I'll escort you to a private room.

330
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,060
Have a good time.

331
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,100
Since I'm with a special guest today,

332
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,969
please take extra special care of her.

333
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,040
Also, for our meal,

334
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:07,840
bring it in after ten minutes.

335
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
Yes, Mr. Kim.

336
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,709
Please excuse us.

337
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,459
As soon as I saw you, I wanted to do this so much.

338
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,530
Stop that mouth.

339
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,969
I fell for it once, but not twice.

340
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:38,638
Ju Ran, you haven't aged at all.

341
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:39,969
You're so feisty.

342
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,810
It reminds me of the old days.

343
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,780
When we were together.

344
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,990
We danced like this a lot.

345
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,830
What are you trying to pull?

346
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:03,929
Goodness.

347
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,330
Why did you want to meet?

348
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,069
What are you after to show yourself again?

349
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm a dreadful man.

350
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,679
This reaction of yours...

351
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:16,879
is only natural.

352
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,850
I asked to meet to give you this.

353
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,050
What's this?

354
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,320
The money I stole from you before our divorce.

355
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,490
With some interest.

356
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,359
(2 million dollars)

357
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,999
How many zeroes are there? One, two...

358
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
(2 million dollars)

359
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,840
Two million dollars?

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,209
I regretted it so badly.

361
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:48,580
In order to come back to you, I worked like a dog.

362
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,580
My business in Dubai was a success.

363
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,980
I owe it all to you.

364
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,849
Don't you dare try to dupe me.

365
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,089
Stuff like this can easily faked.

366
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,159
Don't you know how things are now?

367
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,359
And me? I have a boyfriend.

368
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,859
A boyfriend?

369
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,800
What a relief.

370
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,500
I thought I'd hurt you so bad, you'd gone off men completely.

371
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,000
That means...

372
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,070
there's still hope for me.

373
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,439
What hope?

374
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,310
Hope that Ju Ran...

375
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,209
could become mine once more.

376
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
Ju Ran.

377
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:32,949
Let's get back together.

378
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,188
I started a construction company in Korea,

379
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,688
and I got a huge investment.

380
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,330
Soon in Gagok District...

381
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,159
Gagok District?

382
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,699
Oh, that's it?

383
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,869
You showed your cards too soon.

384
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,399
In exchange for just two million, how much will you take from me?

385
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,138
"Hope?" "Reconciliation?"

386
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,010
That's just stupid.

387
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I really...

388
00:22:57,949 --> 00:23:00,379
don't care about your money at all.

389
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:02,219
I have more than enough people...

390
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,320
who are willing to invest.

391
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,820
Whenever you're ready,

392
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,330
come and see me.

393
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:14,230
I fly out in three days.

394
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,399
I hope you don't wait too long.

395
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,469
I'd like to see your smile again.

396
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,070
Think about what I said and call me.

397
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,419
The likes of him can't run a business.

398
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,840
Come this way.

399
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,040
How are things with your ex-wife?

400
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,249
I wronged her so badly, she won't come round.

401
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
Oh, dear.

402
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,750
Where's my guest?

403
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,919
Waiting in the private room.

404
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:15,260
- Thanks. - Sure.

405
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,439
Wait. Excuse me.

406
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,510
The man who just went upstairs. Kim Do Jin.

407
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,809
Mr. Kim the CEO, you mean?

408
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,379
Yes. Mr. Kim the CEO.

409
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:41,049
I have business with him.

410
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,320
I'm so sorry.

411
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,189
Mr. Kim said he'd no longer meet with investors.

412
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,689
As general manager of this hotel,

413
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,830
I respectfully ask you to leave.

414
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,060
- I... - Escort her out.

415
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,968
Do you know who I am? Don't treat me like a peddler.

416
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,169
I'm Mr. Kim's...

417
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,469
wife. I'm his wife.

418
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,409
Oh, my goodness.

419
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,310
How insolent of me. I apologize.

420
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,050
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

421
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:14,679
I'm very sorry.

422
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,050
I'm so very sorry.

423
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
He's in there.

424
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:35,439
This laughter...

425
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,169
Don't worry too much.

426
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,310

427
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,310
What is she doing here?

428
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,980
It's perfect. So admirable.

429
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,179
Thank you.

430
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,389
You must keep this investment a secret as well.

431
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,159
From Chairman Lee too.

432
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,699
Don't you worry.

433
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,699

Just like last time, I guarantee a 300-percent profit.

436
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,709
I trust in you.

437
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,249
- Don't worry. - She has lost her mind.

438
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,379
Why is she holding my man's hand?

439
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,520
- Shall we leave, then? - Sure.

440
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,859
- Don't forget this. - Thanks.

441
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,020
After you.

442
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:40,730
Three hundred percent?

443
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,270
Yes.

Thanks.

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,290

What he said was true.

457

How much is she investing?

and no one else's.

469
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:53,270
There were signs that someone wiped it down.

They wiped their prints off in that short time?

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,050
I was just passing by.

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,958
Aren't you on a break for a while?

Oh, well,

487
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,230
I had some sorting out to do at Children Home.

Sorry. Cancel dinner for me.

I can't.

496
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,580

You won't do something silly like propose, will you?

498
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,919
Goodness, how did you know?

499
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,230
Since it came to this, I can't wait any longer.

500

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,480

I hope you don't wait too long.

509

I refuse.

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,869
I'm leaving the country.

514
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,750
Are you...

515
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,159
seeing someone else?

516
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
I am.

517
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,060
Someone cool and capable.

518
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,300
Someone who doesn't know what I did...

519
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,230
and will make my life rosy.

520
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,469
This time,

521
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,199
I want to get a shot at a good life.

522
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,510
Forget witches like me, Chul Woo.

523
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:51,949

That girl...

525
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,719
will play my daughter?

Erica dropped out due to an injury.

527
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,159
Han Na's a genius when it comes to acting.

528
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,829
Do you hate it that much?

529
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,230
She memorized the script already.

530
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:10,000
The director gave the green light right away.

531
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,369
Because you abandoned me,

532
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,070
can you leave that easily?

533
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Mone.

534
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,840
When did you get here?

535
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,050
It's your first shoot. I had to come.

536
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,550
As a surprise, I also brought a food truck.

537
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,980
I'm excited already.

538
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,619
Thank you.

539
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,648
- Take good care of Mone for me. - She's awesome.

540
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:36,389
- Help her out. - Thank you.

541
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,060
Is she the girl playing your daughter?

542
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
No Han Na.

543
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,770
Right? The girl from the news.

544
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,010
Yes. I think so.

545
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,179
I see the chemistry.

546
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:07,119
I thought this before too,

547
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,459
but that child looks oddly similar to you, Mone.

548
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:12,830
Her gaze especially.

549
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,090
What?

550
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,379
Thanks for driving me home.

551
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,619
I'd like to come in for some tea.

552
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:43,219
Next time.

553
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Okay, then.

554
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:47,760
You must be tired. I'll hold back.

555
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,330
Excuse me.

556
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,449
What's your decision, Min Do Hyuk?

557
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,850
Your offer.

558
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,850
It'll turn it down.

559
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,400
You turned me down?

560
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,929
If that's what you say, fine.

561
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,369
Call me if you change your mind.

562
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,909
Darn it.

563
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,290
When did you get out of the car?

564
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:50,889
Just now.

565
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,830
Who was it?

566
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,330
It was just business.

567
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,060
I got boring news.

568
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,170
It's a shame to part like this.

569
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Sorry.

570
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,250
I know you're a great guy,

571
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,449
but I'm not prepared.

572
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,619
It's not your fault.

573
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:22,520
I was hasty.

574
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:25,790
I'll call you tomorrow.

575
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:29,900
Get back safely.

576
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,420
Can I trust Chan Sung?

577
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Yes.

578
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,860
He even gave me the security program.

579
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,230
I must trust him right now.

580
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:10,299
But...

581
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,869
what did Do Hyuk refuse?

582
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,818
- Long time no see. - Yes.

583
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,719
I was going to call you.

584
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,830
Who is this?

585
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:34,189
A guy I work with.

586
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,759
Don't mind him at all.

587
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,299
I'm Han Kyung Soo.

588
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,170
Yesterday evening, they all got together for a movie.

589
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,839
I don't know what movie it was.

590
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,569
- They watched a movie? - Yes.

591
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,839
But suddenly the alarm sounded, and it turned into a total mess.

592
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,210
What's important is...

593
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,880
that none of them fled or even left the room.

594
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,619
Do you remember what time that was?

595
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,819
The movie started at 7pm,

596
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,989
and that happened about 20 minutes in.

597
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,889
7:20pm.

598
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,059
System unlocked. Escape now.

599
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,360
Medusa is helping us.

600
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:19,369
Are you sure all seven were there?

601
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,869
Yes. I saw them myself.

602
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,279
Then one of them is Medusa.

603
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,819
There's one more thing.

604
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,290
Han Na will appear in Mone's movie.

605
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:44,699
Come on.

606
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:47,969
I know you're upset, but you must eat.

607
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,699
I don't want to eat!

608
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,698
I hate Han Na.

609
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:53,669
Why did we take in that beggar?

610
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,139
I lost my role to her and all the attention.

611
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:09,719
You're pretending to be pitiful on purpose, aren't you?

612
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:11,920
To steal my dad from me too?

613
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,560
Han Na. Leave that and get out.

614
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,298
No one will take your dad from you.

615
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,008
I hate how he's nice to her.

616
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:28,269
I hate how he only looks at her.

617
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,310
Mister.

618
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,110
I'm okay.

619
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,380
I see why Erica is upset.

620
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,119
Han Na.

621
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,250
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,630
I brought you here for my own selfish reasons.

623
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
No.

624
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,960
If I didn't have you,

625
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,869
I'd really be all alone.

626
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:57,170
Thank you.

627
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,619
I'll go read a book.

628
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,360
Don't you dare think of scolding Erica.

629
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,360
Even if it's you,

630
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,600
I won't put up with anyone who hurts my kid.

631
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,210
Even as an act,

632
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:36,880
can't you hug Erica or say something nice to her?

633
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,409
Is it that hard?

634
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:41,810
She yearns for your love. This is too cruel!

635
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,619
A father role was never part of the deal.

636
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,850
Han Na living with us wasn't part of the deal either.

637
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:48,989
Do you think I took her in because I liked her?

638
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,119
It was what you wanted.

639
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,258
Because she's the daughter of the woman you loved!

640
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:55,360
- Go Myoung Ji! - What, Yang Jin Mo?

641
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,629
You're not the only one who's holding back.

642
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,029
I'm holding back too.

643
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,799
So as much effort I put into caring for Han Na,

644
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,239
I want you to put into caring for Erica and Phillip.

645
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,520
What was the love we had?

646
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,549
Did you toy with me?

647
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,618
Did you use me?

648
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,789
Were you even worth...

649
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,029
Well, fine.

650
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,889
Let's say I toyed with you.

651
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,428
If that's what you want to hear,

652
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,100
I'll say it a thousand times.

653
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,969
This is your last chance.

654
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:40,040
If you go inside like this, you'll never...

655
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,210
see me again.

656
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:44,638
Can you live without me?

657
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,409
Will you be okay with that?

658
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,080
Will you?

659
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:53,319
- You were making a wish. - Yes.

660
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,119
I never took you on a decent date since we met.

661
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,460
Sorry.

662
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,159
In the future, let's go on a great date.

663
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,299
I'll treat you to a full course.

664
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,159
Get out of here.

665
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:07,469
Darling!

666
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,610
Why are you so darn cool?

667
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,610
I can't live a day without you.

668
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,178
Why couldn't I?

669
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:19,710
Our love wasn't that majestic.

670
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,250
You're a drug addict.

671
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:25,790
I swear I'm clean.

672
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,089
For you.

673
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,060
Did you? How commendable.

674
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,630
But I don't care.

675
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,630
Darling. Ju Ran!

676
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,029
Cha Ju Ran!

677
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:42,940
You can't do this out here.

678
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,298
- Leave. - Don't leave me!

679
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:48,669
Darling. Will you please explain?

680
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,810
Why are you doing this?

681
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,940
Honey, Ju Ran!

682
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,750
Ju Ran! I can't live without you.

683
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,219
- Please! - We'll call the police.

684
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
Calm down.

685
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,420
Cha Ju Ran is on her way up.

686
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,060
- Be prepared. - Okay.

687
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,589
I got it.

688
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,060
You're the woman who wanted to see me?

689
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,529
What do you want?

690
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,239
You need money, right?

691
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,600
Seduce Cha Ju Ran.

692
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,239
Get her life savings in a week.

693
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
Then you get a million dollars.

694
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,150
A million dollars? An actual million?

695
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,189
We have Yang Jin Mo,

696
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,129
the former Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs.

697
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,258
You recently stepped down as deputy mayor...

698
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,159
to run for office as mayor.

699
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,369
Is it true you'll run as an independent candidate?

700
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,638
Yes.

701
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:52,368
The mayor who appointed me ended up losing his job,

702
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,968
and joining a party...

703
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:55,940
to take his place just didn't seem right.

704
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,779
Isn't it because you weren't sure any party would nominate you?

705
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,580
No.

706
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,779
I think the mayor should be a servant to his people.

707
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,219
I will not be loyal to any party.

708
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,318
Can I ask you an aggressive question, then?

709
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,319
Sure.

710
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,428
Seoul National University...

711
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,159
law school professor Choi Mi Nam is your opponent,

712
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,629
and he raised the issue...

713
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,758
that you only have a middle-school diploma.

714
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:21,569
Would you like to refute that?

715
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,540
No, I don't.

716
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,769
My family was poor, so I dropped out of high school.

717
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,869
I joined the workforce earlier than most.

718
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:30,940
Is that illegal?

719
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,080
Does that disqualify me as a candidate?

720
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,049
I was an entertainer, a so-called clown.

721
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,289
But unlike someone else, I don't use an SNU degree...

722
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,650
to pathetically beg for votes.

723
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,759
I like your spirit.

724
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,830
I guess that must be why this person fell for you.

725
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:52,469
Let me introduce our secret guest.

726
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,000
Come on out.

727
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:58,799
Honey.

728
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,869
Are you surprised?

729
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:07,949
I saw you off this morning, and I'm still pleased to see you.

730
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,549
My dear wife Go Myoung Ji.

731
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,618
Welcome.

732
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,159
- Thanks for inviting me. - We're honoured.

733
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,420
Hello.

734
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,629
You used to teach high school art.

735
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,630
Yes.

736
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,929
Our viewers would love to hear exactly how you fell in love.

737
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:28,699
Who proposed to whom?

738
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:30,299
He proposed to me.

739
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,110
She had to be exhausted as a single mom of twins,

740
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:34,909
but we volunteered together,

741
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,909
and when I saw her care for the orphans so lovingly,

742
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:39,549
it was love at first sight.

743
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:43,080
(I love Yang Jin Mo)

744
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,619
- Thank you. - Good job.

745
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,730
You put on a good act.

746
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,389
So did you.

747
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,439
What are you doing here?

748
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,540
I'm here...

749
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,569
to support Yang Jin Mo, the future mayor of Seoul.

750
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,509
Did you identify Medusa?

751
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,650
We'll know in due time.

752
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:16,980
Can you...

753
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,049
excuse us?

754
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,330
When you become mayor,

755
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:33,630
make Gagok District a government-run project.

756
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,069
So TIKITAKA can buy the land for a dollar per every 3.3m².

757
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,969
You can do what you want with the budget.

758
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:42,110
Do you think that's even possible?

759
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:45,980
That's why I'm trying to make you mayor.

760
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,580
Before the public bid,

761
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:51,420
I'll make up a lie that TIKITAKA's the company...

762
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,150
to build a futuristic city.

763
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,489
What's your plan for this place?

764
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,389
I'll make the world's best data center complex.

765
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:02,630
A data center complex?

766
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:07,529
TIKITAKA, Save, Sungchan.

767
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,269
The data of all the country's major companies...

768
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,299
will be here.

769
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:18,179
Then I'll have all the information and power.

770
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,179
It's the dream my father couldn't realize.

771
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,380
How about working with me on it?

772
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:28,619
I'd be honoured.

773
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,729
Once I get what I want,

774
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,929
you and that kid will be gone forever.

775
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,270
Do you think I'll be satisfied with becoming mayor?

776
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,770
I'll go further and higher.

777
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,009
So you can never touch Han Na.

778
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,580
I want to withdraw every cent.

779
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,219
- I'm in a rush. Hurry up. - Okay.

780
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,959

You'll lose a great deal if you sell so urgently.

784
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:12,729
It's none of your business.

I can't take more than ten million.

00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,670
I went everywhere I could.

802
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,170
Right.

803
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,239
I even maxed out the cash loan on my credit cards.

804
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:01,409
Why did you go to that extent?

805
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:04,339
I really don't want to spend your money.

806
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,179
You wanted us to get back together and leave the country.

808

814

- Good job. - But...

820
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:51,960
now I'm thinking the one million dollar pay...

821
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,029
is a bit too little.

822
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:55,960

That's for Mone's safety.

873

It wasn't for Mone's safety.

00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,960
Geum La Hui!

920
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,900
Open the door.

921
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:34,670
We received a report of drug use.

922
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,130
We're going to force it open.

923
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,710
(Nam Chul Woo)

924
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:48,509
Nam Chul Woo,

925
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:51,119
you're under arrest for using drugs.

926
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,389
Thank you for cooperating.

927
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,419
- Let go! - What are you doing?

928
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,589
You punks. Do you know who I am?

929
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,690
I'm a detective.

930
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,099
Sure. I'm a detective too.

931
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,298
- Get him. - Okay...

932
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:06,429
Okay...

933
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,940
I'm a detective... Cha Ju Ran, my love...

934
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,170
Ju Ran...

935
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,819
Are you sure you're okay?

936
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:34,089
Are you absolutely sure?

937
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,230
I told you to mind your own business.

938
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:38,630
I'll be doomed if I get involved with you.

939
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,968
Watch out for Hwang Chan Sung. He's a dangerous man.

940
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:42,699
To me, you're the most dangerous.

941
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:45,170
My mom wouldn't have died if it hadn't been for you.

942
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,409
You saved Han Na. Why didn't you save my mom too?

943
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,639
You said Medusa contacted you.

944
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,980
Why didn't you save her?

945
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,279
Why didn't you?

946
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:23,579
(Thank you once again for protecting Han Na.)

947
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:27,650
Thank you once again for protecting Han Na.

948
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,079
I thought leaving Mone and Han Na...

949
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,489
would be the best for my daughter and granddaughter.

950
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,589
Will you please stay out of my life?

951
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,658
You got me in a huge mess.

952
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:42,089
Please, just leave me alone!

953
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,699
Just stay out of my life!

954
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:52,940
I'm sure there will be a chance to see Han Na and Mone again.

955
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,670
I'll look forward to that day.

956
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,580
Mom...

957
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:07,290
She came to see me...

958
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,690
She came to see me before leaving.

959
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,330
What have I done?

960
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:18,259
What have you done to Mom, Mone?

961
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:43,089
Thank you...

962
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,089
for handing my mom's last letter to me.

963
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,029
(Chan Sung)

964
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,440
Yes, Chan Sung.

965
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,710
What are you doing right now?

966
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:06,209
I'm taking a quick walk in front of my home.

967
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,210
I'll read scripts too.

968
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:08,679
I see.

969
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,449
On your own?

970
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:13,690
Yes.

971
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,159
Do you want to have dinner together?

972
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,029
You won't decline again, will you?

973
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:21,529
Sure.

974
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,360
Where should I meet you?

975
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,429
Okay. See you later.

976
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:29,969
Don't go.

977
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:31,600
If you go, break it off with him.

978
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,480
Mr. Hwang,

979
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,409
Ms. Han Mone is here.

980
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,630
It took you longer than I thought.

981
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:33,600
Was it difficult to find?

982
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:37,540
There was a bit of traffic.

983
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:40,210
I see.

984
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,049
Dinner's already set.

985
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:48,949
Come with me.

986
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,949
Are you afraid of me, Mone?

987
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,290
You're shaking right now.

988
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,000
Of course not.

989
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,270
Maybe it's because it's chilly out.

990
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,409
Let's hurry up and eat.

991
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,750
I hope to set some rules between us from now on.

992
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:04,659
No lying.

993
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,690
And...

994
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,799
No to meeting Min Do Hyuk.

995
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,770
He's a very dangerous person.

996
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:29,949
Let me ask you one more time.

997
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,190
Who were you with earlier?

998
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,719
I'll ask you for the last time.

999
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:07,989
Why...

1000
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,159
did you meet with Do Hyuk?

1001
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,860
Were you tailing me?

1002
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:31,409
That doesn't answer my question.

1003
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,500
All right.

1004
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:56,299
Let me repeat the rules. One...

1005
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,179
Get up.

1006
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:47,989
La Hui!

1007
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,130
You...

1008
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:05,869
Are you...

1009
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:09,210
Medusa?

1010
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,610
You are, aren't you?

1011
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,179
You're Medusa, right?

1012
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:15,179
Answer me!

1013
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,610
It's you!

1014
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:26,060
What are you thinking to have started this?

1015
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,960
Why did you approach Do Hyuk?

1016
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,690
How did you get the information from Save?

1017
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:36,130
Why do you care if I'm Medusa or not?

1018
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,239
You should go on your way,

1019
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:41,369
and I will mine.

1020
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,409
What are you thinking, La Hui?

1021
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,480
Don't tell me...

1022
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:52,750
you saw Da Mi's video that day.

1023
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,219
I mean the last record of Da Mi...

1024
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,529
that K had.

1025
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:09,270
I'm being punished.

1026
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,739
Punishment for what I did to my daughter.

1027
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:26,679
La Hui.

1028
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,920
Don't touch me.

1029
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:29,819
I don't need your help.

1030
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:39,060
Don't you know who I am?

1031
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,000
I'm the heartless...

1032
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,940
Geum La Hui.

1035
01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:39,259
Is this working?

1036
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:43,429
Hi, Mom and Dad.

1037
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,298
I was going to call you,

1038
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:48,369
but I figured you might want to see me.

1039
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:53,369
Look. I'm doing well over here.

1040
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,479
I'm eating well and sleeping well,

1041
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,639
so now my cheeks are chubby.

1042
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,778
My mom here is a great cook.

1043
01:08:04,779 --> 01:08:06,149
Even yesterday,

1044
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,588
she made me stir-fried anchovies and braised beef.

1045
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,250
They were so delicious.

1046
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,319
Now that you know,

1047
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:16,560
you can stop sending me food.

1048
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:21,969
My mom is a really cool person.

1049
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,270
She works hard, and she's passionate.

1050
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,969
I wish I could be more helpful,

1051
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,980
but for now, I still fall short.

1052
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,749
However, I promise to become a daughter who is loved.

1053
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:39,419
Right, the aquarium.

1054
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,219
Thank you so much for that.

1055
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:44,219
I'm so happy to have little siblings.

1056
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,088
You can stop worrying about me now.

1057
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:50,959
I want the two of you to take care. Okay?

1058
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,799
You believe me, don't you?

1059
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,450
Geum La Hui,

1060
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,650
you don't have the right to cry.

1061
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:23,530
You have no right to punish.

1062
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,400
You have no right to live.

1063
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:40,679
You don't even deserve to die.

1064
01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:47,219
You...

1065
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:54,929
