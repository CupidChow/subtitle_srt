00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,049
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

2
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,678
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,349
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,020
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,789
(Episode 3)

6
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,029
What is this?

7
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,550
Who dares to pretend to be Sim Jun Seok?

8
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,940
Long time no see, K.

9
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,770
Good job.

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,610
You revealed me to the world.

11
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,350
You managed to survive,

12
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:51,809
Min Do Hyuk.

13
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,550
How does it feel?

14
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,419
You ridiculed the world with your fake news,

15
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,419
but that news backstabbed you.

16
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,259
Tell me how it feels.

17
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,490
Wasn't it enough you died once?

18
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,330
Was that why you came looking for me?

19
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,698
Since I have nothing to lose,

20
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,229
I fear nothing.

21
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,568
You punk.

22
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,440
What are you trying to do? Do you want to fight?

23
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,769
Let's do it.

24
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:18,669
Give me your best shot.

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,280
I hope you had fun playing Lee Hwi So the hero.

26
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,949
Now that I'm back,

27
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,549
it's over for you.

28
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,620
You can try all you want,

29
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,019
but no one will trust you.

30
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,389
Sure. Let's find out.

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,400
We'll meet again soon.

32
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,930
Until then, take care,

33
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,199
Sim Jun Seok.

34
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
K.

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Darn it.

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,560
How is he still alive? This is impossible!

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Min Do Hyuk...

38
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,940
Min Do Hyuk is still alive.

39
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,949
He was in front of me just a moment ago.

40
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,048
He had my mask on his face...

41
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,690
and ridiculed me!

42
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,690
Now everything makes sense.

43
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,690
That was why Michell disappeared.

44
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,630
There must be a traitor among us.

45
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,329
What?

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,530
For now, I'll gather everyone up.

47
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,440
We'll be able to track down the traitor from their reaction.

48
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,210
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,979
What do you mean Min Do Hyuk's still alive?

50
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,910
We have to go see Matthew. Get ready.

51
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,720
(Yang Jin Mo)

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,258
Hello?

53
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,259
We must meet right now. Just the two of us.

54
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,220
Tell me the truth.

55
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,378
Were you secretly in touch with Min Do Hyuk?

56
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,189
Did you know he was alive? Tell me!

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,660
Are you suspecting me?

58
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,359
I didn't know at all.

59
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,789
What about you?

60
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,929
How do you think I found out?

61
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,439
Hey.

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,669
You know where Han Na is, don't you?

63
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,080
If you keep that kid, you'll end up in danger.

64
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,840
Take her to an orphanage soon.

65
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,879
Or we both die!

66
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,049
We'll live in hiding forever,

67
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,590
so don't worry and leave.

68
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,089
I won't call you even if I'm going to die.

69
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,489
So go. Go now.

70
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,929
You know, don't you?

71
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,629
Are you in contact with Han Na?

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,260
I already told you, I don't know.

73
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
I get it now.

74
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,129
Are you using me as a sacrifice to earn brownie points?

75
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,539
You can try, but we're in this together.

76
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,640
Both of us knew Han Na was alive,

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,210
but neither of us said anything.

78
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,650
Matthew can never find out.

79
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,650
If he does, Han Na will die...

80
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
and so will we.

81
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,470
What are you two doing here?

82
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:06,939
No way.

83
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,839
You're the Deputy Mayor of Seoul.

84
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,109
You wouldn't be having an affair with Mone, would you?

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,609
Stop talking nonsense.

86
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,878
- Come out. - Gosh.

87
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,879
My head was stuck.

88
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,720
Are you sharing a secret or something?

89
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,150
It's not like that.

90
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,020
Someone suggested Mone become the Seoul ambassador,

91
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,559
so I was raising it up with her.

92
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,059
The Grim Reaper's at our heels,

93
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,960
and you're talking business?

94
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,559
Whether Min Do Hyuk is dead or alive,

95
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,270
we have to earn a living.

96
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,070
Well...

97
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,369
Anyway, I'll think about it and let you know.

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
All right.

99
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Who was it?

100
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,890
Who betrayed me?

101
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,400
I had Min Do Hyuk acquitted with my own mouth.

102
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,400
I was the one who said he was not Sim Jun Seok!

103
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,369
Tell me.

104
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,470
Who saved Min Do Hyuk?

105
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,210
Was it you?

106
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
You?

107
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Or you?

108
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,809
A year ago,

109
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:27,850
I was the first to shake hands with you.

110
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,049
You should never suspect me!

111
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,049
The gallery surely exploded then.

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,059
They even said they found a body on the news too.

113
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,189
Then whose body was that?

114
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,559
We thought it was Min Do Hyuk without a doubt.

115
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,169
Someone made a switch.

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,270
Min Do Hyuk was replaced with someone else.

117
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,039
Who could manage such a thing?

118
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,080
Could it be Michell?

119
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:59,749
Think about who Michell contacted under the table.

120
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,450
From the very beginning,

121
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,019
Michell used the documentary...

122
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,890
as an excuse to work with Min Do Hyuk...

123
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,059
to spy on us.

124
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,960
So it was you, Han Mone!

125
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,359
You were the one who told Michell that I was Sim Jun Seok.

126
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,669
I was only threatened constantly by Michell.

127
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,739
I never even met with Min Do Hyuk!

128
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,939
Yang Jin Mo is suspicious too.

129
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,770
We saw him having a private conversation...

130
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,608
with Mone in a car earlier.

131
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,410
It looked very secretive.

132
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:31,749
You're right.

133
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,580
They have a history of getting close to Min Do Hyuk.

134
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,219
This is why ex-convicts are always...

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,320
the first to get suspected.

136
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,460
What did you two talk about?

137
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,070
You're going to play the silent game?

138
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,399
Fine.

139
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,070
I'll help you...

140
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,070
find your voice.

141
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,139
Grab them.

142
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,479
How dare you betray me again?

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,290
Who should I kill first?

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Jin Mo.

145
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,790
Should I start with you?

146
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:20,629
This was why I met with Mone first.

147
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,830
I feared I'd be framed as the one who helped Min Do Hyuk!

148
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,868
Because I betrayed once,

149
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:27,299
my every move was under watch.

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,739
On top of that, by my wife!

151
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,009
I can vouch for this.

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,080
He has a full schedule every day.

153
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,149
There was no time for funny business.

154
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,249
Now that I think about it,

155
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,619
aren't you two...

156
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,988
the least watched?

157
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:45,119
What?

158
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,060
Are you taking his side since he's your husband now?

159
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,590
You call it a fake marriage, but I guess you two are lovebirds.

160
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,898
Why on earth would we work with Min Do Hyuk?

161
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,399
Because you two aren't the brightest...

162
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,600
of the bunch.

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,170
It might be easier to work with him.

164
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,108
Are you trying to pick a fight?

165
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,638
Yes. Let's fight.

166
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,839
What are you going to do about it?

167
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
- Where is Min Do Hyuk? - Hey.

168
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,449
- How dare you? - Go Myoung Ji.

169
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,449
- What? - You jerk!

170
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,249
Keep barking at each other...

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,850
until none of you are left.

172
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,290
- What is it? - Tell me if you want to die early.

173
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,118
- What? - You traitor!

174
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:25,189
- How dare you? - LUCA, turn on the television.

175
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,128
- How dare you? - "I Am a Natural Person Too."

176
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,599
For the very first time,

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,028
- we're airing live. - Everyone, quiet!

178
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,498
I can hear someone singing in that direction.

179
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,570
Let's go meet today's natural person.

180
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,340
I catch fish, I catch frogs

181
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,839
I forage medicinal herbs and catch frogs

182
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,778
I catch fish, I catch frogs

183
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,680
- I forage medicinal herbs - Stop!

184
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,550
- What? - Gosh.

185
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,479
Hold on a minute.

186
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,479
It's a celebrity.

187
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,950
You're a celebrity, right?

188
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,389
This is so cool.

189
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,219
Amazing. I'm so shocked.

190
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,629
I'm... What should I do?

191
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,659
He looks like a beggar.

192
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,759
It became very scary.

193
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,469
Whenever I turned on the TV, I saw my face on it.

194
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,868
Sim Jun Seok this, K that...

195
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,809
It was too scary.

196
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,569
I thought denying I wasn't them...

197
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,778
would get me locked up.

198
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,679
It wasn't like I could say I was them either.

199
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,710
It almost turned me insane.

200
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:21,180
Is he crazy?

201
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,920
All the comments are positive towards Min Do Hyuk.

202
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,350
The reaction is heated.

203
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,060
Meeting you led me to learn...

204
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,258
that you're a pure natural person.

205
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,128
("I Am a Natural Person Too")

206
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,529
But didn't Chairman Sim Yong call you his son...

207
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,729
at some point in time?

208
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,100
It's absurd.

209
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,839
He's the one who framed me...

210
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,309
as an impersonator of Sim Jun Seok.

211
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,479
It's a lie. He's definitely not my father.

212
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,378
Let me... Let me say it loud and clear here.

213
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,449
- Should I look that way? - Yes, that way.

214
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,949
I'm the son of hairdresser Jung Mi So...

215
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,349
in Deokseon.

216
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,789
Here, look. This is my mom,

217
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,259
my little brother, and me. Right?

218
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,258
This is my opinion.

219
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,929
- He got in a fight with Matthew... - He denied the fact...

220
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,589
he was Chairman Sim Yong's son.

221
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,258
- It's nonsense. - What is he scheming?

222
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,999
Actually, Chairman Lee and I...

223
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,139
both lost our families due to Sim Jun Seok.

224
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:20,310
Chairman Lee's name used to be Lee Hwi So.

225
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,479
His family and mine lived...

226
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,349
in the same building, just different floors.

227
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,350
Okay.

228
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,819
But due to the arson started by Sim Jun Seok,

229
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
both families were wiped out.

230
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,619
Lee Hwi So's wife and my mom...

231
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,960
My mom... I'm sorry, I need a moment.

232
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,560
He's targeting the public sentiment.

233
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,859
So many comments are cheering him on.

234
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,868
"No way, that poor family was his?"

235
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,340
"I remember. His brother graduated from law school with top honors."

236
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:50,839
"Poor Min Do Hyuk."

237
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,310
"He lost his family, then he was falsely accused."

238
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,479
Be quiet! Are you enjoying this?

239
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,550
I don't know how Chairman Lee found out,

240
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:01,478
but he came all the way to my house to find me.

241
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,219
He went on his knees...

242
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,589
and apologized.

243
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,748
I see.

244
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:09,289
He promised to be responsible for my life.

245
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,159
He offered me a job at TIKITAKA.

246
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,330
What an act! When did I ever do that?

247
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,659
Everyone,

248
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,629
it's really different.

249
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:19,768
Chairman Matthew Lee!

250
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,399
No, I keep forgetting this.

251
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,639
Mr. Lee Hwi So.

252
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,769
You'll protect me from Sim Jun Seok, right?

253
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,739
Is that punk making a fool of me?

254
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,379
Should I take care of him?

255
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,608
We must nip it in the bud.

256
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,080
Leaving him alone would keep us uneasy.

257
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,350
No.

258
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,050
"Keep your friends close..."

259
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,960
"and your enemies closer."

260
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,690
Do you really plan to bring Min Do Hyuk to TIKITAKA?

261
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,300
Why not?

262
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,659
We might be able to find...

263
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,300
his hidden helper while keeping him close.

264
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,639
Matthew, Matthew, my love

265
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,939
This isn't the time for this. Let me...

266
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,840
Let me cook a meal for you.

267
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,209
Day after day, the interest in Min Do Hyuk's interview is...

268
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,820
on the rise.

269
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,589
The clothes he wore on television were sold out.

270
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,888
Min Do Hyuk's fashion...

271
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,988
and Min Do Hyuk's recipe for kimchi fried rice...

272
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,059
are now the most searched online.

273
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,960
Among those in their 20s, it's a trend to copy Min Do Hyuk.

274
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,768
On short-form platforms, challenges copying...

275
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,869
Min Do Hyuk's dances and movements are popular.

276
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,608
There is an explosion of new memes...

277
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,969
wishing for the return of Min Do Hyuk from the wild.

278
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,709
On the portal website Save,

279
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,679
there is a popularity contest between Lee Hwi So and Min Do Hyuk.

280
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,580
(Who is the real national hero?)

281
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,649
Did you fact-check Michell's background?

282
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,820
Michell is Song Ji A's older sister.

283
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,220
It's also true Ji A went under trial as a law-breaching minor.

284
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,290
I also confirmed that Michell left for the US after that.

285
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,470
Did Song Ji A give birth to Sim Jun Seok's child?

286
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,070
That hasn't been confirmed yet.

287
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,340
All right.

288
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,940
Continue the research.

289
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,509
Yes, sir.

290
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,680
Min Do Hyuk...

291
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,580
Sungchan Group's heir knows...

292
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,790
how to make an appearance.

293
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,399
Did Michell arrive safely?

294
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:33,769
Yes.

295
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,239
She's much better now.

296
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:46,909
Do Hyuk.

297
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,619
Let me ask you for the last time.

298
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,690
Do you really plan to join TIKITAKA?

299
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,519
I need to get back...

300
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,359
Chairman Bang's two billion dollars.

301
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,930
Also,

302
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,200
I need to find a way to get through LUCA's firewall.

303
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,830
I'll be able to snatch Matthew's strongest weapon then.

304
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
You didn't forget what I asked you, did you?

305
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,810
We must find Han Na.

306
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:16,939
We have to find her...

307
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,050
before Matthew finds out she's alive.

308
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,879
All right.

309
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,350
I'll make sure to find her.

310
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,680
Look at that. It's dancing.

311
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,149
Hello... Don't I look cool?

312
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,119
Welcome, Min Do Hyuk.

313
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:08,429
Gosh, you got me flowers. Thank you.

314
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:14,399
This is a clean zone, so you don't have to worry.

315
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,198
TIKITAKA will...

316
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,569
exclusively take care of you, 24 hours a day.

317
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,639
"24 hours a day?"

318
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,439
That feels excessive.

319
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,080
By the way, where's Chairman Lee?

320
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,149
I'm so sorry...

321
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,480
for all the trouble you went through.

322
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,050
I apologize.

323
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,889
No, don't do that.

324
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,090
No, no. Don't.

325
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,489
This isn't how brothers treat each other.

326
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,289
I know you suffered...

327
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,629
due to the fake news too.

328
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,859
Shall we stand back up?

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,530
One, two, three.

330
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,139
We decided to become brothers.

331
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Right, Matthew?

332
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,369
Darn it!

333
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,639
Yes, Do Hyuk.

334
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,408
How is the hospital?

335
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,649
I love it so much!

336
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:58,879
How should I put it?

337
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,349
It makes me feel like I've become rich.

338
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,519
It can feel excessive,

339
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,819
but I also feel right at home.

340
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,050
I must have a knack for it.

341
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,260
Gosh. Anyway,

342
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,990
thank you for pampering me.

343
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,229
For a while, I'll be at ease even if a group...

344
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,060
of Sim Jun Seok's come at me. Thank you.

345
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:19,030
Thank you!

346
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,639
Don't get scared, you punk.

347
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:26,869
No way.

348
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,879
If it's a show you want,

349
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,250
I'll give you a show.

350
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,789
Shall we do that since the press is here?

351
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,090
We should make our fans happy. A heart?

352
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,290
- Let's make a heart. - A heart?

353
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
- Like this. - A heart.

354
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,658
We love you.

355
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:47,159
Thank you. We love you.

356
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:49,359
Mone will show you...

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,730
where you'll work.

358
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,570
Me?

359
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,939
Mone? It would be an honor.

360
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,669
Follow me.

361
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:13,919
How does it feel to live as a traitor under K?

362
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:17,830
I guess it's not as good as I thought.

363
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,159
You're shaking, aren't you?

364
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,429
Maybe you're scared of me and not K.

365
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,270
Because the fool you thought died came back from damnation?

366
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,209
Shut your mouth.

367
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,270
Was it fun?

368
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:38,080
Handing over Chairman Bang's money to side with K.

369
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:42,679
How pitiful.

370
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,850
Just to preserve your meager life,

371
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,090
you're pretending to be a happy star.

372
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,230
No one has the right to condemn me.

373
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,459
I don't care about loyalty when it comes to survival.

374
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,770
Did you abandon your own child for fear of death?

375
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,869
No Han Na.

376
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,939
Why would you mention her?

377
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,350
She has nothing to do with me.

378
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,080
K will think differently.

379
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,020
If he believes you deceived him.

380
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,320
Don't say a word.

381
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,659
Even if I were to go back, I'd do the same thing.

382
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,530
I always prioritize myself.

383
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,060
Nothing changes because you came back.

384
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,399
What kind of situation is this?

385
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,139
Come this way.

386
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,109
This is as far as I go. Get out.

387
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,368
- Stop! - Stop!

388
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,570
- Stop! - The people of Korea...

389
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,219
(We don't trust you anymore. Boycott Sungchan)

390
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,469
I kept my face clean today.

391
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,469
Aren't I smart?

392
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,570
You're a genius.

393
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,139
Your ideas improve each day.

394
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,179
I came here later just to avoid those punks.

395
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,049
But they insist on waiting to pelt me with eggs when I come to work.

396
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,580
And that passion?

397
00:21:58,449 --> 00:21:59,490
Is impressive, right?

398
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,760
Get changed first.

399
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,330
Soon, he will be here.

400
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,760
No!

401
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,899
I'll look more pitiful this way.

402
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,600
- Don't you think? - But the eggy smell...

403
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,869
Excuse me.

404
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,540
Chairman Lee.

405
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,020
It's all that punk's fault.

406
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,249
Jun Seok, that moron came back,

407
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,389
and this is how I'm treated for it.

408
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,219
You know that...

409
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,260
I had and have nothing to do with him, right?

410
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:41,330
Of course I do.

411
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:43,000
It must be hard on you.

412
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,629
Sorry.

413
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,070
Are you...

414
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,609
allergic to eggs too?

415
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,909
That dirtbag is.

416
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,649
Even if you end up selling all the other subsidiaries,

417
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,879
make sure you keep S Talk.

418
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,219
Anyway, I made up my mind.

419
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,320
I'll sell you all the remaining subsidiaries.

420
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:14,629
Will that improve my public image?

421
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,730
I'm sick of getting egged.

422
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,899
My dear stupid aunt.

423
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,070
I'd be so grateful if you'd do that.

424
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:25,469
I don't want to live here anymore.

425
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,540
What I want...

426
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,379
is cash.

427
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,679
You want to up the price?

428
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:37,719
I like how you catch on so quickly.

429
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,619
TIKITAKA isn't the only company that wants S Talk.

430
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,530
Just double the amount you offered.

431
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,099
A hundred million dollars.

432
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,030
Then I'll sign the papers even tomorrow.

433
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:56,699
Okay?

434
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,010
You bet.

435
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,909
You're so manly and so cool.

436
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:09,020
You're so nicely dressed. Just my type, I'd say.

437
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,959
Jun Seok. Take the bait.

438
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,800
What was it like to reunite with an old comrade?

439
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,399
I set it up on purpose.

440
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:32,069
If you think I'm helping Do Hyuk, you're mistaken.

441
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,138
Because you got Matthew to cancel the movie,

442
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,379
we suffered a huge loss.

443
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,179
How will you make up for it?

444
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:40,149
With Hwang Chan Sung.

445
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,719
What?

446
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:45,790
Did Matthew not tell you?

447
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,919
I scored him a meeting with Hwang Chan Sung.

448
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,859
Is that how you got to him?

449
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,329
To beat an opponent,

450
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,859
you must do something they can never do.

451
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,669
You never managed.

452
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,969
But it was easy for me because I'm Han Mone.

453
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,209
Exactly.

454
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:08,139
Because you're Han Mone, Matthew doesn't trust you.

455
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,109
You're a card he can throw out.

456
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,250
Your role is to set up a meeting with Hwang Chan Sung.

457
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,550
So...

458
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,619
my plan is to be Scheherazade from "Arabian Nights."

459
00:25:20,949 --> 00:25:22,919
Hwang Chan Sung is the main character.

460
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,629
Matthew will need him continuously.

461
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,500
I'll stay here a while.

462
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,629
I have time to kill before my ad.

463
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, can I ask for a coffee?

464
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,270
Sure you can.

465
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:43,280
Enjoy.

466
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,830
I'm sorry the coffee's cold.

467
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,570
That psycho.

468
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Boo!

469
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,770
TIKITAKA's Children Home got this for Mr. Min.

470
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,379
Here.

471
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,939
If you press the button on this safety bracelet,

472
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,379
it'll connect you with the local police...

473
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,449
and Chairman Lee.

474
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,418
If I just press this button here,

475
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,919
I can reach Chairman Lee right away?

476
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,990
That's right.

477
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:32,459
Can I test it to see how well it works?

478
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,359
Right now?

479
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,359
Chairman!

480
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,369
Save me.

481
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:41,199
A ghost.

482
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:45,109
Come and save me!

483
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,169
My gosh.

484
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:49,080
That lunatic.

485
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,770
Isn't he taking too long?

486
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,669
Do you think he can protect me from Sim Jun Seok this way?

487
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:19,009
He's too slow.

488
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,169
Still, I'll bear with it and wait.

489
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:35,520
This is insane. Ten minutes have passed.

490
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:37,219
What's wrong?

491
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:38,689
Sir!

492
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:40,530
Daddy's late.

493
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:42,899
Hey.

494
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,659
Are you okay?

495
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:47,969
I'm not okay.

496
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,368
If you take as long as ten minutes to get here,

497
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,469
I'll already be...

498
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:53,240
dead.

499
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,240
Look at that camera up there.

500
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:57,739
That scares me badly.

501
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,309
What if Sim Jun Seok were to hack the system...

502
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,249
and used it to watch me?

503
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,649
I'm so darn scared of him.

504
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,850
Take those cameras down.

505
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,819
Why are there so many?

506
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Okay.

507
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,059
Move it. Take the cameras down.

508
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,060
I don't like this either. I can't use it.

509
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,230
He could hack this too.

510
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,230
Get rid of them all! I'm really scared of them!

511
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:23,269
Get to it. Move fast.

512
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,770
Go on.

513
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:26,939
- Gosh. - Thanks.

514
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,050
Full. F...

515
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,979
F, that's here.

516
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,719
I got the F. Now I need a U.

517
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:40,649
U, here it is.

518
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,959
L.

519
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,659
You never used a PC before?

520
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,090
All I did on a PC was play games.

521
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,830
Leave it. We'll finish it up after lunch.

522
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,070
Okay. Then I'll concentrate on a game.

523
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,899
- Let's go out for lunch. - Okay.

524
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,149
He was within knife range,

525
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,820
and he shot me when he could've used a knife.

526
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,750
Oh, right. This headset has no mic.

527
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,389
I can't do anything because I'm a slow typist.

528
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,859
Enjoy your lunch.

529
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:26,929
(Search for missing child: No Han Na)

530
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,899

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,679
(Min Do Hyuk)

537
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,280
He's an utter moron.

538
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,490
Is he really Sim Yong's son?

539
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,240
(Is Matthew Lee really Lee Hwi So? Is he telling the truth?)

540

Here you go, ma'am.

545
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,540
I enjoy these meetings.

546
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,168
I squeeze in a facial...

547
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,740
and discuss the future with you.

548
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,409
Didn't your husband say you look different?

549
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:25,250
He never commented on things like that,

550
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:27,350
but he said my skin looked clearer,

551
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,060
and he touched my face.

552
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,020
My gosh. What then?

553
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:32,760
He asked if there was one for him.

554
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,030
I'll pack one for the mayor.

555
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:40,369
You're the ideal wife.

556
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,639
Hello, darling. It's me.

557
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,570
I'm with Myoung Ji.

558
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,510
Yes.

559
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:51,310
Get out right now.

560
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,709
Rumors about Chairman Lee are spreading.

561
00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:55,079
- What? - We must...

562
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,350
stay away from Mr. Yang too.

563
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,080
Okay.

564
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,359
Something urgent came up. I must go.

565
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Ma'am.

566
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,230
Take this with you.

567
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:10,699
No, thanks.

568
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Okay.

569
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,209
(Jang Jin Gu, Mayor of Seoul)

570
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,080
(Is Matthew Lee really Lee Hwi So? Is he telling the truth?)

571
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,550
You asked to see me, sir?

572
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:36,760
- Take a look at this. - Sure.

573
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,188
(Is Matthew Lee really Lee Hwi So?)

574
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:42,659
(Is he telling the truth?)

575
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,929
Do you believe fake news like this?

576
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:51,040
It was clearly proven that Chairman Lee is Lee Hwi So.

577
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,939
I started to wonder.

578
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:55,809
Why did Chairman Lee...

579
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,240
turn a lowly ex-CEO of an entertainment agency...

580
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,750
into the Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs?

581
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,250
At the expense of making a large donation.

582
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,389
Chairman Lee thinks you'll be the next president.

583
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,629
I'm thinking...

584
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,760
Chairman Lee...

585
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:20,600
will pose a problem for my bid for the presidency.

586
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:23,339
We'll say you resigned...

587
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,639
due to unforeseen personal reasons.

588
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,540
Today's your last day.

589
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:32,209
You'll cut ties with Chairman Lee?

590
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,520
You'll have to cough up the donations, then.

591
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,189
I doubt Chairman Lee would want that.

592
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,689
If word that he funded me were to get out,

593
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,090
his image as the national hero would take a nosedive.

594
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,459
The mayor's wife acted weird.

595
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:54,899
She got a call from her husband, then turned cold and left.

596
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,439
That goes for the mayor too.

597
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,009
(Min Do Hyuk joins Chairman Lee, a moving spectacle!)

598
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,209
(Is Matthew Lee really Lee Hwi So? Is he telling the truth?)

599
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,080
Comments are posted like crazy on all the articles.

600
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,309
"Is Matthew Lee really Lee Hwi So?"

601
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,980
"Is he telling the truth?"

602
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,480
The IDs are different, but the comments are the same.

603
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,089
It's not the work of one person.

604
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,360
They're using a macro program.

605
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,960
What was Min Do Hyuk like?

606
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,429
He played games all day.

607
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,428
I told him to type up a document,

608
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,730
but he's a moron who can't even type capital letters.

609
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,500
This is some impressive work.

610
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,569
If it's not Do Hyuk...

611
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,839
No. Lee Hwi So is dead.

612
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,710
We must take down the mayor.

613
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,479
If Jin Mo resigns as Deputy Mayor for Political Affairs,

614
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,119
that will affect our future plan.

615
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,819
Do you have a solution?

616
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,250
You bet I do.

617
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:49,060
At last, we have a reason to use...

618
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,259
the Children Home database.

619
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,730
Use the mayor's prints in the Children Home's database...

620
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,600
and expose him for bribery.

621
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,839
That's an option.

622
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,770
(To Yang Jin Mo, Title: Mayor's prints)

623
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:09,509
(Send)

624
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,549
(A token of my appreciation.)

625
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,730
This is it.

626
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,969
There we go.

627
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,869
How did it go with K?

628
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
It was awesome.

629
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,909
You should've seen the annoyed look on his face.

630
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:48,580
What about Han Na?

631
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,080
Don't feel let down already. You'll see her soon.

632
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,449
Do Hyuk.

633
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Hey.

634
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,520
Do you hear me? Hello?

635
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,159
- Ki Tak. - Do Hyuk.

636
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:01,960
Min Do Hyuk.

637
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,860
Congratulations on coming back alive.

638
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,600
- Who are you? - Medusa.

639
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,139
Medusa?

640
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,439
I could be your enemy or your ally.

641
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,509
What do you want?

642
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,610
Matthew's death.

643
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,408
And Geum La Hui's death.

644
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:20,409
What?

645
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,650
As of this moment, you must obey me at all costs.

646
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,850
You can't refuse.

647
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,258
Disobey and you'll be eliminated at any time.

648
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:30,360
Why should I do that?

649
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,060
Because your life's in my hands.

650
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:44,339
Like that.

651
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:46,909
Did you get your answer?

652
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:50,810
Here's something that'll make you trust me.

653
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:55,650
Tomorrow, a scandal will break out that will shake the political world.

654
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,150
What scandal?

655
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,619
Something about the mayor of Seoul.

656
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,989
TIKITAKA's secret chat isn't a secret.

657
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,830
Prove it.

658
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:09,759
This conversation is our secret.

659
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,830
Not even Kang Ki Tak can know.

660
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,869
Medusa knows Ki Tak's alive.

661
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,270
Don't forget my warning.

662
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,810
I'll be in touch around the same time tomorrow.

663
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,580
What happened, Do Hyuk?

664
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
Did K figure it out?

665
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,279
What happened?

666
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,420
It's nothing, Ki Tak. It was just a glitch.

667
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,949
I'll call you back later.

668
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,949
Sorry. Are you all right?

669
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,399
(Save will only publish the truth.)

670
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,900
(Save will only publish the truth.)

671
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:53,940
Min Do Hyuk.

672
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,139
We will now begin our secret joint mission.

673
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,819
To bring down K.

674
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,460
It's an honor to finally meet you.

675
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,230
I wanted to meet you so badly.

676
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,360
The honor is mine.

677
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,170
I'm drinking coffee with the nation's hero.

678
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,839
I wanted to meet you to...

679
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,739
I'm not interested.

680
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:33,080
I'll be direct, Ms. Han.

681
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:35,679
Will you be Save's model?

682
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,589
We asked the public who they thought should represent us,

683
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,020
and you were the top pick.

684
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:49,000
If you make an offer, I'll think about it.

685
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,900
Of course, Ms. Han would consider...

686
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:58,569
Hello?

687
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,980
Okay. I'll be right there.

688
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,520
There's an emergency briefing at Seoul City Hall.

689
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:11,619
I must head over there.

690
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,049
Sure thing.

691
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,850
You should go.

692
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Bye, then.

693
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,159
Right.

694
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:28,170
It seems like a topic you'd be interested in.

695
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,270
I kept my word, Ms. Han.

696
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,319
Check the facts as soon as possible.

697
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,889
What's the problem with that arrogant jerk?

698
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,830
I guess Mr. Yang released the mayor scandal.

699
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,069
Anyone who goes against me will be punished.

700
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,369
Don't worry.

701
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,670
I'll figure out Hwang Chan Sung's weakness.

702
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,350
- Deputy Mayor. - Any comments, sir?

703
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,880
What can you say about Mayor Jang?

704
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:17,479
There was talk that he was a future presidential candidate.

705
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,889
Is it true he bribed influential people with paintings?

706
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,658
His wife manages Si Han Gallery.

707
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:25,389
Is the rumor he used it to launder money true?

708
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,359
It's just a rumor so far.

709
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
His wife could've acted alone.

710
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,928
Until the truth comes out,

711
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,270
we'll crack down harshly on fake news.

712
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,928
Police found the mayor...

713
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:37,399
and his wife's prints on the evidence they seized.

714
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,369
Doesn't that mean he was involved too?

715
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:41,039
The investigation's ongoing,

716
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,679
so let's see what the police say.

717
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,880
I have nothing more to say. Thank you.

718
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:49,549
Matthew.

719
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:52,489
I did all this for myself, not for you.

720
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,860
I will use you to become Mayor of Seoul.

721
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,560
Only then will I get a chance to stomp all over you.

722
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,690
Chairman Lee. Things are going as we wished.

723
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:03,698
(Jang Jin Gu, Mayor of Seoul)

724
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:04,860
Mayor Jang.

725
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,630
He'll be gone by today.

726
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:14,738
(Seoul Mayor Jang Jin Gu...)

727
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,309
(to be questioned by prosecutors...)

728
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,839
(regarding artwork lobby)

729
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,980
The Seoul Mayor scandal.

730
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,319
It's as Medusa said.

731
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,049
How did she know in advance?

732
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,500
- Who are you? - Before you head to Save,

733
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,609
Chairman Lee would like to see you.

734
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,040
Say I'm not interested. I'm busy.

735
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:51,509
Then your son...

736
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,009
could get into trouble.

737
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:58,278
(Do Not Enter)

738
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:59,919
Are you aware...

739
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,790
your teenage son is a known school bully?

740
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,859
If his secret chats come out,

741
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,130
I doubt he'll get a chance to even consider a future.

742
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:13,770
No university would accept him even with his fancy background,

743
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,540
and he'd fail every job interview.

744
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,940
He'll be called a violent bully for the rest of his life.

745
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,810
All because he has a famous father.

746
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,179
You went through my son's messenger?

747
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,489
The secret chats aren't secret?

748
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,619
You framed me for lobbying with art, didn't you?

749
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,759
- What do you want? - For you to admit to everything...

750
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:45,360
and step down.

751
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,139
And the money you took from me.

752
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,170
I want it back.

753
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,949
A butterfly.

754
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:08,250
There's a flower.

755
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,299
She went to catch butterflies.

756
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,639
Why isn't she back yet?

757
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,130
Help me!

758
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,900
Grandma, I'm down here.

759
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,299
Grandma!

760
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,739
Grandma, I'm here. I'm down here.

Grandma.

769
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,850
My baby.

770
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,920
Hang in there. Granny's sorry.

771
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,350
It's my fault.

(Sampyeong Community Health Center)

773
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,929
What happened to her?

774
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,000
A viper bit her.

775
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,469
A viper bit her!

776
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,400
A snake?

777
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,799
Okay.

Are you her family?

779

you can't let people see her.

783

You can't...

784
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,920
say our names.

785

My name or Han Na's name.

You're her grandma?

793
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,350
I don't think so.

794
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,279
And you don't know her name?

795
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,548
You're lying.

796
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,520
You stole a kid and put her to work.

797
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:32,460
You must come with us.

798
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,230

Hello?

802
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,309
This is Sampyeong Police Substation.

803
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,940
An old lady wants to talk to you.

804
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,239
Just a moment.

805
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,020
What's wrong? Why are you with the police?

806
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,889
What are you doing there?

807
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,520
Han Na was hurt.

808
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:04,759
What?

809
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,230
We went to a clinic and the police came and asked for Han Na's name.

810
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,868
I'll come to you.

811
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,968
Don't you say a word. Okay?

812
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:15,969
Okay.

813
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,779
Where are you going in such a rush?

814
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,719
I forgot I booked a massage.

815
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
Han Mone?

816
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:02,679
Hello. I can vouch for her.

817
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,619
She's not a kidnapper.

818
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,350
Even if you vouch for her,

819
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,250
she failed to give the child's name.

820
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,790
Child Welfare will send someone.

821
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,089
What?

822
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:15,159
What did he say?

823
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,069
The child's name is Han Na. No Han Na.

824
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,299
Her mom died recently, and she was orphaned.

825
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,139
I'm her benefactor.

826
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:29,610
Han Na.

827
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:33,080
Did something happen to her?

828
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,179
It's only a matter of time until Han Na's existence becomes known.

829
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,150
I just have to beat them to it.

830
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,560
Hello?

831
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:47,589
What?

832
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,400
That brat, Han Na, is alive?

833
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,360
We have to catch Han Na this instant.

834
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:54,299
If Min Do Hyuk's side finds out about this,

835
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:57,000
they'll use Han Na to reveal your identity.

836
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,238
Who has been keeping that brat hidden?

837
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,239
Which jerk?

838
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:04,909
It was Mone.

839
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,110
Mone's birth mom has been looking after Han Na.

840
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,449
That darned wench!

841
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:11,980
Where is she right now?

842
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,589
- Where is she? - There.

843
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,758
They got the poison out for now,

844
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:23,600
but she won't wake up.

Is this the massage shop?

847

If you're looking for Han Na,

848
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,350
she's not here.

849
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,798
Did you already tell Matthew everything?

850
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:02,568
This is a great chance to get rid of you.

851
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:03,699
Would I miss such an opportunity?

852
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:08,639
What about Han Na?

853
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,279
I'll see you later, baby.

854
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,860
But what about Han Na?

855
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,400
As soon as you get out of here,

856
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,630
go and hide yourself somewhere, okay?

857
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:36,739
Don't wander around.

858
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:38,069
Got it?

859
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:39,810
Just stay hidden somewhere!

860
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:41,839
Darn you!

861
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,779
I won't go.

862
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,290
Han Na will be looking for me!

863
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,290
Calm down!

864
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,819
Calm down and listen to me!

865
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,259
I will find Han Na.

866
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,529
You need to stay alive to meet her again.

867
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,759
Is Nam Chul Woo on duty today?

868
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Darn it.

869
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,000
Min Do Hyuk, find No Han Na this instant.

870
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,270
How do you know No Han Na?

871
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,069
Matthew is after No Han Na.

872
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,770
The location is Sampyeong Community Health Center.

882
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,769
I think Matthew has found out about Han Na's existence.

883
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,770

00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,650
Didn't you hear me?

919
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:52,119
Bring me your sister!

920
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,389
Yes, sir. Got it, sir.

921
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:00,730
Darn it.

922
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:09,029
Do Hyuk.

923
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,009
Han Na.

924
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,540
Are you awake?

925
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,739
Don't be afraid.

926
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,679
We're your mom's friends.

927
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,779
You saw me outside the house before, right?

928
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,279
Mom!

929
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:29,819
Why did you come outside in the cold?

930
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,589
Who are you, mister?

931
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:35,790
Well...

932
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,259
I'm a close friend of your mom's.

933
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,839
But where is my grandma?

934
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:48,040
Han Na, we're looking for her now too.

935
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:50,040
Do you perhaps know...

936
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,279
someplace where Grandma might be?

937
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:53,779
Well...

938
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:57,179
The old house in Sampyeong.

939
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,679
I promised Grandma.

940
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,520
Wherever we lose each other, we'll find our way back home.

941
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,630
Grandma said she'd wait there.

942
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:28,380
Grandma!

943
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,830
Grandma. You were really scared because of me, weren't you?

944
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,500
I'm sorry.

945
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,170
It's okay.

946
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,339
Grandma!

947
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,150
Do Hyuk!

948
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,750
My son!

949
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:07,819
Goodness.

950
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:09,250
Gosh.

951
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:11,818
You didn't come home for days.

952
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:13,758
What have you been up to?

953
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:15,888
I thought my eyes would go blind from missing you so much.

954
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:19,059
You were squatting while waiting for me again, weren't you?

955
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,068
I told you not to do that!

956
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:22,499
If you do, you'll damage your knees and bother you when you're old.

957
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,040
Who cares about that?

958
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,000
It's fine as long as you're back in one piece.

959
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,969
That's all that matters to me.

960
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,408
I will always wait for you until you return,

961
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,580
time and time again.

962
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,949
My mom and brother are inside.

963
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,420
Let me go!

964
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,650
Back up!

965
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,219
Mom!

966
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,230
No!

967
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:02,838
These guys saved me.

968
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:03,839
They saved you?

969
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,139
Thank you.

970
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,080
Thank you.

971
00:59:14,449 --> 00:59:16,488
Wait, you are...

972
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:17,520
Ma'am.

973
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:21,389
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

974
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,500
From now on,

975
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,299
Han Na will become the most famous child in Korea.

976
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,400
I've made it seem like Sim Jun Seok has kidnapped Han Na.

977
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,540
This is the only way to save Han Na.

978
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:37,580
Making her a child that Chairman Lee can never touch.

979
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,679
Making her famous enough...

980
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:42,110
for everyone in this world to recognize her.

981
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:46,449
Han Na.

982
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:48,920
Things might get harder from now on.

983
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,520
But in order for you to be safe with Grandma,

984
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,290
you must go through this at least once.

985
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,460
Still, if you don't want to do this,

986
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:58,529
I'll stop things now.

987
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,270
I can do it.

988
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,540
I'll do anything.

989
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:12,339
If I want to live happily with my grandma,

990
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,610
I have to do as you say, right?

991
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:19,619
I can do it.

992
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:23,119
Good, Han Na.

993
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,420
Then,

994
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,360
let's do this together.

995
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,360
There's trouble.

996
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:36,270
Sim Jun Seok has posted a murder notice.

997
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,969
What are you talking about?

998
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,468
I'm Sim Jun Seok!

999
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,039
That's a deepfake video!

1000
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,210
(Sim Jun Seok's murder warning?)

1001
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,908
Lee Hwi So.

1002
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:49,448
(I have Han Na.)

1003
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:51,779
No Han Na, the girl you're sponsoring.

1004
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,420
I have her with me.

1005
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,560
I hear you especially cherish that girl very much.

1006
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:03,560
I've just registered No Han Na's information on TIKITAKA's system.

1007
01:01:04,299 --> 01:01:06,899
So, find her if you can.

1008
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,298
(If you can't find me until noon tomorrow, )

1009
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:09,770
(No Han Ha will die. - K)

1010
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,170
What's going on?

1011
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:25,250
(Remaining time, 7 hours 33 minutes)

1012
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,190
Is that girl...

1013
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,960
such an important child to you?

1014
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,369
Why is that?

1015
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:45,440
Because she's the daughter of the woman you loved?

1016
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:47,839
I have to go.

1017
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,440
Don't go. Stop!

1018
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:53,610
If you leave now, I'll tell Matthew everything.

1019
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,209
I'll tell him you've been looking for her the whole time,

1020
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,080
and that you knew she was alive from the very beginning!

1021
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,489
So, don't do anything...

1022
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,719
unless you want to get caught up with Mone and suspected.

1023
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,400
Just stay home.

1024
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,799
Please don't do anything.

1025
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,639
I don't want you to get hurt.

1026
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:26,380
(Remaining time, 3 hours 50 minutes)

1027
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,920
(I'm disappointed that you still haven't caught me, Matthew Lee.)

1028
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,319
What is that about?

1029
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,819

(No... Mr. Lee Hwi So.)

Why don't you make a statement for now?

1040
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,569
We must get the public opinion on our side.

1041
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,299

1045
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,119
LUCA, find out the hacking route of the screens at Gwanghwamun.

1046

Unable to enter the hacking route.

1047
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,028
Cannot identify the hacking route.

1048
01:03:48,029 --> 01:03:50,259
That doesn't make sense. What's wrong with LUCA?

1049
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:52,029
Hang on.

1050
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,500
Turn off LUCA.

1051
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:55,069
I think you have spyware.

1052
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:04,609

Darn it!

1055
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,420
LUCA has become a piece of trash!

behind Min Do Hyuk.

1059
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:29,069
I know that too.

There is only one person...

1061
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,440
who is capable of doing this.

1062
01:04:35,969 --> 01:04:37,239
Lee Hwi So.

1063
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,710
There will be many people for you to fight from now on.

1064
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,150
Lee Hwi So, who is already dead,

1065
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:46,380
and yourself, Sim Jun Seok.

1066
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:49,690
You will fight until you're covered in blood...

Who's behind Min Do Hyuk?

1070
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,460
Is it Lee Hwi So?

1071
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,369
I don't know. I really don't know anything.

1072
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,540
Lies.

1073
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:40,639
She won't open up easily anyway.

1074
01:05:42,469 --> 01:05:43,469
Just kill her.

1075
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:46,080
She'll only become an obstacle in our path.

1076
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,380

your own death.

Don't touch my mom.

She's just an old, powerless woman who can't speak.

1083
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,699
She's a poor woman who had to live in hiding because of me!

1084

Han Cheong Soo! Say something!

1085
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,339
There's no reason to hesitate. Just kill her.

1086
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,610
Go on.
