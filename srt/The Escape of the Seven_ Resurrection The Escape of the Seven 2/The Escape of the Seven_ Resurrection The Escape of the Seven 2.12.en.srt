00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,119
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

2
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,748
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,288
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,990
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,759
(Episode 12)

6
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,329
Safe!

7
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,770
Oh, you arrived right on time.

8
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,399
It's exactly ten minutes before the press conference.

9
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:11,740
- Out of the way. - Gosh!

10
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,009
Don't you dare lay a finger on our chairwoman.

11
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,509
It's fine.

12
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,679
What's so frightening about this nobody?

13
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,050
Jun Seok. Gosh, I'm so sorry about this.

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,190
Sadly, you came to the wrong place.

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,690
This isn't where they're having the press conference.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,800
How does it feel to be fooled by false information?

17
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,069
Gosh, darn it!

18
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,270
Capture that little thief right away.

19
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,970
Don't move!

20
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,209
Come at me if you want to die.

21
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,580
That little...

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,580
Darn it!

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,449
That darned coward.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,479
How dare they play games with me?

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
LUCA.

26
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,889
Track the locations of the reporters who have been invited to...

27
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,919
Hwang Chan Sung's place today.

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,220
Yes, tracking location now.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,100
Now, please look at the truth.

30
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,530
Please look carefully at our faces.

31
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:14,299
We are...

32
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,769
the real offenders who ignored the truth about the Bobble incident,

33
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,639
consistently told lies,

34
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,509
and made the serial killer K...

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,410
into a national hero.

36
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:31,489
As of today,

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,319
I will permanently retire from the entertainment industry...

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,229
and gladly receive any punishment...

39
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,759
for the crimes I have committed.

40
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,470
Shouldn't you confess to the police first?

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,939
If all of you make statements,

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,639
it'll be hard for Chairman Lee to get away with it as well.

43
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,210
First, in order to break down the lies,

44
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,579
we need reporters who will deliver the real information.

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,039
The fact that Matthew isn't Lee Hwi So...

46
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,079
has to be believable for this to work.

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,720
The whole nation must know...

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,590
that the serial killer K has stolen Lee Hwi So's technology.

49
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,250
Then, what about K who committed suicide?

50
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,190
Who on earth was that man?

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,060
He was working for Matthew.

52
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,560
He's my brother, Han Cheong Soo.

53
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,400
Also, I will divorce the domestic violence offender,

54
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,900
Hwang Chan Sung.

55
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,239
Do you mean it's true that you were a victim of domestic violence?

56
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes, that's true.

57
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,079
("Serial Killer K Stole Everything Belonging to Lee Hwi So")

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,079
How can we believe that what you are saying is the truth?

59
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,350
What if you people are lying right now?

60
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,960
What if you're trapping us in here and forcing us to write articles?

61
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,530
Can you prove what sets you apart from the Matthew you speak of?

62
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:46,859
We have no intention of forcing you.

63
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Whether you will write an article or not will be up to you.

64
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,900
We simply believe in your journalism, conviction,

65
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,910
pride, and sense of duty.

66
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,509
What? Why won't it upload?

67
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,250
My phone isn't working either.

68
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,978
- What? - All networks are down.

69
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,078
- What's this? - What?

70
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,720
- Look here. - Nothing is working.

71
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,819
What is this?

72
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,789
It's a DDoS attack.

73
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,029
Not just this building but the surrounding area...

74
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,299
is also being jammed.

75
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,629
It's K's doing.

76
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,770
K caught on to our plans, even our location.

77
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,669
DDoS attack is complete.

78
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,539
Good job, LUCA.

79
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,640
Try and run amok all you want.

80
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:36,780
You guys can't beat me, even in your next lives.

81
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,210
This is possible?

82
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,789
Was LUCA this powerful?

83
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,789
Currently, the surrounding area is experiencing network failure...

84
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,489
due to Matthew's attack.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,530
Unfortunately, we will have to change locations.

86
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,859
So, those of you who would like to come with us,

87
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,400
raise your hand.

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Please show us your courage...

89
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,700
so that the truth does not get covered up.

90
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,340
Is this a failure?

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
I will go.

92
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,320
If this guy has so much to hide that he even launched a DDoS attack,

93
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,760
I want to dig up his secrets, even if it obstructs my plans.

94
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:28,400
I will bet my own name and trust your word.

95
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,070
I will go as well.

96
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,439
Me too.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,070
How dare he try to stop a reporter from writing an article?

98
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,070
- I'll go too. - Me too.

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,678
- I'll go as well. - I will go.

100
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,739
I will join you.

101
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,049
We've done it.

102
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:48,419
We'll be able to start now.

103
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,720
Thank you for trusting us.

104
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,590
Then, please write your articles once we move to a different area.

105
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:55,359
We'll take you to a safe hotel.

106
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,029
Also, K might track your locations,

107
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,830
so be sure to turn off your phones.

108
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,058
Everyone, gather your belongings and follow me.

109
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,830
There isn't much time. This way.

110
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,039
Everyone, go to where the kids are.

111
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,179
K might send people that way.

112
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,279
- Okay. - Let's hurry.

113
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,308
- Yes. - Let's go.

114
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:20,320
Hurry.

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,249
I'll come with you.

116
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,850
I promised the kids...

117
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,489
that I would catch the jerk who did this to their mom.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,859
We're going to take a two-track approach.

119
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,559
The reporters will write their articles,

120
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,890
and we will post our confession video on S Talk.

121
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,489
Let's see this through to the end today.

122
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,229
They moved all at once in a van.

123
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:41,869
They're planning on posting their articles in a new location.

124
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,399
LUCA.

125
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,510
Track their locations. You can't let them get away.

126
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,140
Yes, Chairman.

127
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,410
Hwang Chan Sung. There's something you can do for me.

128
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,650
If we act according to my plan, we can stop them.

129
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,510
Just say the word.

130
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,118
Darn it, why aren't the articles being posted?

131
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,788
Things should've gone crazy by now.

132
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:58,919
Try calling.

133
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,590
Okay.

134
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,289
Grandma.

135
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,999
The men who are protecting us are collapsed on the ground.

136
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:09,499
What?

137
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,470
Mom.

138
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,270
We have to take the kids and run away right now.

139
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,070
Han Na.

140
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,079
You kids should run away out the back door upstairs.

141
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Hurry up!

142
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,509
Mom, you too!

143
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,720
It'll be too hard for you. Let's do it together.

144
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,580
No, Mom! Just go now!

145
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,889
Han Na, take the twins and run away!

146
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,160
Okay, Grandma. You have to be careful too.

147
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:37,859
Come this way.

148
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,039
- Mom. - Go through the whole place!

149
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,308
Who are you people?

150
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,109
You can't just come in as you wish!

151
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,918
The kids aren't here. Go upstairs.

152
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:03,989
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

153
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,960
Is this the police? Someone has broken into my house.

154
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,059
- Please come quickly... - Darn it.

155
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,100
- Mom. - Sir, the kids aren't here.

156
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,570
I think they've already run off.

157
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,210
Go outside and find them now. There are three of them.

158
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,840
Catch at least one of them.

159
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,379
No!

160
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,179
You can't go!

161
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,650
Hey, you jerks. You call yourselves human?

162
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,979
How can you even think of hurting the kids?

163
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,200
Let's go that way.

164
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,139
Hurry up and find them!

165
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,939
There's 1 boy and 2 girls.

166
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,139
- Spread out! - Yes, sir!

167
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,840
Hey, follow me!

168
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,379
Now is the time. Let's run away.

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,460
My feet won't move.

170
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,359
Erica, what are you doing? Hurry!

171
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,389
I can't get myself to move.

172
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,859
Erica, don't be scared.

173
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:25,170
Think of this as acting.

174
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,940
- Acting? - Yes, acting.

175
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,619
There are cameras, and the director is there too.

176
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,820
We are running away from the bad guys right now.

177
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,119
Erica.

178
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,889
You can do it.

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Mom.

180
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,269
Mom is watching me.

181
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,170
I'm not scared.

182
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,970
We will defeat the bad guys.

183
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,279
In cartoons, the ones who save the world...

184
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,639
are little kids, just like us.

185
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,279
We will never lose to the bad guys.

186
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,649
Let's go.

187
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,238
Darn it, you old hag.

188
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,379
Do you have a death wish?

189
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Darn it!

190
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,249
No.

191
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,550
Don't hit my mom.

192
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,720
Then, just die with her.

193
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,430
Why, you little punk.

194
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,430
Mom!

195
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:04,430
Mom.

196
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,570
Are you okay?

197
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
What about the kids?

198
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,268
They ran away, but those jerks chased after them.

199
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,508
Mone, you stay with your mom. We'll find the kids.

200
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,570
- Chul Woo, hurry. - All right.

201
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,109
You little...

202
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,310
Dr. Cha. Mr. Nam.

203
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,279
Please, I'm begging you.

204
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,720
Be sure to find the kids.

205
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,149
Please.

206
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,759
- Okay. - We will.

207
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,229
You were scared, weren't you?

208
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,659
Get up.

209
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,629
Were you hurt? Let me see.

210
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,269
I'm okay.

211
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:45,609
Han Na and the twins have to be okay.

212
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,769
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

213
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,839
- Ms. Cha! - Yes.

214
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,769
- Ms. Cha! - Oh, goodness.

215
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,709
- Yes. - Ms. Cha.

216
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,779
Ms. Cha.

217
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,479
We found the kids. Don't worry too much.

218
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,019
Mom, they found the kids.

219
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,720
Thank you. Thank you so much.

220
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
Who is it?

221
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,509
Didn't you turn off your phone?

222
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,249
Mr. Min said so earlier.

223
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,679
Our locations could be tracked through TIKITAKA Talk,

224
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
so we should turn our phones off.

225
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,519
I'm sorry. I thought I had turned it off.

226
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,590
My goodness.

227
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:14,999
What...

228
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,629
What's going on?

229
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,129
Hey.

230
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,170
- What... - Sit tight.

231
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,639
Who are you people?

232
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,409
Did Chairman Lee make you do this?

233
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,909
Hey, you with the phone.

234
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,649
Stop that unless you want to die.

235
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,379
From now on, raise your phones above your heads and turn them on.

236
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,450
Now!

237
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,359
Get going.

238
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,039
Get out quickly!

239
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,108
- Get out! - Let's go!

240
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,779
- Come on. Get out. - Hurry up!

241
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,109
- Hurry up and get out! - Go!

242
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,950
- Get over here! - Get out quickly.

243
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,519
Come on!

244
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,649
All right.

245
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,388
- Let's go. - Move!

246
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,989
- Come on! - Go!

247
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,599
- Down on your knees! - Get down.

248
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
- Kneel. - Kneel!

249
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,430
- Kneel! - Kneel!

250
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,210
Gosh.

251
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,279
I'm sorry this place is so shabby.

252
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,608
What kind of nonsense is this, Chairman Lee?

253
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,080
What do you mean by "nonsense?"

254
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,389
I'm just trying to protect you from those who are trying...

255
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,190
to distort the truth and cover it up.

256
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:49,619
Protect us?

257
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,159
Aren't you just trying to cover our eyes and plug our ears?

258
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,229
Reporter Byun.

259
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,600
The one who's covering your eyes and plugging your ears...

260
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,470
is yourself.

261
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:05,310
Do you know that your wife bought land in the Gagok District?

262
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,269
Enough of that ridiculous nonsense!

263
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,979
My wife doesn't know how to do such a thing.

264
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,749
I'm sure.

265
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,350
You must've lived your whole life listening to your wife's lies.

266
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,389
Humans are...

267
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,720
naturally vulnerable to fake news.

268
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,728
That's because the fake stuff is...

269
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,529
more provocative and thrilling than real news.

270
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,729
And sometimes,

271
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,999
fake news ends up becoming the real news.

272
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,670
Just like you.

273
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,170
Serial killer, Sim Jun Seok!

274
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,019
You're nothing but a murderer.

275
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,450
You were despicable enough to act like a national hero.

276
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:53,950
Don't think of us as pushovers.

277
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,720
People may criticize us and call us trashy journalists,

278
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,859
but we have enough of a conscience not to make a murderer...

279
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,529
into a national hero.

280
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,529
You...

281
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,330
made a mistake by taking us on.

282
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,369
No.

283
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,810
You will not be able to stop us.

284
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,379
I will show you what true journalism is about.

285
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:27,859
Will you actually...

286
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,159
be able to do that?

287
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,590
- LUCA. - Yes, Chairman.

288
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,800
The family chats of all the righteous reporters here.

289
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,430
Send them all now.

290
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,269
Sending, start.

291
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,249
What...

292
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,690
All right! Take a look over here!

293
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:02,259
(Byun Young Chul's wife, Jang Young Kyu's wife)

294
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,030
What?

295
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,699
You crazy, evil jerk.

296
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,179
Weren't these private messages?

297
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,719
You went on about how they were automatically deleted.

298
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,148
But have you been collecting all of our conversations?

299
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,619
Of course. That's my real weapon.

300
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:36,189
Now,

301
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,290
do you get a sense of the situation?

302
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,300
The moment these are revealed,

303
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:51,070
it will be revealed to the whole world...

304
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,740
just how hypocritical and delusional...

305
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,709
that journalism you people keep raving about really is.

306
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,980
Manipulating public opinion is a piece of cake.

307
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,320
Just by revealing a piece of your family's personal information,

308
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,790
people will crowd around like hungry hyenas...

309
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,050
to rip them to shreds and gobble them all up.

310
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,090
Then,

311
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,459
some of your family members might not be able to withstand it...

312
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,929
and end up choosing to end their own lives.

313
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,570
The people who would've caused their deaths...

314
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,070
would be you guys. You murderers.

315
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:28,209
If you think those kinds of threats will actually work,

316
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,810
you're wrong.

317
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,550
Why is it so hard to get through to a smart man like you?

318
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:38,389
Then,

319
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,889
what if I use a method...

320
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,359
that's a little more savage?

321
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,399
What...

322
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:51,899
All right.

323
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,669
Who else wants to die?

324
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,709
That darned jerk...

325
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,868
- No, sir! Don't do it! - Mr. Byun!

326
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,109
Let go of me.

327
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,119
Okay?

328
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,290
We have an agreement, right?

329
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,590
Then, I'll tell you what I want.

330
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:21,830
Forget all about what you saw and heard today.

331
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,469
From now on, write articles...

332
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,869
based on exactly what I say.

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,769
What are they all doing?

334
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,439
Why aren't the articles being posted?

335
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:35,010
(S Talk)

336
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:39,510
What is it, Ki Tak? Is it still not done?

337
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,820
I think something has happened.

338
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:43,379
The reporters haven't arrived yet.

339
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,189
The driver won't answer either.

340
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,459
K has taken the reporters.

341
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,790
That evil rat.

342
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,059
We'll reveal the confession video right away.

343
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,399
Ki Tak, find the reporters quickly and get them to safety.

344
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
(File, Hard disk)

345
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,089
(Uploading attachment, Confession Video)

346
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,189
(Main power device)

347
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,030
(Danger, electricity. Do not touch unless authorized.)

348
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
What is this?

349
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,469
Why did the power suddenly go out?

350
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
What about a backup power source?

351
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:40,869
I'll call and find out.

352
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Hello?

353
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
Hello?

354
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:49,449
It's not working.

355
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,979
(An error has occurred while uploading the attachment.)

356
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,090
The backup power is turned off too.

357
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,289
Someone must've attacked the data center...

358
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,290
because they had to stop us.

359
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,030
It's Jun Seok's doing again.

360
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,959
Auntie, don't move from here...

361
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,029
and check whether the video is finished uploading.

362
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,030
Let's go to the electrical room.

363
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,240
Darn it.

364
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,379
Darn that little punk.

365
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,849
How should I kill the monster to make people praise me?

366
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,850
Darn it!

367
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,249
Should I fry him or shred him?

368
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,990
Should I dry him?

369
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,830
Just wait until I get you, you fraud.

370
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,959
Who's there?

371
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
(Upload was cancelled.)

372
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,530
(Warning, Backup power is unavailable)

373
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,679
What happened? Why was there a fire?

374
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,310
K set fire to the data center.

375
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,678
The CCTV system at the press conference hall...

376
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,449
was hacked, and we lost everything.

377
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,820
How did it go?

378
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:33,350
The fire was called in fast, so it didn't spread.

379
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,719
Where did the fire start?

380
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,060
At the Uninterruptible Power Supplies.

381
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,040
Vice-Chairman Kang.

382
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,740
Vice-Chairman Kang.

383
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,480
Vice-Chairman Kang.

384
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,919
Are you okay?

385
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,520
Ki Tak.

386
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,619
Am I alive?

387
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,149
I'm not dead, am I?

388
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,219
Pinch me on the cheek.

389
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:12,629
Go on.

390
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:26,409
I'm alive.

391
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:28,709
That hurt.

392
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,550
K set fire to the data center.

393
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,649
And he stole the taped confession.

394
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,790
It wasn't K. It was Hwang Chan Sung.

395
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,918
Even as I was losing consciousness,

396
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,490
I did my very best to see his face.

397
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,330
Aren't you proud of me?

398
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,800
It was Hwang Chan Sung?

399
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,760
We're fighting a bigger evil.

400
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,730
They're nothing but lowly trash.

401
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,000
We're Sungchan Group, and we have S Talk too.

402
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,609
It'll take a while to fix the data center.

403
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,010
We don't have a backup center.

404
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,810
Sorry.

405
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:06,010
You know I sold that before we joined forces, right?

406
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,480
K used the secret chat to get leverage on the reporters.

407
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,350
I heard the driver was shot,

408
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,119
and he's currently missing.

409
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,490
My men are looking for him.

410
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,459
We only have more victims.

411
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,629
K got even more powerful, and we're still in trouble.

412
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,540
Come on, now. Let's not be discouraged.

413
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:31,138
Do you know how my brother...

414
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,369
made Sungchan Group the biggest company in the country?

415
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,179
Sungchan Group faced many crises,

416
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,310
and each time, they became opportunities.

417
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,879
Trouble became a blessing.

418
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,919
That's how we turned things around.

419
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,419
So nephew. Don't give up.

420
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,060
Now you must take center stage.

421
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,330
You are Sungchan Group's future and its representative.

422
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:53,990
I believe in you.

423
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,399
Cheers.

424
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,969
Welcome to K Land.

425
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Bad things are more fun when you have company.

426
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,050
It was quite amusing.

427
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,119
They won't be able to make a move for a while.

428
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,919
By now they must know...

429
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,419
that if they move, more people die.

430
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,199
I'm so relieved to be on your side.

431
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,230
Especially LUCA.

432
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,800
It's a crazy system.

433
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,540
We must use that incredible masterpiece...

434
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,639
to its full potential.

435
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,709
To do that, I must get my hands on Gagok District.

436
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,379
Why are you so obsessed with that place?

437
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,919
What are you planning to be working so hard?

438
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,320
- You want to know? - Yes.

439
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,219
LUCA, show him.

440
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,770
You're going to build a cutting-edge digital complex?

441
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,240
I'll go higher, deeper, wider than that.

442
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,449
I'll monopolize information to gain the power to control society.

443
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,249
Deep under the ground of Gagok District...

444
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,849
is a communications network I'll use for hacking.

445
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,689
That's why it must be Gagok District.

446
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,889
If I pull this off, all the top-secret government...

447
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,659
and company information will go through TIKITAKA.

448
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,199
A world where information is power,

449
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,129
and you're in control?

450
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,270
That's right.

451
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,570
LUCA will be the compilation of all the data in the country.

452
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,969
That means I will be power.

453
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,139
An absolute monarch. A king.

454
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,179
I will be a god.

455
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:55,579
What do you think?

456
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,619
Would you like a chance to work for me as a loyal servant?

457
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,189
I'll serve you well.

458
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:03,619
Thanks.

459
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
We must revive Gagok District first, then.

460
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,599
To celebrate our alliance,

461
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,929
I'm thinking of giving you a gift.

462
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,800
The thing you want the most.

463
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,939
The thing I want?

464
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,609
I see.

465
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:23,840
To get rid of Min Do Hyuk?

466
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,609
Bingo.

467
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,550
Tomorrow morning, a massive scandal will hit the news.

468
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:33,520
Reported by ten of the most influential journalists in Korea.

469
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,019
("Shocking! National Hero Min and Top Star Han's Affair")

470
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,718
("Min and Han Were Crazy for Each Other, Hwang Was Used")

471
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,929
("Save CEO Hwang, the Victim of Min and Han's Affair")

472
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:40,428
("S Talk's Report of...")

473
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:41,800
("S Talk's Report of Hwang’s Assault Was Fake News!")

474
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:47,070
Congratulations on your return to the chairman's office.

475
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,899
There was a fire at S Talk's data center...

476
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,040
and then breaking news about Min Do Hyuk and Han Mone's affair.

477
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:55,840
Bad things keep happening to Sungchan Group.

478
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,939
What do you have to say about that?

479
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,080
They reaped what they sowed.

480
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,449
I can finally come clean...

481
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,590
about why Min Do Hyuk and I parted ways.

482
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:10,260
Were you aware that he was having an affair with Han Mone?

483
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,490
I was aware Do Hyuk had a crush on her.

484
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,060
I advised him as an older friend, but he didn't listen.

485
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,469
That's why I had to let him go,

486
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,409
and I believe his grudge drove him to frame me for murder.

487
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,938
Then did Save's CEO Mr. Hwang...

488
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:32,350
not assault or harass Mone at all?

489
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,850
Mr. Hwang's incapable of such things.

490
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,080
He shut himself up at home...

491
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,320
because news of the affair broke him.

492
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,790
As of this moment,

493
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,530
TIKITAKA will break all contracts with Han Mone,

494
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,499
and demand she repay us...

495
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,530
according to the breach of contract clause.

496
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,270
Darling, I have bad news.

497
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,179
- You'll wake the kids. - Okay.

498
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,149
What is it? What's the fuss about?

499
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,050
It's up.

500
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,550
The article on Min Do Hyuk and Han Mone's affair.

501
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,629
("Shocking! National Hero Min and Top Star Han's Affair")

502
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,449
I still love you.

503
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,879
If you come back to me, Mone, I'll forgive you for everything...

504
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,149
and sweep everything under the rug.

505
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,359
You're just an insect.

506
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,079
Considering her condition,

507
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,820
a heart transplant is her only option.

508
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,290
We put her on the waiting list,

509
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,419
but no one can say when we'll find a donor.

510
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,129
I'll do whatever it takes...

511
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:30,959
to fix you.

512
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,340
I'll give you my heart if I must.

513
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:38,270
Let's not give up.

514
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,550
You can't go in there.

515
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,659
I won't be here for long. Why are there so many of you?

516
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,530
Can I have a word?

517
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,199
You always show up at the worst time.

518
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,240
I feel like ripping you to shreds whenever I see Myoung Ji.

519
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:19,310
How dare you stand before me?

520
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,250
Why are you being so scary?

521
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,919
For the sake of the kids,

522
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:28,320
I'm doing my very best not to kill you.

523
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,189
Get lost.

524
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:32,990
A heart.

525
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,399
Don't you need one?

526
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,760
I can give her that heart.

527
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Are you more willing to talk now?

528
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Mr. Mayor?

529
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,040
I know someone who's brain-dead.

530
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,179
I can arrange for Myoung Ji to get that heart.

531
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,080
Is it the driver you shot?

532
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:57,549
I shot him for you...

533
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,550
so that Myoung Ji could get the heart.

534
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,149
You're not even human.

535
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,530
You're right. So...

536
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,500
if you want to save Myoung Ji, save Gagok District first.

537
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,499
Say you found nothing illegal,

538
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,628
and that you'll build the complex as planned.

539
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:14,429
Shut your mouth before I rip it open.

540
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,340
I'd rather sell my soul...

541
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,469
than strike a deal with you.

542
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,079
You'll get your happy ending if you just give me Gagok District.

543
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,148
Why are you being such a fool?

544
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:27,010
You'll never know what it means...

545
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,619
to have a family you want to fight for.

546
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,820
"A family?"

547
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,550
What are you on about? You're an orphan.

548
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,989
No one can be family unless you're related by blood.

549
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,829
Here's some advice from a man with experience.

550
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,928
Waking up from your dream will hurt bad.

551
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,260
No. You're the one who's wrong.

552
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,530
You think you were abandoned. That you're all alone.

553
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,570
To you, family is something to hate and resent.

554
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,639
Do Hyuk's different.

555
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,839
You're also way beneath him.

556
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,070
How dare you?

557
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,810
The more you attack us,

558
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,149
the tighter and stronger we'll become.

559
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:05,219
Oh, right.

560
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,290
Because of the fake news you spread,

561
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,219
Min Do Hyuk is very angry.

562
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,959
Sometime soon, he's going to mess with you big time.

563
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,030
You should be prepared for that.

564
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,359
What?

565
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,600
You set it all up, you fraud.

566
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,270
I bet Sungchan Group's hall, where the press conference is,

567
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,209
will be fit to burst.

568
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,889
Last night, there was a fire at our data center.

569
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,790
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience it caused.

570
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,500
We'll compensate all damages caused by the incident.

571
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,570
(Sungchan Group)

572
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,639
I, Sim Mi Young,

573
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,540
will take full responsibility by resigning as chairwoman.

574
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,809
Does that mean Sungchan Group...

575
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,609
will be without a chairman?

576
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Of course not.

577
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,150
We have a new chairman...

578
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,159
to lead Sungchan Group into the future.

579
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,790
Let me introduce him right now.

580
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,029
Come in, Chairman.

581
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,868
What?

582
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:31,869
Who is it?

583
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,239
Who's he?

584
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:40,710
- What? - This is insane.

585
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,249
(Sungchan Group Press Conference)

586
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,380
What's going on?

587
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,350
Speak.

588
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,259
Min Do Hyuk will become Sungchan Group's chairman?

589
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,730
Everyone's talking about his affair.

590
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,659
Do you think he's qualified?

591
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,400
Why isn't he qualified?

592
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:00,969
I'll introduce him properly.

593
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,139
Chairman Sim Yong's biological son...

594
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:11,279
and my one and only real nephew.

595
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,409
It's Min Do Hyuk.

596
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
That's right.

597
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,630
As Chairman Sim insisted on the day he died,

598
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,259
I am his real son.

599
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,698
- What? - He's the real son?

600
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,469
The Sim Jun Seok you know...

601
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,368
is the son of Gu Gang Jae,

602
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,469
Chairman Sim's secretary, which means...

603
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,670
He's a fake.

604
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,908
A fake pretended to be the heir.

605
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:45,909
And...

606
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,380
that Sim Jun Seok is...

607
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,380
TIKITAKA's chairman Matthew Lee.

608
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:56,190
Just a moment.

609
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,190
Isn't Lee Hwi So the chairman of TIKITAKA?

610
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
No.

611
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:04,198
Until now, Sim Jun Seok used TIKITAKA...

612
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,029
to pretend to be Lee Hwi So.

613
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:08,969
The real Lee Hwi So died last year...

614
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,400
when the exhibition hall exploded.

615
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,408
(Explosion on Exhibition Hall Roof, 1 Unidentified Corpse Found)

616
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,908
- No way. - That happened?

617
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:23,020
(Explosion on Exhibition Hall Roof, 1 Unidentified Corpse Found)

618
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,719
Darn it!

619
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:32,790
It's back again.

620
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,130
This darn condition of mine.

621
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:44,698
TIKITAKA's secret chat was programmed...

622
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:46,709
by the real Lee Hwi So, not Matthew Lee.

623
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,040
Sim Jun Seok's unable to make such a thing.

624
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,179
All he can do is pretend to be Lee Hwi So.

625
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,350
That's about it.

626
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,319
Because...

627
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,790
(Matthew Lee Is Just a Fake Lee Hwi So, He Can't Do Anything)

628
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:03,559
Sim Jun Seok is a fake and a complete...

629
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,859
(Matthew Lee Is Just a Fake Lee Hwi So, He Can't Do Anything)

630
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,290
brainless fool.

631
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,599
You're a brainless fool who can't even...

632
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,960
come in the top ten of his year.

633
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:13,929
I will...

634
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,739
study even harder.

635
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,339
You don't get another chance.

636
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,770
Prepare to move to the US.

637
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,170
Father.

638
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,778
Father. I really don't want to go.

639
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,579
I want to stay with you and Mother.

640
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,049
Do as you're told and go.

641
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,290
How dare you talk back when you're just a fake?

642
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,690
"A fake?"

643
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,830
"A fake?"

644
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,060
"A brainless fool?"

645
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,469
(Matthew Lee Is Just a Fake Lee Hwi So, He Can't Do Anything)

646
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:55,440
Abnormal vital signs were detected.

647
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,940
Increased heart rate.

648
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,210
Increased blood flow.

649
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,379
Rest is required immediately.

650
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
Actually,

651
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,150
the fact that I'm Chairman Sim's son isn't important.

652
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:07,290
Sungchan Group became a victim...

653
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,158
to Sim Jun Seok who pretended to be Lee Hwi So,

654
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,158
and the public believed it was an evil company.

655
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,690
The company lost everything.

656
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,860
The fire at the data center...

657
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:19,369
was arson and Matthew Lee was behind it.

658
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,839
Does someone like that have the right...

659
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,270
to criticize Chairman Sim...

660
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,909
or Sungchan Group?

661
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,779
I ask for the public's help.

662
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,679
So that we can prove Matthew Lee isn't Lee Hwi So,

663
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:37,549
help us.

664
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:48,759
I see my older brother in him.

665
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:51,659
Sungchan Group's true owner is back.

666
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,069
Now my brother can rest in peace.

667
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,869
The fight between the real and the fake.

668
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,779
Sungchan Group will take TIKITAKA head-on.

669

670
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,089
(We'll Take TIKITAKA Head-on)

671
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:24,230
Why is it you and not me?

672
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,929
Since I was young,

673
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,699
I was the one to entertain and serve Father.

674
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,639
So why am I the fake,

675
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,179
and why are you the real deal?

676
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,909
If only you hadn't been alive,

677
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,679
I could've been happy.

678
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,350
If not for you,

679
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,449
I wouldn't feel so inferior.

680
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:50,290
You ruined me...

681
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,989
and made me a murderer.

682
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,630
I'm a monster...

683
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,829
because of you, Do Hyuk!

684
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,729
(The Fight of the Real and the Fake! We’ll Take TIKITAKA Head-on)

685
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,069
You're not like Father at all.

686
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,839
I'm the one that takes after him.

687
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,270
Father's favourite foods,

688
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,409
tastes, personality, and walk.

689
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,480
I copied it all. I even breathed like him.

690
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,350
How dare you...

691
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,989
call me a fake and insult me?

692
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,889
For the rest of your life,

693
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,360
you'll regret making that confession.

694
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,100
I'll see to it that Father has no choice but to accept me!

695
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,000
Whatever happens,

696
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,329
Sim Jun Seok must be his son.

697
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,369
I'll see to that!

698
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,869
I'll show you that a fake can replace the real deal.

699
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,040
Watch and see me prove it.

700
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,839
We will soon...

701
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,338
show you some clear proof.

702
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:14,770
That's all for today.

703
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,779
- Make way. - Any more comments?

704
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,109
- Step aside. - What proof?

705
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,479
- What do you have? - Step back.

706
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,009
- What will you do? - What's the plan?

707
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,249
Min Do Hyuk who became chairman of Sungchan Group today...

708
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,920
openly attacked TIKITAKA's chairman Matthew Lee.

709
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,919
He adamantly stated that Matthew Lee...

710
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,290
was Sim Jun Seok, not Lee Hwi So.

711
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:36,499
Former chairwoman Sim Mi Young backed him up,

712
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,399
- adding legitimacy to the claim... - Do you see this?

713
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,630
Do Hyuk is definitely my nephew.

714
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,440
Regardless of whether Min Do Hyuk is Sim Yong's son,

715
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,310
their statement that I'm Sim Jun Seok...

716
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,639
is preposterous and nonsensical.

717
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,940
They're muddying the facts...

718
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,409
to switch the frame.

719
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:57,380
It's a cowardly trick to use something sensational to hide...

720
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,449
their immoralities.

721
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,319
The bottom line...

722
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,360
is that Min Do Hyuk had an affair with my wife.

723
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,929
I can't even describe...

724
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,690
how miserable I feel.

00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,699
I'll sell all the properties I own.

727
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,699
Sell them as soon as possible.

728
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:19,509
You bought them less than a year ago.

729
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,110
The tax will be massive.

730
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,809
Why sell now when it will make you rich very soon?

731
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,650
I don't care. It's urgent.

732
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,150
Call as soon as you have a buyer.

733
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:33,219
Use all of the front-page slots...

734
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,690
to attack Sungchan Group and Min Do Hyuk.

735
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:37,259
Yes, sir.

736
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:41,589
Mone.

737
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:45,330
Do you know what scandal people in this country hate most?

738
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,130
Affairs.

739
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:49,940
The longer you don't give in,

740
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,369
the tougher it will be for Min Do Hyuk.

741
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,270
So...

742
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,279
you should surrender now...

743
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,739
before you lose everything.

744
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,409
Min Do Hyuk. Don't look back.

745
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,080
Don't feel sorry for someone like me.

746
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:36,150
Go your way.

747
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:38,580
I'll go my way.

748
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,150
It's Han Mone.

749
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,060
- Is this true? - Wait.

750
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,388
- Hey. Are you even human? - Hey.

751
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:48,758
You liar!

752
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,329
How could you do that?

753
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,730
- How could you? - I can't believe it.

754
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,969
What's wrong with you?

755
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,068
How could you do that?

756
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,069
Hey!

757
00:43:58,199 --> 00:43:59,568
(Penalty for breach of contract)

758
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,169
(Written claim for damages)

759
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,080
(Written claim for damages due to breach of contract)

760
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,709
("Han Mone’s Affair Becomes Big News.")

761
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,980
("Advertisers Cut Ties. May Be Big Penalty Fees.")

762
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:24,759
Are you okay?

763
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,569
I'm fine.

764
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,170
I'll take this chance to retire and get some rest.

765
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,639
Are you done packing?

766
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,880
I don't know if I should really leave now.

767
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,420
You're struggling so much.

768
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,819
It's too dangerous here. You need to leave.

769
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,759
Could I at least see Cheong Soo once before I leave?

770
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,630
I haven't seen him in so long.

771
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,569
Cheong Soo went to Thailand to work.

772
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:10,409
He won't be back for a few years because he's enjoying his work.

773
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:12,749
Don't worry and go with Kyung Soo.

774
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,850
Okay. I'll do as you ask.

775
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:24,190
As long as I can save you kids and Han Na,

776
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,790
I will even sacrifice my life!

777
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,940
I bought a house in a safe place...

778
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:37,869
and put some money in the bank.

779
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,210
Go with Kyung Soo and eat what you want,

780
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,380
buy what you want, and do what you want.

781
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,948
How can you give us money in that situation?

782
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:52,079
Don't sacrifice yourself for us anymore!

783
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,419
We'll take care of ourselves.

784
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,190
No, I'll take care of you now!

785
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,190
Come on, Mom.

786
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,830
I'm your daughter, Han Mone.

787
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,299
I have more than enough to pay these penalty fees.

788
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:07,569
Don't worry and just go.

789
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:27,190
You can be honest with me.

790
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,159
Mom.

791
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,929
I'm totally okay.

792
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,270
I don't care about money or popularity.

793
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,710
But I'm worried about Min Do Hyuk.

794
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,539
He put his life on the line, but no one really cared...

795
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,949
because of the news about me.

796
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,850
No one will listen to what he wanted to say.

797
00:46:56,819 --> 00:47:00,020
Do you have feelings...

798
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:08,259
I know I'm being shameless.

799
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,299
I know I shouldn't be like this.

800
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,369
But I'm going crazy worrying about him.

801
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,170
How can I help Min Do Hyuk?

802
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,469
What can I do?

803
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,409
What do I do?

804
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,730
Okay. It's my turn now.

805
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,029
- Number 12. - No. Number 21.

806
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,940
Number 21? Okay. Number 21.

807
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,270
Success!

808
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,210
Who's next? Erica? Who is it?

809
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,909
Oh, Erica is up next.

810
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,150
Well...

811
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,750
Hey, kids. Instead of this,

812
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:08,719
should we watch TV?

813
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:13,158
The affair between Min Do Hyuk and actress Han Mone...

814
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,529
has been all over the news lately.

815
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:16,129
- What is this? - We have selected...

816
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,729
- their relationship timelines... - What?

817
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,170
- as today's entertainment topic. - What?

818
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,798
- Wait... - The two first met at TIKITAKA.

819
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,969
- Turn that off. - Min Do Hyuk was...

820
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,580
Kids. How does my face look?

821
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,279
It's shining and glowing, isn't it?

822
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,480
Oh, my eyes.

823
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,650
Should we play tag? Or...

824
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,850
Cops and Robbers?

825
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,920
Nobody plays games like that these days.

826
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,089
Can I play outside for a little bit?

827
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Hey.

828
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:51,060
You can't go outside.

829
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,000
- Be quiet. - Can't I even ask?

830
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,600
I haven't gone to kindergarten for several days.

831
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,770
I haven't gotten to see my friends.

832
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,639
I can't even talk now?

833
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,839
You're so mean!

834
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,080
Hey!

835
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,850
You dummy.

836
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:10,920
Come back here!

837
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:18,989
Hello, Chairwoman Sim.

838
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,630
I have a favour to ask.

839
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,730
I want to play with the kids just for a day at a safe place.

840
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,529
Would that be possible?

841
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,509
- Hey, kids! - Auntie!

842
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:44,619
Come here!

843
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,389
Hello.

844
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,219
Kids. It was frustrating to be stuck at home, right?

845
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,658
Is it really okay for us to be outside like this?

846
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,730
Are the bad men gone now?

847
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:57,330
Of course.

848
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:59,868
Don't worry about anything today and play as much as you want.

849
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,000
- Really? - Really?

850
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,939
- There are toys over here. - Oh, my!

851
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,900
He brought a bunch of toys for you.

852
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,969
Ki Tak!

853
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,080
There he is!

854
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,750
She's too much. She's always too much.

855
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:17,080
Don't say anything today.

856
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,750
Everyone. The host of our camping trip is here.

857
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:24,019
Because of the tight security here,

858
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,488
it's a safe place that outsiders cannot enter.

859
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:27,560
It's perfectly safe here.

860
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:32,499
Chairwoman Sim made this camping trip happen.

861
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,670
Everyone, applause!

862
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,499
- Thank you! - Thank you!

863
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,198
- Thank you! - Thank you, rich Auntie.

864
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:39,238
Yes.

865
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,569
I'm very wealthy.

866
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,440
Have tons of fun.

867
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,540
- Okay! - Okay!

868
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,139
- Be careful, kids. - Yes.

869
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,948
Why are we camping all of a sudden?

870
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:48,379
I'm too stressed for this.

871
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,549
No.

872
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,420
You have it wrong.

873
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,089
Being upset doesn't solve anything.

874
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,759
Happiness comes to those who smile.

875
00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:00,059
How can I do nothing as an aunt...

876
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,159
when my nephew is feeling terrible?

877
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,799
Haven't you heard the saying, "Nephews are most loved by aunts?"

878
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,429
Was there such a saying?

879
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,630
Shut up!

880
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,068
How dare you try to hit on me?

881
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,339
Don't even look in my direction. Don't get your hopes up.

882
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,009
I already have a lover.

883
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,839
Ki Tak! I'm so excited!

884
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:19,979
Did I get rejected before I even proposed?

885
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,980
By the way,

886
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,679
she keeps speaking to us informally.

887
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,350
I didn't even notice.

888
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:30,589
Is that the charisma of an ultra-wealthy person?

889
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,489
Gosh.

890
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:34,489
I'll shut up.

891
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,359
This is my first time camping.

892
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,460
Me too.

893
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,819
Do Hyuk!

894
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,230
Kids. Come here.

895
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,929
Come here.

896
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,569
Okay. Say something to Mom.

897
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,698
- I love you, Mom. - Mom!

898
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:20,068
- I love you. - Please wake up soon.

899
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:21,309
- Wake up soon. - Mom.

900
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,080
- Let's go camping together. - Let's play together.

901
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,278
- Bye, Mom! - Bye, Mom!

902
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:26,650
- Bye! - Bye!

903
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:30,818
- I love you, Mom. - Please wake up soon.

904
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:32,479
Wake up soon.

905
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,650
- Let's go camping together. - Let's go camping.

906
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,610
This is how you do it.

907
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,409
What do you think? Don't I look like a chef?

908
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,630
Why does it smell so amazing?

909
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,900
Meat tastes best when you eat it outdoors.

910
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,670
Yes. This is great.

911
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:29,210
Unbelievable! You're as fast as a machine.

912
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:31,139
I didn't expect that of you.

913
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:35,709
By the way, why do you keep speaking informally to me?

914
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:36,979
You don't get to do that just because you're super rich.

915
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,750
Also, aren't you almost about to go broke?

916
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,719
Why are you being so unsophisticated?

917
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:42,548
If you don't like it, just speak informally to me too.

918
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:44,290
Do you think I won't?

919
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:46,560
Peel the green onions.

920
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,589
I'll peel the onions.

921
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:57,568
You're the first person who has spoken informally to me.

922
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:58,799
I love it!

923
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,279
Cheers.

924
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,810
Okay.

925
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,779
What's wrong? Did you cut yourself?

926
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,560
Are you okay?

927
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,718
I'm okay.

928
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,618
Just hang out like me.

929
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,659
She's going to donate her skills to us today.

930
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,158
You think we're friends now, I see. You!

931
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,159
You!

932
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,299
Cheers!

933
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:32,738
"Can we be friends with anything that is alive?"

934
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:34,809
"You can, but you also cannot."

935
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,710
"At times, it takes a while before you can become friends."

936
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,110
"Why?"

937
00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:43,679
"Everyone opens up their hearts at different speeds."

938
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,449
Phillip. Let's switch spots.

939
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,020
Don't know you...

940
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,059
"Ladies first?"

941
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,330
I should come before ladies.

942
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,029
You're older than me, so let me have this spot.

943
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:59,399
So Han Na can give up her spot.

944
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,170
I don't want to. I want to sit next to Mr. Yang too.

945
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:06,040
Don't fight, kids.

946
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,409
Do you want to see the stars?

947
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,210
- Oh, my. So pretty. - Oh, how pretty.

948
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:12,810
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

949
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,150
Oh, how fun!

950
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:19,179
So fun!

951
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,818
- So fun! - Look at this.

952
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,159
You can draw with the light.

953
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,060
Cheers.

954
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:35,199
Oh, that's nice.

955
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,739
Honey.

956
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:46,480
What's wrong? It's such a nice day.

957
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,319
I don't know.

958
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:52,619
I keep tearing up.

959
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:58,218
It would've been so nice to have Geum La Hui and Go Myoung Ji...

960
00:55:58,219 --> 00:55:59,619
here with us.

961
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:00,929
We're so happy.

962
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,170
You're right.

963
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,770
The sound of kids laughing is the best ASMR.

964
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,940
- It's so pretty! - It's so nice to listen to.

965
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,139
A star!

966
00:56:18,339 --> 00:56:19,739
Look!

967
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,679
Someone said that...

968
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:28,989
those who had a happy childhood...

969
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:31,860
live off of those memories their whole lives,

970
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:36,630
and those who had sad childhoods...

971
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:39,360
live their whole lives...

972
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,969
healing those wounds.

973
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
So...

974
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:50,880
I thought about how my childhood was,

975
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:57,449
and I don't have many good memories.

976
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
If we had been happy as children,

977
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:22,770
do you think...

978
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,509
we'd be living different lives right now?

979
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,710
We can't change the past,

980
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,179
but we can change the future.

981
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,489
As long as you are willing.

982
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,659
Ta-da!

983
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,829
Let's all take a picture together.

984
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,759
You have to take pictures when you're camping.

985
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,468
I'll take it now.

986
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:48,770
Big smiles!

987
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,139
Okay.

988
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,339
Hurry.

989
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Get ready.

990
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,020
(Pharmacy)

991
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:15,029
I'm sorry. Hello.

992
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,000
Could I buy some ointment?

993
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,599
Oh, yes. Come in.

994
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Thank you.

995
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,270
What?

996
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:28,869
Everyone left?

997
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:30,380
Yes.

998
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,610
(Band-aid)

999
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,880
Let's clean up.

1000
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:18,860
(Min Do Hyuk)

1001
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,150
What is it, Ki Tak?

1002
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,350
Do you have something to say?

1003
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:54,489
(Han Mone reunites with CEO Hwang and announces retirement.)

1004
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,129
Ms. Han Mone,

1005
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,729
who was known to have had an affair with Sungchan CEO Min Do Hyuk,

1006
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,069
officially announced that reunited with CEO Hwang.

1007
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,968
CEO Hwang explained that Ms. Han's scandal...

1008
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:07,769
- was a misunderstanding. - Mone asked me to give this to you.

1009
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,138
At the same time, he announced...

1010
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,210
Ms. Han's retirement from the entertainment industry.

1011
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,178
(To Min Do Hyuk, I hope the decision...)

1012
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,309
(I made today doesn't make you question yourself.)

1013
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,310
To Min Do Hyuk.

1014
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,949
I hope the decision I made today doesn't make you question yourself.

1015
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,059
I asked Chairwoman Sim for yesterday's camping trip.

1016
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,618
Okay. I'll take it now.

1017
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,258
I wanted to see everyone for the last time.

1018
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:29,259
Come here.

1019
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,729
Thank you for letting me see your smiling face, Min Do Hyuk.

1020
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:32,730
One, two, three.

1021
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,469
I'll stay strong by remembering yesterday.

1022
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,770
I'm going to start the last acting performance of my life.

1023
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:44,839
Fake smiles and fake happiness will be awaiting me.

1024
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,380
Okay. Thank you.

1025
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,448
But I'm going to think of it as climbing a very steep hill.

1026
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:49,709
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1027
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,749
If I keep taking one step after another...

1028
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,289
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1029
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,589
Someday, I'll reach the top of this tough hill.

1030
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,230
Good work, Mone.

1031
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,799
With you back,

1032
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:06,560
the house feels bright again.

1033
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:12,600
You'll keep your promise, right?

1034
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,770
Your promise not to do anything to Min Do Hyuk.

1035
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,940
Of course.

1036
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:20,949
All of your penalty fee lawsuits will be cancelled as well.

1037
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,350
I don't care how much I pay for breach of contract.

1038
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,750
I've already put up my house and real estate for sale.

1039
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,250
The promise you need to keep...

1040
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,420
is to make sure no one ever talks of the affair again.

1041
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,330
I want that more than anyone.

1042
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:40,400
There's only one thing I want from you.

1043
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:43,429
To never get involved with Min Do Hyuk.

1044
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,069
Please just make sure of that.

1045
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:51,239
I promise.

1046
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:54,080
I'll never look for him again.

1047
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,199
I came back to kill you.

1048
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,239
I'm going to kill you first...

1049
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:19,600
and then get rid of K my way.

1050
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:43,029
Min Do Hyuk and Han Na.

1051
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,799
I'm going to protect them both from now on.

1052
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,000
(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

1053
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:24,039
We will now verify whether he is Lee Hwi So.

1054
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,638
While I'm going through physical verification,

1055
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,638
you cannot take your eyes off of LUCA.

1056
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:29,408
Min Do Hyuk is planning something.

1057
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:31,109
Did LUCA give you false information?

1058
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,509
You have to deal with me now.

1059
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,008
Give up on Gagok District now.

1060
01:03:35,009 --> 01:03:37,118
Chairman Lee is in trouble now.

1061
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,118
I'm scared that Matthew will go crazy again.

1062
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,889
From now on, Sim Jun Seok is my enemy.

1063
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,650
Matthew hurt Han Na.

1064
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,819
I'm going to kill that punk, Min Do Hyuk.
