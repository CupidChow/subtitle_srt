00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,919
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,248
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:52,990
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

5
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,759
(Episode 15)

6
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,160
It's not too late. Hurry.

7
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,470
Can you check on Mone for me?

8
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,708
It bothers me that she suddenly canceled dinner.

9
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,770
All right. Hurry up and go.

10
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,390
You must be punished.

11
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,359
You can never take a step outside this house ever again.

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,789
You will rot in this house,

13
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,630
next to me, for life.

14
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,459
In this room where your mom...

15
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,830
was locked up.

16
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,720
Because of her brat of a daughter who didn't keep her promise,

17
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,160
she will die a most miserable death.

18
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,289
Watch it with your own eyes.

19
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,569
No!

20
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,169
No!

21
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,669
Where is Yoon Ji Sook?

22
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,639
Capture her right now.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,449
I will kill that wench myself.

24
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:39,329
Darn it...

25
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,729
I came here to kill you.

26
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,139
I don't care if my life is ruined!

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,039
But I can't stand you tormenting my mom and Min Do Hyuk anymore.

28
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,019
I've never loved a monster like you, not even for one moment.

29
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,479
Please...

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,389
Please just die!

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
Darn it...

32
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,609
A monster?

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Me?

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,410
I can't die like this alone.

35
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,220
If I must die, I will die with you.

36
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,319
Because we'll be together forever.

37
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,989
You are going to...

38
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,660
die by Kang Ki Tak's hands without me, anyway.

39
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,030
You didn't know, did you?

40
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
That jerk is Bang Da Mi's real dad.

41
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,710
- What? - Instead of dying by his hand,

42
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,910
just...

43
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:08,979
Just...

44
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,220
die with me.

45
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Darn it!

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,299
Kang Ki Tak, you jerk...

47
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,299
I love you.

48
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,359
I came because Do Hyuk asked me to check on you.

49
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,129
I'm glad I made it in time.

50
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,799
That jerk is Bang Da Mi's real dad.

51
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:38,939
Han Mone?

52
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,179
Can you hear me?

53
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,679
Is it true?

54
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,520
Are you Da Mi's real dad?

55
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,400
Then why are you helping me?

56
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,470
Don't you want me dead more than anyone?

57
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,839
That was your chance...

58
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,910
to avenge your daughter without getting your hands dirty.

59
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,679
So why did you save me?

60
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:20,650
It's not up to me...

61
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,820
to avenge or forgive.

62
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,650
Ask Da Mi...

63
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:27,989
and...

64
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,660
her real parents who raised her for their forgiveness.

65
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,070
I don't have the right.

66
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:46,910
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,749
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,379
I'm sorry...

69
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,859
I'll take care of the body first.

70
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,510
Are you expecting someone?

71
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,720
It must be the helpers.

72
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,989
I told them to take the day off, but Chan Sung must've called them.

73
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,429
I think they're trying to come in.

74
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,869
Buy me some time.

75
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,710
I'll take care of it somehow.

76
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
(Pull the handle)

77
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,919
What is it?

78
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,189
Mr. Hwang called us.

79
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,520
His dinner plan was canceled and wanted to eat at home.

80
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,629
I already prepared something simple.

81
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:11,859
You can go.

82
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,169
Where is Mr. Hwang...

83
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:21,900
right now?

84
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,679
We'll see him before we go.

85
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,379
He just...

86
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,019
went into the shower.

87
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,290
You wouldn't want to interrupt us, would you?

88
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,759
I'd rather see him first before...

89
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,898
(You don't have to come.)

90
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,028
(Don't come to work for a while until I give you the order.)

91
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,029
All right.

92
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,300
I just received his text.

93
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,440
Please have a good time.

94
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,859
Are they gone?

95
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,269
We have to move the body out.

96
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,340
Hurry and grab what you need. You'll have to leave too.

97
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,310
No, I'll stay in this house.

98
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,378
What are you talking about?

99
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,350
The helpers and guards live just next door.

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,320
It'll be impossible to move the body without them noticing.

101
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,388
If Hwang Chan Sung's death is found out,

102
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,989
K will find out Min Do Hyuk accessed LUCA.

103
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,759
Then all of Do Hyuk's plans will go down the drain.

104
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,628
In order to avoid any suspicion,

105
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,129
I'll need to keep communicating with K as if I'm Hwang Chan Sung.

106
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,070
With Hwang Chan Sung's phone, of course.

107
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,600
Don't be ridiculous.

108
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,840
Are you saying you'll stay in this house with a corpse?

109
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,170
I can do it. This is nothing.

110
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,710
Everything will be over once the info in LUCA is revealed.

111
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,849
Nothing can be guaranteed right now.

112
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,379
No one can stop me.

113
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,149
If anything gets in my way,

114
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,119
I'll get rid of them.

115
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,100
Where do you plan to keep the body?

116
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,570
There's a suitable place.

117
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,019
Did Ki Tak get in touch?

118
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,470
Hwang Chan Sung is dead.

119
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,739
He knew we came by.

120
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,739
I had no choice but to get rid of him.

121
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,310
Mone is fine, so don't worry.

122
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,210
It's so nice to see you often.

123
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,149
We better speed up the investigation process...

124
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,149
if we want to gulp down the Gagok District at once.

125
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,790
Don't you know that eating too fast can give you an upset stomach?

126
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,129
That's why we have digestive pills.

127
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,628
We were able to manipulate the press...

128
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,359
to turn Min Do Hyuk into a perfect murderer.

129
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,469
Giving them more time...

130
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,639
might allow them to come up with another crazy scheme.

131
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,170
So? What do you want?

132
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,478
Process an immediate arrest warrant for Min Do Hyuk...

133
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,979
and announce Kang Ki Tak as wanted.

134
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,909
Min Do Hyuk denies his charges.

135
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,719
On top of that, Kang Ki Tak has evidence of the hacking network.

136
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,090
This is exactly why...

137
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,359
we must make a move first...

138
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,590
before Kang Ki Tak tries to get us.

139
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:41,800
It's a waste since I spent so much money on the network,

140
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,330
but I must let it go for the cause.

141
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:05,790
It was them.

142
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,619
The ones helping K.

143
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,729
The root of evil.

144
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,758
They act like they're doing what's best for the people,

145
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,499
but it's all a show.

146
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,498
Behind our backs, they create fake news...

147
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,930
for their selfish interests and desires.

148
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,499
These pigs disgust me.

149
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,609
I won't let a single jerk get away with it.

150
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,989
We'll officially start the witch-hunt on Kang Ki Tak.

151
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,929
Save must promote public opinion accordingly.

152
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,269
(I understand...)

153
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,509
Matthew got in touch.

154
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,180
He said the witch-hunt on Kang Ki Tak would start.

155
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,019
You'll likely become publicly wanted.

156
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:14,159
It was what I anticipated.

157
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,590
Even if...

158
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,930
something happens to me,

159
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,759
Do Hyuk's plan must still succeed.

160
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,769
Why would you say such a thing?

161
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,769
You never know.

162
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,170
I'm worried about Do Hyuk.

163
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:32,409
There might be a moment...

164
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:35,139
when I won't be able to protect him.

165
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,550
Do me a favor.

166
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:40,920
Please don't ever give up on Do Hyuk.

167
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,960

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,649

Late Mayor Yang Jin Mo was proven...

175
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,489
to have been constantly threatened...

176
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,389
by Sungchan Group's Min Do Hyuk...

177
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,398

When Mayor Yang did not agree to suspect Min Do Hyuk's request,

180
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,340
he attempted to kidnap Mayor Yang's children.

181

184
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,450
ended up dead.

185
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,450
He's from the NIS.

186
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,249
(Joint Investigation Headquarters of the Prosecution and Police)

187
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,050
I'm Park Moo Hyuk from the National Intelligence Service.

188
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,158
Last night, we received an anonymous tip-off...

189
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,830
on the Gagok District at the NIS.

190
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,559
The report claimed there was a hacking network...

191
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,059
built underground in the Gagok District.

192
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,100
To that, the NIS investigated right away.

193
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:11,040
Just as the report said, we found a hacking network.

194
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,170
(Gagok District's underground hacking network)

195
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,179
The underground hacking network in Gagok District intended...

196
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,310
to steal confidential info from the government and companies.

197
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,648
Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak are said to have secretly embedded it.

198
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,089
This is a threat to the state...

199
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,119
and an act of terrorism which cannot be overlooked.

200
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:31,489
Kang Ki Tak, who is a key figure in the case, is now wanted.

201
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:46,509
For some reason, I feel unsettled.

202
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,540
Why is Min Do Hyuk sitting quietly behind bars?

203
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,979
Also, Kang Ki Tak hasn't made a move.

204
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,180
By the way, why is Hwang Chan Sung so quiet?

205
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,619
He'd get antsy and call me all the time.

206
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,960
(Save's Hwang Chan Sung)

207
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,600
The person is unable to answer the phone.

208
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,899
LUCA, check when Hwang Chan Sung last connected.

209
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,070
(Hwang Chan Sung, online)

210
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:20,009
Hwang Chan Sung is currently online.

211
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,010
Secretary Chae!

212
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,530
Where's Mr. Hwang?

213
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,628
He's at home.

214
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:41,760
He has the flu, so he'll be away for a while.

215
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,399
Did he suddenly catch the flu?

216
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,439
You must be terribly sick...

217
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,010
if you can't pick up your phone.

218
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,740
How could you miss work at this important time?

219
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,520
I don't think I'll be able to move for a while.

220
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:02,879
Don't worry.

221
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,550
Save's article will be released per our plan.

222
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:09,320
How strange.

223
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,260
It doesn't sound like the Hwang Chan Sung I know.

224
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,500
Also, he'd never answer me so fast.

225
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,530
All right.

226
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,500
Please don't worry, Prosecutor General.

227
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,398
Go Myoung Ji would never change her mind.

228
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,240
Her children's lives are at stake.

229
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,969
Where are her children?

230
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,809
We have all hands on deck to find them,

231
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,980
but so far, there's no lead.

232
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,750
Go Myoung Ji doesn't seem to have a clue either.

233
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Prosecutor Kang.

234
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,090
You're on the fast track to a promotion.

235
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,889
Thank you, sir.

236
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,859
I'll wrap up the investigation well. Salute.

237
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
Salute!

238
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,939
Ms. Go, you need to stay on your toes.

239
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,139
Things look unfavorable for you.

240
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,080
They officially started their attack on Kang Ki Tak.

241
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:10,820
Why are you helping me, Prosecutor Kang?

242
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,250
Once the prosecutor general finds out,

243
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,090
it'll mean trouble.

244
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:20,159
Not all prosecutors are pathetic, although that's the public image.

245
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,300
If one doesn't have any attachment to getting promoted,

246
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,600
prosecutors have nothing to fear.

247
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm not indebted to anyone,

248
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:29,770
so why would I fear my superiors?

249
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,540
You're really something.

250
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,540
There's not much to being a prosecutor.

251
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,379
All I have is my pride.

252
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,080
Shall we go for a drive?

253
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,050
Pardon?

254
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,050
Come on.

255
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,719
I told the guards the investigation would take time.

256
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,429
Where are we going?

257
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
To your kids.

258
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,260
They're at Geum La Hui's.

259
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,300
I can only give you time until 6pm.

260
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,199
They'll get suspicious if you take any longer.

261
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:04,909
Prosecutor Kang...

262
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,869
I'll escort you there.

263
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,280
Hurry.

264
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
I'm...

265
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,050
I'm so thankful.

266
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,320
"I'd like to express my sincere condolences..."

267
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,889
"to late Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo..."

268
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,060
"and his loved ones..."

269
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,459
"for his sudden and unjust passing."

270
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,169
"The state intends..."

271
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:36,569
"to enthusiastically support the last administration..."

272
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,010
"the late Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo was working on,"

273
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,480
"which was a project..."

274
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,080
"on making a cutting-edge city."

275
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,080
"All development rights..."

276
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:55,760
"will be appointed to TIKITAKA."

277
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,730
"In addition,"

278
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,129
"Chairman Matthew Lee enthusiastically helped..."

279
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,359
"in revealing the truth,"

280
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,639
"and we would like to send him our gratitude."

281
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,560
Good job.

282
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,659
I'm amazed. I'm truly amazed.

283
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,969
Do you know how much...

284
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,799
the little ones worried about you?

285
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,300
They were worried something might happen to Mom too.

286
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,570
Do they know everything?

287
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,340
I didn't tell them,

288
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,980
but I think they can sense it.

289
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,409
At least Erica and Phillip cry.

290
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,480
Han Na doesn't even cry.

291
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,199
Erica.

292
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,030
Phillip.

293
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,199
Mom!

294
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:15,139
Mom...

295
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,369
I'm so sorry I took so long.

296
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,520
Mom, I missed you.

297
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,919
I almost went crazy from missing you.

298
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,260
Mom, are you all better?

299
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:40,830
Are you not sick anymore?

300
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,060
Do you not have to go to the hospital now?

301
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,369
Mom's all better now.

302
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm sorry for making you guys worry.

303
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,909
About Dad...

304
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,310
Will we never see him again?

305
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,980
We can't see him anymore?

306
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,550
The poor guy.

307
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:11,389
I feel so sorry for him.

308
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,800
Dad saved us, didn't he?

309
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,810
- Where's Han Na? - What?

310
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:34,179
- Han Na? - Yes.

311
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,580
She was with them. Where did she go?

312
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,189
Han Na.

313
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:01,480
Han Na.

314
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,709
Didn't you miss me?

315
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,119
I missed you.

316
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:12,090
Can't you...

317
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,619
let me see your face?

318
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:19,230
Han Na.

319
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,669
It's all because of me.

320
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,409
If I hadn't existed,

321
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:40,050
you and Mr. Yang could've been happy.

322
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,719
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,189
I apologize.

324
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,020
Mr. Yang died because of me.

325
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,330
Han Na.

326
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,800
It's my fault.

327
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,300
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,000
I apologize.

329
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm so sorry.

330
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,540
Who said that?

331
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,280
I was so relieved you were around.

332
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:12,079
Erica and Phillip relied on you so much.

333
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,350
Don't say that.

334
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,090
I'm sorry, Han Na.

335
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:21,889
I took you to Chairman Lee.

336
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,389
I must've lost my mind.

337
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,929
I was...

338
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,070
I missed you.

339
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,840
I missed you so much.

340
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,480
I'm sorry, Han Na.

341
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm sorry.

342
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,409
I'm so sorry.

343
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:12,468
Is Myoung Ji's interrogation over?

344
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:14,438
I was told she returned home at 6pm.

345
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,879
Is Prosecutor Kang acting strange?

346
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,949
No. He's very close with the prosecutor general.

347
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,379
Losers get on so well with each other.

348
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,629
How is everything, Detective Oh?

349
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,760
Are you watching Do Hyuk closely?

350
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,359
Yes, sir. Everything's fine here.

351
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,669
Stop calling, you pervy stalker.

352
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,310
The lunatic.

353
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,639
He's so full of energy.

354
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:10,230
Chan Sung.

355
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:24,240
Mr. Hwang. I know you're at home.

356
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,909
If you don't let me in, I'll break down the door.

357
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,859
- Break in. - Yes, sir.

358
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:41,500
Wait there.

359
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,379
Chan Sung told you he was unwell.

360
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,879
You had to come all the way to my house.

361
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,250
I wanted to wish him a speedy recovery.

362
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,990
Where's Mr. Hwang?

363
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,060
Let's see his face.

364
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,389
He took his meds and fell asleep.

365
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:15,699
Wake him up.

366
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,500
If it's just the flu,

367
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,330
it won't kill him.

368
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,709
He's not well.

369
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,310
He can barely speak.

370
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm surprised.

371
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,609
You care this much about him?

372
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,189
Then I'll have a drink and wait.

373
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,790
He told me he got a nice bottle of port.

374
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,490
I have to go to the basement for it.

375
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,929
The staff aren't in today.

376
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,770
Your husband's ill...

377
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,310
and the staff is absent?

378
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,810
The flu must be limited to just this house.

379
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,850
Don't just stand there.

380
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,449
Get the port.

381
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,550
I can't go. I don't live here.

382
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:14,820
Don't think of waking Chan Sung.

383
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,959
Get something nice.

384
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:28,699
Mr. Hwang?

385
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,969
Mr. Hwang.

386
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:37,439
Chan Sung. Where are you?

387
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:40,980
Hwang Chan Sung.

388
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,490
Chan Sung.

389
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:55,899
He's not the type to stay away knowing I'm here.

390
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,179
Chan Sung.

391
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,659
Chan Sung.

392
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:30,159
Where are you?

393
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:49,649
What is this place?

394
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,129
K knows everything now.

395
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:42,770
He knows Hwang Chan Sung died and that Do Hyuk was here.

396
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,040
Get out of there before the police arrive.

397
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,869
What about Chan Sung's body?

398
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:49,810
Do as I say. I'll take care of the rest.

399
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,459
(Construction work, Do not enter, Go around)

400
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,330
Let's go.

401
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,869
Yes, Mone. Run.

402
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,840
Whether it's to Kang Ki Tak or to Cha Ju Ran and Nam Chul Woo.

403
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,310
I already know what you're planning.

404
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,879
The burner phone.

405
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,550
Here, sir.

406
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:36,790
This is the police hotline.

407
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,129
Someone... A man is dead. I need help.

408
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:41,859
Where are you at?

409
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,830
Hwang Chan Sung's home. Save CEO Hwang Chan Sung.

410
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,169
I know the killer. It's Min Do Hyuk.

411
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:50,600
He escaped police custody and went on a killing spree.

412
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,810
No, don't. Please.

413
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,350
Did Min Do Hyuk really kill Mr. Hwang?

414
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,050
Of course not.

415
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,520
I think Mone killed him.

416
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,249
Hwang Chan Sung figured out...

417
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,490
that Do Hyuk logged onto LUCA.

418
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,119
They had no choice but to kill him.

419
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:13,990
How brazen.

420
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,158
She killed her husband,

421
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,230
then pretended to be him.

422
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:21,070
Isn't it bad for us if Min Do Hyuk logged into LUCA?

423
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,939
He'll have found out about the billion-dollar family.

424
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,569
They're hastening their own deaths.

425
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,669
What choice do I have?

426
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,340
I must kill them so they can't talk.

427
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:36,879
I think I'm being followed.

428
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,219
I can't reveal the hideout.

429
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,350
I'll go somewhere else.

430
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,419
No. Keep going.

431
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,389
I'll get them off your tail.

432
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,889
What do you mean?

433
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:49,959
- Where are you? - Trust me and drive on.

434
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:51,869
Don't ever stop the car.

435
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,750
Who's this?

436
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,549
Kang Ki Tak.

437
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,940
Yes, sir. I understand.

438
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,480
(Arrest Warrant: Min Do Hyuk)

439
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,389
Follow me.

440
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,790
The call cannot be connected.

441
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,860
This is strange. I can't reach Kang Ki Tak.

442
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,259
I can't get a signal.

443
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:58,460
What's going on? I lost the connection to LUCA.

444
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
(Korean Provincial Police Agency)

445
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,639
Detective Jang.

446
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,139
I told you not to come in without permission!

447
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Oh Sang Sik!

448
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,310
You're under arrest for abetting murder and obstruction.

449
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,710
Arrest him.

450
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
What are you doing?

451
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,880
Why do you say I abetted murder?

452
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,318
CEO Hwang Chan Sung is dead.

453
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,580
Min Do Hyuk's the culprit.

454
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,219
Get him out of here.

455
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,819
It wasn't Min Do Hyuk.

456
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:22,218
Let me explain!

457
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,489
What happened was...

458
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,659
Min Do Hyuk. Your arrest warrant was issued.

459
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,600
We'll take you to Seoul Detention Center.

460
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:30,759
Let go of me.

461
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,569
- Come along. - Let me go!

462
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,699
Let go of me!

463
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,610
Hey.

464
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,178
What about Ki Tak?

465
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,610
Why isn't he here? He said he'd be here a while ago.

466
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,149
I can't reach him.

467
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,420
What do you mean? Since when? Why?

468
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,790
I'll go out for a bit.

469
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,859
I think something is wrong.

470
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,198
Where will you go?

471
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,199
To see Do Hyuk.

472
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,298
If Ki Tak's in danger, so is he.

473
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:07,770
- I should check on him. - Be careful.

474
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,199
If you might get caught, run away.

475
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,839
Why would I get caught? No one's as fast as me.

476
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:28,250
This just came in. Save CEO Hwang Chan Sung was found dead.

477
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,588
He was murdered in his own home.

478
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,488
Police concluded he was killed by Min Do Hyuk who was...

479
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:36,359
detained for the murder of Mayor Yang...

480
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,830
and got an arrest warrant.

481
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,298
It's said Min Do Hyuk escaped the police station...

482
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,729
with the help of a detective...

483
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,069
and murdered Hwang Chan Sung.

484
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:52,250
(Gangnam Police Station)

485
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,350
Did you see the news?

486
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,419
Do Hyuk was taken to a detention center.

487
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,779
Detective Oh's being questioned too.

488
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:58,420
Have you heard from Ki Tak?

489
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,549
Not yet.

490
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,419
Get back here now.

491
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Don't be out on your own, okay?

492
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
I'll turn myself in.

493
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,500
I killed Chan Sung.

494
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,069
Do Hyuk doesn't know anything.

495
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,440
Who would believe that?

496
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,940
They'll stick anything on Do Hyuk to make him look guilty.

497
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,449
The public even thinks you and him had an affair.

498
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,819
The truth never matters.

499
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:31,818
People imagine what they want,

500
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,420
and crave whatever is more provoking.

501
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,089
Because that's fun.

502
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,589
Because that makes money.

503
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
So...

504
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:41,029
bide your time.

505
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,860
There is no time!

506
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,229
Do you think K will let Do Hyuk off...

507
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,529
for toying with LUCA?

508
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,368
He'll try to kill Do Hyuk!

509
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,799
Who said I'd let that happen?

510
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,469
Jun Seok that dirtbag.

511
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:56,508
If he touches my nephew,

512
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:58,380
I'll pull out all his hair!

513
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,350
The only family I have left...

514
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,449
is Do Hyuk.

515
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Kang Ki Tak.

516
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,230
Let me ask you something.

517
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,400
Why are you still lurking around me?

518
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,139
That's for you to find out.

519
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,909
It was weird from the start.

520
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,079
Even if Geum La Hui was your first love,

521
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,710
for her daughter,

522
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,310
you helped the old Bang Chil Sung,

523
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,949
then Min Do Hyuk,

524
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,580
and now you're protecting Mone?

525
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,219
You have nothing to do with Bang Da Mi or her revenge.

526
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:49,130
I don't see why you're so deeply involved.

527
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,468
Don't you dare say that name!

528
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,670
So I did some thinking.

529
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,339
Bang Da Mi.

530
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,139
Is she your daughter?

531
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,250
She is.

532
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,880
You're Bang Da Mi's real dad.

533
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,790
Now all the puzzle pieces are falling into place.

534
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,690
That's why you helped Min Do Hyuk.

535
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,219
Am I right?

536
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
You punk.

537
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,270
I'll kill you with my own hands.

538
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,799
- Darn you! - I can't stand you.

539
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,369
What were you going to use LUCA for?

540
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,139
What is Do Hyuk's plan?

541
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,540
Tell me,

542
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,279
and I'll spare your life.

543
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:44,949
Hey.

544
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,690
Do you think I'd bargain...

545
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,790
with an animal?

546
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Okay.

547
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Then...

548
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,900
I'll send you to your daughter's side.

549
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,650
Sir. The prosecutor general called.

550
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,580
Darn it.

551
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,460
Hello, sir. It's me.

552
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,270
Where's Min Do Hyuk?

553
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:33,569
In solitary.

554
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,940
I kneaded him a bit to put him in his place.

555
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,500
Very well done.

556
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:42,279
Min Do Hyuk's accomplices...

557
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,540
will never be seen again.

558
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,580
Kang Ki Tak and Detective Oh.

559
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,750
The others are just small fry.

560
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,020
Hwang Chan Sung's death was convenient too.

561
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:53,389
You got your hands on Save much more easily.

562
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:55,420
Congratulations.

563
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:56,919
It might get wrapped up...

564
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,929
before the announcement's made, just as you wished.

565
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:01,060
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

566
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,729
It's no fun at all...

567
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,299
if the great Kang Ki Tak were to die this easily.

568
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
Wait.

569
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,209
It's a shame you didn't see your daughter die,

570
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,810
but if you were to watch your beloved Do Hyuk die first,

571
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:19,179
that would be fun.

572
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,679
No. Leave Do Hyuk alone.

573
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,549
Don't do anything to him.

574
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:28,449
Shall I go see Min Do Hyuk, then?

575
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,690
Keep a close eye on him.

576
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,528
Make him a cripple if you must...

577
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:35,060
and make him tell what Do Hyuk is planning.

578
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,860
- Yes, sir. - You!

579
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,130
Stop where you are! No!

580
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
No.

581
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:46,909
No.

582
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,000
Mr. Min is brave.

583
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,900
So he'll be fine.

584
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,909
Grandma said so.

585
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:29,650
That the good people eventually win.

586
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,790
That outfit looks good on you.

587
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:10,560
You're a thug through and through.

588
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:12,290
What do you want?

589
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,589
I came to say goodbye.

590
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:17,928
We both shared the name "Sim Jun Seok."

591
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,270
We have a special connection.

592
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,799
Of course, we both shed that name.

593
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,699
You became Min Do Hyuk,

594
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,940
and I became Lee Hwi So.

595
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,540
You're Lee Hwi So?

596
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,850
Jun Seok.

597
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:34,549
You're just...

598
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:37,020
mentally unstable.

599
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,449
Oh, guess what?

600
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,889
Tied up in my basement...

601
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,960
is Kang Ki Tak.

602
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,659
That means...

603
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,730
no one can come to your rescue.

604
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,770
You will die, no matter what.

605
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,270
According to my plan, in the way that I want.

606
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,480
I heard people have many regrets before they die.

607
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,279
I wonder what your father regretted.

608
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:16,190
Today, I have come here...

609
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,429
to end the dispute about what's real...

610
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,290
and what's fake.

611
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,730
I will be sure to pay the price...

612
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,830
for only revealing the truth now.

613
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
My son is...

614
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,210
Min Do Hyuk.

615
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:38,310
Did he regret admitting you were his biological son?

616
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,549
It is true that Min Do Hyuk is my biological son,

617
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:44,520
but Sim Jun Seok, the serial killer,

618
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:48,619
is Matthew Lee, the chairman of TIKITAKA.

619
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,460
It...

620
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,389
It wasn't enough that he killed the mom who raised him.

621
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,730
He brutally murdered Bang Da Mi's family...

622
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,069
and Min Do Hyuk's family as well.

623
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,369
He also killed Song Ji A...

624
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,670
and made it look like she'd killed herself.

625
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,540
Or...

626
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:11,779
did he regret abandoning me?

627
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,350
Min Do Hyuk...

628
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:17,549
is innocent.

629
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,819
He lost his whole family...

630
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,589
to Jun Seok.

631
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,819
He's a victim.

632
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,790
His...

633
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,130
innocence...

634
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,429
Chairman Sim!

635
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:47,980
He must've felt a little sorry for me, right?

636
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:52,920
You still haven't broken free from Chairman Sim Yong's brutality.

637
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:56,389
Shall I answer instead?

638
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,429
He would've regretted not killing you.

639
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:06,569
He would've regretted turning you into a monster.

640
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,069
He would've lamented...

641
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,040
that he wasn't able to raise his son to become an adult.

642
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,440
Whether or not that's true,

643
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:19,710
you can go and ask him in person.

644
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,679
Soon,

645
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:25,020
you'll be going to meet your father.

646
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,819
When you do,

647
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:29,219
give him my greetings too.

648
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:31,119
Well, then.

649
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,770
How did you...

650
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,000
get in here?

651
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,369
And what brings you here, Prosecutor Kang?

652
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,380
A spot inspection has been scheduled for tomorrow.

653
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,650
We need the suspect's confession before then.

654
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,880
There's so much attention on this case,

655
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,979
so the Prosecutor General ordered...

656
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,520
the investigation to proceed urgently.

657
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:02,960
I see.

658
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:04,290
Then,

659
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,159
I hope you get his confession.

660
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:21,770
I've brought the whiskey you mentioned.

661
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,080
Leave it here.

662
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,409
And clean up around that punk too.

663
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,679
Yes, sir.

664
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:05,649
Has Kang Ki Tak started talking?

665
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,889
No, sir. He's more stubborn than we thought.

666
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:10,960
Well, it can't be helped.

667
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,659
Just kill him quietly when the time is right.

668
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:13,960
Yes, sir.

669
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:16,258
Also, we'll take care of Min Do Hyuk after the spot inspection...

670
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:17,600
and make it out as a suicide.

671
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,500
Suicide, you say.

672
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,670
Then, we'll have to create a fun little show.

673
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,109
Call as many reporters and vloggers...

674
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,779
to wherever Min Do Hyuk goes today.

675
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Yes, sir.

676
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,479
A spot inspection of Min Do Hyuk,

677
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,749
who has been arrested on charges of murdering Seoul mayor Yang Jin Mo...

678
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,979
and CEO Hwang Chan Sung of Save...

679
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,519
He should at least seem like a monkey in a zoo...

680
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,020
for people to believe that he died out of shame.

681
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,088

691

- Those jerks should be separated... - A national hero? More like killer.

698
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,729
- I'm breathing the same air as him? - Is he just pretending to be human?

what I did to Da Mi.

Mone had a baby,

717
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:18,178
and because Mone asked me, I took the newborn baby outside!

00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,150
She's lying.

730
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,948

731
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,049
What did I do wrong?

732
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:57,290
We've found definitive proof!

733
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,290
The baby's ultrasound photos.

734
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:00,529
This is...

735
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,830
It's not mine.

736
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,759
It's not mine! Please believe me!

737
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,170
It's not mine!

738
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,739
She's right.

739
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:18,779
I did that to Lee Hwi So back then too.

740
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,049
We can't leave Min Do Hyuk like that. Let's go.

741
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,319
- We should. - No.

742
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:31,658
You're in a delicate condition.

743
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:32,689
It's your first pregnancy.

744
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,088
What if something happens to the baby?

745
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:35,659
And to you too. No!

746
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:37,960
Really?

747
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:43,369
I, Cha Ju Ran, have never given up on any mother or baby...

748
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,199
ever since my days as an OB-GYN.

749
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,940
I always saved them both.

750
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,270
The same goes for now.

751
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,738
I will save Min Do Hyuk,

752
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,580
and I'll have our baby and raise it well.

753
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,609
There will come a day...

754
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,509
when you'll boast about Mom's performance.

755
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:59,588
So, don't think about stopping me, Dad.

756
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:00,949
All right. Let's go.

757
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,389
- Let's go. - Come on.

758
00:52:19,299 --> 00:52:20,310
You promise...

759
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:22,210
to come back?

760
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,009
You can't get hurt.

761
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:54,339
How pretty.

762
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,100
Next up.

763
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,669
The Gagok District public policy blueprint presentation...

764
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,270
is set to happen this afternoon in the main building of TIKITAKA.

765
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:26,138
At the presentation, Chairman Matthew Lee,

766
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,609
who has been entrusted with the development rights,

767
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,679
the Prime Minister, and others will be in attendance.

768
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,350
Since Mayor Yang's death...

769
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,609
(Gagok District Public Policy Blueprint Presentation)

770
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,850
(The Dream City Imagined by TIKITAKA)

771
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,779
Father, you see this, don't you?

772
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,579
Look at how great a man your fake son,

773
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,549
whom you looked down on, has become.

774
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,319
And keep watching...

775
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,690
as your real son faces his end.

776
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,659
Gosh, how impressive.

777
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,960
Welcome, Prime Minister.

778
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,699
Welcome to TIKITAKA.

779
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,739
Is Min Do Hyuk...

780
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:38,409
being taken care of today for certain?

781
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,610
Yes.

782
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,049
I plan on having him killed...

783
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:45,879
in the car heading to the detention center after the spot inspection.

784
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,089
Of course, it will be disguised as a suicide.

785
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,759
There can't be any problems afterward.

786
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,460
You can't forget that I am...

787
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:57,699
the next presidential candidate.

788
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:00,799
Just trust me.

789
00:55:05,299 --> 00:55:07,540
That murderer!

790
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:08,969
You jerk!

791
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,178
How could you do that?

792
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:12,909
(Victim, Yang Jin Mo)

793
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,709
Get over here, punk!

794
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,149
Look at him!

795
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,649
Murderer!

796
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,079
Hey, jerk!

797
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,889
Hey, you jerk! Get over here!

798
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,318
Just die!

799
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,689
How did you kill him, punk?

800
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,719
(Victim, Yang Jin Mo)

801
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,060
Hit me, curse at me, and stomp on me all you want.

802
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,400
Just as you want, I will become...

803
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,699
Bang Da Mi and Lee Hwi So.

804
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:50,250
Min Do Hyuk will die soon.

805
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,819
I'll let you die then too.

806
00:56:01,429 --> 00:56:02,429
Kang Ki Tak!

807
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,569
You will regret letting me live the most.

808
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,049
Tomorrow afternoon. The back door.

809
00:56:35,489 --> 00:56:36,900
- Ki Tak! - Hey.

810
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,710
Do you know how worried I was?

811
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:50,540
I couldn't sleep a wink all night.

812
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,850
Why would you give up your life for someone like Mone?

813
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,819
How am I supposed to live?

814
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:03,089
She's Han Na's mom.

815
00:57:04,259 --> 00:57:05,759
I couldn't let her get hurt.

816
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,690
Don't cry.

817
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,960
What about Do Hyuk?

818
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,730
I heard he was taken to a detention center.

819
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,770
There's a spot inspection today.

820
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:19,239
Chul Woo and Ju Ran went to save Do Hyuk.

821
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,069
We should go to Somang Hospital.

822
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,810
Somang Hospital? Who's there?

823
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,409
You'll know when we get there.

824
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,810
Let's hurry.

825
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,380
Please, let there have been a miracle.

00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:35,618
(Suspect, Min Do Hyuk)

827
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,690
Let's go if you're done.

828
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:45,429
What's that?

829
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,690
What's with you people?

830
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,489
Do you want to be arrested for obstruction of justice?

831
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,029
Ms. Han Mone?

832
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:16,900
Why are you helping the murderer who killed your husband?

833
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:19,159
Who says this man is a murderer?

834
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,000
You're making a mistake by making an innocent man do a spot inspection.

835
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,600
No need to explain.

836
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,368
Han Mone! Take Min Do Hyuk and get going.

837
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:27,710
We'll handle things here.

838
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,670
Hurry!

839
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,580
Hey, get them, darn it!

840
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,350
Don't move!

841
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,449
If you move, I shoot.

842
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,319
I'm a pregnant woman.

843
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:41,119
An old first-time mom in her 50s.

844
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:43,020
If you lay a hand on me and my baby gets hurt,

845
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,619
you'll all become murderers.

846
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:48,560
- What? - Mone! Hurry up and leave!

847
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,130
Don't move!

848
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,739
The Gagok District Blueprint Presentation will begin soon.

849
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:02,069
Let's go there.

850
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,540
I heard from Kang Ki Tak.

851
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:06,850
You need your laptop, right?

852
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:23,029
Soon, I will have everything I want in my hands.

853
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,380
Min Do Hyuk got away.

854
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,110
"Got away?"

855
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,610
Cancel today's presentation.

856
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,420
Min Do Hyuk might come here.

857
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,019
He'll be running around crazy.

858
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,049
We must hide for now.

859
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,420
No.

860
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:51,219
There will be no cancellations.

861
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,689
We can't ruin our great plans from the beginning...

862
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,029
because of a jerk like him.

863
00:59:55,889 --> 00:59:57,100
Isn't this rather a good thing?

864
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,330
We have a clear reason to have Min Do Hyuk killed.

865
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:07,368
Before the main event as we embark upon...

866
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:08,568
this great project,

867
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:10,810
we will have a tape-cutting ceremony.

869
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,580
Two.

The target is a serial killer!

874
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:33,699
If he resists, you may shoot to kill.

875
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,830

879
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,089
Thanks for today.

This is actress Han Mone.

CEO Hwang Chan Sung of Save.

883
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,630
I'll go and turn myself in now.

884

Mr. Min Do Hyuk.

A great project that Korea and TIKITAKA will take on together.

888
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,380
The long-awaited first moment will begin now.

889
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:32,650
There is one man who has worked the hardest for this moment.

890
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,549

Thank you to the honored guests who have joined us today.

896
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,049
from the stage...

897
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,480
makes my heart feel full.

899

I won't speak for long.

900
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:14,290
I will repay you with results.

Where do you think you're going?

01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,250
No one can leave this place without my permission.

944

How dare you come here, you murderer?

945

We will protect Min Do Hyuk.

964
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:25,440
As long as we're here, you can never take him.

965
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:27,908
The person who tried to kill me was not Min Do Hyuk...

966
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:29,249
but Sim Jun Seok himself.

967
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,719
What on earth happened?

01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:35,749
If not, mass chaos might break out soon.

01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:38,088
Stop LUCA.

972
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:39,258
Why should I?

973
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:41,229
Get that great Min Do Hyuk to stop it.

974
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,559
But Min Do Hyuk already died by your hand...

975
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,799
