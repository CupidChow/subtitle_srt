Don't move!

7
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,829
Min Do Hyuk is not a murderer.

I swear on my baby.

Yang Jin Mo sacrificed himself to protect his family.

The police having his kids...

11
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:13,069
in protective custody is all a lie too.

12
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,740
The kids have been with us this whole time!

13
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,050
We move according to our superiors' orders.

We will arrest you for obstruction of justice.

15

Do you really think Min Do Hyuk is a murderer?

16
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,318
You all thought about this at least once!

17
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,419
You doubted it!

18
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,459
That Min Do Hyuk isn't the culprit.

19
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,690
That Matthew could be Sim Jun Seok.

20
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:33,229
That we could've been fooled. Isn't that right?

21
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,069
Why do you only obey orders that don't make any sense?

22
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,039
Why won't you do anything?

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,069
What power do we have?

24
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,409
We have to do as they tell us to in this organization.

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,839
That was why Bang Da Mi died!

26

Even if a guy like me acted crazy, no one stopped me!

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,490
No one took that girl's side.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,520
How painful would it have been?

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,330
All alone... Just like that.

30
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,600
At this rate,

31
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,069
Min Do Hyuk will die like Bang Da Mi too.

32
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,370

00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:34,949
Okay.

The long-awaited first moment will begin now.

51

There is one man who has worked the hardest for this moment.

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,130
The man who can be called a pioneer more than anyone.

53

Thank you to the honoured guests who have joined us today.

59
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,030
from the stage...

60
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,270
makes my heart feel full.

65
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:35,938
to reveal to you today.

This time, I hope the truth gets revealed for certain.

132
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,879
All of the evidence proves that you are the murderer!

133
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,089
You're a criminal who should be at the spot inspection!

134

Hurry up and arrest the criminal.

137
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,330
You manipulated that video too, didn't you?

138
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,830
Min Do Hyuk.

139
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,700
You must be out of your mind.

140
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,900
You're going this far to cover up your murder.

141
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,339
Aren't you afraid of the people's fury?

142
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,700
"The people's fury?"

143
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,840
That's what I wish for the most.

144
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,280
When the people find out what you've done so far,

145
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,749
how angry must they be out of a sense of betrayal?

146
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,479
What would the people think about that video?

147
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,090
I'm very curious.

148
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,420
Chairman Lee. You should say it yourself.

149
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,629
How did I kill Mayor Yang Jin Mo?

150
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,259
You said you were a witness.

151
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,100
Then, you'd be able to explain things clearly.

152
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,330
If you prove it for certain, I'll admit everything as well.

153
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,710
Yang Jin Mo's body has been cremated anyway.

154
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,340
No matter what lies I tell, that jerk can't prove it in any way.

155
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,279
I saw it with my own eyes.

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
That jerk...

157
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,089
not only pushed Mayor Yang off of a cliff...

158
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,960
but he also gouged out Mayor Yang's eyes with a devilish face.

159
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,389
- His eyes? - No way.

160
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,600
This is a hate crime.

161
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,670
If Mayor Yang hadn't sacrificed himself,

162
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,999
his kids would've faced a horrendous death.

163
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Darn him...

164
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,710
Min Do Hyuk.

165
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,680
And how will you prove that you're not a murderer?

166
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,350
You not only killed Yang Jin Mo...

167
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,690
but also CEO Hwang Chan Sung!

168
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,289
The police already have footage...

169
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,759
of you escaping from your holding cell...

170
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,290
and breaking into CEO Hwang's house!

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,229
Did you really...

172
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,470
kill your husband?

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes.

174
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,869
I stabbed Hwang Chan Sung with this.

175
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,180
Min Do Hyuk has nothing to do with Hwang Chan Sung's death.

176
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,249
He has been framed.

177
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,350
Six years ago,

178
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,619
the person who had a baby at Myeongju Girls' High School...

179
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,129
was also me.

180
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,159
Bang Da Mi was wrongly accused just like Min Do Hyuk right now.

181
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,070
I...

182
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,340
framed Da Mi on purpose.

183
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,639
The child's father...

184
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,540
is Sim Jun Seok,

185
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,609
Chairman Matthew Lee.

186
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,879
You're not...

187
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,680
lying right now, are you?

188
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,720
I swear on the skies above.

189
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,119
No part of what I just said was a lie.

190
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:01,659
Da Mi, I'm sorry.

191
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,330
It's too late,

192
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,769
but I'm really sorry.

193
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,070
Why must I prove that?

194
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,239
I'm the one...

195
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,080
who has been wrongly accused as a murderer.

196
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,609
Six years ago,

197
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,019
after the student, Bang Da Mi died,

198
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,249
we have not changed one bit.

199
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,920
The one who committed a crime...

200
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,729
has not been punished.

201
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,440
This is the secret chat between the Prime Minister and Matthew.

202
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,310
I plan to make Min Do Hyuk the second Bang Da Mi...

203
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,820
and the second Lee Hwi So.

204
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,690
You mean you will make him the target of hate and criticism?

205
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,790
There is no other ending more befitting for Min Do Hyuk.

206
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,800
- What was that about? - I can't believe it!

207
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,629
Hey, turn that off this instant!

208
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,129
I said to turn it off!

209
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,998
We can't let that criminal toy with us!

210
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,869
What are you doing? Hurry up and arrest him!

211
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,108
Hands above your head!

212
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:19,709
- Prime Minister, explain yourself! - Darn it.

213
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,710
Oh, no.

214
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,810
You devils!

215
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,649
We will protect Min Do Hyuk.

216
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,989
As long as we're here, you can never take him.

217
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,590
What do you think you're doing to an unarmed civilian?

218
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:38,859
Lower your weapons now!

219
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,159
Don't you see what you're doing right now?

220
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,369
Those people are the ones you should be pointing your guns at!

221
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,450
Min Do Hyuk, keep going.

222
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,350
Don't leave anything out...

223
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,220
and reveal every little detail.

224
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,930
If only we had played our own parts in our own places,

225
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,499
what would the world have been like?

226
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:18,869
Sir.

227
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,300
Please help me arrest Sim Jun Seok urgently.

228
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,340
It hurts my pride too much to just stand by and watch!

229
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,769
Even civilians are risking their lives to take a stand.

230
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,479
As a prosecutor of this country, I'm too ashamed!

231
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,680
- Do it. - Gosh. What?

232
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,450
Do it. A prosecutor has his pride.

233
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,450
I'll get the arrest warrant for you.

234
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,420
Thank you, sir! Salute!

235
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,659
(National police that sticks to the basics)

236
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,159
We must go quickly. Min Do Hyuk is in danger.

237
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:50,499
Detective Oh.

238
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,999
It'll be dangerous if you go just like this.

239
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,899
- According to procedure... - Then, we'll be too late.

240
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,970
Right now, I'll only think about catching Sim Jun Seok.

241
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Let's go.

242
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,550
I will ask you one more time.

243
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,590
Am I really...

244
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,960
the murderer who killed Yang Jin Mo?

245
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,259
Did you really see me...

246
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
gouge out Yang Jin Mo's eyes?

247
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,470
Answer me,

248
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,540
Mr. Sim Jun Seok.

249
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,999
Yes, I saw you.

250
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,739
I saw how you made sure he was dead in the most gruesome way.

251
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:37,210
I can still hear Yang Jin Mo's screams ringing in my ears.

252
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,609
(Auntie)

253
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,479
Do Hyuk. Don't be surprised and just listen to me.

254
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,449
We just found a heart donor.

255
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,949
It's a total miracle!

256
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,850
Go Myoung Ji can live now.

257
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,648
Hurry up and go to Somang Hospital now.

258
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,060
Mr. Jo is waiting.

259
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,889
(Restricted area, Authorized personnel only)

260
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:28,430
The patient was just declared brain dead.

261
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,728
The heart is available for a transplant.

262
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,869
(Operating Room)

263
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,670
Yang Jin Mo is brain dead.

264
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,908
Please proceed with the heart transplant...

265
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,879
on Ms. Go Myoung Ji at Yehyeon Hospital.

266
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,580
We already received their consent.

267
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,749
Yang Jin Mo must be a dead man for now.

268
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,749
Take care of it without any mistakes.

269
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,420
(Heart donor: Yang Jin Mo)

270
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,359
(Somang Hospital)

271
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,540
(Yang Jin Mo)

272
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,050
They weren't able to get rid of all the shrapnel in his heart.

273
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:22,820
He's not in any state to undergo surgery,

274
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,190
so they must've just stopped midway.

275
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,550
Then,

276
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,590
does that mean he could die just like this?

277
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,960
We have to leave it up to the skies now.

278
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Yang Jin Mo...

279
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,009
What is going on?

280
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,119
Jin Mo...

281
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,249
Jin Mo!

282
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,639
Seoul Mayor Yang Jin Mo.

284
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,399
Yang Jin Mo is alive!

285
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,209
- Chairman Lee. - What is this?

286
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,310
What happened?

287
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Didn't you say you saw it with your own eyes?

288
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,549
You said you saw Min Do Hyuk kill Mayor Yang...

289
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,309
and even gouge out his eyes!

290
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,320
And yet,

291
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,119
why is he still alive?

292
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,149
Why are his eyes still fine when they've been gouged out?

293
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,659
- No way. - I did not die.

294
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm alive and standing here now.

295
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,530
In other words,

296
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,129
Min Do Hyuk's murder charge...

297
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,000
does not stand.

298
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:50,000
The person who tried to kill me was not Min Do Hyuk...

299
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
but Matthew Lee,

300
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,310
Sim Jun Seok himself.

301
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
That's right.

302
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,149
The person who tried to kill me as well...

303
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,010
was none other than Sim Jun Seok.

304
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,750
You've all been fooled by Sim Jun Seok's lies.

305
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,358
What on earth happened?

306
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,989
- Chairman! - Did you really fool everyone?

307
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,958
- Please give us a statement! - Answer the question!

308
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,959
Do you admit that you lied?

309
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,800
How is he still alive?

310
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,669
No.

311
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,580
This makes no sense.

312
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,010
I was sure I killed him.

313
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,879
We're supposed to believe that?

314
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,648
- Matthew, you're crazy. - Matthew, you're unbelievable.

315
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,849
(Matthew Lee, you're a crazy bastard!)

316
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,050
(How can we trust him?)

317
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,490
I'm going to kill you all.

318

319

320
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,489
Hey, hurry up and get going!

321
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,490
Yes, sir.

322
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:21,629
Hurry!

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,429

What?

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,350
What?

328
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,350
Why...

329
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,350
do I keep...

330
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,850
feeling sleepy?

331
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,990
Don't dose off. You can't fall asleep.

332
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,389
You can hear my voice, right?

333
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,060
Honey, look at me.

334
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,260
Please, look at me.

335
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,600
You're the prettiest...

336
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,929
and the coolest...

337

person in the whole world.

338
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
You're...

339
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,609
going to be...

340
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,820
the coolest mom ever.

341
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,919

342
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,490
And you're going to be the best dad.

343
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:27,129
So...

344
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Hang in there a little while.

345
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,629
Just a little while...

346
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,270
It was...

347
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,010
a really...

348
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,139
cool fight.

I know.

362

Get that great Min Do Hyuk to stop it.

363

But Min Do Hyuk already died by your hand...

364

If I don't log in,

366
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,049
LUCA will infiltrate all the networks in the country...

367
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,320
and reveal the whole world's secret chats.

368
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,619
Then, Korea will become a huge mess.

369
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,159
Look. There's not even a minute left.

370
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,990
(Matthew Lee is not logged in. Attack on the network starts in...)

371
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,698
(Matthew Lee is not logged in. Attack on the network starts in...)

372
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:16,899
(Matthew Lee is not logged in. Attack on the network starts in...)

373
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
- What is that? - Look.

374
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,000
Log in, right now!

375
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,639
I can't go down on my own!

376
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,239
(Matthew Lee is not logged in. Attack on the network starts in...)

377
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,780
- What's happening? - What's that?

378
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,149
(Matthew Lee is not logged in.)

379
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,649
(Opening attack on the network)

380
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,560
LUCA is an AI developed by Lee Hwi So...

381
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,490
to offer the public ease and convenience.

382
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,500
Sim Jun Seok created Children Home...

383
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,800
to collect the DNA of every member of the public,

384
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:54,330
but he failed.

385
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,740
He also viewed your secret chats without permission...

386
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,678
and collected and saved data that wasn't his own.

387
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,480
What's this? What's going on?

388
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,678
What are you yapping on about?

389
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,480
(He also viewed your secret chats without permission...)

390
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,750
Oh, dear.

391
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,790
It looks like Min Do Hyuk set something up.

392
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,590
First, I must separate K from LUCA.

393
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,929
(He also viewed your secret chats without permission...)

394
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:21,129
No.

395
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,459
You can't betray me.

396
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,399
You can't abandon me!

397
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,899
No... No way.

398
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,540
Min Do Hyuk, you scumbag!

399
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,750
A world where personal information is kept safe.

400
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,820
A world where fake news is never made.

401
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,320
That was the future Lee Hwi So wanted.

402
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,858
All data excluding that...

403
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,129
on Sim Jun Seok will be deleted.

404
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,929
Goodbye forever.

405
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,169
No.

406
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:07,980
No.

407
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:09,879
No.

408
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,709
LUCA brought you down.

409
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,949
It only remembers your crimes.

410
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,590
You have no allies now.

411
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
No.

412
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,158
Amid the special team formed to investigate Sim Jun Seok,

413
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,429
additional crimes have continued to surface.

414
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,070
Save, the company that led the media corruption,

415
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,040
ended its service today following the search and seizure.

416
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:42,908
Sim Jun Seok's one-billion dollar family,

417
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,108
which turned out to be most of the senior government officials,

418
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,908
have resigned simultaneously.

419
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:48,349
A motion was made to pass...

420
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,718
The Bang Da Mi Fake News Prevention Law.

421
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:53,219
(3 months later)

422
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:54,689
(Counsel)

423
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,259
(Defendant)

424
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,859
(Prosecution)

425
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:06,330
All rise.

426
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,310
Be seated.

427
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:26,619
I will begin defendant Sim Jun Seok's sentence.

428
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,990
Your Honour.

429
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,060
May I say one last thing?

430
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,289
(Judge)

431
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,300
Go ahead.

432
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,600
I've searched my heart, and I regret all that I've done.

433
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,469
I'm determined and willing to take what punishment I'm given.

434
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,969
I thought a lot in my cell during the past three months.

435
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,279
How did I become such a monster?

436
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,639
(Prosecution)

437
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,850
What would I have become...

438
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,419
if I'd had a normal life, free from my father's abuse?

439
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:00,389
Your Honour.

440
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Please...

441
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,419
take pity on me.

442
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:05,990
- What? - Are you kidding me?

443
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,699
Are you insane?

444
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,169
Has he lost his mind?

445
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:14,938
He took so many lives,

446
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:16,840
and he wants pity?

447
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,609
Silence.

448
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:21,678
(Judge)

449
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,709
Continue.

450
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,379
I'll tell you...

451
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,580
a fact the world doesn't yet know.

452
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,550
I have...

453
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,619
a child that was born eight years ago.

454
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,959
- What? - He has a child?

455
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,429
That child...

456
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,689
still lives.

457
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,730
The child's alive? Han Mone's child?

458
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Where is the kid, then?

459
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,909
Her name is No Han Na.

460
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,310
Yang Jin Mo adopted her.

461
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,649
I love that child,

462
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,919
but I never got to live with her.

463
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,119
Wouldn't it be sad...

464
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,119
if she were to remember me as a monster dad?

465
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,590
Your Honour.

466
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,560
Please give me one last chance.

467
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,070
I want to beg her for forgiveness,

468
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,270
and as a dad,

469
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,209
I'd like to create some nice memories with her.

470
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,209
Do you call yourself human?

471
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,040
How dare you even say Han Na's name?

472
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:33,810
I can't go down on my own.

473
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,320
I swear I'll kill you.

474
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,020
Return to your seat.

475
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,990
Or I'll have you sent out.

476
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,260
Let go.

477
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,459
(Prosecution)

478
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,239
Strike the defendant's statement...

479
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,540
from the records.

480
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,609
I don't want any of this to be reported, either.

481
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,919
What kind of crap is this? Why did you delete my statement?

482
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:12,289
The people have a right to know.

483
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,159
All this came about because of that child!

484
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,020
I don't want to know. I don't care.

485
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,159
Today, the National Assembly passed...

486
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,070
the Bang Da Mi Fake News Prevention Law.

487
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,100
I also had a lot to think about.

488
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,980
Where did it start to go wrong?

489
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,409
Why was no one able to protect the young girl?

490
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
What did...

491
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,619
we all do then?

492
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
I will hand down...

493
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:52,659
the sentence.

494
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,658
(Judge)

495
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,829
This began with the fake news surrounding...

496
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,800
Bang Da Mi's childbirth at Myeongju Girls' High School.

497
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:06,409
Someone told a lie. Another lie was added, and it grew.

498
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:10,980
It eventually led to a monster called Scarlet Letter.

499
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,879
To Scarlet Letter,

500
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,020
views and money meant more than the truth.

501
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,549
(Judge)

502
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,689
We all...

503
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,619
believed what we heard and spread it.

504
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,060
We can't deny that we assisted the defendant.

505
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,260
However, the biggest problem...

506
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:35,369
is that for a long time, the defendant enjoyed...

507
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,840
the protection of power and avoided punishment.

508
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
If back then,

509
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,209
the teacher protected the student,

510
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,850
- Here. I even have her chart. - the doctor protected the patient,

511
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,750
and the police protected a citizen...

512
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:53,490
Perhaps we could've...

513
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,820
prevented Da Mi's tragedy.

514
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:05,129
Our laws are the final stand that wronged people rely on.

515
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,539
One can demand to be given rights...

516
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,939
only if they respect the rights of others.

517
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,669
This is...

518
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,369
the sentence.

519
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,279
(Judge)

520
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
I sentence...

521
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,419
the defendant to death.

522
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,689
- Yes! - That's it!

523
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,659
- That's perfect. - Justice was served!

524
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,730
It worked out.

525
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,030
No way.

526
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:36,629
I'll appeal. Why should I die?

527
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,830
I'm not done yet.

528
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,709
The defendant's crimes are vicious and grave.

529
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,909
He lied about being remorseful,

530
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,409
and in court, he insulted his own child...

531
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:54,280
which is something no human being should do.

532
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,919
The defendant's appeal...

533
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,050
will be denied.

534
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,550
That's nonsense!

535
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,858
I have the right to protection!

536
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:03,990
(Judge)

537
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:09,730
Lastly,

538
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,770
though it's late,

539
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,500
for not helping Bang Da Mi in her time of need,

540
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,639
as an adult,

541
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:20,469
I apologize sincerely.

542
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,480
I'll appeal. This is a farce.

543
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,850
I'll appeal! I swear I will!

544
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,580
You can't stop me.

545
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,449
I have rights too!

546
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:34,020
- Get rid of him for good! - Darn you!

547
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:35,990
It all worked out.

548
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:58,080
(Newsflash! Sim Jun Seok's child that Han Mone had is alive?)

549
00:32:58,449 --> 00:32:59,980
- What are you doing? - What?

550
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,250
Well...

551
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:06,419
You're going to expose Sim Jun Seok's child?

552
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,219
The people have a right to know.

553
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:16,330
Didn't you hear what the judge said?

554
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,230
The people don't want to know.

555
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,439
I don't expect everyone to be upright.

556
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,070
Can't we at least not embarrass ourselves?

557
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,570
Dear Han Na.

558
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,270
This is the 11th letter to my daughter.

559
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,439
I think of you even more these days.

560
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,139
I miss you a lot.

561
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,780
Could you pay me a visit?

562
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,550
There's so much I didn't tell you.

563
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,350
I'll wait.

564
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,650
You can never beat me.

565
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,219
The one who survives wins.

566
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,860
My execution will never be carried out.

567
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,360
I'll harass you all until I'm old and withered.

568
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,170
(A comforting comment gives courage.)

569
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,839
Who's there?

570
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,480
Who's doing this?

571
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Where is everyone?

572
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,569
Guard.

573
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Guard.

574
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:45,909
Guard!

575
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,650
Darn it. You lunatics.

576
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,210
It was decided from the start.

577
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,409
That I'd die a dog's death.

578
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,750
Like Da Mi who died with a bullet in her heart.

579
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,690
Like Park Nan Young who burned to cinders.

580
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,560
Like Lee Hwi So whose body was blown up.

581
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Will the deities...

582
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,560
permit my revenge?

583
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,170
What is this?

584
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:47,469
Gasoline?

585
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,279
Darn it.

586
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,750
What's this? Will you kill me or what?

587
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,710
(10 years later)

588
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,480
(Yang Phillip)

589
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,650
Yang Phillip.

590
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,949
Your sisters are fighting again.

591
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
What?

592
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,259
Hey!

593
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:12,020
Your mom and dad are criminals.

594
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,060
They were behind Bang Da Mi's death.

595
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,360
They spent a few years in prison.

596
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,600
If I'm wrong, say so.

597
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,929
Yes, that's true.

598
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Did we say it's not?

599
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,199
See? It's true.

600
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,239
You're admitting it at last.

601
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,339
Don't think you're special...

602
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,480
because you're pretty and you get good grades.

603
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,080
You're criminals' offspring.

604
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,580
Be honest.

605
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,080
You're ticked off because your boyfriend asked Erica out.

606
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:40,019
Take it out on him.

607
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,588
Why vent at us?

608
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,259
Erica flirted with him first.

609
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,159
Who, me?

610
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,159
I'm all about good looks.

611
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:49,829
I don't care for guys who are uglier than my dad.

612
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,198
My ego can't take this anymore.

613
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,900
Hey, don't bother with her.

614
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,669
He's just a playboy.

615
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,040
He'll hit on anyone.

616
00:38:58,839 --> 00:38:59,940
Pull yourself together.

617
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,139
Let's go.

618
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,710
Why bother talking to people who won't get it?

619
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,049
There's nothing more to see!

620
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,350
Who's lecturing whom?

621
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,719
You're not even real sisters.

622
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,290
Han Na. You don't even know who your real mom is.

623
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,060
I bet she has a record too.

624
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:21,889
Oh, no.

625
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,860
That's the one thing she hates.

626
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,969
Erica. Ignore it.

627
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:30,139
I can ignore everything but fake news.

628
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,940
Did you see her?

629
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:34,709
Will you take responsibility...

630
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,239
if your lies get someone killed?

631
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,350
How dare you spread gossip?

632
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,980
Han Na's real mom...

633
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,980
is incredibly pretty and sweet.

634
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,548
I'll punish you both according to...

635
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:49,060
the Bang Da Mi Fake News Prevention Law!

636
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,060
- Darn you. - Come at me.

637
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,659
- You! - What?

638
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,199
(Cat Restaurant)

639
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,210
Honey.

640
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,150
Two jjajangmyeon and one jjambbong to the realtor's?

641
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:15,949
Of course, you get free fried dumplings.

642
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,350
It should taste amazing.

643
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,190
- Honey. - Yes?

644
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,549
- Two jjajangmyeon, one jjambbong. - Okay.

645
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:23,859
Let's make that the last order.

646
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,729
We only have ingredients to feed the orphans now.

647
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,730
Okay.

648
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,429
This is the best time of day.

649
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,330
Same for me too.

650
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,310
- I should take that. - Okay.

651
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,309
Hello, Cat Restaurant.

652
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,210
Sorry. We're out of ingredients and...

653
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,179
What?

654
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,020
Erica and Han Na?

655
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,489
Sorry.

656
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,860
I told them not to get into trouble.

657
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:58,388
I should just...

658
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,629
Honey, wait.

659
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,330
Take a deep breath. Honey!

660
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,869
My dad was a police officer.

661
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,469
He first met my mom on Jeju Island.

662
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,909
Mom and Dad fought all the time, saying they weren't...

663
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:18,480
each other's type,

664
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,650
but they slowly took a liking to each other...

665
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,009
and fell in love.

666
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,089
Mom and Dad even loved each other's flaws...

667
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,989
and were the perfect couple.

668
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Mom.

669
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:36,600
What were your flaws?

670
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,239
He's still too young...

671
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:46,239
to understand we're convicted criminals, right?

672
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:48,639
I will...

673
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,779
explain all that to you...

674
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,580
when you're a bit older.

675
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,350
When you're able to understand.

676
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,319
Can I do that?

677
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,190
Our son is ten years old already.

678
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,960
He becomes more like you each day.

679
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:11,028
What he likes to eat, and even how he sleeps.

680
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,798
(The late Nam Chul Woo)

681
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,299
I'm sorry I couldn't visit often.

682
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,639
Will you be in my dream tonight?

683
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,710
I'd like you to.

684
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,480
I miss you so much.

685
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,889
- Mom, get over here! - What?

686
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:37,420
Hurry!

687
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,429
Mom. She thinks her baby is coming.

688
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,969
Son. Call 911.

689
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,310
The baby is about to pop out.

690
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,380
But you can take your time.

691
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:02,618
My mom is an expert at delivering babies.

692
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:03,879
It's not yet due.

693
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,088
- We're at... - There's nothing to worry about.

694
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:07,588
I used to be an OB-GYN.

695
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:09,389
Relax and lie down.

696
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,589
Take some deep breaths.

697
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:16,799
If you must choose between me and the baby,

698
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,029
save my baby.

699
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,170
No, thanks.

700
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,230
That never happens in my book.

701
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,338
I save both mother and child,

702
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,469
so stay strong.

703
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,539
I was a really old first-time mom,

704
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,480
but I had my son naturally.

705
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,279
Since that day ten years ago,

706
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,619
this has happened to me sometimes.

707
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,049
I never refuse the opportunity.

708
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,690
I believe...

709
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,060
this is the reason I was allowed to live...

710
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,389
after doing something unforgivable.

711
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:06,249
It's a new creation of mine.

712
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,250
- How is it? - Really?

713
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
It's delicious.

714
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:10,949
Honey.

715
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,690
Dad. Mom's such an embarrassment.

716
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,790
Look at what she did to us.

717
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,588
You should be grateful...

718
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:21,029
she let it off with this.

719
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:23,298
You're always on her side.

720
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:25,028
It wasn't just any fight.

721
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,428
We fought for a reason.

722
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:28,568
Still, you shouldn't hit a friend.

723
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:30,899
I told you to call me if someone ran their mouth.

724
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,770
- Why would you get into a fight? - Right.

725
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:34,139
I could...

726
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:37,110
teach them a good lesson by crushing their bones.

727
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,179
I'll take down anyone who upsets my daughters.

728
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,419
This is why we handle things.

729
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,279
In case you get carried away and get in trouble.

730
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,549
That's much harder to take care of.

731
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,259
You should know that by now.

732
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,860
When do I get carried away?

733
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:55,790
You have no idea how rational and calm I am.

734
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,029
What?

735
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:03,069
What?

736
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,639
Why are you all making faces?

737
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:12,380
Oh, dear. Madam Go's anger gauge is going up.

738
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,079
- Shall we have a word? - No.

739
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,249
- Honey. Take a seat. - Let's talk.

740
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,019
No one's as rational as you.

741
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,919
Erica. Don't do it again. Now sit down and eat some dumplings.

742
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Okay.

743
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,230
Hey. The person with those flowers.

744
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:32,630
She was just here.

745
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,900
What?

746
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,339
(Cat Restaurant)

747
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:58,819
You promise...

748
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,560
to come back?

749
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,239
How pretty.

750
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:27,949
Mom.

751
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:32,989
Sorry for being late.

752
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:36,159
Did you wait a long time?

753
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,330
Are you hungry?

754
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,900
Flowers. They're flowers Han Na likes.

755
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:48,940
You forgot everything, but you still remember Han Na.

756
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,449
Because Han Na looks a lot like my daughter.

757
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,980
Look this way.

758
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,960
Wait a second, Mom.

759
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:15,130
Ta-da.

760
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:21,969
It's a gift for you.

761
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,560
Mom! Be careful!

762
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,639
Mom!

763
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,908
Here's a list of children who will be sponsored...

764
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:05,409
by the Bang Chil Sung Scholarship Foundation.

765
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,119
How about this?

766
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,758
Why don't we support more kids?

767
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:19,759
Would it be too hard?

768
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,389
The board will likely oppose it,

769
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:25,199
but Sungchan Group grew because of this.

770
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,369
- There won't be any problem. - Thanks.

771
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,239
Also...

772
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,509
I'm planning...

773
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,509
to quit the company.

774
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,779
I stayed longer than I thought.

775
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,920
The company is stable now.

776
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,489
I have you and my aunt. I think it'll be just fine.

777
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,719
Have you made up your mind?

778
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,129
I already packed my stuff.

779
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,960
I don't need any shares or anything.

780
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,029
I'll go back to being a natural man again.

781
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,769
It's arrogant of you...

782
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,069
to decide on your own. This is more of a notice.

783
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:06,809
You deserve a beating.

784
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,338
I'm still the CEO.

785
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,239
- Also, I'm a CEO who fights well. - Come on.

786
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,948
- Hey. You're going to fall. - Watch out.

787
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:15,509
Hey... Gosh!

788
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:19,790
What is this?

789
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,460
- He's mine! - What?

790
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Look at this.

791
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:26,588
("No Way! Latest Han Mone Sighting!")

792
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:30,029
Did you know? Han Mone showed up.

793
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,400
She showed up at a hospital with her mom.

794
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:34,829
How long has it been?

795
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:37,670
No one knew her whereabouts for five years after her release.

796
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:40,139
Some people took pictures of her and posted them.

797
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:42,809
But look at all the comments.

798
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,178
So many people are cursing her.

799
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,210
Where is this place?

800
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,279
Where was it again?

801
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,449
A hospital in Sampyeong somewhere.

802
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,250
I heard it was a remote place somewhere in Gangwon-do.

803
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420
Sampyeong...

804
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:58,889
Yoon Ji Sook's guardian?

805
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,690
Yes?

806
00:51:03,299 --> 00:51:05,500
- Thank you. - It's Han Mone, right?

807
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:08,170
She must really live in this area.

808
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,969
How can she live with her chin up...

809
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,769
after killing her friend?

810
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,610
Right, she even killed her husband.

811
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:16,779
She's shameless. That's why she's still alive.

812
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:20,480
We should kick her out of our neighbourhood.

813
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,880
We can't live in the same area as a murderer.

814
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,448
It'll cause a ruckus in town once people find out.

815
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,489
You're right.

816
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,259
What? What is it?

817
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:32,159
Did I say something wrong?

818
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,830
It's true you're a murderer.

819
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,469
You're right.

820
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,369
I'm so sorry.

821
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:44,900
However,

822
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:48,069
my mom really loves this town.

823
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:51,409
Please don't kick us out.

824
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:53,980
I beg you.

825
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,420
Forget it.

826
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,489
Mom.

827
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,130
Are you happy?

828
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:44,860
I'm happy.

829
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,369
I'm happy.

830
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,770
You used to tell me...

831
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,139
that you lived because of me.

832
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,810
Now it's the other way around.

833
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,279
You're the only reason...

834
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,279
I stay alive.

835
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:11,819
You're not cold, are you?

836
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,159
We'll go find some mugwort tomorrow.

837
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,670
I'll make you soybean paste soup with your favourite mugwort.

838
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:25,069
Mone?

839
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:32,810
Mom...

840
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:35,610
Do you recognize me?

841
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,949
How could a mom forget her daughter's face?

842
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,259
Things must be tough for you.

843
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,429
Not at all. I'm so happy.

844
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,100
I wonder why I didn't know...

845
00:53:56,869 --> 00:54:00,170
that living with you would make me the happiest.

846
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,909
We wake up together every day, eat together,

847
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,049
and sleep together.

848
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,179
I love it.

849
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:22,130
Kyung Soo will come to Korea soon.

850
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,960
He's doing so well at work.

851
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,270
He sends me a monthly allowance to buy you delicious stuff.

852
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:32,299
He has matured, hasn't he?

853
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:44,020
This is enough.

854
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,350
I'm happy.

855
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,630
This is enough.

856
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,060
I'm happy.

857
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:54,909
Mom...

858
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,369
Keep in touch, okay?

859
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,980
You can come back whenever you want.

860
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:25,540
That won't happen.

861
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,509
Don't disappoint your aunt.

862
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:33,819
(Sungchan Group)

863
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,658
No! I can't let you go! I won't!

864
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,759
I can't live without you.

865
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,560
I'm your only aunt.

866
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,000
Do you want me to die old and alone?

867
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,569
Aunt.

868
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:56,040
I promise to visit often to see you.

869
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,110
You have to keep your promise.

870
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:01,949
If you don't,

871
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,150
I'll cry every day!

872
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,449
Enough.

873
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:29,210
All I have is you, Ki Tak.

874
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:38,480
Did Phillip and Erica go out to play again?

875
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:42,290
Gosh. I wonder if they'd ever get into university.

876
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:45,690
They're taking turns getting the worst grades in school.

877
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,659
Did you pack a lot of delicious food?

878
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,589
The kids will love it.

879
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,000
Take me with you to the orphanage next time.

880
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Sure.

881
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,799
We're going.

882
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:58,440
Come on. I'm old enough to get my ID. Go on.

883
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,169
- See you later. - Bye.

884
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,310
We'll be back.

885
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:03,270
- Bye. - Bye.

886
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,750
This is Cat Restaurant.

887
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:14,850
Hello?

888
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:18,020
What would you like? Please tell me.

889
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,699
It's me.

890
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,339
I know.

891
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,369
Are you well?

892
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:36,839
Yes.

893
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,110
Your grandmother...

894
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,610
passed away.

895
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,619
I thought I should let you know.

896
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:50,219
Grandma?

897
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,130
Grandma...

898
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,860
She died peacefully in her sleep.

899
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,170
Before her passing,

900
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,869
she had forgotten everything...

901
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,540
except for you.

902
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,880
She never forgot her memories with you.

903
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:17,719
What about you?

904
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,250
Are you okay?

905
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,020
You're alone...

906
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:26,719
I'm okay.

907
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:30,699
I think I can let go of everything now.

908
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:33,529
What do you mean?

909
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,270
Let go of what?

910
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,100
Hello?

911
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,569
Hello?

912
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,509
Hello, are you there?

913
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:45,009
Hello?

914
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,290
Han Na,

915
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:00,889
I was about to pay you a visit.

916
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,629
I'm on my way to Mone.

917
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,630
Mister,

918
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:07,529
Ms. Han Mone just called me.

919
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:12,699
She told me that Grandma died.

920
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,040
But...

921
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,940
her voice sounded strange.

922
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:21,279
She sounded like she called to say goodbye.

923
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,449
She told me she could let go of everything now.

924
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:27,819
I'm so nervous and worried.

925
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:30,719
I better go to Sampyeong.

926
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,389
I shouldn't let her stay alone.

927
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:37,658
I'll be there soon, so please wait.

928
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:38,699
I'll be right there.

929
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:53,110
(Sampyeong-ri Payphone)

930
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,029
I can't find her.

931
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,759
All belongings look organized.

932
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,060
Han Na.

933
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,869
Let's split up to find her. Do you think you can do that?

934
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:16,429
I'll go this way.

935
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,940
Okay.

936
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,540
Grandma.

937
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:32,849
Did I make you wait? Are you hungry?

938
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,448
Han Na wants zucchini jeon.

939
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:38,389
I thought so, so I got lots of zucchini and potatoes.

940
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,029
You're the best.

941
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,100
I got bored, so I drew a picture of you.

942
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:53,869
Ta-da.

943
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:58,210
Am I that pretty?

944
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:00,040
Of course.

945
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:04,350
After my mom, you're the prettiest.

946
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:15,960
Grandma.

947
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,230
Han Mone!

948
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,270
Han Mone!

949
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,540
Ms. Han!

950
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,509
Ms. Han!

951
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:42,020
Han Mone!

952
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,560
Ms. Han!

953
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:47,690
Ms. Han!

954
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Ms. Han!

955
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:11,319
Han Na?

956
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,670
I don't hate you.

957
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,139
I don't blame you.

958
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,310
So please...

959
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,980
So please, don't die.

960
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,199
Did you know how worried I was?

961
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:36,199
How could you hang up like that?

962
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,040
I called out for you so much.

963
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,270
I searched everywhere for you.

964
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,480
Why didn't you answer me?

965
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,210
I'm sorry.

966
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,089
I was looking for some flowers for Grandma's grave.

967
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:00,790
Did you come because you were worried about me?

968
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,259
Of course.

969
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:05,860
You...

970
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,699
You're my mom.

971
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:15,909
I missed you.

972
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,080
I missed you so much.

973
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:47,739
I missed you,

974
01:06:50,779 --> 01:06:51,980
Mom.

975
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,868
(Thanks to Lee Jae Yong and Park Jin Hee...)

976
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:56,009
(for their special appearance.)

(The Escape of the Seven: Resurrection)

978
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:02,469
Okay.

979
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,669
- Cut. - Good work.

980
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,079
Here you go.

981
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:29,329
Look at each other.

982
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,270
- Kiss. - Kiss.

983
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,649
(Thank you for supporting and watching...)

985
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,748
Bye!

986
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:46,450
- Bye! - Good work!
