1
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,582
Master Jan...

2
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,457
Master Jan!

3
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,666
Ken!

4
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,916
When did you get here?

5
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,749
You were asleep,
I didn't want to wake you.

6
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,957
I wasn't sleeping,

7
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,082
I was just thinking.

8
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,749
What's on your mind?

9
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:45,207
Old men like us can only think
about one thing...

10
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,124
The past.

11
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:56,166
Jan Dara is still Jan Dara.

12
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,041
Ken is still Ken.

13
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,582
We've just got so old.

14
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,791
Yes.

15
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,124
We're very old.

16
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,124
But my heart... my heart refuses to age.

17
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,999
I still remember the love of my life,
Hyacinth.

18
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,916
I still remember Madame Boonleung,
always so graceful.

19
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,791
I still remember that perverse woman,
Miss Kaew.

20
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,291
I even remember someone
we both knew very well.

21
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,582
Would you like an inhalant?

22
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,916
No.

23
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,916
I still remember Saisoi,
Kaew's maidservant

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,166
and your first woman.

25
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,541
She Was your first too.

26
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,582
Right,
we shared the same property back then.

27
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,041
Ken, the inhalant please!

28
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,625
Do you remember the exact date
when we left Bangkok

29
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:09,874
for my grandmother's house in Phijit?

30
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:16,582
It was ages ago!
Who would remember that?

31
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:21,082
I do. I'll never forget it.

32
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:28,499
It was December 10, 1932.

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,082
The day
the king granted the constitution.

34
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,749
Master Jan,
Madame is waiting for you in the house.

35
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,291
All right.

36
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,916
My dearest Jan...

37
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:55,291
My precious!

38
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:02,291
Are you Ken, son of Poom?

39
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,374
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,416
I know everything.

41
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,082
Wad sent a telegraph this morning

42
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,832
to tell me the whole story.

43
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,749
My dearest Jan...

44
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,416
Forgive me for putting you

45
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,791
through all the misfortunes.

46
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,416
It's all because I chose a wrong man

47
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,916
to be your mother's husband.

48
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,749
Wisnan was working at the Palace Office.

49
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,624
He was also an accomplished court actor.

50
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,291
Even I was fooled by his theatrics.

51
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,666
It never occurred to me that

52
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:01,332
he would put on a realistic performance
in life as he did on stage.

53
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,791
So I made him marry Dara, your mother.

54
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,749
I thought I could lead him by the nose.

55
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,874
Lord Wisnan, please forgive me.

56
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,582
I'm four-months pregnant.

57
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:33,624
What you did was a horrible insult
to my family! Revolting!

58
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,082
Please, My lord!
I'd give you the moon and the stars,

59
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,166
I'll give you anything!

60
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:48,749
Just promise me that the scandal
will never leave this house.

61
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,499
All right.

62
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,916
State your wish.

63
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:59,332
I want the ownership of everything,
the house, the land,

64
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:04,332
and all the businesses in Bangkok
belonging to your family.

65
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,791
That horrendous louse!

66
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:14,624
What about my father, Jom?

67
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:21,166
Where is he now?
What's happened to him?

68
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,916
Don't suffer yourself

69
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,582
with things of no great concern.

70
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,041
What's gone is gone.

71
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,916
Now you're here, my precious...

72
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,666
so rest your body and mind.

73
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,541
In the meantime, you and me...

74
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:50,041
can plot sweet revenge against that

75
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,457
scum you once called Father.

76
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:02,749
How about that, my precious?

77
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:26,416
Dear Hyacinth,
Ken and I have arrived safely in Phijit.

78
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,166
We're staying with my grandmother,

79
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,749
the only elder in the family

80
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,416
who has always showed her kindness
towards me

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,707
since the day I was born.

82
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:44,749
You must be wondering
why I had to leave home

83
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,166
and come to Phijit in such haste.

84
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,749
But if I had remained in Bangkok,

85
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,916
I might've already been shot dead
like a rabid dog

86
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,707
by the man whom
I always thought was my father.

87
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,499
My life here is incredibly different
from my days in Bangkok.

88
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:08,916
The air is fresh,

89
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,249
the sky is clear,

90
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,416
and everything seems so serene.

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,457
For the first time in my life,
I feel completely free.

92
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,291
I'm only concerned
about my virile friend, Ken.

93
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,624
Because all the servants here
are wrinkled old ladies.

94
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,249
Don't worry about me,

95
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,457
I feel completely at peace here.

96
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,332
Missing you always, Jan Dara.

97
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,291
Master Jan,
I can't stand it any longer.

98
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,082
Why? Work's too hard?

99
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,749
Hard work my foot!

100
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,832
Every day I make jasmine garlands,
carry water

101
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,916
and cook with a bunch of old women!

102
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,916
Master Jan,
I feel like my heart is withering.

103
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:06,124
Like a tree dying for a drop
of magic water.

104
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,082
What shall we do then?
This isn't like Bangkok.

105
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:15,082
If we get naughty here,
Grandma will skin us alive.

106
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,249
Aren't you afraid of her?

107
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,957
I do! I'm shitting my pants!

108
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,416
Your Grandma
is scarier than Lord Wisnan.

109
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,291
But look,
I heard the servant boys talk about

110
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:32,957
a certain establishment
with red and green lanterns.

111
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,082
Don't you feel itchy?

112
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,499
No.

113
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,457
But I do!

114
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,624
So I'd like to ask you
to sponsor my trip

115
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,291
to the house of pleasure, just for once.

116
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,499
I'd be eternally grateful.

117
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,666
I have to let some steam off.

118
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,166
My wrist is about to fall off!

119
00:10:58,417 --> 00:10:59,791
Take the whole purse.

120
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,707
Good evening sir!

121
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,749
I'm so sorry
but all the girls have been taken tonight.

122
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,082
Except "Sister Patum",
not exactly young

123
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,832
but her performance is legendary.

124
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,416
Is that all talk?

125
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,124
No sir! Patum never
lets her clients down, literally.

126
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,166
Or you can wait for the young lasses,
but it'll be an hour.

127
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,249
Patum it is then!

128
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,082
Are you from Bangkok?

129
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,541
Yes.

130
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,999
Doing business?

131
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,582
No, just staying.

132
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,124
Where do you stay?

133
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:13,332
Phijitvanich House at the edge of town.
Ever heard of it?

134
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,207
Of course I do.

135
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,416
I was a servant girl there.

136
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,249
So you know the story of Dara,

137
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,624
the lady who was raped.

138
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,416
Miss Dara wasn't raped.

139
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,457
It was the servant girl
who went with her

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,291
who was raped.

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,624
What're you talking about?

142
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,082
Seventeen years ago
when Madame traveled with Miss Dara

143
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:57,957
through the forest to visit her relatives
at a remote village,

144
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,749
Jom and two other men

145
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,541
ambushed them and kidnapped Dara

146
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:09,249
and her 17-year-old servant girl
into their forest hideout.

147
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,457
There...

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,707
The girl was brutally raped
by Jom's men

149
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:32,499
while Jom himself was in the hut

150
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,332
cooing with Dara like lovebirds.

151
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,249
That servant girl was me.

152
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:45,166
I was so scared back then.

153
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,916
When those two fell asleep,

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,041
I ran away to the police.

155
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,707
What happened to that man, Jom?

156
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,832
I don't know.

157
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,249
I have never seen him again
since that day.

158
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:08,749
But he didn't rape Dara,
I'm sure about that.

159
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,207
Why do you want to know all of this?

160
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,207
I never thought that
Ken's trip to the bawdy house

161
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,624
would benefit me
with such a valuable tip-off.

162
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:27,707
"Sister Patum",
who was once my mother's servant,

163
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,832
pointed Ken to the Wiangchai House

164
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,957
where my father, Jom, once lived.

165
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:38,166
Most importantly, I learned that...

166
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,416
I wasn't a child born
from a hideous circumstance

167
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,207
as Lord Wisnan
had vengefully accused me of.

168
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:49,499
They've moved to the Northeast!
How can we find them?

169
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,707
Master Jan. Sister Patum also told me
about a police officer...

170
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,499
Captain Ruang... something...

171
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,166
Yes! Captain Ruangyos.
He was in charge of the case back then.

172
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,707
I've gone through every case file
from 17 years ago.

173
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,749
There was no such case as you mentioned.

174
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,416
Nothing about the rape
and kidnapping of Miss Dara.

175
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,957
And there wasn't any report

176
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,163
about a shoot-out
between the police and the bandits.

177
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,499
What about Captain Ruangyos?

178
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,499
Captain Ruangyos...
left the force 17 years ago.

179
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:38,624
That means
I'll never meet him again in this life.

180
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,082
You do.

181
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,291
Captain Ruangyos is my uncle.

182
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,374
After he resigned,
he's spent his life in solitude,

183
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:12,166
living a farmer's life in deep woods

184
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,957
and barely visiting the town.

185
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,916
Only I visit him sometimes.

186
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,624
I can take you to see him

187
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,791
but I'm not sure if he'll talk to you.

188
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,749
He's Jan Dara,

189
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,707
Lady Phijitraksa's grandson.

190
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,416
He'd like to pay you respects.

191
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,874
Please go back.
I have nothing to tell you.

192
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,707
Wait sir.

193
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,082
Please have mercy on me.

194
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,291
In my whole life
I've never seen my father and mother.

195
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,082
I only wish to know who my father is.

196
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,957
And if he's doing fine.

197
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,624
If he's still alive,

198
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,582
I wish I could bow at his feet
at least once.

199
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,148
Only then my soul would be at peace.

200
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,124
You've come to the right place.

201
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,499
I knew your mother...

202
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,416
...and Jom very well.

203
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:29,624
Actually I'd known Jom since we were
in a boarding school in Bangkok.

204
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:35,624
I was his senior.
When his family in Phijit went bankrupt

205
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,999
he quit school and came back here.
When I was transferred to Phijit,

206
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,749
I visited him for old time's sake.

207
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,374
Jom had changed a lot.

208
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:54,166
He'd become a playboy.
Boozing, gambling, whoring...

209
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,791
But he never hurt anyone.

210
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:02,582
One day I was invited to
Miss Dara's homecoming ceremony

211
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,749
when she arrived here from Bangkok.

212
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,249
I admit that

213
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,416
I fell hopelessly in love
with your mother at that instant.

214
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,999
She was an image of perfection.

215
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,707
Her fine, elegant manner...

216
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:25,041
Her angelic face...

217
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,749
That's why...

218
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,124
when Patum reported to me

219
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,666
that Dara was kidnapped
into the forest by Jom and his friends,

220
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,374
I felt as if I were struck by lightning.

221
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,957
How could that be possible?

222
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,041
When Patum led me and your grandmother
to the forest hideout

223
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,207
I found Jom's two lackeys

224
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,791
and arrested them without any hassle.

225
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:07,124
Then we found Miss Dara,
wretched and frail.

226
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,416
But Jom was nowhere to be found.

227
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,207
I conducted an investigation

228
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:16,582
to find any clues that might lead to Jom.

229
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:21,791
The two men confessed that
they raped Patum,

230
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:26,124
while Jom and Miss Dara were talking
by the river.

231
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,582
I want you to know now that

232
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,499
I never want to hurt you.

233
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,832
We're merely paying for the sin
committed by our parents.

234
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,124
I'm the son...

235
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,207
and my duty is to restore dignity

236
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,624
and wealth taken from my family
by yours.

237
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,416
Are you going to kill me?

238
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,499
You have to bear my child.

239
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,124
I hope you'd understand.

240
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,041
If bearing your child...

241
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,416
is a way to pay for the sin my family

242
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,041
committed against yours...

243
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,332
it's my duty too,

244
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,582
to accept the karma forged
by my ancestors.

245
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,749
I beg your forgiveness.

246
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:22,916
But later that night,
after Patum ran away,

247
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,916
things took a turn for the worst.

248
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,957
After the two men raped Miss Dara,

249
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,041
they dumped Jom's body into the river.

250
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,541
Kill them now.

251
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,041
Ma'am, by law we have to

252
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,332
put them on trial.

253
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,291
The law isn't the only means
to ensure justice,

254
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:49,999
don't you agree?

255
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:07,541
You're not my child!
You're a bastard!

256
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,832
Your mother was raped!

257
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,624
Why did I have to take you as my son!?

258
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,707
Master Jan! Master Jan!

259
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:42,999
What're you doing?!

260
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,749
Get away from me!

261
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,249
Master Jan, no!

262
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,791
I beg you!

263
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:54,207
I was born a bastard!
Why should I go on living?

264
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,791
If that's what you think...

265
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,916
Kill me! Shoot me, now!

266
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,749
Shoot me now! Just shoot me dead now!

267
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,207
Do it!

268
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,749
Scum!

269
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,249
Bastard!

270
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,957
Scum!

271
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,499
Bastard!

272
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,249
Master Jan! Promise me you'll never
do something like that again.

273
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,541
Promise me!

274
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:05,416
Everything I've done...

275
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,374
I never once did it for my own good
and happiness.

276
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:16,499
I've done everything

277
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,749
to protect the land

278
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,082
our grandparents

279
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,332
had earned through their sweat.

280
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,791
They did everything

281
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:34,082
to ensure that their children

282
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,124
would live

283
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:43,416
a harmonious

284
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:47,374
and peaceful life.

285
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,416
And the gratitude
we have towards our family...

286
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,582
is the quality that sets human apart
from beast.

287
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,624
Jan,

288
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,291
you have to always remember...

289
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,749
that you're the last

290
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:09,666
remaining offspring of our clan.

291
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,957
Your great responsibility is

292
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,249
to maintain our Phijitvanich bloodline

293
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,749
until eternity.

294
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,499
Do you or do you not get it?

295
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:32,249
My precious.

296
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,916
I do, grandma.

297
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,416
Dear Jan, I'm filled with joy

298
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,249
upon hearing that the agony caused
by the search for your real father

299
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,874
has finally been relieved.

300
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:02,416
I hope you're beginning to enjoy
working in the Phijitvanich's factory.

301
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:07,416
That's a good way
to put the misery behind you.

302
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,874
And your new life will become
even more complete

303
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:17,374
if you observe dharma and austerities

304
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,624
every Saturday and Sunday.

305
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,791
Me, I'm doing just fine.

306
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,541
I'm eagerly looking forward
to meeting my new Jan in Bangkok soon.

307
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,832
Miss you always, Hyacinth.

308
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:23,541
I never thought that
a ruthless womanizer like you

309
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,624
would find love in a temple,
of all places.

310
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,957
And I never thought that

311
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,082
there'd be any woman
in this whole world

312
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,749
who could inspire me

313
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,416
to think of her only in a good way.

314
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:48,874
Ken, this is what they call true love.

315
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:50,957
That's what I feel towards Hyacinth.

316
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,398
That's what I feel towards Hyacinth.

317
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:56,499
Master Jan, come look at my baby!

318
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:03,582
Say hello to my master.

319
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:16,249
May the boy have only happiness
in his life.

320
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,624
Don't grow up to be a womanizer
like your dad.

321
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,916
That was the past!

322
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:27,041
Don't listen to him.
I've stopped that!

323
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:37,124
The baby hasn't had a name,
can you think of one for him?

324
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,291
What should I call you?

325
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,749
Well...

326
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:58,416
Let's call you Dao, meaning star,

327
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,666
so you'll shine a light
into people's hearts.

328
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:09,249
As Ken's life thrived like a tree
on fertile soil,

329
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,624
As Ken's life thrived like a tree
on fertile soil,

330
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,332
my grandmother's health withered away.

331
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,332
My grandmother's health withered away.

332
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:21,582
Make sure she takes the medicine
as I prescribe.

333
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,082
Thank you, doctor.

334
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,749
Around that time

335
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,041
Aunt Wad and Ken's mother

336
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,249
Jan...

337
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:38,082
arrived at our Phijit house
out of the blue.

338
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,416
Ken...

339
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,332
Mom...

340
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,666
Aunt Wad...

341
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,582
This is your grandson,

342
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,582
and this is Malai, my wife.

343
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,666
My grandson!

344
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:11,041
Let me guess that something
must've gone terribly wrong...

345
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:15,791
at our Bangkok house.

346
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:24,041
That's why
you two suddenly showed up here.

347
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,499
Am I right?

348
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,666
You are, ma'am.

349
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:36,791
So what's happened?

350
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,416
Kaew is pregnant.

351
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:53,874
Kaew... Who's the father?

352
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,374
After Jan and Ken fled here

353
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:11,791
Kaew kept up her promiscuous lifestyle.

354
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,957
Her appetite grew ever more insatiable,

355
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,124
especially when Lord Wisnan
and Madame Boonleung were away.

356
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,123
She ordered room service
from young male servants.

357
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:24,415
Or she'd arrange an orgy
at the small house almost every night.

358
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:50,207
Last year,
Lord Wisnan and Madame Boonleung

359
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,957
went on a business trip to Singapore
and Europe,

360
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,998
leaving Kaew at home.

361
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,373
At first
she was supposed to travel with them.

362
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:07,040
But she changed her mind just days

363
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:09,373
before the planned departure.

364
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:41,832
Kajorn, come have some wine with me.

365
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:47,540
I'm so lonely...
Dad and Boonleung have left without me.

366
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:51,207
Let me put on some clothes first.

367
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:56,623
That won't be necessary.

368
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:01,165
Why not?

369
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,623
You never know

370
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:09,040
you are my love at first sight.

371
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,873
And you never know too

372
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,290
you are also my love at first sight.

373
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,248
After that day...

374
00:41:27,374 --> 00:41:31,248
They spent time together
whenever they had a chance.

375
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:37,873
They didn't care
if people were watching.

376
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,832
They didn't even listen to my warning.

377
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,457
The day before yesterday,
nightmares awaited

378
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:28,915
Lord Wisnan and Madame Boonleung
as they returned home.

379
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,040
Sir, Kaew and Kajorn are waiting
for you in the hall.

380
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:52,249
We beg you to please forgive us

381
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,415
for our misconduct
and disregard of tradition.

382
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,249
We've been to bed
before we get married.

383
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,624
But our unseemly behavior

384
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,832
wasn't an act of rash desire.

385
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,707
It's an act of love
we feel for each other.

386
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,665
And now...

387
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,624
Miss Kaew is three-month pregnant.

388
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,290
What are we waiting for then?

389
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,415
Wad! Prepare the biggest wedding

390
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,290
Bangkok has ever seen, get to it now!

391
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,832
Boonleung! Send out the invitation
to guests in Singapore,

392
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,374
Penang and Phuket.
Finally, we're becoming a real family!

393
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,957
Aren't you happy?

394
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,540
The two of them...

395
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,915
can't be married.

396
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,082
Why's that?

397
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,624
We truly love each other.

398
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,749
What made you say that?

399
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,082
Kajorn...

400
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,707
is your son.

401
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,082
They're

402
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:19,582
brother and sister.

403
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,915
I was pregnant

404
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,082
before I married my husband.

405
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:37,457
How come you never told me?

406
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,499
I meant to tell you...

407
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:53,249
on the day Kajorn graduates from the
cadet school and becomes an officer.

408
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,249
I'll be damned...

409
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,082
Why are you so cruel?

410
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:16,124
If I had known... I would never...

411
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,082
Son, I'm sorry!

412
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,665
Don't say anything!

413
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,040
I don't want to hear another word
from you!

414
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,249
I've been living in the same house

415
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,749
as my father for three years!

416
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,374
And you never told me the truth!

417
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,415
What were you trying to do?

418
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,457
What were you trying to do?

419
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,261
Please forgive me!

420
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,790
How could I?

421
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:41,290
Because of you,
I've taken my sister as my wife!

422
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,540
How can I face the world now?

423
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:07,540
Kaew...

424
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,874
Always remember that I love you.

425
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,874
I'll always do.

426
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,082
Kajorn!

427
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:38,582
Kajorn!

428
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:39,332
Kajorn!

429
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,707
Don't leave me!

430
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,374
Kajorn!

431
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,665
Don't leave me here!

432
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,082
Kajorn!

433
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:58,665
My lord, my lord!

434
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:08,290
Come now, sweet revenge!

435
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:15,415
Karma has finally caught up with him.

436
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,207
My precious,

437
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,165
come sit right here.

438
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,999
Yes, Grandma.

439
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,540
Your virtue and dharma practice...

440
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:54,582
have finally brought our family
a great merit!

441
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:59,624
That monster must be desperate to

442
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:05,082
find a man to be Kaew's husband.

443
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,499
Am I right, Wad?

444
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,499
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,249
And who else would be able to

446
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,082
clean up the filth in that house...

447
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:27,540
except my precious Jan.

448
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:31,124
Am I right, Wad?

449
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,915
That's the only way. Actually,

450
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,371
Lord Wisnan has admitted that
he had no other choice.

451
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,415
My precious Jan...

452
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,790
It's time for you to return to Bangkok.

453
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:52,915
You'll reclaim everything

454
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,165
that the evil man
deceitfully took from us.

455
00:49:57,166 --> 00:50:00,249
Return everything to
our Phijitvanich clan!

456
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,749
Take revenge
and restore dignity to my name...

457
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:10,665
To your mother's...

458
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,540
To Aunt Wad's...

459
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:17,040
And to the Phijitvanich's blood in you.

460
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,582
You must promise me.

461
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,040
Now!

462
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,665
I promise... Grandma...

463
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:56,624
Ma'am!

464
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,290
Grandma!

465
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,665
Ma'am!

466
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:05,415
Ma'am!

467
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,040
Ma'am!

468
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,749
I'll go get the doctor.

469
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,124
Ma'am!

470
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:33,290
I've told you not to let
this little shit into the main house!

471
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:40,332
That scum killed his mother.
Go on, call him "scum".

472
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,915
Scum!

473
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:50,374
You little fuck, you and I are over!

474
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:57,207
All right, you and I are over.

475
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:59,415
It was March 7, 1935.

476
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:06,082
The day King Rama VII abdicated.

477
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:11,499
After the 50 days mourning period
following my grandmother's funeral,

478
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:14,540
we returned to Bangkok

479
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:18,374
to finalize the wedding agreement

480
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,832
between Kaew and myself.

481
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:26,415
But Ken's mother decided to remain
in Phijit permanently.

482
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:55,707
I'm really glad to see
all of you again.

483
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:28,207
Here's Mr. Marut, our lawyer.

484
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,582
Pleased to meet you, sir.

485
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:37,165
This way please, Jan.

486
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,665
Take your seat.

487
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,832
Jan, sit.

488
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:13,957
From now on,

489
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:16,915
you're the only master of the house.

490
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,749
Good afternoon, Madame Boonleung.

491
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,124
I believe that you has already
gone through our proposition

492
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,665
we've sent already.

493
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,957
He has.

494
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:37,249
I'd like all of you to know that

495
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,915
Lord Wisnan has asked me
to represent him in this negotiation.

496
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:46,290
He still hasn't recovered

497
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,832
from the trauma

498
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,582
of the recent events.

499
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,915
So why is he here?

500
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:59,332
Lord Wisnan would like to be present.

501
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:01,665
Fine.

502
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:06,082
Now I want to officially confirm
our lists of demand again.

503
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:07,582
First,

504
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,415
all assets and business
interests in Bangkok

505
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:16,874
under the title of Lord Wisnandecha

506
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:22,582
will be transferred to me, Jan Dara.
I'll be the sole owner of everything.

507
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:26,707
He accepts.

508
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:29,749
Second,

509
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:33,957
the entire executive board of
Phijitvanich Company will have to resign.

510
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,832
Especially the managing director...

511
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:40,915
Mr. Ken Kratingthong
will take up the position

512
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,582
right after this negotiation.

513
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,915
He accepts.

514
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:53,665
Third, from now
on the Phijitvanich Company in Singapore

515
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,999
will report directly

516
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:59,582
to the headquarters in Bangkok.

517
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,582
Lord Wisnan...

518
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:07,540
refuses this proposition, Mr. Jan dara.

519
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:12,415
Why?

520
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,624
He has a personal reason, Mr. Jan dara.

521
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,957
What's that personal reason?

522
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:27,249
Mr. Jan,
we've agreed to all your demands.

523
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:31,624
We just ask for this one exception
about Singapore.

524
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:36,582
I'm asking you,
what is that personal reason?

525
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,832
Shit! I only ask to
keep the Singaporean branch

526
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:47,499
because Boonleung and I
have built an international network!

527
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:52,249
An idiot like you would ruin everything!

528
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,957
In that case...
I hereby promote Madame Boonleung

529
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,165
from consultant

530
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,915
to managing director
of our Singaporean branch.

531
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,790
She'll report directly to me.

532
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:19,457
I hope you'd understand.

533
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,915
But remember this...

534
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:35,624
I, Jan Dara...
I'm the sole owner of this house.

535
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:42,207
You're just an inhabitant, you're
no different from any other servants.

536
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,999
Bear in mind that

537
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,082
I can kick you out of here
whenever I want.

538
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,790
It's entirely up to me.

539
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,624
But since we're no strangers,

540
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:03,790
you're Aunt Wad's husband.

541
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,457
I'll have mercy on you.

542
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:10,624
Aunt Wad, tell the servants

543
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:14,749
move The Lord belongings
from his room to the tower.

544
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,999
As my prisoner...

545
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:24,249
he'll spend the rest of his life
in confinement over there.

546
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:30,290
Meanwhile,
the small house that used to be my jail

547
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:35,624
will from now on belong to
Mr. Ken Kratingthong.

548
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,749
And naturally...

549
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:46,540
The Lord's room will become mine.

550
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,874
And now my last demand...
You have to call me "sir".

551
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:08,165
Try it.

552
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:19,415
You won't? That's all right.

553
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:21,624
Ken!

554
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:24,374
Sir.

555
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,040
We're going back to Phijit.

556
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,832
Have someone book the train for tonight.

557
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:30,915
Yes, sir.

558
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:36,499
Wait, sir!

559
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:43,540
What's the matter?

560
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:55,874
I accept everything, sir.

561
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:05,249
Very good! You've made the right move!

562
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,832
Have you put everything down?

563
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,790
Yes, sir.

564
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:17,082
Very well, the meeting is over.

565
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,415
"Wisnand House"

566
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:12,540
"Phijitvanich House"

567
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:49,499
Sir, is Hyacinth back?

568
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:23,582
"I return this handkerchief
you once gave me".

569
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,957
"Please keep it"

570
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:29,582
"as a memento of our friendship".

571
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:33,082
"Love, Hyacinth".

572
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,874
By the mercy of God, she's left us.

573
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,749
She passed away this morning
from typhoid.

574
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:30,874
Jan.

575
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:35,707
Go take a bath.

576
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:39,665
The dinner will be serve in your room.

577
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,749
Yes, Aunt Wad.

578
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,749
I'm surprised that all of a sudden

579
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:06,249
you've made me managing director
of our Singaporean branch.

580
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:09,832
May I ask you why?

581
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:14,457
Because you're
the most qualified person.

582
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,540
What if I refused?

583
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,749
Then I'd give up
the Singaporean outfit.

584
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:27,999
Just our companies in Bangkok and Phijit

585
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:31,457
are more than enough to provide for us
into the next generations.

586
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,124
That's what it is.

587
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,415
You've changed a lot.

588
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,999
It scares me.

589
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:44,582
As long as the world is spinning

590
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:49,582
nothing ever stays still.

591
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:57,874
I'll go get some rest.

592
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:00,582
See you tomorrow.

593
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:43,915
It has come out!

594
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,415
The baby's been born!

595
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,082
We have a young master.

596
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:05,957
The baby's been born!

597
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,915
We have a young master, sir.

598
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,582
You scum!

599
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,832
Come on.

600
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,957
Dinner is ready, sir.

601
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:24,165
I'm not hungry, now I want a bath.

602
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:38,582
On the day of that absurd wedding,

603
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:42,332
I felt like a lunatic
returning to the madhouse.

604
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:46,415
Like being on stage,

605
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,310
I was convinced and unconvinced of
everything that was happening.

606
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:53,415
The finest actress of that

607
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,374
play was certainly my bride.

608
01:12:56,583 --> 01:13:01,832
Her performance as a virgin ingenue

609
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:10,582
was so persuasive
despite her lack of rehearsal.

610
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:56,499
Scum, you'll never get to touch
as much as my foot.

611
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,374
Shut your filthy mouth.

612
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:05,249
I don't want to smack my wife
on the wedding night.

613
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,082
Son of a bitch,

614
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,124
I'm not scared!

615
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:18,874
Call me "sir".

616
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,249
Scum!

617
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,457
Scum!

618
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:27,915
- "Sir"!
- Scum!

619
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:30,749
- Scum!
- "Sir"!

620
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,624
That's enough,

621
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:36,582
today's a good day.
Miss Wad would feel bad seeing this.

622
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,790
It's not enough!
I want to slap this bitch to her sense!

623
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:43,165
Call me "Sir"!

624
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,582
Scum!

625
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:30,415
I'm sorry.

626
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:36,249
It's all right.

627
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:40,707
This isn't why we're still together.

628
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,082
Yes.

629
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:48,790
Please don't leave me.

630
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:53,999
I'll never leave you.

631
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,832
Promise me.

632
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:03,957
Yes.

633
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,540
I promise.

634
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,624
It's sweltering tonight!

635
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:45,499
Would you rub some ice on my back?

636
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:52,249
Insolent! How insolent!

637
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:57,290
Insolent?
Who was it that taught me to be insolent?

638
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,082
Please leave my room now, Mr. Jan dara.

639
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:12,749
Should I remind you again
whose house is this?

640
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:17,749
You may bully everyone else in this house.

641
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,626
But you have no right to boss me
around like that.

642
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,749
I'm not bossing you around.

643
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,207
I'm just asking for a favor.

644
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:30,207
Like you once asked me.

645
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:33,665
Now it's my turn.

646
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,665
It wouldn't be that hard
for you to return the favor.

647
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:40,915
Come, the ice is melting.

648
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,290
Let it melt.

649
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,540
I'll never let you

650
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,915
order me like one of your servants.

651
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,874
How unsympathetic!

652
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:59,249
Time can really change people.

653
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:07,082
Do you know... I can never forget
the scent of your bare back...

654
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:12,249
or the smoothness
and warmth of your soft breasts...

655
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:19,082
And I never forget
the taste of your lips.

656
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,957
Don't you feel the same?

657
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:26,290
Have you forgotten the touch of my hands

658
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,915
on your body?

659
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:33,915
Have you forgotten
my kisses on your back?

660
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,499
I forgot them all.

661
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:46,040
Liar! You're lying to yourself!

662
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,374
I know you want me.
Just like I want you.

663
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:55,915
We've wanted each other
from the first day we met!

664
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:08,415
How did you get this scar on your head?

665
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:15,040
The Lord beat me.

666
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,749
No one knows that

667
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:21,582
every punishment...

668
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:26,749
every painful blow I took...

669
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:30,040
I accepted it

670
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:34,457
as the punishment for the crime
that was born with me.

671
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:37,665
I deserve it,
my mother died because of me.

672
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:45,249
I already told you
your mother's death was an accident.

673
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:51,707
If I hadn't been born,
my mother would've been alive.

674
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:54,332
That's not how you should look at it.

675
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:56,915
Jan,

676
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,624
promise me...

677
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:03,415
no matter what happens,

678
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,332
You must not harm The Lord to death.

679
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:14,082
Yes, I promise.

680
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:44,582
Master Jan! Master Jan!

681
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:52,874
Are you dead?

682
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,040
I'm not.

683
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,749
I'm just resting.

684
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:05,915
Someone like you just can't
drop dead easily. Can you?

685
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:09,165
Of course.

686
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:15,749
I'm not going to die on you.

687
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,415
So while you're sleeping...

688
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,415
Resting!

689
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,207
While you're resting

690
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:32,665
let me continue the story for you.

691
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,040
Make it good.

692
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:36,582
Make it good.

693
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:39,999
Six or seven months after the wedding,

694
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,749
Six or seven months after the wedding,

695
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:43,499
the house

696
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:47,749
was so calm it was suffocating.

697
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,665
Take it to the factory.

698
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:57,915
Yes, sir.

699
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:04,415
The semblance of peace
was more like a cloak of uncertainty.

700
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:10,415
Take it to the office this afternoon.

701
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,374
Yes, sir.

702
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,082
Doctor!

703
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:19,332
Don't worry.

704
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,749
Let me take a look.

705
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:28,957
Take a deep breath,
everything will be fine.

706
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:30,915
I can't stand it anymore!

707
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:35,915
Get this preposterous thing out of me!

708
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,082
Who put this devil inside me?!

709
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:42,540
My dear wife,
squealing like a slaughtered pig!

710
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,540
And calling her baby "preposterous"!

711
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:50,749
Be careful how you speak!

712
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,124
You're about to become a father.

713
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:58,290
Didn't you hear how sweetly
the mother talked, huh?

714
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:02,915
It's not even my child,
I don't give a damn.

715
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,332
The baby's about to be born?

716
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,790
Yes, it is.

717
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:26,832
Finally!

718
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:35,082
It's a boy!

719
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,665
Please return to your quarters.

720
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,999
You're not allowed to be here.

721
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:56,332
Please let me take a look at my grandson.

722
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:00,415
No.

723
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,040
All right, sir.

724
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:27,665
Madame Boonleung, please.

725
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:56,874
The way you told it,
I looked like the bad guy!

726
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:01,749
What about when you told it?
I looked bad too!

727
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:09,207
No! But you've made me look really bad.

728
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:13,457
We'll get to the part
when you're the good guy soon!

729
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,082
I should smack you!

730
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:19,832
I'm scared, papa!

731
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:21,999
Good!

732
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:26,624
We're all good and bad.

733
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:31,749
What's the fun if we're like saints!

734
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,915
You should become a monk!

735
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:41,915
Will they let an old and dying man
become a monk?

736
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,915
I want to see you with a shaved head!

737
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,540
Crazy!

738
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,915
I never thought you would change
for the better

739
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:05,082
since the baby had been born.

740
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:09,540
You even set aside a small room

741
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,749
next to your office as the baby room.

742
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:15,790
Every time you were with the baby,

743
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:22,415
you became the old Jan that I once knew,

744
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:26,790
kind and sensitive.

745
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,332
Jan,
the boy still hasn't got a name.

746
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:36,707
Grandma and Grandpa
can't think of anything.

747
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:42,124
You were born with a curse
just like your father here.

748
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:46,957
No breast milk, just powder milk.

749
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:51,040
You have a father and mother,
but it's as if you didn't.

750
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,290
Your grandfather calls me Jan,

751
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:56,624
from Jan Rai, or scum.

752
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:59,415
Your mother called you "preposterous".

753
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:02,332
So I'll call you "Pree".

754
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:05,249
P-R-E-E

755
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:07,249
You're Pree Dara.

756
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:10,082
What a beautiful name.

757
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:14,040
That's quite witty.

758
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,749
Don't you like it?

759
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:21,749
He's my son.

760
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,790
We should have something in common.

761
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,749
You'll grow up to be a millionaire
like me!

762
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:34,707
Go get dressed.
We have to go to the office.

763
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:36,999
You go on.

764
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:39,415
Can't you see
I'm crazy about my child?

765
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:45,540
Of course I do, sir.

766
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:08,082
It was said
that happiness was transient.

767
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,874
And it was true.

768
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:12,999
Soon a tragedy struck the house

769
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,582
and broke everyone's heart.

770
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:21,082
The victim was Pree Dara.

771
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,415
The boy was slow in mental development.

772
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,249
At first we thought he was a mute.

773
01:29:28,916 --> 01:29:30,582
The boy has mental retardation

774
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,749
His body will grow,

775
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,582
but his brain will not.

776
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:43,957
Pree!

777
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,040
It's my fault.

778
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:17,540
Please forgive me.

779
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:28,374
No, it's my fault!

780
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:34,874
All of us have suffered enough...

781
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:38,249
Please forgive me.

782
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,082
Jan.

783
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:46,832
Leave us. I want to be with my son.

784
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:51,249
Please leave.

785
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:29,040
My son.

786
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,540
Don't worry.

787
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:34,457
I promise.

788
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,915
I'll never leave you,

789
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:39,999
as long as I'm alive.

790
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:19,582
How's that? Am I a good storyteller?

791
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:24,249
You almost made me cry.

792
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,332
It's very touching.

793
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,874
Hats off to you.

794
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:33,624
Should I continue?

795
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:35,957
No.

796
01:32:36,416 --> 01:32:37,790
Why not?

797
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:42,749
Because Jan Dara is the leading man
in this story

798
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:46,082
Not Ken Krathingthong.

799
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,582
Then I'll go home now.

800
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:51,749
Don't go.

801
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:55,499
All right...

802
01:32:56,791 --> 01:32:59,290
You can be the second leading man.

803
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,665
I'm kidding.

804
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:09,957
I'm happy being an assistant
to the leading man.

805
01:33:10,916 --> 01:33:13,082
It's called the supporting role.

806
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:17,915
Yes, the supporting role.

807
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:22,707
At 3am today,

808
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:23,415
At 3am today,

809
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:28,082
the Japanese Army has landed on
Siamese coasts at Songkhla,

810
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:28,665
the Japanese Army has landed on
Siamese coasts at Songkhla,

811
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:33,915
Pattani, Chumporn and Samut Prakarn.

812
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,332
There were clashes,

813
01:33:37,416 --> 01:33:41,374
but by no means could we
resist the Japanese forces.

814
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:45,290
The government has agreed to
allow the Japanese

815
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:48,749
to move their troops across our country.

816
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:53,332
We ask all Thai citizens to remain calm

817
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:58,374
and maintain peace.

818
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:02,249
Obey the warnings of the government.

819
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:06,915
Announced at 1 pm
by Thailand's Broadcast Radio.

820
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:39,332
Take me home!

821
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:45,415
Boonleung, my heart burns with jealousy

822
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:48,665
every time I see you with that bastard.

823
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:53,790
I want him to die and leave us alone.

824
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:57,332
Please!

825
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:02,665
You know
he can't do anything to you now!

826
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:08,582
I know, but I still can't stand it.

827
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:14,707
Do you realize how much I love you?

828
01:35:18,916 --> 01:35:20,082
I do.

829
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,915
Boonleung... Have a child with me.

830
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,582
I want an heir to carry my bloodline.

831
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:35,415
I had a vasectomy...

832
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:38,915
when I went to Europe with The Lord.

833
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,499
Peter wrote me that

834
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:59,707
the Japanese has seized

835
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,499
our company in Singapore.

836
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:06,707
I'm so worried that the same
will happen to our business here.

837
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:11,082
- Wad, get ready to move everyone to Phijit.
- OK.

838
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,290
Soon war will break out here.

839
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,957
I'll warn Jan about it.

840
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:21,957
No, let me do that.

841
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:24,165
I want to tell him myself.

842
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:26,665
He won't listen to you.

843
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:29,624
That's fine.

844
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:35,707
At least I want to try.

845
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,707
My Lord!

846
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,832
My Lord, My Lord!!

847
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:06,999
My Lord!

848
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,332
Sir!

849
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:15,457
I never forget that day

850
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:19,290
when the hammer of fate hit us.

851
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:23,082
Not just Siam...

852
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:25,832
But the Phijitvanich house too.

853
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:29,415
Lord Wisnan became totally paralyzed.

854
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:34,249
Miss Wad had to move him from the tower

855
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,749
to the main hall.

856
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:47,332
Master Jan and Madame Boonleung
kept to themselves

857
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:50,874
and hardly showed up to meet anybody.

858
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:09,082
Ken.

859
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:10,457
Yes, ma'am

860
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:15,207
Please take care of
Jan and The Lord for me.

861
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,499
What do you mean by that?

862
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:24,249
I'm going to Phijit tonight.

863
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:29,082
Send someone to get a train ticket.

864
01:38:34,458 --> 01:38:36,040
Yes, ma'am.

865
01:38:37,541 --> 01:38:39,540
I'll ask Malai and the boy
to go with you.

866
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:44,040
Thank you.

867
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,124
Ma'am.

868
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:06,082
Stop it!

869
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:11,249
Why? I need you so much.

870
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:13,499
The old lech is now a cripple.

871
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:21,374
That's enough!

872
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:25,540
You don't desire me at all?

873
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,540
We've caused too much suffering.

874
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:35,374
You never loved me.

875
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,707
You slept with me...

876
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,582
You pretend to be good to me...

877
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,496
just because you were
afraid I'd hurt that old devil!

878
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,790
Boonleung, answer me!

879
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:51,457
Yes.

880
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:11,249
You never loved me.

881
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:24,332
Someone must've
sneaked in to do this to him.

882
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:28,165
You have to keep watch.

883
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,374
I have to go now.

884
01:45:32,916 --> 01:45:34,415
Thank you, doctor.

885
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:49,749
Getting drunk so early, huh?

886
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:54,249
Ken! Come drink with me!

887
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:59,957
I think you should have breakfast,
not whisky.

888
01:46:01,083 --> 01:46:02,790
You'll hurt your stomach.

889
01:46:03,541 --> 01:46:04,790
Don't lecture me.

890
01:46:05,875 --> 01:46:07,749
I don't care about my stomach!

891
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,957
Well, I do! But so what?

892
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:17,165
Suit yourself.

893
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:22,332
I'll have to ask you frankly.

894
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,040
Did you hurt The Lord?

895
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:28,707
Yes, I did.

896
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:32,582
Why?

897
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:36,332
You saw what that prick did to me
when I was a child!

898
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:38,874
It's time to end this vicious cycle.

899
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,665
It only hurts us more and more!

900
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,999
The Lord is paying for his sins,

901
01:46:45,416 --> 01:46:46,977
and he's not going to live much longer!

902
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:56,749
Die and burn in hell!
The sooner the better!

903
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:01,415
You think so, Grandma?

904
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,374
Jan...

905
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:06,999
Do you even know what you've become?

906
01:47:07,916 --> 01:47:09,790
Come back and be the old Master Jan
I used to know!

907
01:47:09,916 --> 01:47:11,624
If you keep spreading poison
like this,

908
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:14,082
no one will want to be with you.

909
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,582
Don't you know that Miss Wad
has gone to Phijit

910
01:47:16,916 --> 01:47:18,415
because she couldn't stand
what you and Madame Boonleung did!

911
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:19,832
Then follow her!

912
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:21,915
Go to Phijit!

913
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:25,415
How dare you teach me what to do?!

914
01:47:26,083 --> 01:47:28,040
Get this into your head!

915
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:29,957
You're just a maid's son!

916
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:32,540
You have no right
to tell me how to live!

917
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,165
All right.

918
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:48,457
If that's what you want.

919
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:05,165
Get out! Go to hell!

920
01:48:06,291 --> 01:48:08,249
All of you!

921
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,207
Is Ken here?

922
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,457
In his office, sir.

923
01:51:00,916 --> 01:51:02,665
What can I do for you, sir?

924
01:51:07,916 --> 01:51:10,499
I happen to be in the neighborhood.

925
01:51:11,916 --> 01:51:13,676
You haven't come back to the house
in months.

926
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,582
I thought you'd left the company
to join your family in Phijit.

927
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:25,790
I did. And I've come back.

928
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:35,915
The staff here should be fired!

929
01:51:37,041 --> 01:51:41,499
How can they leave their manager
to work alone like this? Useless!

930
01:51:42,375 --> 01:51:43,624
Today's a holiday.

931
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:48,915
Is that so?

932
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:56,624
Have you eaten?

933
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:02,999
I've had coffee.

934
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:11,624
I've brought you lunch.

935
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:17,165
Shrimp paste, fried mackerel,

936
01:52:18,083 --> 01:52:23,915
bitter curry, and banana in sweet syrup.
All your favorites.

937
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:29,249
I'll leave it here.

938
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:32,582
Why are you in such a hurry?

939
01:52:38,166 --> 01:52:40,915
I'll take a walk, I'll be back.

940
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:51,707
Well, I forgot something.

941
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:56,207
What?

942
01:52:57,833 --> 01:52:59,249
I forgot to say sorry.

943
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:03,707
Forgive a bad man like me.

944
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,082
You can come home whenever you want.

945
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:12,124
You're always welcome.

946
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:16,040
Master Jan!

947
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:18,999
Master Jan!

948
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:20,082
Ken!

949
01:54:21,666 --> 01:54:22,915
Ken!

950
01:54:23,041 --> 01:54:23,874
Master Jan!

951
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:27,374
Master Jan!

952
01:54:29,583 --> 01:54:30,665
Master Jan!

953
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:28,749
Master Jan, can you hear me?

954
01:55:29,958 --> 01:55:30,915
Master Jan!

955
01:55:32,083 --> 01:55:36,249
I'm all right.
But the man on top of me isn't.

956
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,499
Help him up.

957
01:55:48,416 --> 01:55:49,374
Mr. Kajorn!

958
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:52,582
Where have you been?

959
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:57,957
I've joined the Free Thai Movement
in England.

960
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:05,582
You'll be all right,
we'll take you to the doctor.

961
01:56:06,041 --> 01:56:07,665
It's too late, Mr. Jan.

962
01:56:16,416 --> 01:56:18,624
Please give this ring

963
01:56:19,166 --> 01:56:21,207
to my mother.

964
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:26,874
Please take care of my mother...

965
01:56:28,666 --> 01:56:29,749
My father...

966
01:56:31,958 --> 01:56:33,207
Kaew...

967
01:56:37,708 --> 01:56:39,707
and our child.

968
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:42,749
Mr. Kajorn!

969
01:56:43,583 --> 01:56:44,624
Mr. Kajorn!

970
01:57:03,083 --> 01:57:05,665
May you rest in peace.

971
01:57:33,083 --> 01:57:34,749
That's life.

972
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:37,499
Mr. Kajorn died and I was saved.

973
01:57:38,458 --> 01:57:40,619
You should hurry home to see
if everything's all right.

974
01:57:42,208 --> 01:57:44,415
I'll take his body to the temple.

975
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,457
Ken. I hate war.

976
01:57:55,625 --> 01:57:57,207
I despise all of this.

977
01:58:24,666 --> 01:58:28,249
Where's my son?

978
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,165
Daddy! Daddy!

979
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:21,915
Is anybody hurt?

980
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:23,249
No, sir.

981
01:59:23,833 --> 01:59:24,915
And The Lord?

982
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,457
He's asleep, sir.

983
02:00:25,666 --> 02:00:28,499
It started
after you forced yourself on Kaew.

984
02:00:29,875 --> 02:00:32,235
She threatened to kill herself
if I didn't become her lover.

985
02:00:33,916 --> 02:00:35,540
I feel sorry for her.

986
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:39,124
Kaew is no different from you.

987
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:41,707
You're two motherless children.

988
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:46,790
And the burden fell on me.

989
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:10,249
I met Mr. Kajorn today,

990
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:13,332
he asked me to give this ring to you.

991
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:18,540
Where did you meet him?
Is he doing all right?

992
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:22,374
He's fine. He's going to England.

993
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:25,290
Now? During the war?

994
02:01:26,375 --> 02:01:27,999
He's with the Free Thai Movement.

995
02:01:32,916 --> 02:01:33,874
Kajorn...

996
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:39,249
The Lord has passed away.

997
02:03:00,083 --> 02:03:01,332
Father,

998
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,665
please forgive me

999
02:03:07,583 --> 02:03:09,624
for everything I did.

1000
02:03:14,458 --> 02:03:18,415
Please forgive me too.

1001
02:03:49,125 --> 02:03:53,624
Scum! You knocked me up!

1002
02:03:54,083 --> 02:03:59,249
You're my wife. What's so wrong
with me knocking you up?

1003
02:03:59,958 --> 02:04:02,082
Who's your wife, asshole?!

1004
02:04:02,958 --> 02:04:04,957
The whole of Bangkok knows that you,

1005
02:04:05,458 --> 02:04:07,624
Mrs. Wilailek Dara,

1006
02:04:07,958 --> 02:04:11,749
is the wife of Jan Dara
by law and by tradition.

1007
02:04:12,583 --> 02:04:14,207
In seven months

1008
02:04:14,583 --> 02:04:16,915
I'll have a child as my heir.

1009
02:04:17,416 --> 02:04:20,665
Scum! I want to smack your face.

1010
02:04:21,125 --> 02:04:22,915
Smack Ken! You two have history, right?

1011
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:25,707
No! I've retired a long time ago!

1012
02:04:26,375 --> 02:04:28,415
I want to fight you, son of a bitch!

1013
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:32,999
Sure!
I want to kick my wife's face too!

1014
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:40,832
Don't run away!

1015
02:04:41,416 --> 02:04:43,374
I'll run! So what?

1016
02:04:44,583 --> 02:04:46,540
Your mustache has come off!

1017
02:04:47,666 --> 02:04:49,915
And your pants too!

1018
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:53,040
What a disgrace!

1019
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:06,499
Dear Madame Boonleung,

1020
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:08,499
I've heard the sad news
of The Lord's death from Ken.

1021
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:12,374
I've heard the sad news
of The Lord's death from Ken.

1022
02:05:13,083 --> 02:05:18,249
But I couldn't leave the monastery
for the funeral

1023
02:05:18,833 --> 02:05:21,665
since I was in the period of
observing dharma.

1024
02:05:22,291 --> 02:05:24,582
I guess soon

1025
02:05:24,916 --> 02:05:27,790
you'd leave Bangkok

1026
02:05:28,125 --> 02:05:30,540
for your home in Phuket

1027
02:05:31,208 --> 02:05:34,749
or maybe for a vacation in Europe.

1028
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:39,124
You had performed the noblest of duty

1029
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:42,290
that a woman could to a man she loved.

1030
02:05:43,041 --> 02:05:47,582
Right up to
the final moments of his life.

1031
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:51,749
Myself, I've found peace
under the guidance of faith.

1032
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,249
I'll devote my soul

1033
02:05:56,708 --> 02:06:00,749
to the glory of Buddha

1034
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,540
until the last day of my life.

1035
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:09,874
I will consign the merit to all
the spirits in the universe.

1036
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:12,624
As well as to you...

1037
02:06:13,166 --> 02:06:15,707
To Jan... To Kaew...

1038
02:06:16,583 --> 02:06:19,874
To my grandson Pree...

1039
02:06:20,166 --> 02:06:22,665
And another
who's growing in Kaew's womb.

1040
02:06:24,875 --> 02:06:27,665
May the virtue

1041
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:31,124
of Buddha's teachings

1042
02:06:31,833 --> 02:06:35,457
shower you with peace
and happiness forever.

1043
02:06:36,208 --> 02:06:38,999
From Nun Wad.

1044
02:06:51,333 --> 02:06:54,249
If you leave me,

1045
02:06:55,208 --> 02:06:57,290
how can I go on living?

1046
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:01,790
Of course you can.

1047
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:06,582
If you walk out on me,
I'll kill myself!

1048
02:07:07,916 --> 02:07:09,499
Try me!

1049
02:07:10,916 --> 02:07:16,249
Kaew...
A person can never love another person

1050
02:07:17,083 --> 02:07:18,832
If he doesn't even know

1051
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,165
how to love and respect himself.

1052
02:07:22,541 --> 02:07:23,999
Goodbye.

1053
02:07:26,958 --> 02:07:28,915
Selfish.

1054
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:36,624
Look who's talking.

1055
02:07:47,916 --> 02:07:49,832
I have to go now, young man.

1056
02:07:50,541 --> 02:07:52,457
Too bad I was born too soon,

1057
02:07:52,958 --> 02:07:55,915
or maybe you were born too late.

1058
02:07:57,708 --> 02:07:58,665
Why's that?

1059
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,165
Otherwise I might've

1060
02:08:05,916 --> 02:08:11,082
settled down here as your wife
and lived happily ever after.

1061
02:08:13,833 --> 02:08:17,124
Age is just a number.

1062
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:20,540
It's easy for a man to say that.

1063
02:08:21,166 --> 02:08:23,749
In five or six years,
I'll become an old hag.

1064
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:26,082
And you'll dump me

1065
02:08:26,416 --> 02:08:28,832
for a hot young thing.

1066
02:08:29,583 --> 02:08:31,124
Right, Ken?

1067
02:08:32,583 --> 02:08:34,040
No comment, ma'am.

1068
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:39,415
My heart skips a beat seeing you leave.

1069
02:08:41,416 --> 02:08:44,457
Tomorrow your heart will be fine.

1070
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:47,665
Believe me, young man.

1071
02:08:51,791 --> 02:08:55,499
I'll remember everything that happened
in this house as my souvenir.

1072
02:08:57,541 --> 02:08:59,165
Especially

1073
02:08:59,916 --> 02:09:03,207
the friendship you had for me.

1074
02:09:08,625 --> 02:09:13,999
And I'll remember to rub ice on my body
when the heat gets unbearable.

1075
02:09:15,666 --> 02:09:20,040
It's much more fun
to have a girl do that for you.

1076
02:09:22,208 --> 02:09:26,749
There won't be any girl
who can melt my ice...

1077
02:09:27,583 --> 02:09:31,832
like you could. I mean it.

1078
02:09:33,833 --> 02:09:38,915
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1079
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:41,665
Including...

1080
02:09:43,291 --> 02:09:46,332
When you lied to me about Kajorn.

1081
02:09:48,583 --> 02:09:50,665
How did you know?

1082
02:09:53,208 --> 02:09:57,582
I'm a witch. I have a crystal ball.

1083
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:00,582
Let's go.

1084
02:10:01,458 --> 02:10:03,415
Bon voyage.

1085
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:25,915
Ken, did you tell her about Mr. Kajorn?

1086
02:10:27,625 --> 02:10:29,249
I'd never dare do that!

1087
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,207
How could she know then?

1088
02:10:32,208 --> 02:10:33,749
She knows a lot of people,

1089
02:10:34,375 --> 02:10:36,249
maybe one of
her Western friends told her.

1090
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:40,749
Or maybe she really has a crystal ball.

1091
02:10:46,125 --> 02:10:50,665
Son of a bitch!
You'll never have your child!

1092
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:55,957
May you burn in hell and be damned
until eternity!

1093
02:11:19,541 --> 02:11:20,874
She's gone.

1094
02:11:25,083 --> 02:11:29,165
My child... My child's gone too...

1095
02:11:32,416 --> 02:11:34,749
Yes.

1096
02:11:39,875 --> 02:11:45,165
My child's gone too!

1097
02:11:47,416 --> 02:11:52,249
My child.

1098
02:11:57,250 --> 02:11:58,957
My child.

1099
02:12:02,208 --> 02:12:04,499
And they all left me,

1100
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:07,332
one by one...

1101
02:12:07,416 --> 02:12:09,874
like falling leaves.

1102
02:12:10,583 --> 02:12:16,040
Pree died when he was around 10.

1103
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:18,957
You too, Ken.

1104
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,415
I'm not dead yet.

1105
02:12:23,416 --> 02:12:27,040
I'm right here,
or do you take me for a ghost?

1106
02:12:28,666 --> 02:12:31,249
I'm not saying you're dead.

1107
02:12:32,791 --> 02:12:35,457
I said, everyone left me.

1108
02:12:37,375 --> 02:12:42,915
We all have to leave
those we love at some point, don't we?

1109
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:46,790
I never did.

1110
02:12:47,708 --> 02:12:55,749
I never left Phijitvanich House.

1111
02:12:57,083 --> 02:13:02,790
You're talking about a house.
A house doesn't have a life.

1112
02:13:05,041 --> 02:13:06,249
Of course there is.

1113
02:13:06,375 --> 02:13:10,749
You don't see what I've seen.

1114
02:13:11,875 --> 02:13:15,582
Sometimes I saw Lord Wisnan.

1115
02:13:16,166 --> 02:13:19,124
I saw Aunt Wad, Madame Boonleung...

1116
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:22,207
I saw Miss Kaew too, we even talked.

1117
02:13:22,583 --> 02:13:27,249
Don't you believe me?
I also saw Mr. Kajorn and Pree.

1118
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,082
Are you serious?

1119
02:13:31,875 --> 02:13:34,624
You're frightening me!

1120
02:13:38,083 --> 02:13:39,332
I'm joking!

1121
02:13:46,541 --> 02:13:50,874
Ken, I have a present for you.

1122
02:13:51,416 --> 02:13:52,707
What is it?

1123
02:13:58,166 --> 02:13:58,999
Here.

1124
02:14:01,583 --> 02:14:04,540
My diary.

1125
02:14:05,458 --> 02:14:07,665
All my memories are written in here,

1126
02:14:08,125 --> 02:14:09,915
with pictures too.

1127
02:14:10,625 --> 02:14:14,415
And this is my will.

1128
02:14:14,791 --> 02:14:17,665
I give everything

1129
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,415
to you and your children.

1130
02:14:23,416 --> 02:14:25,249
I'll take the diary,

1131
02:14:26,333 --> 02:14:30,040
but the will... I won't have it.

1132
02:14:30,625 --> 02:14:35,249
Are you out of your mind?
That's a few billion baht!

1133
02:14:36,833 --> 02:14:37,915
I won't take it.

1134
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,415
I don't have a child,
I don't have anyone.

1135
02:14:45,875 --> 02:14:49,624
Give it to charity.

1136
02:14:50,583 --> 02:14:52,499
No, I want you to have it!

1137
02:14:52,583 --> 02:14:53,957
I don't want it!

1138
02:14:54,375 --> 02:14:55,749
I want you to have it!

1139
02:14:55,833 --> 02:14:59,124
I don't want it! You're so stubborn!

1140
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:01,124
I should smack you!

1141
02:15:03,583 --> 02:15:05,249
Oh, I'm scared!

1142
02:15:05,875 --> 02:15:11,749
Are you mad
to refuse a billion-baht fortune?

1143
02:15:13,791 --> 02:15:15,332
Master Jan,

1144
02:15:15,916 --> 02:15:20,249
the apocalypse is coming.

1145
02:15:20,708 --> 02:15:22,624
What good

1146
02:15:23,458 --> 02:15:25,624
would money do?

1147
02:15:26,166 --> 02:15:27,582
Good afternoon, grandpa.

1148
02:15:28,791 --> 02:15:31,707
Tiwa, you're here.

1149
02:15:32,083 --> 02:15:32,915
Yes.

1150
02:15:34,375 --> 02:15:37,374
Is this Dao?

1151
02:15:37,958 --> 02:15:39,540
No.

1152
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,165
This is Tiwa, Dao's son.

1153
02:15:43,708 --> 02:15:46,374
What kind of work do you do?

1154
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:51,499
I work at NASA in the States.

1155
02:15:51,916 --> 02:15:55,290
Tiwa has a PhD. In physics.

1156
02:15:57,583 --> 02:16:01,999
Grandpa,
we have to leave for the airport now.

1157
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:05,957
Where are you off to?

1158
02:16:07,041 --> 02:16:09,582
Back home in the USA.

1159
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:18,624
I have to go, or I'll miss my flight.

1160
02:16:23,416 --> 02:16:24,915
Let me hold it.

1161
02:16:25,708 --> 02:16:28,124
See, everybody left me.

1162
02:16:28,458 --> 02:16:30,290
Don't say that, Master Jan.

1163
02:16:31,166 --> 02:16:34,374
I come back to visit you every year.

1164
02:16:34,916 --> 02:16:39,249
If I dropped dead this year,
you wouldn't see me here next year.

1165
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:42,249
Then I'd see you in heaven.

1166
02:16:43,791 --> 02:16:45,207
You mean hell?

1167
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:50,249
Heaven or hell,
I'll make sure to see you every year.

1168
02:16:50,791 --> 02:16:52,915
What if you died first?

1169
02:16:54,708 --> 02:16:57,582
I'd come to you as a ghost.

1170
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:02,415
Please don't, I'd be so scared.

1171
02:17:03,333 --> 02:17:05,249
We really have to go.

1172
02:17:06,833 --> 02:17:09,165
Please take care of him.

1173
02:17:09,708 --> 02:17:10,832
Don't worry, sir.

1174
02:17:11,291 --> 02:17:14,915
See you soon,

1175
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:16,915
in heaven or hell.

1176
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,915
Hell, definitely.

1177
02:17:20,833 --> 02:17:23,249
Who knows?

1178
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:25,915
Hell, wanna bet?

1179
02:17:26,375 --> 02:17:29,582
- Goodbye.
- Be careful.

1180
02:17:49,958 --> 02:17:52,082
Bon voyage, Ken.
