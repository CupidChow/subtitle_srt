1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,640
(Hey, Zhou Shuyi.)

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,120
(Do you know why being in 1st place
is important to me?)

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,970
(Driving forward with reckless abandon)

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,760
(I only wish to stay somewhere
where you can see me.)

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,000
(Can you please don't push me away?)

6
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,230
(Can you look at me?)

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,780
=No.1 For You=

8
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,638
(It's a wonderful thing
to have childhood friends)

9
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,406
(who grow up together with you.)

10
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,675
(But sometimes,)

11
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,911
(a three-way company doesn't work.)

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,878
(For example,)

13
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,113
(being in love.)

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,083
(My father always tells me)

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,617
(that failure is natural,)

16
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,152
(and that you're a man if you succeed.)

17
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,122
(Back then, he traveled from Japan
to Taiwan, China,)

18
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,025
(and won my mother's heart
with this attitude.)

19
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,566
(I made a vow to my lucky charm.)

20
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,204
(As long as I win
the Swimming Club Newbie PK match,)

21
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,973
(I will accomplish something great,)

22
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,710
(and turn our friendship into
a love relationship.)

23
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,681
(Sorry about that, Fang Zhengwen.)

24
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,683
(I have to get into a relationship
before you.)

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,085
(Jiang Yuxin,)

26
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,487
(just wait for my confession.)

27
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,289
(Let's welcome the most important day
for me, Zhou Shuyi,)

28
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,791
(together before my graduation.)

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,592
You can do it!

30
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,593
You can do it!

31
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,797
Okay, change sides.

32
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,366
What do you think? Are you confident?

33
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,067
What about you?

34
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,401
Good luck, newbie.

35
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,638
The top swimmer of the swimming club.

36
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,540
1st place is definitely yours.

37
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,443
Shuyi, your swimming cap.

38
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,778
Shuyi, your swimming goggles.

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,414
Shuyi, you can do it.

40
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,382
Thank you.

41
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,483
He's so handsome!

42
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,086
You're so popular.

43
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,753
Not bad at all.

44
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,888
Are you confident that you can win?

45
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,855
Of course.

46
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,191
I just need to use 40% of my full power

47
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,893
(Freshman Joining)
for such a competition.

48
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,294
(Freshman Joining)
Don't get ahead of yourself here.

49
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,029
I'm Zhou Shuyi, you know?

50
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:43,663
Fine.

51
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,265
Remember, focus.

52
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:45,999
And relax.

53
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,867
Shide, tonight...

54
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,036
Gao Shide, you're so handsome!

55
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,974
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,882
(What is he doing here?)

57
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,918
(Is he trying to spoil my plan?)

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,154
(Oh, no! My leg is cramping up!)

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,161
(Are you okay?)

60
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,663
(I'm okay.)

61
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,765
(But your leg is...)

62
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,933
(I'll pull you up.)

63
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,900
(No need for that.)

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,101
(I don't need your help.)

65
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,503
(Go away.)

66
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,576
(Some people say that setbacks)

67
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,477
(are our enemies,)

68
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,680
(and failures are the steps
that impede us in life.)

69
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,816
(To me,)

70
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,985
(no matter if it's rivals or setbacks,)

71
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,553
(I only think of one name.)

72
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,388
(Gao Shide.)

73
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,893
(From primary school to junior high
and senior high,)

74
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,194
(no matter what kind of competition
I participated in,)

75
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,163
(whether it's English, essay-writing,)

76
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,332
(Go, debate, sprint, and so on,)

77
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,600
(because of him,)

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,901
(I was always in 2nd place.)

79
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,818
Shide.

80
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,787
Shide, here.

81
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,591
I bought it for you. You must finish it.

82
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,592
I'm sure you'll like it.

83
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,293
This is yours.

84
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,850
(First place, Gao Shide, 698,
Second place, Zhou Shuyi, 697)

85
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,278
(I don't like losing.)

86
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,246
(But ever since his appearance,)

87
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,348
(I was always)

88
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:47,654
(the runner-up!)

89
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,399
Hey.

90
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,199
What are you doing?

91
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,501
What happened?

92
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,037
I'm fine.

93
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,605
Hey.

94
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,676
He didn't even thank you.

95
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,845
Thank you for saving Shuyi.

96
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,416
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

97
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,939
You'll be fine.

98
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,741
Safety first.

99
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,710
Don't be upset.

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,618
Falling into the pool
is just a small deal.

101
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,853
Don't cry.

102
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,321
Now, the entire school
knows who you are.

103
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,322
You're famous now.

104
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,757
Who's crying?

105
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,225
Darn it.

106
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,228
He embarrassed me in front of everyone.

107
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,497
You fell into the pool yourself.

108
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,298
Just forget it.

109
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,133
You guys have been good friends

110
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:07,834
for a long time.

111
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,602
Who said we are good friends?

112
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,238
That's ridiculous.

113
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,974
We studied in the same primary school,
junior high, and senior high.

114
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,510
I thought I wouldn't need to see him
in university.

115
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,712
I didn't expect him to
make a school transfer

116
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,982
to our university
during his sophomore year.

117
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,084
I've endured this until my senior year.

118
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,587
I will never forgive him.

119
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,688
That's right.

120
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,523
I'll definitely support you
until the end.

121
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,225
Let's show Gao Shide
who's the boss here.

122
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,867
What's the matter?

123
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,106
Bingwei, are you done?

124
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,508
Almost. Wait a second.

125
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,642
They're coming. Hurry up.

126
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,211
Hurry.

127
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,746
I'm done.

128
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,215
Let's go.

129
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,926
Shide,

130
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,327
lend it to me.

131
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,396
Okay.

132
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,431
Thanks.

133
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,337
Who did this?

134
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,405
Darn it.

135
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,773
Let's think of something else.

136
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,507
Okay.

137
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:23,976
Who did this?

138
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,686
Nice shot.

139
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,454
Shide.

140
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,423
Your layup was nice.

141
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,558
-Good job.
-You blocked him.

142
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,595
Here you go.

143
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,933
It's free.

144
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,000
We shouldn't let it go to waste.

145
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,604
It's a bomb.

146
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,339
I just bought this shirt.

147
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,250
(Silly)

148
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,617
Pass me the towel.

149
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,622
I'm pretty unlucky lately.

150
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,348
That was nice.

151
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,717
Bravo.

152
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,033
You did the prank, right?

153
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,000
What prank?

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,268
I don't know what you're talking about.

155
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,107
What?

156
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,347
You smell like talcum powder.

157
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,249
Stop lying.

158
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,016
I threw it away long ago.

159
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,217
Threw what away?

160
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,907
Spreading chili powder
in his swimming trunks,

161
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,613
calling him without saying anything,

162
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,184
waxing his eyebrows,

163
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,254
trimming his nostrils in secret,

164
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,059
sticking chewing gum on his chair...

165
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,828
(A million ways to prank Gao Shide)

166
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,829
(A million ways to prank Gao Shide)
Are you done?

167
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,397
(A million ways to prank Gao Shide)
We started this since 3 p.m.

168
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,865
(A million ways to prank Gao Shide)
Yeah, we're running out of inspiration.

169
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,834
Are we pranking him?
Or is he pranking us?

170
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,187
(A million ways to prank Gao Shide)

171
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,939
Why don't we just hire goons
to beat him up?

172
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,608
Have you lost your mind?

173
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,709
To think that you're in
the Faculty of Law.

174
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,977
How could you come up
with something like that?

175
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,045
They're smart.

176
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,313
They'll hide their identities.

177
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,250
I think

178
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,051
we should forget it.

179
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,753
We're already in our senior year.

180
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,388
Just endure it and graduate.

181
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,158
That's precisely why we need to do
something memorable before we graduate.

182
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,260
Do you think I'll lose to him?

183
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,895
I've already come up with so many ideas.

184
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,664
That's not what I mean.

185
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,932
All of us are adults.

186
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,567
Can't we just talk this over?

187
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,301
Yeah.

188
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,102
I don't care.

189
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,070
I must prank him somehow.

190
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,471
Shuyi.

191
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,776
Are we done?

192
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,211
Remember to take a photo of it.

193
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,994
Bingwei took a blurry shot
of the pranking ideas.

194
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,532
I need to prank Gao Shide somehow.

195
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,968
Fang Zhengwen, hurry up.

196
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,370
Fine.

197
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,972
What's the matter?

198
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,374
You're being so mysterious.

199
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,875
I have something to tell you.

200
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,382
Fang Zhengwen, do you hate me?

201
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,250
Of course not.

202
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,252
So,

203
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,554
you don't hate me?

204
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,256
What are you saying?
How could I hate you?

205
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,524
If so, does that mean you like me?

206
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,226
Didn't I tell you already...

207
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,062
It's because I like you.

208
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,667
Besides my thesis,

209
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,266
you're the most important thing
to me before graduation.

210
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,304
If you don't hate me,

211
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,139
do you want to be my boyfriend?

212
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:22,908
Shuyi?

213
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,009
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,479
I'm so glad.

215
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,714
Finally, we have some great news.

216
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,483
The three of us grew up together.

217
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,884
Now, you two will date each other.

218
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,219
This is great.

219
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,855
Hurry and say yes to her.

220
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,024
I was worried that this tomboy

221
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,760
might be left on the shelf.

222
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,594
Shuyi, I don't know...

223
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,029
I can rest at ease
when you're dating her.

224
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,199
I want to celebrate
this occasion for you guys.

225
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,601
What about tonight?

226
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,503
-Shuyi...
-Tonight, okay?

227
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:51,904
8 p.m.

228
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,340
-Shuyi...
-See you later.

229
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,883
Zhengwen is a fool.

230
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,186
Yuxin is a fool.

231
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,092
Both of them are fools.

232
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,963
I worked so hard.

233
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,568
Why are you guys doing this to me?

234
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,334
You said this lucky charm
was custom-made.

235
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,845
How is this lucky?

236
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,056
What's wrong with you?

237
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,357
Do you have a death wish?

238
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,225
What's wrong with you?

239
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,326
Why did you kiss me?

240
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,864
Who told you to stay underwater?

241
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,401
That's none of your business.

242
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,435
You're such a busybody.

243
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,704
Do you like Jiang Yuxin that much?

244
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,506
You wanted to take your own life

245
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,174
after hearing that she would
date Fang Zhengwen?

246
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,244
How did you know that I like her?

247
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,845
Were you keeping me under surveillance?

248
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,749
I always have my eyes on you.

249
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,156
I'm sure you were thinking of ways
to keep on dominating me

250
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,557
and make me the runner-up,

251
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,858
so that you can mock me, huh?

252
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,162
I knew you were up to no good.

253
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,530
Here you go.

254
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,431
Are you happy now?

255
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,465
Scram!

256
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,671
Zhou Shuyi.

257
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,973
Do you want me to beat you up?

258
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,408
Scram.

259
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,611
(Some people say that having a crush is
the only relationship that won't fail.)

260
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
(Nonsense.)

261
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,448
(When your crush is
dating someone else,)

262
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,584
(especially your childhood friend,)

263
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,787
(it's more heartbreaking than
getting dumped.)

264
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,689
(The pain is so bad)

265
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,390
(that you'll feel like
destroying the world.)

266
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,160
(It's so painful that a clear weather)

267
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,229
(looks like inclemency to you.)

268
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,397
(As the saying goes,
clouds gather before a storm.)

269
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,683
(The most painful thing about falling
out of love isn't losing your beloved.)

270
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,652
(It's that you'll start to
doubt yourself)

271
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,554
(and think that you aren't good enough)

272
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,955
(for people to like you.)

273
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,525
(That's why she chose the other person
instead of you.)

274
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,028
(If you wish to shake it off,)

275
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,964
(you can only tell yourself
that she isn't the one for you.)

276
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,969
(You have to force yourself
to let it go)

277
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,372
(and believe that someone else
in the world will like you.)

278
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,741
(That's why you have to
pull yourself together)

279
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,210
(to find the right person.)

280
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,554
Hey.

281
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,988
Sorry about this.
Our rehearsal will start soon.

282
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,523
Which club are you from?

283
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,226
You're sitting on the chair we need.

284
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,003
What have you been up to lately?

285
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,407
I didn't see you around lately.

286
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,714
Shuyi,

287
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,550
I have something to discuss with you.

288
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,953
Do you mind...

289
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,554
Sorry for being late!

290
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,989
I am late.

291
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,424
The professor wasn't willing
to let us leave early.

292
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,492
Let's go. I'll treat you guys to lunch.

293
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,431
You two should go.

294
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,132
I don't want to be the third wheel.

295
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,535
It's not like you don't know
Fang Zhengwen's character.

296
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,237
I don't know if he's a fool
or playing hard to get.

297
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,972
He hasn't given me a reply
even until now.

298
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,374
But it's fine. I've waited for
a long time anyway.

299
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,275
If you don't give me a reply soon,

300
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,409
you better watch out.

301
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,644
(Sometimes,)

302
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,946
(life will be cruel and give you
a wake-up call like this.)

303
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,215
(No matter who fancies whom,)

304
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,184
(when she started fancying him,)

305
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,458
(and when he started
to be fancied by her.)

306
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,958
I will decide what we eat
since you are indecisive.

307
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,054
(These are parts of the cruel reality.)

308
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,189
Zhou Shuyi.

309
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,560
I finally found you.

310
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,528
We were going to have lunch today.
Did you forget?

311
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,298
You're having lunch with him?

312
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,370
Hurry up.

313
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,537
I still have classes to attend
this afternoon.

314
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,138
Come on.

315
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:13,872
Bye.

316
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,042
Since when were they this close?

317
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,979
Let go.

318
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,615
Why did you grab me?

319
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,184
Would you leave with me if I didn't?

320
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,020
Did you know what expression
you were showing just now?

321
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,656
Do you want them to find out
that you have a crush on Jiang Yuxin?

322
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,924
It's not like I'll die if they find out.

323
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,559
Is that so?

324
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,795
If so, why did you hide
and cry in secret?

325
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
You even jumped into the pool.

326
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,064
Who said so?

327
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,971
(Zhengwen is a fool.)

328
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,775
Yuxin is a fool.

329
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,444
Both of them are fools.

330
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,815
I worked so hard.

331
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,017
Why are they doing this to me?

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,722
What do you want?

333
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,490
Do you wish to show them the video?

334
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,158
You scum.

335
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,360
I would've shown it to them just now
if I wanted to.

336
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,795
What exactly do you want?

337
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,862
You keep following me.

338
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,030
Do you have too much
free time on your hand?

339
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,632
What do I want?

340
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,503
You see,

341
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,905
I lack an attendant.

342
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,573
What about this?

343
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:23,975
You'll be my attendant.

344
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,243
You have to be on standby 24/7.

345
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,378
And, you must obey me.

346
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,147
What gives?

347
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,316
Hmm.

348
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:34,986
Go ahead then.

349
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,356
Do you think I'll be scared?

350
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,225
That is cool.

351
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,704
For how long?

352
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,240
Don't tell me I have to do this
for the rest of my life.

353
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,476
You intend to repeat your grade
for the rest of your life?

354
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,277
Say that to yourself!

355
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,813
For how long?

356
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,217
Until the day of our graduation.

357
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,986
Are there any exceptions?

358
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,500
Even criminals could
be released on parole.

359
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,057
What is your offer?

360
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:15,727
Fine.

361
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,830
If you defeat me one time,

362
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,098
I will set you free.

363
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,035
Defeat you in anything?

364
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,003
Anything.

365
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,606
Just you wait.

366
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,508
I'll defeat you flawlessly.

367
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,376
I'll make you admit
that you're inferior to me.

368
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,219
I will send you my class schedule
and address.

369
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,355
Wait below my house by 8 AM tomorrow.

370
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,056
If you're late...

371
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:45,791
Yeah, yeah!

372
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,728
Sit in the front.

373
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,297
I'm used to taking the MRT.

374
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,567
I'm used to being driven around.

375
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:30,836
That was cool.

376
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,248
Are you happy now?

377
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,483
It's all your fault.

378
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,984
I'll be late for my first class.

379
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,653
Your first class is at 2 p.m.

380
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,359
I have your class schedule.

381
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,163
You actually made an effort to get
my class schedule to prank me?

382
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,731
You're so devious.

383
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:02,767
Let's go.

384
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,603
My class isn't that early.

385
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,939
If so, why did you ask me
to meet you at 8 AM?

386
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,276
So that we can have breakfast.

387
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,713
Alright, guys. Today,

388
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,747
we'll talk about

389
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,283
what resources we can utilize

390
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,684
regarding market liquidity.

391
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,687
Through the retrieving of information,

392
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,456
we can provide our clients

393
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,091
with a complete, correct,

394
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,460
and effective communication module.

395
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,495
First,

396
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,898
we can do

397
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,066
a logical analysis

398
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:40,038
to discuss the kinds of clients we have.

399
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,274
We can use the information
we retrieve from

400
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,175
big data to understand it.

401
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:50,682
Hey.

402
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,517
Wake him up.

403
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,886
It'll be embarrassing when
the lecturer sees him.

404
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,688
It's fine.

405
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,757
Wait.

406
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,826
He's a finance student.
Why is he joining our IT class?

407
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,261
Shh.

408
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,131
Focus.

409
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,783
Let's have lunch

410
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,984
after returning the books.

411
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:26,785
Got it.

412
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,788
I have two more classes after lunch.

413
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,557
I have a little spare time
between the two classes.

414
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:33,425
Gao Shide.

415
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,094
I'm starving.

416
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,696
Can we have lunch first?

417
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:40,532
Hurry up.

418
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,634
I'm starving.

419
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:43,735
Hey.

420
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,570
Why are you making the call now?

421
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:53,912
What are you doing?

422
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,648
My leg is a little sore.

423
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,801
How long do you plan on hiding?

424
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,013
If you keep hiding,

425
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,614
you'll give yourself away.

426
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,483
I know.

427
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,417
But...

428
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,327
You have to face the truth

429
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,129
before you can let it go.

430
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,066
Love isn't a product.

431
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,067
It's not like you can check it out

432
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,268
and put it back whenever you like.

433
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,571
Only inexperienced people

434
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,773
will say that.

435
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,376
Who said I'm inexperienced?

436
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,844
So, you were in a relationship before?

437
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,981
Was it Zheyu?

438
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,150
What a fool.

439
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,451
What?

440
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,687
Gao Shide, were you insulting me
just now?

441
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,906
You're so smart.

442
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,841
You're really intelligent.

443
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,312
So, you infiltrated the enemy camp
to collect intel, huh?

444
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,014
What do you think?

445
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:43,848
Does he have any weaknesses?

446
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:44,749
Is there a way for us
to prank Gao Shide?

447
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,152
Prank my foot. I'm too busy lately.

448
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,419
Why have you been spending time

449
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,255
with Zhou Shuyi lately?

450
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,090
What happened?

451
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,459
Is that so?

452
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:55,894
Yeah.

453
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:58,997
Shide.

454
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,174
What are you doing?

455
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,276
There's too much meat.

456
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:16,915
I want some too.

457
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,353
What?

458
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,392
No one wants yours.

459
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,327
You only know how to eat and sleep.

460
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,863
You better sit at the back

461
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,731
if you want to join our class next time.

462
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,466
If not, Shide and I will be affected

463
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,434
when you fall asleep.

464
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,470
Even if Shuyi falls asleep in class,
he'll still be better than you.

465
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,773
I'm talking to him. Don't interrupt.

466
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,574
What?

467
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,577
According to the principle
of logical judgment,

468
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,946
we can determine the customers' status
and find related products

469
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,147
according to their preference,

470
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,517
time of purchase,

471
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,185
and types of products purchased.

472
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,823
Some people can learn in their sleep.

473
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,892
Like me.

474
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,798
Even so, you still lost to Shide.

475
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,167
Zhou Shuyi didn't lose.

476
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,768
He just let Shide win on purpose.

477
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,805
That doesn't make it any better.

478
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,008
When you lose, you lose.

479
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,576
There's no excuse.

480
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,980
I didn't expect you
to be this straightforward.

481
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,417
Are there any free seats?

482
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,786
Over there.

483
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,823
I'll make a move first.

484
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,690
I'll wait for you outside.

485
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,725
I haven't finished my food yet.

486
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,194
He wasn't referring to you.

487
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,229
Shide?

488
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,032
What are you looking at?

489
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,438
Wait.

490
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:48,873
Why are you sticking around

491
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,475
when you hate him?

492
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,243
Don't ask.

493
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,478
You'll be terrified.

494
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,514
Is it that terrifying?

495
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,651
It's very terrifying.

496
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,524
Not bad at all.

497
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,393
You're pretty good at this.

498
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,028
Thanks.

499
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,529
Nice.

500
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,898
This is it!

501
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,833
What?

502
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:18,603
What do you mean?

503
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
(Taipei City Shilin Public Market)

504
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,348
I thought

505
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,283
you're bringing me out on a date.

506
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,851
Date?

507
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,953
Who wants to date you?

508
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,689
So,

509
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,523
do you dare to take the challenge?

510
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,115
I don't believe it.

511
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,332
Thank you.

512
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,240
What next?

513
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,608
Next...

514
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:11,949
Zhou Shuyi.

515
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,186
You have class at 8 AM tomorrow.
Forget about the match.

516
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:16,554
Darn it.

517
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,423
I guess I became
your attendant for real.

518
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,217
(He's asleep?)

519
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,519
(Go to hell!)

520
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,298
(I should check his phone
while he's asleep.)

521
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,737
(You want to challenge me, huh?)

522
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,339
(Not in a million years.)

523
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,783
(Why can't I take it out?)

524
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,452
(I'm almost there.)

525
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,525
(Oh no!)

526
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,293
(What are you doing?)

527
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,496
(Let go of me!)

528
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,297
(Hurry and let go of me!)

529
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,450
I'm sorry.

530
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,918
Shuyi.

531
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,487
Don't be angry.

532
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,557
I thought you were with Gao Shide.

533
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,059
How could I be together with him?

534
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,062
Don't listen to her nonsense.

535
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:05,796
Listen.

536
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,031
I'm serious.

537
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,966
You should court him if you like him.

538
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,602
He won't know about your feelings
unless you tell him, right?

539
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,571
You see, there's an age gap between us.

540
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,739
I'm two years older than him.

541
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,107
Even so, I still told him my feelings.

542
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,441
You have to do it bravely.

543
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,476
Listen,

544
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,644
I'll always support you.

545
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,351
We have something to attend to.

546
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,252
We'll make a move first.

547
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,791
They...

548
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,560
Are they...

549
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,994
Are you sure they're not a couple?

550
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,560
(Sport Clubs)

551
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,900
I'll add some meat for you.

552
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,739
Why are you making spicy hot pot
when you can't take spicy food?

553
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,108
It's fine as long as you like it.

554
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,146
How did you know I like spicy hot pot?

555
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,182
I know everything about you.

556
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,388
So,

557
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:05,890
thank you for helping me.

558
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,765
They might've discovered my secret

559
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,234
if you didn't help me out just now.

560
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,839
Is the shrimp done?

561
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,341
Yeah.

562
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,654
Seems like you don't mind

563
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,391
losing Jiang Yuxin that much now.

564
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,693
I guess so.

565
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:44,695
Thanks.

566
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,204
Actually,

567
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,139
compared to falling out of love,

568
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,341
it's even more heartbreaking when

569
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,211
you don't even have a chance
to fight for it.

570
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,213
It ended

571
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,748
even before it started.

572
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,285
What will you do if the person you like

573
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,219
likes someone else?

574
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,156
Me?

575
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,363
I will

576
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,599
ruin their relationship

577
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,567
and take advantage of it.

578
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,507
You must be joking.

579
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,477
Yeah.

580
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,765
Gao Shide,

581
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,734
can I apply for leave

582
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,169
as your attendant?

583
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,075
Where are we going?

584
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,176
I thought you were heading to class?

585
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,110
Slow down.

586
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,678
Slow down.

587
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,588
Do you have a death wish?

588
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,259
You knew you had a weak stomach.

589
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,828
Why did you take spicy hot pot?

590
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,696
Have you lost your mind?

591
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,377
Zhou Shuyi,

592
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,680
the gastric medicine
can only relieve your pain temporarily.

593
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,848
You still need to visit a doctor.

594
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,427
Avoid oily and salty food this week.

595
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,729
However, if you wish to die,

596
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,966
you can try taking spicy hot pot again.

597
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,636
You're intimidating your patient.

598
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,805
What's wrong with this school doctor?

599
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,840
(Pei Shouyi)

600
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,446
Are you sure he is the one?

601
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,119
You...

602
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,154
You can take a break.

603
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,665
Great.

604
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,167
I'm going to buy a pack of cigarettes.

605
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,402
You can rest here.

606
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,808
What's wrong with them?

607
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,242
It seemed like they knew each other.

608
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,615
Why did you say that in front of him?

609
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,785
To have fun.

610
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,421
So, you can actually have fun
when you have a mood disorder?

611
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,460
As long as it's interesting.

612
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,566
So, that's my future cousin-in-law, huh?

613
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,134
He's a fine-looking man.

614
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,069
Isn't that great?

615
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,004
He's just an eye candy.

616
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,940
It's because you can't
see his kind nature.

617
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,242
I can't.

618
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,110
Maybe

619
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,279
I need to understand him
on a deeper level.

620
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,114
No need for that.

621
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,917
He'll never fall for me.

622
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,790
Why did you fall for him then?

623
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,793
Without him,

624
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,595
I might not get to where I am today.

625
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,631
I encountered him
when I was in Fifth Grade.

626
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,168
Back then,

627
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,437
my parents just got divorced.

628
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,240
I had a rough time.

629
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,009
I was only a primary school student.

630
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,077
How could I possibly understand

631
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,246
the fact that my father
abandoned the family?

632
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,883
But I knew that my mother

633
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,451
had it rougher than me.

634
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,454
That's why I pretended to be strong.

635
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,525
But sometimes, I couldn't
keep up with the pretense.

636
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:16,901
Hey.

637
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,335
What's the matter with you?

638
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,403
Are you okay?

639
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,078
Hey.

640
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,015
Your mucus and drool
are all over the place.

641
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,116
You look terrible.

642
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,918
My father...

643
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,321
He abandoned me and my mother.

644
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,393
At least you still have a mother.

645
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,630
My mother already went to heaven.

646
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,540
Or,

647
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,475
do you want my father?

648
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,211
Bad things always happen
when I spend time with him.

649
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,182
How could you give
your father away like that?

650
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,960
Why don't I

651
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,063
give myself to you then?

652
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,931
Just come to me when you need me.

653
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,399
You can treat me as your father.

654
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,305
Good boy. You look better
when you smile.

655
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,773
Shuyi.

656
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,376
Where have you been?

657
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,721
Come to me when you want to cry.
I'll lend you my shoulders.

658
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:45,990
I'm Zhou Shuyi.

659
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,925
I'm studying at Sanqiao Primary School,
Grade Five, Class One.

660
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,460
See you.

661
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,329
(Although it was proven)

662
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,866
(that he did so out of curiosity)

663
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,002
(as he couldn't recognize me)

664
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,803
(after I transferred to his school,)

665
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:04,441
(he did save me that afternoon.)

666
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,977
(You have no idea)

667
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,680
(how important his hug
and shoulders were)

668
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,715
(to me)

669
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,217
(at that exact moment.)

670
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,018
I'll head to class first.

671
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,823
I thought you would skip class for him

672
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,225
and make him realize
what you did for him.

673
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,895
After that, you would
use the opportunity

674
00:44:58,962 --> 00:44:59,830
to bend him.

675
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,072
I just wish to become his friend
before we graduate.

676
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,108
Good.

677
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,744
You'll follow your mother to America
after graduating anyway.

678
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,646
You shouldn't drag him into this.

679
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,249
I wouldn't even have the chance
to be his friend,

680
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,785
if he didn't fall out of love
in the first place.

681
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,156
So, you're keeping him company
during this period

682
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:27,491
to repay the favor?

683
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,361
Are you a snow crane?

684
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,330
If you have that much sympathy
floating around,

685
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,965
you should help people
to recycle resources.

686
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,568
Speak for yourself.

687
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,403
Your mug is broken, yet you...

688
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,677
You'll cut your lips.

689
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,516
I'll leave Shuyi to you then.

690
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,200
Okay. That's all for today.

691
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,637
Let's go.

692
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,272
I'm not free.

693
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:18,575
Shuyi,

694
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,878
are you busy later?

695
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,112
What?

696
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,048
It's been a long time
since we had lunch together.

697
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:26,884
I have something to do later.

698
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,425
I just want to ask you this.

699
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,797
So,

700
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,632
do you like Yuxin too?

701
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,237
Don't try to give her to me
just because we're buddies.

702
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,273
There should be no issue
since both of you

703
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,374
like each other.

704
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,276
However,

705
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,412
judging by the way
you reacted when you saw us,

706
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,048
are you sure you're okay with it?

707
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,986
Will you give Yuxin to me

708
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,655
if I say I'm not okay with it?

709
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,331
Gao Shide.

710
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,332
Gao Shide!

711
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,938
Is your tummy better now?

712
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,741
Zhengwen looked for me.

713
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,210
Why?

714
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,445
He asked me if I liked Yuxin.

715
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,414
I asked him

716
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,082
if he's willing to give her to me
if I said yes.

717
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,083
Give her to you?

718
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,285
He rejected the notion

719
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,854
without hesitation.

720
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,258
That guy has always been meek.

721
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,760
I never expected him
to have such a strong attitude.

722
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,365
I feel happy.

723
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,236
I hope he'll treat Yuxin well.

724
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,605
If not, I'll definitely beat him up.

725
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,876
You're right.

726
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,613
Time does cure everything.

727
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,748
This is great.

728
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:05,916
Congratulations.

729
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,550
Alright.

730
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,252
You got it?

731
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,290
Aren't you two the main pillars
of the swimming club?

732
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,428
Do you two want to join

733
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:21,031
the sending-off party
held by our juniors?

734
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,368
It's a test of courage

735
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,036
held in a windless and dark night.

736
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,174
The bizarre school phenomenon
will be expecting your arrival!

737
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,710
And,

738
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,411
if you guys do join it,

739
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,779
I'm sure our juniors

740
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,915
will be elated, right?

741
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,917
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

742
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,652
I'm not joining.

743
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,955
Don't be like this.

744
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,290
You spent time with him lately.

745
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,758
You didn't spend any time with us.

746
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:49,359
Listen.

747
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,629
We even prepared an obstacle course.

748
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,265
The winner will get attractive prizes.

749
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,099
And,

750
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,835
we made the challenge
even harder this time.

751
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,238
We'll confiscate your phones.

752
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,106
Your brain cells and guts

753
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,675
will be put to the test!

754
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,377
Come on.

755
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,380
Let's make some memorable memories
before you guys graduate.

756
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,848
What do you guys think?

757
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,550
Sure!

758
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,088
-(A challenge?)
-(Memorable memories?)

759
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,193
(I guess one more is fine.)

760
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,995
(I'll be free once I win!)

761
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:34,137
Did you guys hear that?

762
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,639
Did you guys hear the footsteps?

763
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,373
Were there footsteps?

764
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,140
What footsteps?

765
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,809
It's coming.

766
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,310
It was terrifying.

767
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,713
I told you guys already.

768
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,014
I wasn't lying.

769
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,683
That's the third person
who came out crying.

770
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,218
What are you doing here?

771
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,986
Were you frightened?

772
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,957
How could you be so adorable?

773
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,559
The juniors came to me.

774
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,828
I was thinking that I could make
your university life memorable for you.

775
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,398
Look, I even disguised myself
as a ghost for you.

776
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,966
So, you're here alone?

777
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,868
If so,

778
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,671
why don't I stay here with you?

779
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,144
You scared me.

780
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,146
What are you doing behind me?

781
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,213
You're the one blocking my path.

782
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:51,481
Oh.

783
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,484
Let's proceed.

784
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:02,626
I thought you got over her?

785
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,397
I just feel happy that
they have a great relationship.

786
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,000
You should focus.

787
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,568
This time, I'll defeat you.

788
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,546
(My goodness.)

789
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,715
(Since when was
our school this terrifying?)

790
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,451
(My flashlight is out of battery too.)

791
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,788
(Gao Shide should still be here, right?)

792
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,192
Why are you still here?

793
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,126
Go now.

794
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,073
I...

795
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,342
I'm afraid of ghosts.

796
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,612
I'll go easy on you.

797
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,414
Let's drop the match.

798
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,382
It's pointless for me to win like this.

799
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,251
Let's go through the maze together.

800
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,356
What are you doing?

801
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,460
Will I drag you down?

802
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,766
Don't worry.

803
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,668
I have your back.

804
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,078
Hurry up.

805
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,748
You're a man, for Heaven's sake.

806
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,682
I'll lead you.

807
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,797
Stay in front.

808
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,666
It's scarier at the back.

809
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,368
Are you ready?

810
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,070
Where will Shide go?

811
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,175
What did I say just now?
Did you not hear me?

812
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,743
Hurry up!

813
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,312
I'm begging you guys.

814
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,480
I was wrong.

815
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,582
I used too much strength.

816
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,454
What?

817
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,423
Did you see Shide?

818
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,959
Did you see Zhou Shuyi then?

819
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,063
What are you doing?

820
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,331
Let's leave together.

821
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:22,799
Your hand.

822
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,901
Stop following me.

823
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,169
Stop dragging me.

824
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,504
Let go of me.

825
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,207
Have you lost your mind?

826
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,085
This is ridiculous.

827
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,621
Why would they hide the clue
in the health center?

828
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,289
Yeah.

829
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,558
This is ridiculous.

830
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,097
What sound was that?

831
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:56,533
It was the wind.

832
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,969
That was scary.

833
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,370
What's the matter?

834
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,405
I was worried that
you might be frightened.

835
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,341
I was just telling you that I'm here.

836
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,545
Are you a fool?

837
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:15,986
Don't be scared!

838
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:18,655
Gao Shide, let's run!

839
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,924
Calm down.

840
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:36,906
Hello?

841
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:40,010
Is anyone there?

842
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,077
Hello?

843
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,447
(Health center)
We're trapped inside!

844
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,949
Hello?

845
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,317
Is anyone out there?

846
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,151
Hello?

847
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:49,986
Is anyone there?

848
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,424
Isn't this your territory?

849
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,393
Think of something.

850
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,228
What can I think of?

851
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,896
We don't have our phones.

852
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,465
So, we'll just sit here idly by?

853
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,906
The telephone isn't working.

854
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,178
There's a computer here.

855
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,881
I think it's connected to the Wi-Fi.

856
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,317
We can tell Zhengwen to help us out.

857
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,821
A password?

858
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,500
Are you hungry?

859
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,210
Got it.

860
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,085
So, you had a crush on Pei Shouyi?

861
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,290
No wonder you're so close to him.

862
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,459
You even know where
he keeps his instant noodles.

863
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,594
How long have you had a crush on him?

864
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,633
For a long time.

865
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,803
However,

866
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,873
you're the one I have a crush on.

867
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,442
What a relief.

868
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,215
Wait.

869
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,182
You have a crush on me?

870
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,852
How is that possible?

871
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,089
Yeah.

872
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,091
How is that possible?

873
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:39,763
You must be joking, right?

874
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,297
Of course I'm joking.

875
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,002
That's for you pairing me up
with Shouyi.

876
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,238
You're so petty.

877
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,041
You're stubborn.

878
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,858
It'll be done in a second.

879
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,075
Don't tell me this is the last one?

880
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,816
You're so long-winded. Just eat up.

881
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,288
We should eat together.

882
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,426
It's better for one to be full
than for two to be starving.

883
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,830
It's better for two to starve a little
than for one to die of starvation.

884
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,432
There's no need to do this.

885
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,801
We're friends, right?

886
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,140
Fine.

887
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,620
Let me tell you this.
Although we're friends,

888
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,622
it doesn't mean
I won't compete with you.

889
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,890
I won't keep losing to you.

890
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,661
I won't give you a chance to win.

891
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,555
Let's not go there.

892
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:46,389
This is the place.

893
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,090
Wait.

894
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,125
My juniors didn't tell me
about this area.

895
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,059
Don't do this.

896
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,094
I'm begging you.

897
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,328
-It's on the map.
-Stop messing around.

898
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,530
Let's leave, okay?

899
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:53,963
Come on.

900
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,067
What is that?

901
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:02,872
That's fake.

902
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,007
I can tell it's a student.

903
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:04,974
Wait.

904
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:05,542
That's impossible.

905
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,209
It's one of our juniors.

906
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,847
You guys are going overboard here.

907
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,515
Back off!

908
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:13,983
Let's leave this place.

909
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:14,817
Come on.

910
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,689
Don't leave.

911
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,391
I'm bored.

912
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,326
Play with me.

913
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,061
I'll carry you. Come on.

914
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,878
You did look convincing as a ghost.

915
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:42,946
Fang Zhengwen,

916
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:43,913
you better watch out!

917
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,250
(My goodness.)

918
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,018
(I have to spend the night
in a terrifying place like this)

919
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,187
(when this is my first time
spending the night outside?)

920
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:52,589
Gao Shide.

921
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,626
Are you scared?

922
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,927
Do you dare to sleep alone?

923
00:59:58,962 --> 00:59:59,429
Oh.

924
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,065
I don't.

925
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,032
But I'm afraid that you'll mock me.

926
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,300
No one will mock their friends.

927
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,135
Come here.

928
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:07,604
I'll protect you.

929
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,244
Move your bed nearer.

930
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,412
I'll chat with you.

931
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:27,757
What should we chat about?

932
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,195
Hmm.

933
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,698
What kind of person do you like?

934
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,377
That person...

935
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,283
He's adorable.

936
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,489
Some people

937
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,159
think that he's arrogant,

938
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,827
cocky, and narcissistic.

939
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,497
But to me,

940
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,800
he's just cute.

941
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,970
Even his flaws are
strengths to you, huh?

942
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,372
I guess it's true love.

943
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:19,609
Maybe.

944
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,448
Although he's proud and stubborn,

945
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,885
he treats his friends nicely.

946
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,188
He would endure hardships

947
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,823
to protect his friends.

948
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,525
He's pretty loyal, huh?

949
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,493
I guess that counts as a strength.

950
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,963
He has plenty of other strengths too.

951
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,201
Don't you plan to confess to him?

952
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:56,279
I don't plan to ruin

953
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,214
the friendship that
I spent so much effort to obtain.

954
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,753
I guess both of us are unlucky.

955
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,022
I understand your feelings.

956
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,660
I've already gotten over it.

957
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,863
But now, you're still dwelling on it.

958
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:14,697
Poor guy.

959
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,170
Come to me if you need someone
to listen to you.

960
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:22,839
I'll listen,

961
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,807
and I'll keep it a secret.

962
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:27,443
Don't stand on ceremony.

963
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,117
Thank you.

964
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,486
Your crush is tasteless

965
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,321
for not liking you.

966
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:41,324
And, he's lucky

967
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,759
that you have a crush on him.

968
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,263
You're a good guy.

969
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:56,906
Gao Shide,

970
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:58,608
sing a song for me.

971
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,744
You want me to sing?

972
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,782
I have to listen to songs
before I go to bed.

973
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,285
Hurry and sing.

974
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:30,673
♪The tide that has not receded♪

975
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:40,016

♪I want you to know that

980
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,338
Great lyrics.

981
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,774
You do have a great sense.

982
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,050
Go on.

983
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,218
That was nice.

984
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,023
This is your second time
complimenting me.

985
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,761
Please continue your singing.

986
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,138
Okay.

987
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,512
Here I go.

1010
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,645
(Closing the distance
between us in secret.)

1011
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,017
(Then asking you)

1012
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:31,721
(whether we can
keep on going like this.)

1013
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:40,162
(It's a shame that I still
don't have the courage to say it out.)

1014
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:36,500
(Password, Ee1I)

1015
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,921
Alright. Now, let's welcome

1016
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,791
our hot and scary female ghost,

1017
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,592
Yuxin.

1018
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,596
You were very convincing as a ghost.

1019
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:49,698
I'll beat you up.

1020
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,601
Where's Shuyi?

1021
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,704
I didn't see him.

1022
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,473
Didn't he return with you?

1023
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,242
I thought he was behind you.

1024
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,512
That's impossible.

1025
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:04,847
Shide hasn't returned yet.

1026
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,716
Has anyone seen Shuyi and Shide?

1027
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,755
They're fine. They just texted me.

1028
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,958
They left first because they thought
the event was boring.

1029
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,626
Did you guys think it's boring?

1030
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,196
(It's boring here.)

1031
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:21,497
(Zhou Shuyi and I will leave first.)

1032
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,731
(Keep our phones for us.)

1033
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:23,499
(We'll take them tomorrow.)

1034
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,034
Zhou Shuyi again?

1035
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:29,004
Since when did they become
a pair of conjoined twins?

1036
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:30,940
How's your leg?

1037
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,841
"We?"

1038
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,477
I'm fine.

1039
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:36,345
Coward.

1040
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,208
It's late and time to end this.

1041
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,449
Everyone, head back
and rest early, okay?

1042
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,035
You...

1043
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,206
Did you confess?

1044
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:10,806
Get out.

1045
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:19,582
Beg me.

1046
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,652
Get out.

1047
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,223
Please.

1048
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,322
Yesterday,

1049
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:03,993
when I said I have a crush on you,

1050
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,363
I wasn't lying.

1051
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,802
I wasn't lying when I said I would
take advantage of the situation.

1052
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,774
But I wouldn't do that to you.

1053
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,680
You said

1054
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,452
the person whom I had a crush on
is lucky.

1055
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,091
However, that luck of mine

1056
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,194
has always been with you.

1057
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,702
It's a shame that you'll never know.

1058
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:18,701
Zhou Shuyi,

1059
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:23,639
I like you.

1060
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:33,108
Did you wait for a long time?

1061
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,076
No.

1062
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:37,980
Order anything you like.

1063
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:38,781
It's my treat.

1064
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,315
Okay.

1065
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:41,984
Thank you.

1066
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,725
(Silly: where are you?)

1067
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,326
(We were supposed
to have lunch together.)

1068
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,094
(Did you forget?)

1069
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,128
What's the matter?

1070
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:54,430
It's nothing.

1071
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:55,631
What would you like to eat?

1072
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:57,933
-Let me take a look.
-Okay.

1073
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,215
Well.

1074
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,820
Do you guys know where Shuyi is?

1075
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,795
What's the matter?

1076
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:28,797
I plan to learn how to swim lately.

1077
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,667
You guys are excellent swimmers.

1078
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,202
I wish to take photos

1079
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,270
of me swimming by the beach.

1080
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,005
Look.

1081
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,210
Why don't we

1082
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,377
catch a baseball match together?

1083
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,346
When I'm free,

1084
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,514
I'll catch a baseball match

1085
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,249
and cheer for the players.

1086
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,184
Swimming.

1087
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,586
Swimming is fine.

1088
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:51,854
Or,

1089
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,589
should we play bowling?

1090
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,390
Shuyi said

1091
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,759
he wants to get a girlfriend.

1092
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,964
A junior of mine has
fancied him for a long time.

1093
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:03,932
That's why...

1094
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:10,205
You and Shuyi are really close lately.

1095
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,240
Are you two

1096
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,441
merely good friends?

1097
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,543
Is that so?

1098
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,512
Yeah.

1099
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,547
Friends.

1100
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:21,016
We're just good friends.

1101
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:24,786
Is that so?

1102
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,395
I love shrimp.

1103
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,530
What about you? Do you like it?

1104
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,864
I do.

1105
01:15:58,921 --> 01:15:59,788
Here you go.

1106
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:02,891
(Why is he appearing in my mind?)

1107
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,527
Shuyi, what do you think
about the food?

1108
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,298
Are you free tomorrow?

1109
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,199
Why don't we catch a movie tomorrow?

1110
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:12,768
The food was great.

1111
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,238
I thought it was great too.

1112
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:16,939
So,

1113
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,974
Shuyi, do you like Korean food?

1114
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,309
I know a great spot.

1115
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,244
Why don't we go there
together next time?

1116
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,812
I'm busy tomorrow.

1117
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,347
I can't join you tomorrow.

1118
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,653
(He gave me no reactions.)

1119
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,957
(Don't tell me
I wasn't proactive enough.)

1120
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,291
Zhou Shuyi!

1121
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,464
Are you sick?

1122
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,100
You look distracted the entire day.

1123
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:50,238
Shuyi.

1124
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:52,975
I...

1125
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,316
No!

1126
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:05,821
That hurts.

1127
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,123
Thank you for your time!

1128
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,400
Am I hallucinating again?

1129
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:23,872
That hurts.

1130
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,140
Wait, you're real?

1131
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,942
What are you doing?

1132
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,310
It's all your fault.

1133
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,611
I sprained my ankle because of you.

1134
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,013
Let me send you to the health center.

1135
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,080
No need for that.

1136
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:34,950
Do you want me to support you
or carry you on my back?

1137
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,784
Pick one.

1138
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:38,720
Just support me.

1139
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:39,921
Support me.

1140
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:49,765
He's not a doctor.

1141
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:56,138
Fine.

1142
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,774
It's my break time anyway.

1143
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:00,809
Who else can you blame
when you sprain the ankle yourself?

1144
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,344
Treat your own injury.

1145
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,112
Where's the bandage?

1146
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:04,913
I'll treat his injury.

1147
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,182
I'm going to get it

1148
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,250
as we ran out of it.

1149
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:10,585
Is it at the warehouse?

1150
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:11,720
Go now.

1151
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,480
What are you looking at?

1152
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:40,716
Seems like

1153
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:42,584
I can rest at ease.

1154
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,389
You're not as good as me.

1155
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,491
You won't attract Shide's attention.

1156
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,959
What do you mean by that?

1157
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,463
Don't you know that men
can fall in love with men?

1158
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:55,530
Kiddo.

1159
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:57,432
So, you...

1160
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:58,500
I can definitely win his heart.

1161
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,137
Keep this a secret.

1162
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,473
I plan to confess next month.

1163
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:06,408
Wish me luck.

1164
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,843
Just you wish!

1165
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,611
Why would I keep your secret?

1166
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:10,712
Just give up.

1167
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,115
Gao Shide said he had a crush on me.

1168
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,257
I guess your secret

1169
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,559
is no longer a secret.

1170
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:35,837
Pei Shouyi.

1171
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:37,672
What's the matter?

1172
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:39,875
Don't go to him.

1173
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,557
Tell him what's on your mind.

1174
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,126
Don't leave any regrets behind.

1175
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:29,558
What are you up to?

1176
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,272
Gao Shide...

1177
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:45,707
We can talk after I'm done
treating your injury.

1178
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,453
I didn't expect myself
to fall for another man.

1179
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,832
I know.

1180
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:20,976
Gao Shide.

1181
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,077
Try and stand up.

1182
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,684
It's much better.

1183
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,154
Thank you.

1184
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,028
Zhou Shuyi.

1185
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,436
Having a crush on you only concerns me.

1186
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,276
It has nothing to do with you.

1187
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,815
Forget what I said.

1188
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,200
♪I never thought that♪

1189
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,620
♪Letting go is more heartbreaking than breaking up♪

1190
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,298
It has nothing to do with me?

1191
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:17,732
You have a crush on me, you know?

1192
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:19,234
How could it have nothing to do with me?

1193
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:38,453
(Silly: our deal is over.)

1194
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:39,988
(I will delete the video.)

1195
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,190
(Thank you for your friendship
while it lasted.)

1196
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,758
"While it lasted?"

1197
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,961
Did I say that I would
sever my ties with you?

1198
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,963
Fine. Let's not be friends then.

1199
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,164
Who cares?

1200
01:23:54,708 --> 01:24:01,417
(Fool. Gao Shide.)

1201
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:26,261
You should find him if you miss him.

1202
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:29,531
Do you think I haven't tried that?

1203
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,301
If so, why didn't you
ask him out directly?

1204
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:34,736
Why should I?

1205
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:38,473
If I do, he'll know that
I'm looking for him.

1206
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,674
It'll be embarrassing.

1207
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:41,910
Are you a kid?

1208
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,012
You traveled around the academy

1209
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,613
just so you could bump into him
by chance, right?

1210
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:47,782
Can't I do so?

1211
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,120
I thought it would be easy to locate
people since we have technology.

1212
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:53,788
Now, I know

1213
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,391
that you can't find anyone
if he wishes to hide.

1214
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,761
How did he manage to find me
before this?

1215
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,996
We majored in different courses.

1216
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,698
Even so, I bumped into him every day.

1217
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:08,236
Now that you mentioned it,
I remember something.

1218
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,939
He's always by your side
no matter where you go.

1219
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:14,375
He must be a stalker.

1220
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,477
He's out of his mind.

1221
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:23,985
Zhengwen told me

1222
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,754
that you had feelings for me
before this, right?

1223
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,190
It's all in the past now.

1224
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,161
However, did you realize something?

1225
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,230
The one who always stays by your side

1226
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,097
is Gao Shide.

1227
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:39,767
Shuyi,

1228
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:42,537
did you fall for him?

1229
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,011
Do the thing you're supposed to.

1230
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:52,080
Good luck.

1231
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,635
(Yi: Gao Shide, what are you doing?)

1232
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,537
(Why couldn't I find you
no matter where I went?)

1233
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:21,509
Gao Shide!

1234
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,012
So, you were avoiding me, huh?

1235
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,414
Are you tired of stalking me around now?

1236
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:31,052
I deleted the video.

1237
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,187
You can check my phone
if you don't trust me.

1238
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,523
You threatened me with the video

1239
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,358
and coerced me into being your attendant

1240
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,360
because you were worried about me
after falling out of love.

1241
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:45,466
You said the deal would be over
as long as I defeat you once

1242
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:48,503
in order to shift
my attention away, right?

1243
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:50,171
I'm not as good as you think.

1244
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:52,807
I'm selfish too.

1245
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,511
I did so to close the gap between us.

1246
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,880
At least we can be friends
before graduating.

1247
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:00,982
Are you a fool?

1248
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,150
You only want to be friends?

1249
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,052
Didn't you treat Jiang Yuxin
and Fang Zhengwen the same way?

1250
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,259
If there's nothing else,
I'll make a move first.

1251
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,063
Does your luck still belong to me?

1252
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,504
When we were in the health center,

1253
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:25,373
I said the person whom
you had a crush on is lucky.

1254
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,443
When I was asleep, you said

1255
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,511
that your luck has always been with me.

1256
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,882
Is it still mine now?

1257
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:37,885
Answer me.

1258
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:39,520
Is it still mine?

1259
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,557
It doesn't matter now.

1260
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,127
Gao Shide, I'm serious.

1261
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,462
Stop messing around.

1262
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:05,546
Zhou Shuyi,

1263
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:07,708
I'll get angry
if you keep being like this.

1264
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,817
I should be the one
getting angry instead.

1265
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:11,653
Does your luck still belong to me?

1266
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,321
Or were you just joking?

1267
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:14,922
Zhou Shuyi, what do you want?

1268
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:16,524
Because I like you!

1269
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:28,736
What about Jiang Yuxin then?

1270
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,238
Didn't you say you wouldn't
fall for another man?

1271
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:31,406
It's you.

1272
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:33,941
I have to fall for you
whether I like it or not.

1273
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,016
You don't trust me?

1274
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,251
Fine.

1275
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:45,853
What are you doing?

1276
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,588
Since you don't trust me,

1277
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,157
I can only prove it with my actions.

1278
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,059
You'll trust me
once I discard this, right?

1279
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:53,728
Discarding your lucky charm
doesn't mean anything.

1280
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:58,966
I,

1281
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:02,770
Zhou Shuyi, like Gao Shide!

1282
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,840
I like him the most!

1283
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:08,076
I like him so much!

1284
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:12,680

1339
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,251
from America.

1340
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:03,878
So,

1341
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:06,180
why are you heading to America?

1342
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,949
My mother is remarrying.

1343
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:09,684
Her partner is an American.

1344
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,620
She'll move to America
after the wedding.

1345
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,055
I need to attend her wedding

1346
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:15,856
and assess

1347
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:18,125
her relationship with my stepfather.

1348
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:21,028
I'll use that chance to establish
a connection with him too.

1349
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:22,263
After all,

1350
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:23,664
we'll be a family in the future.

1351
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,300
Oh.

1352
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,937
You're my family too.

1353
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,408
Any other questions?

1354
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:35,943
How long will you be away?

1355
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:38,646
Maybe a few months.

1356
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,285
I never expected you to sulk

1357
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,320
about it even though
it's only a few months.

1358
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,960
Do you like me that much?

1359
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,495
Go away.

1360
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:56,263
Come to my place tonight.

1361
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:57,231
No.

1362
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:59,367
My mother wants to know you better.

1363
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:00,635
You should tell me this first.

1364
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,003
What's your answer?

1365
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,170
Okay.

1366
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:21,288

1367
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:28,829
This is a nice place.

1368
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:32,767
What?

1369
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:42,877
My mother and I saw this
when we were shopping.

1370
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,445
We thought it's suitable for you.

1371
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,617
You're not allowed to take it off.

1372
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:58,659
Not even when I take a bath?

1373
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:00,127

1374
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:03,664

1375
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:04,865
I'll make an exception for that.

1376

In the future, you can only wear
the things I buy for you.

1377

You're not allowed
to wear anything else.

1379
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,477
