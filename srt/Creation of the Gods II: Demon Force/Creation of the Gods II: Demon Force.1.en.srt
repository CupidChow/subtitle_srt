and "King Wu's War Against Zhou"

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,500
We've carried Yin Jiao here.

3
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,917
Save him if possible.
If not, say so.

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,583
Don't waste time!

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,708
Nezha...

6
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,125
Mind your manners.

7
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,500
We arrived too late...

8
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,875
to save him.

9
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,792
Mortals cannot be resurrected.

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,792
Such is the law of Heaven.

11
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,792
Yin Jiao is dead...

12
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,500
Saving him would defy the will of heaven.

13
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,250
Going against this law

14
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,583
will cause disasters.

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,750
Reconsider, Grand Master.

16
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,292
Show me.

17
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,917
Yin Jiao, you fled
without even a fight.

18
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,000
You disappoint me so much.

19
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,625
I'll bring Father back
to reunite our family.

20
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,125
What is she doing here?

21
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,250
Get out!

22
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,542
I am willing to sacrifice myself for you.

23
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:22,333
You are so eager
to take my throne.

24
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,125
Strange. Yin Jiao is dead,

25
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,375
but his life energy persists...

26
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,042
Even the Investiture of the Gods
couldn't absorb it.

27
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,292
You really want to kill me!

28
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,958
Father, it was an accident.

29
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,000
I wanted to eliminate that demon...

30
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,458
He will be executed tomorrow.

31
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,750
You gave me life.

32
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,000
Yin Jiao's life energy
is imbued with hatred...

33
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,458
He refuses to disappear.

34
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,750
It's a bad omen.

35
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,833
Resurrecting such a mortal

36
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:54,208
with so much resentment
would be disastrous.

37
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,667
Ziya is convinced that Yin Jiao
will become the King of the Earth...

38
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,750
The only one capable of opening
The Investiture of the Gods.

39
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,500
The Divine Curse is already striking.

40
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,833
Yin Jiao is as much

41
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,292
mortals' last hope

42
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,750
as ours.

43
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,083
Gather around!

44
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,583
Watch out, he's absorbing our powers!

45
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,333
Stop immediately!

46
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,875
It's impossible to stop!

47
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,125
We're trapped in the formation...

48
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,125
It's absorbing faster and faster.

49
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,583
If this continues,

50
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,583
it will exhaust our strength!

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,708
Grand Master,
he has absorbed all your power...

52
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,708
We may have
offended the Heavens...

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,792
Wen Zhong,
Grand Commander of the Shang...

54
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:35,000
after ten years of bitter struggle,

55
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:40,500
finally returns victorious to the capital !

56
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,458
Your Majesty, I fought for you
in the North Sea

57
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,250
For ten years of struggle,
thus fulfilling my duty.

58
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,417
Today I present you
with my Commander's insignia.

59
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,667
Your Majesty, I fought for you
in the North Sea

60
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,792
during ten years of struggle,
thus fulfilling my duty.

61
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,792
I present to you today
my Commander's insignia.

62
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,958
Ji Fa, son of the Duke of the West Ji Chang,
attempted to assassinate His Majesty

63
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,833
and took refuge in Xiqi.

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,667
His Majesty, dying,

65
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,208
regrets that he cannot
lead the army himself...

66
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,917
Grand Commander, we ask you
to conquer Xiqi.

67
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,542
I was a devoted servant
of the late king.

68
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,000
His late Majesty has passed away,

69
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,042
and I am too old to be of use.

70
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:14,250
I therefore request my retirement.

71
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,667
Since the Grand Commander
no longer wishes to serve,

72
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,792
His Majesty cannot force you to do so.

73
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,707
It seems the fate of the Shang Dynasty is coming to an end.

74
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:36,957
His Majesty lives on,

75
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,957
but the Great Shang Dynasty...

76
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:40,707
is already doomed.

77
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,750
I, Deng Chanyu, request to conquer traitors
in the name of Your Majesty

78
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,375
My late father, Deng Jiugong,
dedicated his life to war

79
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,583
and died for our kingdom.

80
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,667
I have fought alongside him
since I was a child.

81
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,208
I wish to follow in his footsteps

82
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,000
and restore the glory
of the Great Shang Dynasty.

83
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,792
His Majesty wishes to speak with you. Come closer.

84
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,458
I'm leaving today
with eight hundred cavalry

85
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,667
and the Four Magic Generals.

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,792
If I don't capture the traitor Ji Fa,

87
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,458
I will give my life
to atone for this failure.

88
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,917
I offer you armor.

89
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,458
Go ahead...

90
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:03,875
Fight for your deceased father,
for me...

91
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,583
and for the Great Shang Dynasty.

92
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,208
Ji Chang, death came upon you too easily.

93
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:49,667
How lucky!

94
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,875
not to see the people of Xiqi

95
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,375
being massacred, one by one,

96
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,333
by His Majesty.

97
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,583
All this, thanks to your upbringing,

98
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,083
which produced a regicide rebel.

99
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,208
Ji Fa...

100
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,875
Do you really believe
His Majesty is dead?

101
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,292
I killed him with my own hands,

102
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,125
and I saw him die.

103
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,167
Ji Fa...

104
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,208
Do you remember this box?

105
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,167
This box...

106
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,417
contained the head of the traitor Su Hu.

107
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,083
And this sword?

108
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,292
This is the sword of the Ghost Duke of Yin Jiao.

109
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,125
It's this same sword

110
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,083
that beheaded Yin Jiao.

111
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,750
Do you see now

112
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,458
His Majesty's intentions?

113
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,292
Yin Shou wants my head.

114
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,208
His Majesty, in his mercy,

115
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,292
grants you one last gift.

116
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,917
If only you, Ji Fa,
commit suicide to atone for your sins,

117
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,208
His Majesty will spare Xiqi.

118
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,667
The Shang army is already advancing.

119
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,500
So, will you die alone?

120
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,625
Or will you drag Xiqi

121
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:19,792
down with you?

122
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,375
I'll cut off your head right here!

123
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,458
Wait!

124
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,458
Let him go.

125
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,417
These Xiqi boatmen

126
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,750
are working with enthusiasm.

127
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,667
If they knew

128
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,500
that we were coming to kill them,
would they still smile?

129
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,125
A female general!

130
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,083
There is a girl with a dreaming heart

131
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,208
On a river, peaceful and wide

132
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,625
Why not sail, as lovers?

133
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:09,208
Carried together by the wind?

134
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,542
How dare you sing
such vulgarities in front of the General?

135
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,333
You're looking for death!

136
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,208
Let them sing.

137
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,042
Louder.

138
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,375
You heard the General.

139
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,500
Louder!

140
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,083
General, wait.

141
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,958
I am Ji Fa, Lord of Xiqi.

142
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,042
We welcome you...

143
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,958
into our trap!

144
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,417
Help me!

145
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,458
Let's go!

146
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,167
Follow me.

147
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,167
This is a good spot for an ambush.

148
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,667
Only one of the giants
followed us.

149
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,542
Should we wait for the other three?

150
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,750
Go down and surrender!

151
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,208
You should surrender.

152
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,458
Mo Liqing!

153
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,083
Let go!

154
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,042
Show the power
of the Cloud Sword!

155
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,333
Arrows!

156
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,292
Leave me. Leave quickly!

157
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,833
Fall back to Xiqi!

158
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,792
General Deng!

159
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:59,583
General Deng!

160
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,333
With so little skill,
you dare rebel?

161
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,792
Do you know what Yin Shou did?

162
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,875
How dare you speak
the king's name?

163
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:12,708
Yin Shou

164
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,875
killed his father and brother,

165
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,708
and usurped the throne.

166
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,750
He followed Daji, the fox demon

167
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,833
and had Queen Jiang,

168
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,125
the High Priest,
and the Crown Prince assassinated.

169
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:26,458
He falsely accused the Four Dukes,
sentenced them to death.

170
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,458
He even ordered to have my older brother...

171
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,833
served as a meal to my father!

172
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,917
If you were in my place,

173
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,667
wouldn't you rebel?

174
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,292
Why believe a traitor?

175
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,000
Behind you!

176
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,542
Watch out!

177
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,042
Untie me quickly!

178
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,083
I can help you!

179
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,917
Shut up!

180
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,000
Watch out!

181
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,292
Get out of the way quickly!

182
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,667
You, get out!

183
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,667
Shining Stone, come back!

184
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,000
Come back and bite the bait
when you're older.

185
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,875
Shen Gongbao,

186
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,292
with your miserable crows,

187
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,125
do you think you can find me?

188
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:20,750
Help! Yang Jian! Nezha!
Come quickly!

189
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:29,000
What are you doing here?

190
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:30,875
My pants!

191
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,167
They're falling off!

192
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,792
Easy!

193
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,750
Save some!

194
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,542
Otherwise, we'll drop dead!

195
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,958
Yin Jiao has been beheaded.

196
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,500
I didn't know your father...

197
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:01,917
We have to get out of here...

198
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,167
It's too dangerous.

199
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,167
What?

200
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,833
Has the war already spread to Xiqi?

201
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,125
I ordered the civilians

202
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,250
to abandon Xiqi

203
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,625
and retreat to the heart of Mount Qi.

204
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:20,458
I will take men
to slow down the Shang army.

205
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,542
Abandon Xiqi?

206
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,542
You are Its lord...

207
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,708
Do you really intend to cede It to Yin Shou?

208
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,042
Xiqi hasn't seen war
for centuries...

209
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,917
We can't compete
with the Shang.

210
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,958
I just faced them

211
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,750
and I saw no chance of victory.

212
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,667
I no longer deserve to be their leader.

213
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I see.

214
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,042
I have an idea

215
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,625
that would solve Xiqi's problems...

216
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,625
Listen:

217
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:07,917
deliver me, along with
The Investiture of the Gods, to Yin Shou.

218
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,417
He'll be so pleased...

219
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,000
that he'll spare Xiqi.

220
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:15,208
You could even
get an official position!

221
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:16,833
You...

222
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:22,458
Must not let The Investiture of the Gods
fall into the hands of Yin Shou!

223
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,417
You're not so stupid after all.

224
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,292
If Xiqi falls,
no one will stop Yin Shou.

225
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,208
He will become the Earth King.

226
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,708
It's me that Yin Shou wants.

227
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,708
It's between him and me.

228
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,625
My family is already dead
because of me,

229
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:56,167
and Xiqi has become
a battlefield...

230
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,917
I don't want to cause any more deaths.

231
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:04,042
It was Yin Shou who killed them.

232
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,292
Not you.

233
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,667
If you die,

234
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,833
the world will be his.

235
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,792
Your guilt could die with you.

236
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:18,833
But what will happen to the living?

237
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,625
If you can die of shame,

238
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:27,458
can't you live for your people?

239
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,250
Oh no...

240
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,750
Here's an even bigger one!

241
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:27,375
His Majesty presents Yin Qi,

242
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,875
Crown Prince,

243
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,833
and pray to our ancestors

244
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,625
to bless

245
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,792
the Great Shang Dynasty,

246
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,000
so that it may prosper forever.

247
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,958
Assassin!

248
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,542
Protect the Crown Prince!

249
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:17,958
Father!

250
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,042
Father!

251
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,750
Help me!

252
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,042
Father!

253
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,000
Yin Shou.

254
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,708
Help me!

255
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,167
Help me!

256
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,208
Help me!

257
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:41,792
Don't be afraid...

258
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,375
It was just a dream.

259
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,667
I'll never forget

260
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:54,167
the smell of burning flesh.

261
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,333
Them,

262
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,292
we killed them.

263
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,833
They'll never hurt you again.

264
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,167
I thought that

265
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,542
becoming king

266
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,208
would allow me
to control my destiny...

267
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,042
But I didn't think that

268
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,750
Heaven would be so unfair.

269
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,917
As long as I'm here,

270
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,542
Your Majesty will not die.

271
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,125
Your Majesty

272
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,583
will reign for a long time to come.

273
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,417
What's going on?

274
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,167
I'm using a spell

275
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:52,583
to transfer your injuries
to my body.

276
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,875
In just 49 days,

277
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,917
you will be fully recovered.

278
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,125
Why are you doing this?

279
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,250
You're going to die.

280
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,125
You can possess another body, right?

281
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,208
Tell me which one you want,
I'll kill it for you.

282
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,208
Your Majesty...

283
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,583
Congratulations, Your Majesty...

284
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,333
The Investiture of the Gods has been found.

285
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,000
Where is it?

286
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,500
With Jiang Ziya,

287
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,333
hiding in Xiqi.

288
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,917
Xiqi again!

289
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,750
You can't go...

290
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,458
You haven't recovered yet.

291
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,500
You'd succumb

292
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,792
before you even arrive.

293
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:11,667
The Investiture of the Gods
is the most priority!

294
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,792
- What are they...
- Look...

295
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,417
The people of Xiqi haven't given up.

296
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,667
Strike!

297
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:42,833
Push!

298
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:46,917
Strike again!

299
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,292
Look, it's the Lord!

300
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,083
Our Lord has returned!

301
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,542
Our Lord has returned!

302
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,125
I knew you would return.

303
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,000
My lord...

304
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,167
Xiqi is saved!

305
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,500
Xiqi is saved!

306
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,125
My lord...

307
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,833
We thought
we would never see you again.

308
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,417
Why not take refuge
on Mount Qi?

309
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,125
Xiqi has decided to fight
alongside you to the death.

310
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:36,417
To the death!

311
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,667
It's me that Yin Shou wants.

312
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,167
I refuse to let you die
because of me.

313
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:49,667
My son...

314
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,125
You're wrong.

315
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:55,958
We're doing this for ourselves,

316
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,458
not for you.

317
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,833
Xiqi is your home,

318
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,917
but it's also ours.

319
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,292
Let's protect Xiqi!

320
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:15,625
Sir...

321
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:17,958
Are you an immortal?

322
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,000
I was.

323
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,667
They're fast.

324
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,875
These warrior giants are powerful.

325
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,167
Master, do you still know how
to cast spells?

326
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,750
Before, yes.

327
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,417
And now?

328
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,042
I'm just fishing.

329
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,083
The army is approaching...

330
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,542
What good is fishing for?

331
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,167
Well, I don't see an army...

332
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,917
Just a big fish.

333
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:27,208
Sir, when is
the best time for fishing?

334
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,292
Nighttime is ideal.

335
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,958
You remind me

336
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:58,292
of my late father...

337
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,208
That saddens me.

338
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,917
I resigned,

339
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,875
I am no longer the Grand Commander.

340
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,000
That's true...

341
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,500
You are no longer the Grand Commander.

342
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,167
If I die in battle,

343
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,167
I want you to become king.

344
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,458
If I can't protect his kingdom,

345
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,792
I can at least

346
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:56,875
entrust it

347
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,875
to the person he
trusted most.

348
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,417
Why do you say that, Your Majesty?

349
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:12,125
The Investiture of the Gods is in Xiqi.

350
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,625
To lift the Divine Curse

351
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:16,708
and preserve the Shang Dynasty,

352
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:20,042
I must go there myself
and retrieve the Investiture of the Gods.

353
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,667
Can the Investiture of the Gods

354
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:30,042
really lift
the Divine Curse?

355
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,292
Mo Liqing!

356
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:14,500
Come back!

357
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:39,917
Quickly.

358
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:58,917
General...

359
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,875
Report.

360
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,417
Xiqi has just attacked our camp
and wreaked havoc.

361
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:19,000
Order them

362
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,750
to hold their positions.

363
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:27,958
Go.

364
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:30,917
Yes, General.

365
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:37,833
Water!

366
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,375
Untie the horses!

367
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:44,833
Move forward!

368
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Mo Lihai,

369
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:15,958
come back here!

370
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,708
Weren't you ordered to
hold your position?

371
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:25,000
A huge green bird
stole Mo Liqing's sword.

372
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,417
The four giants
went after him.

373
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:31,417
Do you want me to bring them back?

374
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,458
No.

375
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,875
Immediately reinforce

376
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,500
- the camp's defenses.
- Yes, General.

377
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:06,792
Unleash!

378
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:48,875
Land!

379
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,292
Master,

380
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:02,292
Your fishing technique
really worked.

381
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:04,875
What a shame...

382
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,750
You only caught a small fish.

383
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,708
Does it look like a small fish?

384
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,875
The real big fish is Deng Chanyu.

385
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,500
And where is she?

386
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:23,000
We'll target the bandit leader first...

387
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,750
The plan was to distract the four giants, sow chaos,

388
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,250
and capture Deng Chanyu.

389
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:30,458
Mo Liqing killed our brother Taidian...

390
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,542
We wanted to avenge him!

391
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,708
What are your priorities!

392
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,000
This opportunity won't
come again!

393
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:42,958
As commander,

394
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,875
you let this chance slip away!

395
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,667
At dawn,

396
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:00,083
it will be a bloody battle.

397
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,250
We killed Mo Liqing,

398
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,333
the other three
will be more difficult.

399
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:06,625
If we can kill Mo Liqing,

400
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,625
we can eliminate them all.

401
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,458
General, last night raid of Xiqi
boosted their morale...

402
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,375
If we attack now...

403
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:53,792
We never settle
for small victories like they do!

404
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,292
Little Ji Fa doesn't know how to lead.

405
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,333
I'll teach him a lesson.

406
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,792
Attack!

407
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,375
Fire!

408
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,583
What is it?

409
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,667
This is Mo Lihong's Umbrella of Chaos.

410
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:30,708
Fall back!

411
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:33,125
Retreat!

412
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,917
Quick!

413
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:13,750
This is the Lute of Wind and Fire,
and the Umbrella of Chaos.

414
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:15,667
Watch out!

415
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:24,083
Attack!

416
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,958
Lei Zhenzi!

417
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,875
Raise the drawbridge!

418
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,375
Wait!

419
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:18,625
Raise the drawbridge!

420
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,583
Quick!

421
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,250
Attack!

422
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,125
Today,

423
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,167
we will destroy Xiqi!

424
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,417
Don't let them in!

425
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:58,083
They've got a weasel that's going to
get underneath!

426
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:35,875
Fall back!

427
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:06,042
What is this monster?

428
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:11,833
Could it be...

429
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,167
Who else?

430
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:20,208
Yin Jiao has taken on the powers of the Heavens
and taken this form.

431
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,208
Go help Yin Jiao!

432
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:10,917
Master, don't worry
they can't hurt him.

433
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:12,667
He has more than one trick up his sleeve.

434
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,125
Xiqi is saved!

435
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:16,667
The world is saved!

436
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:22,458
Don't move!

437
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,333
Immortals
must not kill!

438
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,792
You're finally awake!

439
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,250
Where is my armor?

440
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,333
I took it off.

441
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:19,583
Otherwise,

442
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,083
you would have drowned.

443
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:25,625
I saved your life...

444
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,042
In return, I have a favor
to ask of you.

445
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:05,583
Tie me up.

446
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,208
I surrender.

447
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,417
Why?

448
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,042
You haven't lost yet...

449
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:19,542
I followed Yin Shou,

450
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:22,167
and I destroyed the city of Jizhou...

451
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:27,667
I destroyed someone's house myself.

452
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:31,458
And now they're going to destroy my house.

453
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:36,958
I don't want it
to become another Jizhou.

454
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:40,875
I did my best...

455
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,917
If my sword can no longer protect Xiqi,

456
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,917
I have nothing left but my life to offer...

457
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:52,750
Well done, General Deng...
attacking from behind, how brave.

458
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:54,542
Don't tire yourself out.

459
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,125
You won't escape me.

460
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,042
Don't worry.
I won't run away again.

461
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,083
Only my surrender

462
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:05,958
can save Xiqi.

463
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:08,958
You should have surrendered sooner...

464
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,833
There would have been fewer deaths.

465
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,667
They died for their home.

466
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,542
Don't you have a home?

467
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,208
I grew up
on the battlefields...

468
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,458
I have no home.

469
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,958
But you don't have any family?

470
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:42,042
I'm the last vestige of it.

471
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,708
One day, like my father,

472
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,500
I will die fighting,

473
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,000
to honor my family.

474
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:56,500
It seems that...

475
01:02:58,333 --> 01:02:59,750
it was for our families.

476
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:08,167
But do you know
what makes us different?

477
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,708
I won,

478
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,792
- and you lost.
- No.

479
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,792
I fight for the living,

480
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,375
and you...

481
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:25,500
for the dead.

482
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:10,500
Eat.

483
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,708
Is it good?

484
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,958
Have some more.

485
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:51,917
My life force is almost exhausted...

486
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,000
I'm trapped in this body

487
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:04,958
in agony.

488
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:19,667
I fought for the Shang

489
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:21,417
all my life...

490
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,750
How can I bear to see

491
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:28,042
its destruction before my death?

492
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:39,917
It's General Deng!

493
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:44,125
General,
we have finally found you!

494
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:49,375
The Shang army has crossed
the Yellow River to join us.

495
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,417
I myself led the army here...

496
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:33,042
Without fighting
or firing a single arrow,

497
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,292
Ji Fa,

498
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,833
you dare surrender and plead guilty.

499
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,583
I'm not guilty...

500
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,458
I just accept my defeat.

501
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,333
Yin Shou wants me...

502
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:46,708
Withdraw your troops,
I'll follow you to the capital.

503
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:49,500
You're in no position
to negotiate with me.

504
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,500
Xiqi rebelled,

505
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,042
It must be destroyed...

506
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:55,375
to restore Shang rule.

507
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:58,042
Grand Commander,
why did Xiqi rebel?

508
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,708
Don't you know?

509
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,708
Loyalty has no strings attached...

510
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:06,250
Only traitors
look for excuses.

511
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,417
They say that

512
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,250
you are known for being just and

513
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,707
can discern right from wrong.

514
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:21,917
And yet,

515
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,500
you have become Yin Shou's dog.

516
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:28,625
Don't move.

517
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:30,000
On your knees.

518
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:32,707
In order to serve the Shang loyally,

519
01:08:33,457 --> 01:08:35,792
being his dog doesn't bother me.

520
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:42,457
Grand Commander,

521
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,750
Since Ji Fa has surrendered,

522
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,375
why do you insist
on attacking Xiqi?

523
01:08:51,082 --> 01:08:52,292
This,

524
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:53,875
is for your father.

525
01:08:54,707 --> 01:08:55,792
Your campaign

526
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:59,292
was a failure
that shames me.

527
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:01,542
You have tarnished your name.

528
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:05,250
And instead of trying to wash away this shame,
you dare to defend it!

529
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:11,125
My father used to say

530
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:15,250
that massacring civilians

531
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:18,875
is a soldier's greatest shame.

532
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:20,167
How dare you!

533
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:23,082
Exterminate Xiqi. No mercy.

534
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:25,332
These are His Majesty's orders.

535
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:29,500
General,

536
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,167
This is an excellent opportunity...

537
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:37,125
To honor the Deng family,
be ruthless.

538
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:38,207
Shut up!

539
01:09:40,707 --> 01:09:43,582
When did you see my father
massacre innocents?

540
01:09:47,457 --> 01:09:49,042
My sword can kill enemies,

541
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,500
but never civilians.

542
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,042
Follow me.

543
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,000
- Who goes there?
- Get out...

544
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,875
Stop them!

545
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:45,958
Close the doors!

546
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,333
Close the doors!

547
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,500
General Deng!

548
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,792
Why did you save me?

549
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,208
A life for a life...

550
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:06,875
We're even.

551
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,083
Stop.

552
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,167
Ji Fa, both of you leave.

553
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,458
How dare you, Wen Zhong,

554
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:20,083
Seeing me,

555
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,958
not bow down?

556
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,125
Crown Prince?

557
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:29,500
Yes, I am the descendant
of the Shang royal line,

558
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:33,708
Crown Prince Yin Jiao!

559
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:36,167
How did you become like this?

560
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:40,792
Don't you know

561
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,000
that Yin Shou killed me?

562
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:46,875
He killed his father and brother,

563
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:49,000
as well as his wife and son...

564
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:50,625
conspired with a fox demon

565
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:52,083
to usurp the throne.

566
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,417
And you continue to fight for him!

567
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:00,250
I fight for the Shang.

568
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:04,500
I am the Crown Prince of the Shang.
Kneel down.

569
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,125
And swear loyalty to me.

570
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:09,583
You may be the Crown Prince,
but Yin Shou is the king.

571
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:12,417
If I follow his orders and kill you,

572
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,708
I become blindly loyal.

573
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,958
If I swear loyalty to you and
turn against him,

574
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,917
it will be treason.

575
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:24,042
I would rather be blindly loyal
than a traitor.

576
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,083
You crazy old man!

577
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,917
You only care about your reputation!

578
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,958
You're not blindly loyal,

579
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:36,458
You're stupid.

580
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,250
For now, I'll spare you...

581
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,208
Go back to Yin Shou and tell him

582
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:45,667
that his son is back.

583
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:48,208
If you dare set foot in Xiqi again,

584
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,167
I'll kill you.

585
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:09,958
You're home.

586
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:15,833
If you free me,
you'll become like me,

587
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,875
a traitor in the eyes of the Shang.

588
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,125
My only regret is...

589
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:32,625
not having fallen
with my father...

590
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,500
You still have the opportunity

591
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:48,333
to die in battle
alongside your family.

592
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,958
Open the door!

593
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,750
My lord!

594
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:02,333
Our Lord has returned!

595
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,042
My Lord!

596
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,458
My Lord!

597
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:15,000
General Deng is not
an enemy. She saved me.

598
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,042
Thank you for escorting Ji Fa here.

599
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:23,792
Now that he's home,

600
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:26,500
We'll take care of him.

601
01:15:27,792 --> 01:15:28,958
You can go.

602
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:43,042
She's my guest.

603
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,000
We are at war...

604
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:50,125
Perhaps it's not appropriate

605
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,333
for General Deng to remain in Xiqi.

606
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:54,833
She has no refuge.

607
01:15:57,667 --> 01:16:00,875
If we abandon her now,
it's like sending her to her death.

608
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,542
Ji Fa...

609
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,708
Do you still recognize me?

610
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:38,708
Yin Jiao!

611
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,875
Do you remember who you are?

612
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:48,917
Yes.

613
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,750
I'm Yin Jiao.

614
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:54,250
And who is Yin Jiao?

615
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,292
Yin Jiao

616
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:00,083
descendant of the royal line
of Shang,

617
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,875
and Crown Prince.

618
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,000
But my father killed me.

619
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,417
And not just me...

620
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:13,167
He also killed my mother.

621
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:16,750
This hatred burning within you

622
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:19,542
prevented your soul from
disappearing after your death.

623
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:22,250
You absorbed my powers

624
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,667
and you became
what you are today.

625
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,750
You must learn to control your anger,

626
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:31,542
otherwise, one day,

627
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:34,042
this anger will control you.

628
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,208
At that moment,

629
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:38,417
you won't be yourself anymore.

630
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,917
I'd rather stay angry...

631
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:47,250
I want revenge on Yin Shou.

632
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:55,542
Jiang Ziya asked us to save you,
so that you can return to the mortal world.

633
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,500
and become the King of the Earth.

634
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:00,792
You must open the Investiture of the Gods
to save humanity.

635
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:04,500
For this, he sacrificed his powers

636
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:06,500
and became a mere mortal again.

637
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,208
You are humanity's last hope...

638
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,375
I hope you don't disappoint him.

639
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm going to the capital

640
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:16,667
to kill Yin Shou

641
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:19,875
and avenge my mother and myself.

642
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,167
You must not go alone.

643
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:26,708
Otherwise, you will perish.

644
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:29,542
Remember...

645
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:34,208
Jiang Ziya is in Xiqi,
where he's supporting your friend Ji Fa.

646
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:37,750
They need you now.

647
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:54,042
I never imagined

648
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,958
I'd see that sword in your hands again.

649
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,917
Now that you're home,

650
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:04,792
It's rightfully yours.

651
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,250
If one day

652
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:12,833
I forget who I am...

653
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:22,500
show me this sword

654
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:24,833
to remind me

655
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:28,125
that it once beheaded me.

656
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:38,292
Weapons in hand,

657
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,958
to conquer the world...

658
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:48,458
I sharpen my spear.

659
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:52,167
We fight together again.

660
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,167
Ji Fa,

661
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,167
I envy you so much...

662
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,417
You fight for your family,

663
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:10,625
while I

664
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,583
my family is made up of...

665
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,583
nothing but enemies.

666
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:29,292
Don't worry,

667
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:32,083
once Wen Zhong is defeated,

668
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,500
we will rally the Dukes
and march on the capital...

669
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,125
I will take this same sword

670
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,292
to kill Yin Shou

671
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:44,083
and avenge you.

672
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,042
No...

673
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,042
I want to kill him with my own hands.

674
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:16,917
Don't come any closer!

675
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,250
I don't want you to see me like this.

676
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:28,958
Every wound on your body
comes from me...

677
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,250
You suffer in my place.

678
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,458
Your Majesty can choose

679
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,667
a younger

680
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,042
and more beautiful woman

681
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,833
to accompany you.

682
01:21:58,458 --> 01:21:59,958
You are unique...

683
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,458
and irreplaceable.

684
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:24,792
They will only remember
your beauty.

685
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Your Majesty,

686
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,167
an urgent message from the Commander.

687
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,667
Read it.

688
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,375
Does he have the Investiture of the Gods?

689
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:45,167
The Grand Commander says that
Yin Jiao is still alive.

690
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,083
He also says that

691
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,667
Yin Jiao is Your Majesty's only son.

692
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:54,875
When Your Majesty is no more, the
Shang Dynasty must have an heir.

693
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,042
He hopes Your Majesty
will pardon Yin Jiao

694
01:22:58,917 --> 01:23:01,625
and reinstate him as Crown Prince.

695
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:15,708
Very well.

696
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,667
Tell Wen Zhong that

697
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:21,000
as long as he destroys Xiqi

698
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:23,042
and seizes the Investiture of the Gods

699
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:25,000
I will do what he asks.

700
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:29,750
Come on, quickly!

701
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,458
Why forgive him?

702
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,667
Don't forget Ji Fa's father's prophecy.

703
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:50,167
My best troops are
under Wen Zhong's command...

704
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,542
I must appease him first.

705
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:57,458
With The Investiture of the Gods,

706
01:23:58,042 --> 01:24:00,792
there will always be time to eliminate him.

707
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:27,500
Shen Gongbao...

708
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,083
You dare to show yourself

709
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:33,333
without the Investiture of the Gods!

710
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,250
That Kunlun monk is truly treacherous,

711
01:24:37,417 --> 01:24:40,708
but I have discovered his lair.

712
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:43,792
Master, grant me another relic

713
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:47,958
and a chance to redeem myself.

714
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:10,167
My long exile is coming to an end.

715
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,292
Take this flask...

716
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,958
It will be useful to you.

717
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,958
It contains the Curse
of the Deathlarvae,

718
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:22,042
which transforms humans
into soldiers Undead

719
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:24,625
Completely under your control.

720
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:35,917
Come on!

721
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:37,667
Hurry up!

722
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:40,125
Quick!

723
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:41,125
Come on!

724
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,500
His Majesty finally forgive us!

725
01:25:47,667 --> 01:25:49,292
Your brothers in arms,

726
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:56,458
Yin Jiao, Ji Fa, Jiang Wenhuan, E Shun,

727
01:25:56,875 --> 01:25:59,583
all betrayed me, one by one.

728
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:02,708
I locked you in the dungeon

729
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,583
to test your loyalty.

730
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:11,667
Today, I offer you a chance...

731
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:16,208
Are you ready to
demonstrate your loyalty?

732
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:18,708
Loyalty until death!

733
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,292
Are you ready to prove it
at the cost of your lives?

734
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:23,667
We are!

735
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,333
The power of Kunlun is nothing

736
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,542
compared to the

737
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:42,667
witchcraft of Golden Turtle Island!

738
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,000
These soldiers

739
01:27:58,167 --> 01:27:59,542
feel neither emotion

740
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,208
nor fear.

741
01:28:03,167 --> 01:28:05,208
They know only one thing:

742
01:28:06,292 --> 01:28:08,167
absolute obedience.

743
01:28:29,792 --> 01:28:32,625
- How old is this alcohol?

744
01:28:32,792 --> 01:28:33,875
Then let's drink it all!

745
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,833
Let's drink it all!

746
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:39,042
Oh no...

747
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:41,583
Don't drink it all!

748
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,125
Save some.

749
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,125
Tonight, let's drink until we can't drink anymore!

750
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:54,250
My lord,
he's almost emptied the warehouse!

751
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:56,125
Tonight, alcohol

752
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:57,958
must be plentiful!

753
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,042
Not only
to celebrate our victory...

754
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,833
But above all,
because Yin Jiao is back.

755
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,708
My brother is back.

756
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:08,625
The future Earth King is back!

757
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:11,125
Drink!

758
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Cheers!

759
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:19,417
Don't look so glum...

760
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:20,708
Be cheerful.

761
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:26,417
Let's drink!

762
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:29,625
- Cheers!
- To you, Monsignor

763
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,583
Thank you.

764
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:28,125
Tonight, we drink
to our victory...

765
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:31,750
So, when

766
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:34,750
will we raise our glasses
to your wedding?

767
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:37,792
Let's toast the happy couple!

768
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:55,125
We Immortals
aren't allowed to drink.

769
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,833
Watch out!

770
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:05,125
A kiss!

771
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:15,708
Look...

772
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,250
This is the life
everyone should have.

773
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:29,708
I'll help Ji Fa,

774
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:31,708
protect Xiqi,

775
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:33,833
and defeat Wen Zhong.

776
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:38,833
I know,

777
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:41,958
you want to kill Yin Shou right away.

778
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:44,500
But you mustn't go to the capital alone.

779
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,583
You should gather the people

780
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:52,083
and follow the will of Heaven,
as well as that of the people.

781
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,750
Launch an appeal

782
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:55,292
and gather their support...

783
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:58,458
Conquer the capital
and punish the guilty,

784
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:00,458
cut off Yin Shou's head...

785
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:03,625
establish peace,
and guarantee the people's safety.

786
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,542
This is what...

787
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:09,250
The Earth King should do.

788
01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:13,500
Master...

789
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:16,000
Thank you for saving me.

790
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:33,125
Such a pretty young lady!

791
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,792
You must already be betrothed.

792
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:42,125
Our Lord is still
unmarried either...

793
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:45,167
What if I were to play matchmaker?

794
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:55,500
If you married him,

795
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:57,500
that would be wonderful.

796
01:32:57,667 --> 01:33:00,667
From now on, Xiqi would be your home...

797
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:04,042
and we would be your family.

798
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,125
Thank you, noble immortal,

799
01:34:08,292 --> 01:34:09,875
for protecting Xiqi.

800
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:12,583
Heaven and man help
those who help themselves.

801
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,750
It's magnificent!

802
01:34:43,917 --> 01:34:45,583
Thank you!

803
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:48,708
- Join us!
- Come dance!

804
01:36:03,292 --> 01:36:04,875
And your fiancée, where is she?

805
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,542
Let's dance!

806
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,250
Join us!

807
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,708
Let's dance!

808
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:25,000
Stop it!

809
01:36:25,167 --> 01:36:27,000
I have important things to do!

810
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:28,250
The joy of the people

811
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:30,292
is the most important thing!

812
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:32,750
Let's dance!

813
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,292
The curse of the Black Moon

814
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,250
freezes body and soul...

815
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,500
This potion

816
01:37:25,667 --> 01:37:27,667
will protect you.

817
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:36,458
- Fill the bowls.
- Fill the bowls.

818
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,542
Raise your bowls!

819
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,667
Drink!

820
01:39:43,917 --> 01:39:45,417
After tonight,

821
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:50,667
There will be no living soul left in Xiqi.

822
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,167
Warriors of the Shang...

823
01:39:54,917 --> 01:39:57,250
I will remain here,

824
01:39:57,833 --> 01:40:01,167
awaiting your triumphant return.

825
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:16,667
What's going on?

826
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:18,708
The moon and stars have disappeared.

827
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:27,333
This isn't a good sign.

828
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,667
- The enemy is approaching.
- Fire!

829
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:44,667
Archers in position!

830
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,458
Light your arrows!

831
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,333
Fire!

832
01:40:54,208 --> 01:40:55,750
Prepare for battle!

833
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,208
Avoid the rays of light!

834
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,083
Stay in the shadows!

835
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:41,917
Back off!

836
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:54,167
What is this sorcery?

837
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:56,500
They're still alive,

838
01:41:57,167 --> 01:41:58,792
but completely paralyzed.

839
01:41:59,792 --> 01:42:01,542
So their lives are under the enemy's mercy!

840
01:42:03,292 --> 01:42:06,250
We must find a way
to destroy these mirrors.

841
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:10,208
Watch out!

842
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:58,375
Step back!

843
01:43:02,792 --> 01:43:05,458
In the dark night,
A mirror shines,

844
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:06,958
Whoever it reaches,

845
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:08,500
Their soul is extinguished.

846
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,875
Like lambs,

847
01:43:10,042 --> 01:43:11,333
Delivered to the executioner.

848
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,958
The Curse arises,

849
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:15,083
Divines and mortals perish.

850
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:18,583
It is the curse of the Black Moon.

851
01:43:21,792 --> 01:43:22,958
Can we break it?

852
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:26,167
To do this,

853
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:29,625
we must find Wen Zhong's altar.

854
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,667
Spread out and find it.

855
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:34,417
Good!

856
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,625
Protect the city gate.

857
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,583
Warn the residents quickly!

858
01:43:48,625 --> 01:43:50,458
Reinforce the gate. Let's go.

859
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,500
One, two!

860
01:43:56,667 --> 01:43:57,625
Push!

861
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:00,542
One, two! Push!

862
01:44:22,042 --> 01:44:23,000
Avoid the beams.

863
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:07,583
Quick!

864
01:45:13,542 --> 01:45:15,625
Don't go through!

865
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:23,625
Lü Gongwang...

866
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:29,958
Give it to me!

867
01:45:31,167 --> 01:45:33,083
No, My Lord!

868
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:50,375
Leave!

869
01:45:56,917 --> 01:45:58,583
Lü Gongwang...

870
01:46:14,917 --> 01:46:17,250
Take them all to safety
in my residence!

871
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:18,167
Quickly!

872
01:46:48,917 --> 01:46:50,708
Attack!

873
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,750
Except the Crown Prince,

874
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:05,875
Kill them all!

875
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,583
Burn them all!

876
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:43,500
Get down!

877
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:46,458
Surround him!

878
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:56,500
Mom!

879
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,125
Mom!

880
01:48:06,875 --> 01:48:09,167
Catch that old man!
It's Jiang Ziya.

881
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:11,292
- Don't move!
- Ne Zha!

882
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:12,667
Yang Jian!

883
01:48:14,417 --> 01:48:15,667
Where are they?

884
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:17,875
Halt!

885
01:48:24,583 --> 01:48:25,667
Yang Jian!

886
01:48:26,042 --> 01:48:27,375
Water Teleportation!

887
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:30,750
Water Teleportation!

888
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:36,125
Water Teleportation!

889
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:37,583
Where are they?

890
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,417
You're never here when...

891
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:40,875
Water Teleportation!

892
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:46,458
Master!
Are you all right?

893
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:01,958
Master, I'm back.

894
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:04,708
Watch out!

895
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,000
Master!

896
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:15,958
Master!
It's pitch black outside...

897
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:17,042
We can't see anything!

898
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:20,250
We've looked everywhere,
but there's no sign of the altar.

899
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:23,833
It's surely a spell Wen Zhong casts,
hiding his position.

900
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:27,292
Master,
is there another solution?

901
01:49:41,792 --> 01:49:43,458
I'm so stupid...

902
01:49:44,458 --> 01:49:45,958
I'm looking for Wen Zhong,

903
01:49:46,542 --> 01:49:48,625
but he's looking for me too!

904
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:57,125
Quickly.
Come in quickly!

905
01:49:57,292 --> 01:49:58,333
Get up.

906
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:03,458
Stay away from the entrances!

907
01:50:04,417 --> 01:50:05,708
Come in quickly!

908
01:50:06,167 --> 01:50:07,042
Watch out!

909
01:50:07,792 --> 01:50:09,375
Stay away from the entrances!

910
01:50:14,042 --> 01:50:14,875
Give it to me.

911
01:50:16,208 --> 01:50:18,792
In memory of my friendship with your father,

912
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:21,083
I'm giving you one last chance.

913
01:50:21,958 --> 01:50:24,583
Bring me just one thing,

914
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:27,958
and I'll spare Xiqi.

915
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:31,875
What then?

916
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:34,333
The Investiture of the Gods.

917
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:37,792
Search carefully,
no one must escape.

918
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:39,750
Go to Xiqi,

919
01:50:39,917 --> 01:50:41,875
and capture Jiang Ziya alive.

920
01:50:42,042 --> 01:50:44,625
The Investiture of the Gods is upon him.

921
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:46,667
Xiqi?

922
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,000
How can I get in?

923
01:50:50,667 --> 01:50:52,208
Free Ji Fa...

924
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,292
and they will let you in.

925
01:51:01,542 --> 01:51:03,292
I'll help you make this believable.

926
01:51:20,917 --> 01:51:22,500
So, I was right...

927
01:51:22,667 --> 01:51:24,875
You're here for the Investiture of the Gods.

928
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:56,167
Celestial Ribbon! Block the rays!

929
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:13,958
Watch out!

930
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:14,917
Quick!

931
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,125
Come on, faster!

932
01:52:28,667 --> 01:52:29,875
Ground teleport!

933
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,375
Is everything okay?

934
01:52:40,917 --> 01:52:42,375
Fire teleport!

935
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:52,875
Take care of them.

936
01:52:53,458 --> 01:52:54,792
Madam, watch out!

937
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:04,333
Plant teleportation!

938
01:53:25,042 --> 01:53:26,250
Ring of speed! Go!

939
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:33,417
Search every house!

940
01:53:33,833 --> 01:53:35,958
Bring everyone to me.

941
01:53:41,167 --> 01:53:42,417
Watch out!

942
01:53:55,917 --> 01:53:57,833
We agreed on three days...

943
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Why start early?

944
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:05,250
Well? Jiang Ziya and
The Investiture of the Gods together!

945
01:54:05,667 --> 01:54:08,042
You do your father proud.

946
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:10,417
You promised me

947
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:12,750
you'd let the people of Xiqi live.

948
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:15,333
Stop the attack immediately!

949
01:54:16,667 --> 01:54:18,958
You did what was asked...

950
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:21,208
Give me The Investiture of the Gods.

951
01:54:22,125 --> 01:54:25,417
If you don't stop the attack,
you'll never get it.

952
01:54:26,167 --> 01:54:27,750
His Majesty's orders

953
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:30,542
were to exterminate Xiqi.

954
01:54:31,833 --> 01:54:33,042
At dawn,

955
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:36,875
All those hit by the rays...

956
01:54:37,042 --> 01:54:38,583
will die.

957
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,875
Do you really think that

958
01:54:41,042 --> 01:54:43,417
I would disobey His Majesty's orders

959
01:54:43,917 --> 01:54:46,042
to make a deal with you?

960
01:54:52,792 --> 01:54:54,875
Take it! Go quickly!

961
01:54:55,417 --> 01:54:57,042
Ji Fa was not mistaken about you!

962
01:54:57,708 --> 01:54:59,708
You're not helping the Shang,

963
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:02,625
you're helping Xiqi.

964
01:55:14,042 --> 01:55:17,083
Then let's go fishing again...

965
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:20,833
This time, I'll be the bait.

966
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:22,833
And who will be the fish?

967
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:28,250
We'll see who takes the bait.

968
01:55:30,292 --> 01:55:33,333
If The Investiture of the Gods
is saved, there is hope.

969
01:55:34,167 --> 01:55:35,167
Protect it.

970
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,708
I'll send out a signal...

971
01:55:39,875 --> 01:55:41,208
Follow the flames

972
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:43,458
and you'll find Wen Zhong's altar.

973
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:46,917
The Eye of the Black Moon Curse
must be on his altar.

974
01:55:47,583 --> 01:55:49,000
Destroy the eye

975
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:51,417
and the curse will be broken.

976
01:55:54,833 --> 01:55:56,208
You dare challenge me?

977
01:55:56,792 --> 01:55:58,708
Kill them!

978
01:56:14,583 --> 01:56:16,750
Yin Jiao, you're too late!

979
01:56:17,208 --> 01:56:19,167
Ji Fa, you're the one who's slow.

980
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:41,042
Ji Fa, my body is getting heavy...

981
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:42,792
Yin Jiao, hold on!

982
01:56:44,667 --> 01:56:47,583
Yin Jiao, don't look so weak!

983
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:06,000
Yin Jiao, don't fall!
We have to kill Yin Shou!

984
01:57:06,167 --> 01:57:08,458
Ji Fa, it's all up to you now...

985
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,375
Yin Jiao!

986
01:57:20,708 --> 01:57:21,583
Come on!

987
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:23,250
Find the altar!

988
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:28,458
Avoid the rays!

989
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,250
Lei Zhenzi!

990
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:52,000
Go for it!

991
01:58:21,833 --> 01:58:22,917
Ji Fa...

992
01:58:46,167 --> 01:58:47,833
Stab Wen Zhong's eye,

993
01:58:48,917 --> 01:58:50,375
the war will end.

994
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,500
Do it now!

995
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:24,083
Come in quickly!

996
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:25,167
Hurry up!

997
02:00:11,458 --> 02:00:12,500
Close the doors!

998
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:17,000
Kill them all!

999
02:00:17,167 --> 02:00:18,000
Charge!

1000
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:31,542
Hey!

1001
02:01:25,625 --> 02:01:27,333
They're in the residence!

1002
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:01,000
Go!

1003
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:11,417
Surrender or die,

1004
02:02:12,167 --> 02:02:13,292
The choice is yours.

1005
02:02:14,208 --> 02:02:16,167
I'm winning!

1006
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,875
Why stop?

1007
02:02:38,917 --> 02:02:39,917
Hold the door!

1008
02:02:47,625 --> 02:02:48,500
Ji Fa!

1009
02:02:57,583 --> 02:02:59,083
Deng Chanyu, quick!

1010
02:02:59,875 --> 02:03:01,292
This is your last chance...

1011
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,417
Come kill Ji Fa.

1012
02:03:05,417 --> 02:03:06,292
Never!

1013
02:03:08,875 --> 02:03:11,208
Do you really want
to become a traitor?

1014
02:03:11,667 --> 02:03:14,292
Don't forget,
you drank my potion...

1015
02:03:14,458 --> 02:03:16,750
If the curse is broken,
you'll die too.

1016
02:03:20,667 --> 02:03:21,667
Quick!

1017
02:03:21,833 --> 02:03:24,083
Dawn is approaching.

1018
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:39,958
Ji Fa!

1019
02:03:47,208 --> 02:03:49,458
Ji Fa, quick!

1020
02:04:27,417 --> 02:04:28,417
What are you waiting for?

1021
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:29,375
I'm sorry...

1022
02:05:30,667 --> 02:05:31,792
I lied to you.

1023
02:05:32,792 --> 02:05:33,833
No.

1024
02:05:34,583 --> 02:05:35,875
You saved Xiqi.

1025
02:05:36,292 --> 02:05:38,042
Xiqi is now your home.

1026
02:05:43,583 --> 02:05:46,083
When we met
on the banks of the Yellow River,

1027
02:05:48,708 --> 02:05:50,542
the song you sang...

1028
02:05:52,417 --> 02:05:53,708
I loved it.

1029
02:05:55,333 --> 02:05:56,958
I'd like to hear it again.

1030
02:06:04,875 --> 02:06:08,708
There is a girl with a dreaming heart

1031
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,333
On a river, peaceful and wide

1032
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:18,750
Why not sail, as lovers?

1033
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Carried together by the wind?

1034
02:06:29,792 --> 02:06:31,167
Close your eyes.

1035
02:06:42,542 --> 02:06:46,458
There's a girl roaming,

1036
02:06:47,458 --> 02:06:50,167
The wild, harsh, and heavy mountains

1037
02:06:51,583 --> 02:06:55,583
Why not ride, as we go?

1038
02:06:56,333 --> 02:06:59,958
And unite against time?

1039
02:07:05,625 --> 02:07:07,292
General, wait.

1040
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:13,917
I'm going home.

1041
02:07:17,083 --> 02:07:21,292
There is a girl under a troubling sky

1042
02:07:22,417 --> 02:07:25,500
Rain and snow mingle with the wind

1043
02:07:25,958 --> 02:07:30,875
Why not freeze time

1044
02:07:31,042 --> 02:07:34,167
To console her trembling heart?

1045
02:07:34,917 --> 02:07:39,500
There is a girl with destiny floating

1046
02:07:39,667 --> 02:07:42,417
The north wind blows sharply

1047
02:07:42,917 --> 02:07:46,792
Why not dream, lover

1048
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:50,583
Of a soft, comforting nest?

1049
02:09:03,167 --> 02:09:04,042
Master!

1050
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:47,125
There is a girl with a dreamy heart,

1051
02:09:48,667 --> 02:09:51,167
On a river, peaceful and wide

1052
02:09:52,458 --> 02:09:56,333
Why not sail, as lovers?

1053
02:09:57,042 --> 02:10:00,000
Carried together by the wind?

1054
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:04,583
There is a girl traversing

1055
02:10:05,167 --> 02:10:08,417
The wild, harsh, and heavy mountains

1056
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,083
Why not ride, leaving

1057
02:10:13,667 --> 02:10:17,375
And unite against time?

1058
02:10:20,042 --> 02:10:23,958
There is a girl under a disturbing sky

1059
02:10:24,708 --> 02:10:27,875
Rain and snow fall incessant

1060
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:32,875
Why not take a moment

1061
02:10:33,042 --> 02:10:36,542
To console his trembling heart?

1062
02:10:36,708 --> 02:10:40,792
There is a girl with a fleeting destiny

1063
02:10:41,167 --> 02:10:44,042
The north wind blows sharply

1064
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:49,542
Why not dream, Loving

1065
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:53,375
To a soft, comforting nest?

1066
02:10:54,042 --> 02:10:58,083
There is a girl with a floating destiny

1067
02:10:58,542 --> 02:11:01,458
The north wind blows sharply

1068
02:11:02,375 --> 02:11:06,875
Why not dream, loving

1069
02:11:07,042 --> 02:11:10,667
To a soft, comforting nest ?

1070
02:12:26,542 --> 02:12:27,458
My son...

1071
02:12:28,417 --> 02:12:29,333
Come,

1072
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,792
I'll teach you a cheerful melody.

1073
02:13:34,833 --> 02:13:35,625
Yin Shou...

1074
02:13:36,542 --> 02:13:37,417
I told you,

1075
02:13:41,667 --> 02:13:43,958
Even if I were dead, I'd come for you.

1076
02:13:44,875 --> 02:13:46,750
Kill him!

1077
02:14:07,458 --> 02:14:10,000
Die!

1078
02:14:54,542 --> 02:14:55,625
Yin Jiao

1079
02:14:59,042 --> 02:15:03,542
The Supreme Ruler of Golden Turtle Island has arrived!

1080
02:15:06,625 --> 02:15:08,417
Surrender or perish.

1081
02:15:31,292 --> 02:15:36,292
There is a girl, alone and valiant

1082
02:15:36,625 --> 02:15:40,542
On his galloping horse

1083
02:15:41,833 --> 02:15:47,167
Powerful wind, rumbling drum

1084
02:15:47,333 --> 02:15:52,333
His armor forged from burning sand

1085
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:02,583
There is a girl of burning courage

1086
02:16:02,750 --> 02:16:06,125
With blood always boiling

1087
02:16:07,917 --> 02:16:12,917
Who calls him, in a dream floating

1088
02:16:13,375 --> 02:16:18,375
The moon invokes him with its soothing reflection

1089
02:16:21,167 --> 02:16:23,792
The moon illuminates this moment

1090
02:16:24,333 --> 02:16:27,042
I love his kind heart

1091
02:16:27,625 --> 02:16:30,667
In this troubling world

1092
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:34,791
Like a beautiful fire camp

1093
02:16:37,375 --> 02:16:39,875
A path back still beckons

1094
02:16:40,041 --> 02:16:42,958
And I will no longer be a wandering soul

1095
02:16:43,125 --> 02:16:48,708
May he understand why I'm moving so far

1096
02:16:49,083 --> 02:16:52,916
Towards the terrifying abyss

1097
02:16:53,083 --> 02:16:56,250
For this city vibrant

1098
02:16:56,416 --> 02:17:00,041
For wine and soothing songs

1099
02:17:00,541 --> 02:17:05,791
A pure and constant love

1100
02:17:21,458 --> 02:17:26,541
There is a girl, mute in the wind

1101
02:17:26,708 --> 02:17:31,041
Near a river whose bed is wide

1102
02:17:31,875 --> 02:17:37,000
In the heart of the mountains wandering

1103
02:17:37,166 --> 02:17:42,166
Under the biting north wind

1104
02:17:45,166 --> 02:17:50,166
Together on horseback, powerful gallop

1105
02:17:50,625 --> 02:17:55,625
Life and death sealed by an oath

1106
02:17:56,083 --> 02:18:01,208
Keeping a living memory of me

1107
02:18:01,375 --> 02:18:06,375
Like a general, noble and brilliant

1108
02:19:03,083 --> 02:19:07,500
This casket was given
by His Majesty...

1109
02:19:11,041 --> 02:19:12,333
So be it,

1110
02:19:13,458 --> 02:19:15,875
we place Ji Fa's head inside,

1111
02:19:17,125 --> 02:19:18,416
So be it...

1112
02:19:22,041 --> 02:19:25,500
In any case, it cannot Return empty.

1113
02:19:46,833 --> 02:19:50,500
His Majesty desires my head, then.

1114
02:19:50,667 --> 02:19:52,083
Grand Commander...

1115
02:19:56,917 --> 02:19:58,625
You are perceptive.

1116
02:20:12,542 --> 02:20:13,708
Take it then!

1117
02:20:25,875 --> 02:20:27,625
Grand Commander,

1118
02:20:27,792 --> 02:20:29,792
Rest in peace.

1119
02:21:09,417 --> 02:21:10,417
Onward...

1120
02:21:11,083 --> 02:21:12,917
Towards Xiqi!

1121
02:21:41,875 --> 02:21:45,542
A phoenix sings on Mount Qi

1122
02:21:47,167 --> 02:21:51,792
From the summit, it greets the infinite dawn

1123
02:21:54,875 --> 02:21:58,542
A fish glides in the Wei River

1124
02:22:00,125 --> 02:22:04,625
Under the crystal-clear waters
