Bai!

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,550
You said I've erased humanity.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,190
Fine.

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,140
Show me yours then.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,750
Nong Qianya.

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,260
Bai Fan.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,140
Choose one.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,750
Whichever one you pick

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,470
gets to live.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,830
Refuse,

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,119
and they both die.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,479
Nong Cangqin,

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,220
I'll kill you!

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,830
Try me.

28
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,660
I'll count to three.

29
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,730
Three.

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,990
Two.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,999
Chen Jiachuan...

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,300
Bai Fan, no!

33
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,550
I don't need you to decide.

34
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,399
Bai Fan!

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,479
Let me go!

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,789
Ya! Ya!

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,990
Let me go!

38
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,820
I was expecting a show.

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,660
Since neither of you will,

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,380
I'll make the call.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,100
Chen Jiachuan?

42
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,379
Bai Fan, hurry!

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,750
- Watch out!
- Don't move!

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,120
Last time during the drill,

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,020
you got captured
and didn't even try to break free.

47
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,729
How would you
get out of a situation like that?

48
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,190
Here's how.

49
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,369
We lure the enemy deeper,

50
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,150
break their formation,

51
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,630
then adapt on the fly.

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,459
Ow, my back...

53
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,540
Bai Fan.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,119
- Hey, man.
- I can't...

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,409
- He needs to go to the hospital. Truly.
- I need a doctor...

56
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,590
It's serious.

(Security Department Director's Office)

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,980
Let's save Ya.

59
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,520
You've been

60
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,390
such a naughty girl.

61
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,600
If you'd listened earlier,

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,390
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

63
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,220
When we were kids,

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,740
Mom and Cangnan never liked you,

65
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,420
but I did.

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,780
I knew

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,940
you were smart,

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,350
diligent,

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,030
ambitious.

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,980
You're the best product
of our Nong bloodline.

71
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,030
You're so much like me.

72
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,429
From the moment you went

73
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,039
to boarding school,

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,150
whenever you needed tuition
or living expenses,

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,300
I was the one bringing them to you.

76
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,590
Remember that?

77
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,150
I thought
you genuinely cared about me too.

78
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,860
So why,
when you started your experiment,

79
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,030
did you put me in that test car?

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,510
If Xiaotong hadn't been there,

81
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,780
if she hadn't ended up
in that seat by chance,

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,740
you'd have killed me with your scheme!

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,159
It's precisely because you impressed me

84
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,829
that I decided,

85
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,830
without hesitation,

86
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,660
that you would take over from me.

87
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,150
Everything from the Nong family,

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,710
I'm passing it

89
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,269
to you.

90
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,620
Your DNA is embedded

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,829
in the Supercontrol No. 3 system
because I put it there myself.

92
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,420
One day, Supercontrol No. 3 will be us.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,620
Two siblings, bound by blood and power.

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,830
Together,

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,270
we'll start a new era for humanity.

96
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,390
I'll be the king,

97
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,230
and

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,390
you'll be the queen.

99
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,199
But before that,

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,599
you've got to help me

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,899
finish the plan.

102
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,060
So, what say you?

103
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,620
No way!

104
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,300
Dream on!

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,750
Nong Qianya,

106
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,429
do you really think I haven't known

107
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,999
what you've been up to all these years

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,620
while I've been laid up here?

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,629
You staged your own kidnapping

110
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,070
to gain their trust.

111
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,299
You've been sabotaging my project

112
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,660
step by step,

113
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,300
digging holes to make sure it fails.

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,030
Oh, Nong Qianya, so noble of you.

115
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,540
Why can't you understand?

116
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,780
We couldn't be more different.

117
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,740
My feelings for them are real!

118
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,420
Real?

119
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,150
All right. Very well.

120
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,239
If Jiang Zhen found out his sister died

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,869
because of you,

122
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,159
if Bai Fan knew you were far

123
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,710
from the innocent girl
they thought you were,

124
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,950
would your "real feelings" even matter?

125
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,390
Open your eyes, Nong Qianya!

126
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,220
Do you really think
they'd still care about you?

127
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,390
No...

128
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,540
- No...
- Ya,

129
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,429
We are the real siblings.

130
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,030
I'm your true brother.

131
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,820
They both

132
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,100
have to die!

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,230
No...

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,830
Scared?

135
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,980
They'll be here any second.

136
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,350
What do you think?

137
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,980
Shall I tell them your little secret?

138
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,460
Afraid?

139
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't be.

140
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,780
Don't worry.

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,919
I wouldn't do that to you.

142
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,159
I'll show you

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,620
what Supercontrol No. 3
is really capable of.

144
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,149
Killing's

145
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,380
no fun.

146
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,190
The real thrill is control.

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,500
What do you plan to do?

148
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,030
Watch.

149
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,190
Bai Fan?

150
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,479
Bai Fan!

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,630
Are you all right?

152
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,060
Bai Fan!

153
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,340
Bai Fan...

154
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,839
Bai Fan is now part of my grand design

155
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,260
and my loyal servant.

156
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,140
You animal!

157
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,860
Ya, this show

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,380
is just for you.

159
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,310
Enjoy it.

160
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,330
I'm your real brother!

161
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,430
Bai Fan, what are you doing?

162
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,940
Bai Fan!

163
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,630
