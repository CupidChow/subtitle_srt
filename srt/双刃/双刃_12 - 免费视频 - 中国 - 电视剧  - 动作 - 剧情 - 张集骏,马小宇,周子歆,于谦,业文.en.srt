Want to shoot some hoops?

14

Sure.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,330
Pass me the ball.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,530
Ball.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,010
I'm not as accurate as I used to be.

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,690
It's definitely harder to shoot
when you're sitting.

19
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,370
Yeah.

20
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,459
But I don't mind sitting.

21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,990
Standing gets tiring
after a while anyway.

22
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,179
Ball.

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,370
Keep it going.

24
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,800
One more shot.

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,619
What? Keep going.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,810
Ball.

27
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,250
I'm kind of tired from picking it up.
Let's take a break.

28
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,610
Give me something tougher.

29
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,570
There's more here.

30
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,779
Here.

31
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,970
This should be hard enough.

32
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,170
That's Xiaotong's book.

33
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,810
Boring.

34
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,650
I'm going to grab a bite.

35
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,650
Why did you pick on Qianya?

36
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,530
I didn't.

37
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,299
She just got back late.

38
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,389
I didn't...

39
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,730
You're jealous.

40
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,219
I'm not...

41
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,899
You're jealous of her and Jiang Zhen.

42
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,459
She was late.

43
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,619
No...

44
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm not jealous...

45
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,210
I'm inside your head.

46
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,410
I know exactly what you're thinking.

47
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,850
This is good.

48
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,770
You're not eating that, right?

49
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,930
Lyu Qingnan,

50
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,570
get me a glass of water.

51
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,690
Lyu Qingnan from Class 11.

52
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,770
I'm not mistaken, right?

53
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,050
Peng Tao,

54
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,050
next time don't marinate

55
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,219
the steak.

56
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,410
It messes with the texture.

57
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,770
And that guy...

58
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,890
Guo...

59
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,690
Guo something...

60
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,050
Guo Lei.

61
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,970
Guo Lei, right.

62
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,330
As soon as I tasted these noodles,
I knew you made them.

63
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,760
Not bad.

64
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,090
Class 12.

65
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,010
Instructor Chen.

66
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,090
I just left Gale,

67
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,650
I didn't lose my memory.

68
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,379
You've really decked out

69
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,890
the Gale base nicely.

70
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,770
Then why don't you come back to work?

71
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,990
I'm full.

72
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,970
Can I head out now?

73
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,290
You planning
to keep moping around like this?

74
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,450
Do I look like someone moping?

75
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,419
You're the one

76
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,770
not eating a single bite.

77
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,299
- Get up.
- What?

78
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,859
Come with me.

79
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,139
- Get up.
- What's the big deal?

80
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,779
Come on.

81
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,939
Don't forget your crutches.

82
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,130
Let's go.

83
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,450
Bai Fan!

84
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,090
When did Gale Training Camp's budget

85
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,690
get so high?

86
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,719
(Gale Special Academy)

87
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,810
Chen Jiachuan.

88
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,890
We meet again.

89
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,090
I hope

90
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,010
this is the last time,

91
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,990
Instructor Dong.

92
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,690
I haven't seen you in three years.

93
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,930
Don't you want to catch up
with an old friend?

94
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,750
If you've got nothing better to say,

95
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,890
I'm out.

96
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,850
Jiachuan.

97
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,770
You've been undercover for three years.

98
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,570
Don't you want to help
the police and Xiaotong?

99
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,970
Don't I want to help?

100
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,210
Does it matter if I want?

101
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,810
Three years ago,

102
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,159
I tried every possible way
to find the truth

103
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,240
and get justice for my sister.

104
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,760
And you?

105
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,410
Not only did you refuse to help me,

106
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,859
you blocked me every step of the way.

107
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,099
- You even...
- Chen Jiachuan!

108
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,370
Shut up!

109
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,730
I went undercover

110
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,979
in Amethyst Group

111
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,850
for a full three years.

112
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,490
Just as everything
was about to come out,

113
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,810
you sent him in.

114
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,610
What are you trying to do?

115
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,330
There are questionable things
going on with Amethyst Group,

116
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,979
but we have to follow police orders.

117
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,930
The timing is different now.

118
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,219
Gale's Double-Edge Project

119
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,939
is being directed by the police.

120
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,659
With you and Bai Fan assisting,

121
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,219
using tech to crack key authentication

122
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,339
could help avert

123
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,859
a major crisis.

124
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,979
Lies!

125
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,690
Don't you dare say another word!

126
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,210
Want to know why?

127
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,739
Look at me.

128
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,090
Look closely.

129
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,810
I'm useless now.

130
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,379
Look at my leg.

131
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,330
I'm a cripple now!
