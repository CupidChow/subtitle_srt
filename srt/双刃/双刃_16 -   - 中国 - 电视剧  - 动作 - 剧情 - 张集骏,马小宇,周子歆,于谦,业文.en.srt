Chen Jiachuan and Bai Fan
from Gale Training Camp.

14
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,730
So you've known about us all along.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,450
I'm the city's
biggest information broker.

16
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,370
You really underestimated me.

17
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,900
I apologize, Prince.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,099
My bad.

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,369
This was our last resort.

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,370
We've been investigating
an illegal experiment.

21
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,900
We need your help gathering intel on it.

22
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,140
Just for this?

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,500
Yes.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,509
You're doing a good deed.

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,939
You could've just told me

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,130
you needed my help.

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,170
That went better than I expected.

28
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,709
If you ever make me do something
like this again, I'll kill you!

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,290
When it comes to cross-dressing,
it's either never or a million times.

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,530
What are you looking at?

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,810
Prince's files show

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,810
that these people
have been experimenting

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,829
with brain-computer interfaces

34
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,530
to control people.

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,460
That means the Amethyst Group

36
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,650
has been using the Morning Star Project
as a cover

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,499
to implant Supercontrol No. 3 chips

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,060
to control humans.

39
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,620
Luckily, they haven't succeeded.

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,860
If they had,

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,780
it would've been a disaster.

42
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,869
That disabled man who attacked you

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,640
must have been able to walk
thanks to this tech.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,619
It's time

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,460
to bring the mastermind

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,340
into the spotlight.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,690
Madam.

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,899
There's always a good reason

49
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,410
when someone's overly nice to you.

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,530
What's the occasion for the flowers?

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,650
Join me for a drink?

52
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,060
You just came here to drink with me?

53
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,460
There might be other reasons too.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,580
Like what?

55
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,690
Well, that depends on what you're after.

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,650
If I tell you what I want,

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,810
will you give it to me?

58
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,410
Tell me what you want, then.

59
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,810
Perhaps I can.

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,930
Perhaps?

61
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,020
Madam.

62
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,610
The wine is ready.

63
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,220
Won't you have a glass?

64
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,220
Here.

65
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,010
Cheers.

66
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,020
Close your eyes.

67
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,490
I have a present for you.

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,050
How do I look?

69
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,620
Gorgeous.

70
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,010
Zhen,

71
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,490
you do love me, don't you?

72
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm here, aren't I?

73
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,850
What other proof do you need?

74
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,819
Ya.

75
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,939
Bai.

76
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,499
I bought the ingredients for dinner.

77
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,140
What are you making for me tonight?

78
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,660
Whatever you want.

79
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,090
Then

80
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,739
I'll make some of my specialties.

81
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,050
I'll take that.

82
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,619
Bai,

83
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,429
I tried making the scallion oil noodles

84
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,469
you taught me last time.

85
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,939
They turned out pretty good.
I took a picture for you.

86
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,029
Let me see it.

87
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,780
Look, doesn't it look nice?

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,429
Keep scrolling.

89
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,700
There's more.

90
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,380
I also made
some stir-fried pork with chillies.

91
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,260
Bai,

92
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,499
for the Cola chicken wings,

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,380
should I use light soy sauce
or dark soy sauce?

94
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,700
Bai?

95
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,460
Say that again?

96
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,429
Last time, I followed the recipe

97
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,460
and used light soy sauce,

98
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,869
but I felt

99
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,850
the color looked off.

100
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,669
But if I use dark soy sauce,

101
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,739
I'm worried it might turn out too dark.

102
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,820
So which one is it?

103
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,580
Either works.

104
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,260
This looks good.

105
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,610
Bai, you should take a break today.

106
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,699
I'll cook for you tonight.

107
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,469
No...

108
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,819
I can do it.

109
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,229
I can cook.

110
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,020
No need. Just sit there.

111
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,860
Maybe you should

112
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,820
take a shower first?

113
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,300
I'll be right back.

(Supercontrol No. 3
Experimental Design Plan, Top Secret)

115
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
That's what you came here for,

116
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,060
isn't it?

117
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,260
Jiang Zhen,

118
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,340
why are you doing this to me?

119
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,610
Mu Jie,

120
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,580
is all this true?

121
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,970
I knew from the start

122
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,220
that you only approached me to use me.

123
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,820
But I kept giving you chances.

124
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,419
Why do this to me?

125
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,850
Do you know it's illegal

126
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,220
to use disabled people
in brain-computer interface experiments?

127
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,420
They all volunteered.

128
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,210
Madam,

129
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,730
you should turn yourself in.

130
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,899
Zhen,

131
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,060
you said you'd always protect me.

132
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,460
I didn't do any of this.

133
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,010
The evidence is right here.

134
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,770
