13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,380
Qianya, which of them found you first?

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,220
They both found me at the same time.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,229
Since it's a tie...

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,949
Our bet earlier

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,679
was about who brought her back first,

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,870
and that person would win.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,030
Don't tell me you can't accept losing.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,919
Captain Bai,

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,609
you're still young,
yet your memory's poor.

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,379
What I said at the time was
whoever found the young mistress first,

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,500
not whoever brought her back first.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,190
Don't worry, Mr. Mu.

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,580
I will bring the young mistress back.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,310
Chen Jiachuan,

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,110
you're no match for me.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,220
Bai Fan, what do you mean by that?

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,300
A loss is a loss.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,470
I'll gladly take this position.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,190
Alright,

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,500
we'll discuss later about

33
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,830
the matter of personnel changes.

34
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,780
Today's top priority

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,060
is to welcome the young mistress home.

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,500
Technical Department,

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,380
take the young mistress to the
company tomorrow for key authentication.

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,710
Project Supercontrol No. 3

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,630
will officially commence.

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,660
Zhen,

41
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,430
you knew Bai Fan before, didn't you?

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,030
Why is it that every time you see him,

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
you can't keep your cool?

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,380
I just can't stand him.

45
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,100
Are you unhappy with my arrangements?

46
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,820
You know

47
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,060
you're the only one
I care about the most.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,710
You wouldn't

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,780
lie to me, would you?

50
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,349
Does that hurt?

51
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,189
At a time like this,
you put him by my side

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,540
and still expect me to cooperate?

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,359
Third Young Master is determined
to seize power, and that Bai fellow

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,869
plays both sides between you and him.

55
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,630
That's why I can't stand him.

56
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,470
Right now, those two outside,

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,150
one wants to take your position,

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,260
the other wants to take my place.

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,710
If you still won't stand with me,

60
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,839
who else can I rely on?

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,469
If Madam doesn't trust me,

62
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,279
then forget it.

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,630
Those shareholders have always
complained about me favoring you.

64
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,909
If I don't take some action,

65
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,030
how could they ever feel assured?

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,030
Don't worry.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,100
The Security Department
will still be yours.

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,470
Your people will always be mine.

69
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,839
Good boy.

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,030
Go now.

71
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,660
When you're with another man,

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,820
do you feel good?

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,270
No.

74
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,660
I don't.

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,310
No...

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,479
Mr. Mu, everything is ready now.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,509
Once the young mistress's iris
and DNA are unlocked,

78
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,749
we can resume developing

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,220
Project Supercontrol No. 3 chip.

80
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,560
Ya,

81
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,420
unlock the plan with key authentication.

82
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,520
(Login)

83
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,690
(Secondary key authentication failed)

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,119
What happened?

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,180
Even the young mistress's DNA
doesn't work?

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,110
I have no idea.

87
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,999
Sister-in-law,

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,030
I told you this Nong Qianya is a fake.

89
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,309
Your DNA can't even get past
the key authentication.

90
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,270
What makes you think you're Nong Qianya?

91
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,749
What proof do you have

92
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,069
to prove you are Nong Qianya?

93
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,910
You want proof?

94
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,350
When I was six years old,

95
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,470
while I was bathing,

96
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,069
you burned my back with a cigarette.

97
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,030
This scar is what you left back then.

98
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,830
The cruelty you showed me,

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,070
have you forgotten it all?

100
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,470
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,870
My waist...

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,830
Get him to the hospital.

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,220
It's all in the past.

104
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,659
(Amethyst Group)

105
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,219
(DNA unlock for Project Supercontrol No. 3.
DNA authentication)

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,650
(Unlock failed)

107
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,060
Ya.

108
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,460
Come here.

109
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,590
- Sister-in-law.
- Come, sit.

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,660
Before your eldest brother fell ill,

111
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,830
he always spoke fondly
of the bond between you two.

112
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,129
So many years have passed.

113
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,420
Although you are the Nong family's
illegitimate daughter,

114
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,719
he has always treated you

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,660
as his half-sister.

116
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,710
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
used your DNA as a key authentication.

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,780
He also asked me
to take good care of you.

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,180
It's been a long time.

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,860
I've prepared a gift for you.

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,220
Look at this silk scarf.

121
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,180
You still remember it, right?

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,510
When Cangnan was little, he often
played with you using this scarf.

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,620
Take him to visit your eldest brother,

124
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,780
and he'll surely be happy.

125
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,420
The company is struggling right now.

126
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,390
I can't handle so much alone.

127
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,390
You've grown up.

128
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,100
It's time for you to shoulder
some of the company's burden.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,030
Starting tomorrow,

130
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,180
come to the company as an intern.

131
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,620
Brother.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,390
It's been a long time.

133
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,590
Your beard has grown.

134
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,030
Time to give it a shave.

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,110
Don't worry.

136
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,390
I'll take good care of you.

137
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
There's only one office left.

138
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,100
I'll have to trouble Vice Director Bai,
and Captain Jiang will have to make do.

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,340
Vice Director.

140
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,550
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

141
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,520
This feels great.

142
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,510
Vice Director Bai,

143
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,439
there's an issue
with your background check.

144
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,710
The HR Department
has already reported to Mr. Mu.

145
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,070
We need to investigate you again.

146
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,549
That's right.

147
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,790
The last thing I did before resigning

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,070
was write you a background report.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,270
Thank you.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,790
You're welcome.

151
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,839
Your background check file states

152
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,239
that you previously worked
at Anning Company.

153
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,500
But online searches

154
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,590
turned up no such company.

155
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,270
Chen Jiachuan,

156
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,830
what exactly are you trying to do?

157
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,070
Take the disk

158
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,860
and get back to Gale.

159
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,869
Right, Julie.

160
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,260
I think I wrote it wrong.

161
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,670
It's actually

162
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,020
Ning'an Company.

163
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,260
Go back and have HR check again.

164
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,860
