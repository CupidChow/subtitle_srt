Yeah.

14
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,919
Boss.

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,700
I've locked those two in the freezer.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,300
They will be popsicles soon.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,559
Not bad.

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,110
Boss, one more thing.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,990
We caught a young girl.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,999
A young girl?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,299
- Yes.
- That's interesting.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,199
Bring her to my office.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,390
Understood.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,830
You okay?

25
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,190
What could be wrong with me?

26
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,679
Don't give me that look.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,870
It's disgusting.

28
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,420
Yeah.

29
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,060
Evil lives long.

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,630
Look for something to keep warm.

31
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,909
I'm not spending the night

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,399
stuck in here with you.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,870
Go out if you dare!

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,430
If you get frostbite,

35
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,630
Ms. Mu will come after me.

36
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,100
Right?

37
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,060
Here, put this on.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,060
Don't touch me.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,489
Don't touch me!

40
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,190
You're making me dizzy.

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,490
Fine.

42
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,890
Suit yourself.

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,659
You have all the muscles,

44
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,859
broad shoulders,

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,330
but not one bit of resilience.

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,810
You can't handle a bit of pain.

47
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,979
What kind of lab is this?

48
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,450
There's not even an alcohol lamp.

49
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,570
Let me see it.

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,829
- What's your deal?
- What's wrong with you?

51
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,080
- What are you doing? That's disgusting.
- You're freezing. I'm helping.

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,279
I'm warning you, don't touch me!

53
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,379
- You're freezing. I'm keeping you warm.
- I said don't.

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,539
Psycho. You're a pervert.

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,730
Disgusting.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,290
Fine. Freeze to death.

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,130
Suit yourself.

58
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,930
Pretty girl.

59
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,179
Let me introduce myself.

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,330
I own this factory.

61
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,970
My name is Qin Bo.

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,890
Don't be scared.

63
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,530
You have me with you tonight.

64
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,850
Mr. Qin.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,000
No rush.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,810
The night is still young.

67
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,250
How about we start with a drink?

68
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,050
I like your style.

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,930
Smart girl. I like it.

70
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,330
Don't sleep.

71
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,859
I won't.

72
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,250
You sound weak.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,370
Aren't you usually quick to snap back

74
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,210
and always ready with a comeback?

75
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,770
Come on, give me one.

76
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,610
Shut up.

77
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,130
Shut up.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,410
Wake up.

79
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,530
- I'm fine.
- Chen Jiachuan!

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,890
You know
what Xiaotong told me about you?

81
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,410
She said

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,010
you had a bad temper.

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,850
Stubborn as a mule.

84
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,250
Always quick to lash out.

85
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,739
And impossible to calm down.

86
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,450
Nonsense.

87
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,800
My sister would never
say that about me.

88
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,569
I also heard

89
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,210
Instructor Dong wanted me
kicked out of training camp.

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,090
You were the one who stopped it.

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,530
You know why he said that?

92
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,810
Because, just like you,

93
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,450
his mind was messed up.

94
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,290
Did you seriously waste your strength
on a comeback?

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,370
You really are crazy.

96
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,930
Open your mouth.

97
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,970
Have some candy.

98
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,480
Bai Fan.

99
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,930
Once you get out of here,

100
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,530
find Yaoji.

101
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,250
Crack the files.

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,490
Get justice for my sister.

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,770
Stop talking like that.

104
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,370
Please.

105
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,170
Tell Yaoji yourself.

106
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,210
We're both getting out of here.

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,370
Don't start acting like a coward.

108
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,130

110
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,119
Wake up.

Don't fall asleep. Chen Jiachuan.

120

Hit me.

Come on, fight me!

122
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,689

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,099
Say something!

Chen Jiachuan!

126
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,810
Jiang Zhen?

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,290
Bai?

128
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,130
You're awake.

129
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,770
Yeah.

130
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,210
How's it going?

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,770
Did you crack the password?

132
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,010
- Don't worry about that. Just rest.
- Tell me.

133
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,010
Is the disc decrypted?

134
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,130
There's nothing on it.

135
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,240
What?

136
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,930
Why is there nothing?

137
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,210
Where's the data from
the day Xiaotong was hurt?

138
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,250
I'm getting out of here.

139
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,170
Get out of my way!

140
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,370
Bai Fan.

141
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,690
What's wrong with my leg?

142
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,650
The doctor said

143
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,019
you had an old injury.

144
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,930
This time, the heavy blow and the cold

145
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,650
made it worse. You need proper rest.

146
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,850
Get out!

147
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,859
If you push yourself now,

148
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,650
you could be disabled for life.

149
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,099
Out!

150
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,290
Out!

151
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,219
Out!

152
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,410
Out!

153
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,179
Qin Bo's been arrested.

155
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,730
we recovered the chip.

156
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,850
Got it.

157
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,370
You can go.

158
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,090
We got the chip.

159
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,770
The plan can proceed.

160
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,370
