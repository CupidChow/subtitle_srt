00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,470
Stop hitting me!

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,990
Not the face! Not the face!

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,770
He's with us.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,169
Who's this?

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm Yaoji.

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,750
So you two are in it together.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,779
- Third Young Master?
- Third Young Master?

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,739
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,059
You dare hit me?

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,419
I'll kill you for that.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,059
Stop it!

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,250
Stop!

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,219
Jiang Zhen.

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,579
How could you trip him?

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,619
When did I trip him?

28
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,379
I saw you trip him.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,819
Shut up.

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,119
I said you'd be dead weight.

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,579
- Telling me to shut up?
- You shut up.

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,019
What?

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,499
Why are you always causing trouble?

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,459
Setting me up again?

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,099
I'm not crazy.

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,139
Why would I set you up?

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,019
I'll hit you!

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,419
Hands off. Where are your manners?

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,979
Come on.

40
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,170
Go on, hit me.

41
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,339
Get me to a hospital.

42
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,690
Or you'll regret it!

43
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,690
Higher.

44
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,259
A little higher.

45
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,810
- Here?
- Yeah.

46
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,059
How's the lead coming?

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,090
I went to where she was last seen.

48
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,090
I only found a car.

49
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,339
(Someone said they saw a girl)

50
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,619
(about her height and build.)

51
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,019
(Someone must've taken her)

52
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,690
(when the car broke down.)

53
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,530
Brother.

54
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,650
Private meeting?

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,890
What's that?

56
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,370
Share it with me.

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,179
None of your business.

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,810
Take care of your young master.

59
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,730
Petty.

60
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,730
Wow, Jiang Zhen.

61
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,810
Look what you did to him.

62
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,619
If only we had some yellow wine.

63
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,810
This stuff

64
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,130
is great for bruises.

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,330
What?

66
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,730
Yellow wine.

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,250
You stole yellow wine
from the canteen again?

68
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,290
Who stole it?

69
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,259
I went through a lot of trouble

70
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,099
to get this

71
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,259
for your back.

72
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,339
This stuff

73
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,699
is great for bruises.

74
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,010
Hang in there.

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,250
Easy.

76
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,339
Ow.

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,770
Can't handle a little pain?

78
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,250
Who says I can't?

79
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,899
Easy.

80
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,090
I am being gentle.

81
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,619
Don't be so skittish.

82
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,339
That's fine.

83
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,530
Do more.

84
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,330
Too bad we don't have any yellow wine.

85
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,370
Third Young Master.

86
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,650
You're heavy.

87
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,770
Jiang Zhen, can you even drive?

88
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,099
Darn it.

89
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,259
He got away.

90
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,690
Jiang Zhen, you liar!

91
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,570
Third Young Master.

92
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,370
Mind the waist.

93
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,259
Just my luck today.

94
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,339
We didn't find her,

95
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,619
and I sprained my waist.

96
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,170
No, the lead is gone too.

97
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,770
Third Young Master.

98
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,899
With me here,

99
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,410
we'd never lose the lead.

100
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,850
How's the lead coming?

101
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,699
I know this place.

102
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,890
I've seen it before.

103
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,250
Go on.

104
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,970
The last place the young mistress
was seen was this bar.

105
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,890
Are you the owner?

106
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,339
Yeah, why?

107
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,650
Have you seen this girl?

108
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,170
No, I've never seen her.

109
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,090
Boss, this is urgent.

110
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,849
I said I haven't seen her.

111
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,219
You dressed like a beggar.

112
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,850
You shouldn't be at a bar.

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,810
Say it. Will you talk or not?
Alright, I was wrong, sir.

114
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,579
I had no idea who you were. Have mercy!

115
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,970
Spare me, sir!

116
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,530
I prefer something else.

117
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,859
What's going on?

118
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,739
Do your job

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,050
or get lost.

120
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,650
Let me look again, sir.

121
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,850
Stop it.

122
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,090
Let me help you.

123
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,810
You're not hurt, are you?

124
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,779
You...

125
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,899
What is it?

126
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,330
My sister's missing.

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,019
I came to check the bar.

128
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,819
- Will you talk or not?
- Let me look again. I'll look again!

129
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,010
Let me check again.

130
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,450
Has she been here these past few days?

131
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,810
Yes!

132
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,979
I...

133
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,099
I think I've seen her.

134
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,250
Sir, I've got it.

135
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,690
Private room, second floor.
The one at the very end.

136
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,970
(I must find her before Bai Fan does.)

137
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,210
Feifei, keep me company.

138
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,859
That hit the spot.

139
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,170
Pour me another.

140
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,699
- Keep drinking.
- Alright.

141
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,890
Slow down.

142
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,530
We meet again.

143
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,370
Your nose is sharp.

144
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,059
You followed my scent here?

145
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,050
All thanks to my captain's training.

146
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,130
They look strange, don't they?

147
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,410
This is public.

148
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,930
Watch your manners.

149
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,010
It's alright, miss.

150
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,760
I can't drink anymore.

151
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,779
Darn it!

152
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,050
You're asking for it.

153
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,250
Who are you two?

154
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,090
Are you Nong Qianya?

155
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,650
Am I right?

156
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,290
Are you deaf or something?

157
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,050
Do you know who I am?

158
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,770
Get back here.

159
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,650

Calm down.

Where are you taking my person?

178
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,659
What do you mean, your person?

179
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,579
I found her first.

180
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,330
What do you mean you found her first?

181
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,539
Be honest with yourself.

182

Without me,

183
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,059
could you have found her?

184
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,859
You taught me

185
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,419
that everything has an order.

186
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,090
When will you ever grow up?

187
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,739
Always so scheming.

188
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,610
Ya, turn around first.

189
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,450
Are you out of your mind?

190
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,630
- Will you give it up already?
- Where are your manners?

191
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,619
Do you have no shame?

192
