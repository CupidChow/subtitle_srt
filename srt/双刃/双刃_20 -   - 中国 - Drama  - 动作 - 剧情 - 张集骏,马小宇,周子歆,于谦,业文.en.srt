Tell me.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,940
I'll take care of them for you.

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,110
My brother has been gone for days.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,630
He hasn't even called.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,830
I'm worried something happened.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,610
That sounds like separation anxiety.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,699
Why not

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,770
find someone to keep you company?

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,330
Get lost.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,890
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,530
Didn't I say no visitors?

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,890
It's me.

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,939
Brother?

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,130
Don't turn around.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,899
Alright.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,539
Lately,

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,379
I've been tailed
by people from Amethyst Group.

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,579
Find me a place

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,850
to lay low for a day.

36
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,650
Leave it to me.

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,290
Jiang Zhen.

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,850
Why did you betray me?

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,250
Where's Bai Fan?

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,970
He's fine.

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,370
Just like me.

42
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,579
Mu Jie.

43
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,170
Are you really going to keep
helping them do evil?

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,859
Have I ever really had a choice

45
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,610
in any of these?

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,210
And today,

47
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,370
I have to take you with me.

48
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,859
Hold it.

49
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,170
He's with me.

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,650
So the Prince intends

51
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,370
to openly go against Amethyst Group now?

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,290
I'm taking him today no matter what.

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,960
Are you saying
you're representing Amethyst Group

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,810
to break with me for good?

55
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,050
Take him.

56
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,090
Cursed women.

57
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,050
Since you already have him,

58
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,010
make sure you hide him well.

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,450
Don't let Amethyst Group

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,090
find him again.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,930
The Prince took me on a detour

62
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,019
to make sure no one saw me

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,490
before bringing me here.

64
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,970
This is evidence of Amethyst Group's
illegal experiments.

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,770
Bai Fan helped too.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,410
There are others involved.

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,740
Are you crazy?

68
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,900
Run already!

69
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,930
Nong Cangnan.

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,050
It's fine.

71
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,139
You can turn me in anytime.

72
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,890
What do you take me for?

73
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,379
This is proof that Amethyst Group used

74
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,130
disabled people for illegal research.

75
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,629
I'm human,

76
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,730
not a beast.

77
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,019
Hand it over

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,859
to Gale Training Camp

79
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,050
or the police.

80
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,459
Just don't let them

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,770
do these experiments.

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,930
It's too awful to watch.

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,650
Don't worry.

84
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,850
I'll hand it to the police.

85
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,899
You didn't directly
take part in the crimes,

86
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,610
and now you're helping.

87
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,330
It won't implicate you.

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,090
It doesn't matter.

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,310
If Amethyst Group goes down,

90
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,510
I'll lose my income.

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,310
I might even end up in prison.

92
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,110
But maybe that's not so bad.

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,670
At least I won't starve.

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,690
Nong Cangnan.

95
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,930
I didn't expect...

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,850
Anyway,

97
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,650
thanks.

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,930

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,010
I need your approval for something.

100
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,330
Go ahead.

101

Chen Jiachuan,

102
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,370
requesting to rejoin the team.

103
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,090
Approved.

105
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,979

106

107
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,850
I know you are anxious to save him.

108
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,730
But the police

109
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,730
are already handling the investigation.

110
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,819

112
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,899
When I left Amethyst Group
with the evidence in hand,

113
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,250
I swore

114
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,090
I would never abandon my comrade.

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,890
I must save him.

116
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,610
Alright.

117
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,130
I will hand the evidence

118
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,650

119
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,730
As for Bai Fan,

120
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,410
that is up to you.

121
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,699
Don't worry.

122
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,930
I'm only going for him.
