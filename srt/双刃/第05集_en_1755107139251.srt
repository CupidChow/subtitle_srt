Vice Director Jiang.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,589
What is it?

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,990
Mr. Mu asked me to remind you

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,700
to find out the method to unlock
the secondary key as soon as possible.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,190
Got it. You may go.

18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,980
Vice Director Jiang.

19
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,220
I forgot to mention earlier,

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,630
Mr. Mu wants Vice Director Bai
to work with you.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,310
Get out.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,510
Vice Director Bai.

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,390
What now?

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,110
HR asked me to let you know
that your background check has passed.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,750
Wait.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,039
What?

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,129
Thinking of admitting defeat?

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,350
It's still too soon to say who will win.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,390
Anything else you forgot to say?

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,709
No, that's all.

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,350
Sorry to disturb you.
Don't catch a cold.

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,010
Vice Director Jiang and Vice Director Bai
fought in the office over a position.

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,610
They're holding each other in check now.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,850
You should be at ease now, right?

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,979
A tie.

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,819
Let's watch together.

37
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,170
No one hides anything from anyone.

Whose face is that?

41
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,019
Intern.

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,650
Did you finish printing
what I asked for?

43
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,330
- Why is it taking so long?
- I'm working on it. Almost done.

44
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,610
Get me a cup of water.

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,290
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,210
What's with you?

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,410
Has our company
run out of people to hire?

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,850
Why are we
recruiting all sorts of riffraff?

49
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,939
Exactly, Vice Director Jiang.

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,480
You should straighten out HR.

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,699
They're letting all kinds
of strays into the company.

52
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,210
I'm talking about you.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,290
I forgot to make the introductions.

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,899
This

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,339
is our chairman's younger sister,

56
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,530
Nong Qianya.

57
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,410
If any of you
make mistakes in the future,

58
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,090
remember to go to her
to receive your punishment.

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,379
Yes.

60
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,130
Young mistress, let me have that.

61
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,170
I will get my work handled
as soon as possible.

62
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,010
If there's nothing else,
I'll get back to work.

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,210
Young mistress,
please guide us with our work.

64
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,330
Sit.

65
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,339
Before an employee joins,

66
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,059
they need a nice ID photo.

67
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,419
We'll make one for you ourselves.

68
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,130
Full service for the young mistress.

69
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,690

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,370
Thank you for earlier.

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,219
If there's nothing else,

72
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,650
I'll get back to work.

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,250
Remember to give a five-star rating.

74
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,650
Bai Fan,

75
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,090
I was the one who saved her.

76
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,050
How did it turn into thanking you?

77
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,810
Don't be jealous.

78
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,929
Back when you were my instructor,
I already wanted to tell you this.

79
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,969
You always wore that scowl.

80
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,859
Who wouldn't avoid you?

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,259
With your kind of attitude,

82
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,939
opportunistic

83
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,330
and untrustworthy.

84
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,530
Next time, I'll treat you to a meal.

85
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,530
Brother Bai.

86
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,210
When will that be?

87
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,610
I'll personally come pick you up.

88
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,299
Just now,

89
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,610
it was you all.

90
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,050
Now she's directly inviting you to eat.

91
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,610
Then what am I?

92
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,170
Handsome,

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,370
but a bit of a headache.

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,600
(Enter password)

95
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,530
It needs a password.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,290
Leave this kind of thing to Yaoji.

97
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,019

102
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,539
Gale Training Camp
has received a request from the police

103
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,530
to intercept the execution
of its key authentication command.

104
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,299
How's the situation on your end?

105
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,370
Acceptance passed,
and hostility maxed out.

106
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,650
I declare Operation Higher

107
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,370
officially launched.

112
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,290
How long will it take
to crack the disc password?

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,939
At least two weeks.

114
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,739
Faster.

115
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,090
Get it done in one week.

116
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,370
Here's the experimental data
from Xiaotong's accident vehicle.

117
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,850
I've waited three years.

118
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,330
I don't want to wait any longer.

119
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,259
Brother.

120
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,570
Do I sing well?

121
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,850
Yes.

122
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,810
Then I'll sing for you every day
from now on.

123
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,610
(Chen Jiachuan.)

124
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,170
(How long do you intend
to keep punishing yourself?)

125
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,890
May I sit?

126
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,410
Go ahead.

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,210
At least let the song finish.

128
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,050
What did you say?

129
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,730
I remember Xiaotong
used to love this song.

130
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,059
Be a man.

131
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,290
Say what you want directly.

132
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,930
Alright.

133
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,730
We had some misunderstandings before.

134
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,410
But it's not like
we should cut ties forever.

135
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,819
We're old friends.

136
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,010
It's nothing.

137
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,259
At least finish this drink.

138
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,690
I'm not drinking with you.

139
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,010
It's not much.

140
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,450
Just two glasses.

141
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,210
Not even one.

142
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,410
Sorry, brother.

143
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,690
Back in Gale, you could really
hold your liquor, couldn't you?

144
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,450
Don't you dare bring up Gale.

145
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,139
Alright. You've had too much to drink,
so you call the shots.

146
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,179
Fine, you win.

147
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,339
Come on, sit down.

148
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,770
Easy now.

149
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,170
If you can't handle it,
don't push yourself.

150
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,970
You saying I can't?

151
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,010
Let me ask you.

152
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,330
Is there anyone in this world
you haven't argued with?

153
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,010
That's me teaching
the world how to behave.

154
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,339
Have you ever thought

155
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,530
that maybe

156
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,610
Gale never gave up on you

157
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,530
but you gave up on Gale?

158
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,259
So what you mean is

159
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,110
you went undercover in Amethyst Group

160
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,410
to stand up for me?

161
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,090
Would you believe me if I said
I was saving you from the fire?

162
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,170
Don't even think about it.

163
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,490
Take one of these when you get back.

164
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,890
You'll wake up more of a man tomorrow.

165
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,210
Trying to poison me?

166
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,450
Yes.

167
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,730
Poison you.

168
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,939
Take it or leave it.

169
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,130
If you won't, throw it away.

170
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,010
Go home yourself.

171
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,130
Just try throwing it away.

172
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,530

to see you like this.)
