Jiachuan.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,630
I'm sorry

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,119
for Xiaotang's passing.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,319
But there are rules and laws

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,599
for everything.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,480
You ignored orders
and acted on your own.

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,780
Do you realize how serious that is?

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,379
I had no choice.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,479
I couldn't stop myself!

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,750
I couldn't do it!

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,119
I couldn't just

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,039
let Xiaotong

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,630
die in vain.

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,940
I'm begging you.

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,540
Please.

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,470
Let me keep investigating.

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,140
Didn't you hear what I just said?

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,830
Chen Jiachuan.

31
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,630
Listen to me.

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,019
As long as you're in Gale Training Camp,

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,450
you follow the rules here!

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,030
Fine.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,630
Then I resign.

36
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,279
Chen Jiachuan.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,509
Why are you doing this?

38
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,349
My only family died without reason.

39
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,599
Without an autopsy, how will I know why?

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,309
Doing this over and over again

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,540
is pointless.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,709
Can't you just let her rest in peace?

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,100
Get out of my way!

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,100
(Chen Jiachuan.)

45
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,500
(What am I going to do with you?)

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,310
Eat.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,990
No.

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,870
I said eat.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,470
I told you, I'm not hungry.

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,060
Suit yourself.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,990
Zhen.

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,750
How are you feeling?

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,030
How do you think?

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,780
You know.

55
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,380
It's you I care about.

56
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,470
I'm tired. I want to rest.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,160
If there's nothing else, please go.

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,519
Vice Director Bai.

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,780
- Ms. Mu.
- You've both worked hard lately.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,190
The company has decided

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,310
to give you a month off.

62
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,390
Get some proper rest.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,050
It's no trouble, Ms. Mu.

64
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,869
In your twenties,

65
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,289
this is when you should be working.

66
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,039
Not resting.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,639
Captain Jiang is used to working alone.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,780
There's no one looking out for him.

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,710
So I'm counting on you
to take care of him.

70
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,460
Ms. Mu.

71
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,820
Ms. Mu?

72
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,750
Why aren't you saying anything?

73
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,359
You can't investigate in a ward.

74
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,739
Why should I care?

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,030
You went undercover
in Amethyst Group for that case.

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,150
Yeah.

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,719
I did it for the case.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,509
That was before.

79
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,679
I don't care anymore.

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,300
- Chen Jiachuan, you...
- Bai Fan.

81
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,620
If you don't let me rest,

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,830
I'll tell Mu Jie who you really are.

83
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,070
Gale and you

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,860
mean nothing to me.

85
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,950

98
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,280
Bai.

99
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,790
How are you feeling?

100
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,980
I'm fine.

101
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,569
I had some free time this afternoon,

102
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,820
so I thought I'd drop by.

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,390
How's Jiang?

104
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,380
Him?

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,510
See for yourself.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,710
I told you to get out!

107
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,780
See? Still the same bad temper.

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,300
You've scared Ya.

109
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,790
Flowers for you.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,350
Hope you get well soon.

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,470
Hope you recover soon, Brother.

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,100
When I was a kid,

113
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,860
Nong Cangnan played a prank on me.

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,270
He poured boiling water over my head.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,159
The wound festered
and kept getting infected.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,620
I had to keep reapplying medicine.

117
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,300
Back then, I thought

118
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,180
it would never heal.

119
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,420
But with time,

120
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,950
it eventually did.

121
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,380
See?

122
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,100
Now there's nothing left.

123
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,070
So,

124
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,580
Jiang Zhen,

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,710
others may give up on you,

126
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,950
but you can never

127
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,220
give up on yourself.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,190
Right?

129
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,180
See? She gets it.

130
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,039
You should be ashamed to act

131
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,829
so dramatic.

132
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,919
Cut it out.

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,220
That's enough.

134
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,999
You expect me to sit in a wheelchair?

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,710
You're almost discharged.
I can't exactly carry you out.

136
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,910
Bai Fan, what's that supposed to mean?
You think I'd let you carry me?

137
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,940
A wheelchair?

138
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,039
No way. Absolutely not.

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,309
And why not?

140
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,119
Why?

141
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,749
Because only trash like Nong Cangnan

142
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,940
would sit in one.

143
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,430
Only someone like him
would use a wheelchair.

144
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,220
Am I wrong?

145
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,319
Sorry.

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,510
Sorry, sorry.

147
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,340
Terribly sorry, madam.

148
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,630
Sorry, madam.

149
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,749
You know what to say later?

150
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,079
We agreed you'd say it.

151
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,439
No. We agreed you'd say it.

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,020
If I say it, he won't take it.

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,670
Jiang Zhen.

154
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,079
To celebrate your discharge,

155
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,950
we got you a gift.

156
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,430
This should be fine, right?

157
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,430
Slow down.

158
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,020
There's a first time for everything.

159
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,740
Careful.

160
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,980
Your place is as lifeless as you are.

161
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,860
Cut the crap.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,260
This one's for external use.

163
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,419
This one's oral.

164
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,790
This one's for external use too.

165
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,269
You know the other two.

166
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,620
When are you leaving?

167
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,710
I looked after you day and night,

168
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,500
and this is how you thank me?

169
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,149
Why should I thank you?

170
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,309
Did I ask you to do it?

171
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,710
Did I beg you?

172
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,079
Fine. I was being sentimental.

173
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,220
No problem.

174
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,370
As long as you step out right now

175
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,550
and close the door behind you,

176
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,070
I'll forgive you.

177
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,350
