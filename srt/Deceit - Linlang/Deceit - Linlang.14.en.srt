How are you and Sir Emilio doing?

1075
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,336
Have you made up already?

1076
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,841
Alex, we can't afford to lose work.

[JULIANA] You know our
situation now, right?

1078
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,889
We have a lot of payments due at the bank.

1079
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,725
Don't worry about it. I'm working on it.

1080
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,935
Where's Abby?

1081
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,355
- Getting ready for school.
- Abby, eat your breakfast.

1082
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,273
I'm not hungry.

1083
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,694
Can you take me to school now?

1084
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,406
You've been acting weird since yesterday.

1085
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,615
Is there a problem, Abby?

Why did you kick Grandma Amelia out?

1090
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,044
Who said I kicked her out?

Hello, Matteo. Any update?

1094
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,683
I sent someone to keep tabs
on Badong's gym.

1095
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:12,812
So far, nothing to worry about.

1096

Except for Aunt Amelia.

What do you mean?

1098
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,320
She went there last night with her stuff.

1099
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,157
I think she's staying with Victor.
