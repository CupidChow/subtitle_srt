I hope you don't
deprive Victor of that right.

908
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,242
Does your mother know your
classmates are bullying you?

909
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,411
She doesn't need to know.

910
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,165
I don't want her and Uncle Alex to worry.

They've already been through a lot.

913

They've suffered enough because of me.

914
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,470
I don't want to add
to their problems again.

915
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,431
I'm fine, Daddy.

916
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,266
In fact, I'm more than fine.

Everything is perfect.

We have an invitation for the opening
of our new gym franchise.

923
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,795
It's important that you're there.

924
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,089
It will give us a lot of publicity
and advertising

925
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,424
which will help our franchise grow.

926
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,136
I wasn't wrong about choosing you, Alex.

927
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:17,058
It's evident that the business
is more successful because of me.

928
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:23,022
So, is it too much to ask you
to make me your business partner?

929
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,696
Do you still have to think about it?

930
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,451
I have no problem with that.

931
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,248
But you also have to invest.

932
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,711
Do you have enough capital for that?

933
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,756
Can't you consider all the help
I've given you an investment?

It's not easy to run a business, Alex.

00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,517
money?

938
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,686

from your matches?
