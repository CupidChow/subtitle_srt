You need to be there for the good times
and the bad times.

1069
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,266
You need to face everything together.

1070
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,939
It will strengthen your relationship.

1071
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,193
So, sorry if…

1072
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,405
if I didn't get to do
those things with you.

1073
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,493
That's in the past now.

1074
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,704
I'm happy for

1075
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,330
you and Olivia.

1076
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,792
Thank you.

1077
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,336
I would be happier if…

1078
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,798
I got to spend more time with Abby.

1079
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,930
Alex is still really upset.

1080
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,057
It's starting to affect Abby.

1081
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,438
It would be better if she stayed with you
from time to time.

1082
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,232
But I have one request, Victor.

1083
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,025
What is it?

1084
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,362
Alex can't find out you're with Abby.

1085
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,947
Juliana.

1086
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,282
[ABBY] Daddy.

1087
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,743
What's going on?

1088
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:32,665
Alex, Victor and Olivia
are my new clients.

1089
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,083
They're getting married.

1090
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,501
Oh, really?

1091
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,171
Come on, let's go.

1092
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,172
[ALEX] Wait a minute.

1093
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,257
Don't leave yet.

1094
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,968
Why don't you join us for dinner?

1095
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,304
Let's celebrate your upcoming wedding.

1096
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:53,394
