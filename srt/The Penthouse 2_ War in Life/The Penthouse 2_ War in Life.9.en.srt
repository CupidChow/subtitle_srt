6
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,700
You're up, Ms. Na Ae Gyo.

7
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:39,451
Who are you?

8
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,326
Where the heck are we?

9
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,159
I went out of my way to save you,

10
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,825
yet you have a violent way of thanking me.

11
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:49,409
I guess you only look like Soo Ryeon.

12
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,409
I said who the heck are you?

13
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:54,992
I'm Logan Lee.

14
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:57,742
We've met two years ago.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,867
Logan Lee?

16
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:00,825
I don't know anybody by that name.

17
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,159
Cut this rubbish right now and get lost.

18
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:07,326
Wait.

19
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,451
I'm not trying to hurt you.

20
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,909
What were you going to tell me back then?

21
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,034
That's all I want to hear from you.

22
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,117
Move away from me unless you want to die.

23
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:19,618
It won't even take a punch

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,783
to take down someone like you.

25
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,576
Until the day Soo Ryeon died,

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,409
you played Soo Ryeon's part

27
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:32,242
and pretended to be Joo Dan Tae's wife.

28
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,284
You lobbied Representative Jung Doo Man

29
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,700
of Happy Future Party

30
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:37,618
and other politicians, businessmen

31
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:39,576
to get insider information,

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,492
and made a huge fortune.

33
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:44,451
But two years ago, you clearly wanted

34
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:46,409
to split up with Joo Dan Tae.

35
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:48,950
That's why you wanted to see me.

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,242
Stop talking nonsense.

37
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:53,618
I never said anything like that.

38
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:57,242
Dan Tae is the only person I trust.

39
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,534
This voice!

40
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,326
This is obviously you!

41
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:06,451
I'm Na Ae Gyo.

42
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:08,700
There's something I must tell you

43
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,075
before I leave.

44
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:13,992
Everything Dan Tae did to Soo Ryeon,

45
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,200
and what he's truly like.

46
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,409
Today might be the only chance

47
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:19,451
I can tell you this.

48
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:20,950
Back then,

49
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:23,783
you meant it.

50
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:25,742
You were...

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,576
You were desperate.

52
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,034
Back then?

53
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,034
I guess we got into a fight.

54
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,492
I did that spontaneously out of spite.

55
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,992
I have a short temper.

56
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:43,659
Then would it be okay

57
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:46,034
if I let Joo Dan Tae listen to this?

58
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,117
Sure.

59
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:48,950
Run along and let him listen to it.

60
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:50,659
Are you trying

61
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,950
to threaten me with this?

62
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,950
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,117
However, my relationship with Dan Tae's

64
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,242
much tighter and deeper than you imagine.

65
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,700
We even had kids together.

66
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,618
Do you think a few words could shake me?

67
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:12,909
Don't get so cute,

68
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,576
and don't ever come back to see me.

69
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,075
We meet again.

70
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,326
What is this?

71
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,200
Did you and that man work together

72
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,117
to approach me?

73
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:36,783
You two must be utterly delusional.

74
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,618
I'm Joo Dan Tae's woman.

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,326
And the twins' biological mother.

76
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,576
He tried

77
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:45,950
to kill you.

78
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:47,909
You almost died today.

79
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,326
You never know

80
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:51,867
when he'll abandon you

81
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,992
like he did with Soo Ryeon.

82
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,326
Yet you still want to take his side

83
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,200
to keep your petty loyalty to him?

84
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,326
What do you know about him anyway?

85
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,242
I've also been

86
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,367
miserably betrayed by him.

87
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,992
I became a fugitive then almost died

88
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,117
because of that man.

89
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,451
I'm sure

90
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:10,700
it won't be too different with you.

91
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,242
I'm sure you'd know best,

92
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,242
how Joo Dan Tae

93
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:17,117
deals with someone he doesn't need.

94
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:18,367
We're giving you a chance

95
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,159
to abandon him before he abandons you.

96
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:23,950
You should cooperate with us, Na Ae Gyo.

97
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,783
Who the heck are you two?

98
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,034
"Seok Hoon"

99
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:32,909
Hello?

100
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:35,284
Hey, Seok Hoon. It's me.

101
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,909
Is everything okay?

102
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,909
I called because I got worried.

103
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:40,950
Yes, I'm fine. What about you?

104
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:44,034
Did my dad do something again?

105
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,742
No, I'm fine.

106
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:47,867
I'm glad you sound fine.

107
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:49,117
I'll have to go now.

108
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,909
Don't you miss

109
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,367
your children?

110
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,326
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

111
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,659
I'll help you meet them.

112
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,992
Aren't you two a little too cute?

113
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,284
You're using something like that

114
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,492
to buy me out?

115
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,200
If I had a hint of love as their mum,

116
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,659
I wouldn't have run away

117
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,618
with those babies behind.

118
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:30,200
Gosh, motherhood?

119
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,034
I can't stand anything like that.

120
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:36,783
Do you know what he does to his kids?

121
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,825
Your children are getting abused.

122
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,783
They're getting tortured!

123
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,909
Still,

124
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:46,034
you want them to grow up with that psycho?

125
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,284
You'd better watch your mouth

126
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,992
when you speak about my family business.

127
00:05:58,618 --> 00:05:59,534
Let her go.

128
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,867
We can't let her go like this.

129
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,117
What if she tells everything to Dan Tae?

130
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,825
We can't help it.

131
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,075
So you're going to give up like this?

132
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:09,867
I can't do that.

133
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:11,409
She said all those things,

134
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:13,742
but I saw her eyes get shaken.

135
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:16,200
Let's just hope

136
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:17,909
she has some kind of maternal love left.

137
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:28,950
Where have you been?

138
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,159
Why won't you pick up your phone?

139
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:31,492
Were you with another man?

140
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,992
You're the one who tried to kill me.

141
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:35,618
Don't be so brazen.

142
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:37,618
Why did you do that, you jerk?

143
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,825
Now that you sold off those buildings,

144
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,534
you wanted to kill me

145
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:41,451
because I'm useless now?

146
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,200
I couldn't understand why you did that

147
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:44,284
two years ago, so I wanted to make sure.

148
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,326
What couldn't you understand?

149
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,992
I got kicked out to Thailand quietly

150
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,576
and kept a low profile as you suggested.

151
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,492
That's...

152
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,659
I told you to leave for a bit

153
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,075
since Sim Soo Ryeon died.

154
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,742
You weren't to be seen by anyone else.

155
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,451
But why did you keep avoiding me?

156
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,200
You won't pick up your phone or come back!

157
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,242
You completely shut me out!

158
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,034
How am I supposed to take that?

159
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:08,200
Honey.

160
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:10,159
We're wonderful partners.

161
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,159
We've always been one since ages ago.

162
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,909
I won't betray you

163
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,534
as long as you don't betray me.

164
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:25,659
Dan Tae, this is the last time

165
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,783
you do something cheeky like this.

166
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:29,783
If you do something like this again,

167
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,117
I'll put a bullet through your head.

168
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:34,867
Do you understand?

169
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,242
Finally.

170
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:44,242
It sounds like Ae Gyo is here.

171
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,742
Anyway.

172
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,700
You were pretty sexy back there.

173
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,242
You almost made my heart race.

174
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,200
Why don't we grab a drink to celebrate

175
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:57,576
our reconciliation?

176
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,492
I was scared that you changed your mind.

177
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,367
You do know how much you mean to me.

178
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:18,159
We need to pull

179
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:19,992
our big heist with Cheonsu District.

180
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,367
At the very least, until that day,

181
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,159
I'm not going to get another idea.

182
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:26,034
"Voice Spy"

183
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:30,576
It sounds like Dan Tae and Ae Gyo

184
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,576
are much closer than we thought.

185
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,534
No.

186
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,909
I just detected a bit of trouble.

187
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:37,367
She didn't tell him

188
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,326
about meeting us.

189
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,451
Call us whenever you change your mind.

190
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,909
I'll help you meet

191
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:57,117
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

192
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:04,534
What brings you here?

193
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:06,867
Chairman Joo isn't home yet.

194
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:10,576
I stopped by to check

195
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,992
his tuxedo for our wedding.

196
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:13,825
I have to check the shoulder width.

197
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:17,242
You may go.

198
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,200
Yes, Ms. Cheon.

199
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,825
This necklace is your daughter's, right?

200
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:44,200
We found her DNA

201
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,576
and the victim's blood on it.

202
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:10,992
Where did he put that thing?

203
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:23,950
Oh.

204
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:31,659
What are you doing here?

205
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,034
Why are you being like a rat

206
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,659
in my room?

207
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,950
Are you looking for this?

208
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,825
"Bio M and J"

209
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,992
Give it to me.

210
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,534
You have no reason to keep that now.

211
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,242
I did everything as you said.

212
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:20,492
I sent out our wedding invitations

213
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:21,618
and got a dress too.

214
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,742
I'll be there at the wedding as promised,

215
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,367
so give me that necklace.

216
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,284
Giving this back to you isn't a problem,

217
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:30,409
but do you really think

218
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,200
this is the only card I have?

219
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,075
What do you mean?

220
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,242
I heard Eun Byeol was put on an IV.

221
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:42,451
So? Did her memories disappear like magic?

222
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,492
How can Dr. Ha

223
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:47,576
experiment with a drug still in testing

224
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:49,326
on his daughter?

225
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,326
If he's still a licensed doctor,

226
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,534
he shouldn't do that.

227
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,492
If any side effects kick in,

228
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,117
not only will it ruin her life,

229
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,825
he'll get locked up behind bars too.

230
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,200
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin.

231
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,200
Why don't you understand?

232
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,326
I already told you that

233
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:11,367
you can't be freed from me.

234
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,367
It's time to just accept your fate,

235
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,867
unless you want to bring back

236
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,034
your daughter's memory.

237
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:21,659
Do you understand,

238
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,284
my dear Seo Jin?

239
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,367
"Yoon Chul"

240
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
"Sillim-dong Meant to Be"

241
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,117
What the heck are you thinking?

242
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,950
You're marrying Chairman Joo?

243
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,451
You said you won't do that for Eun Byeol.

244
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,284
Don't you know what he's like?

245
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:18,867
I do!

246
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:20,200
But so what?

247
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:22,242
If a man's fiancee is

248
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:23,492
having an affair with her ex-husband,

249
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,576
of course, any man would get furious.

250
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:28,700
What's going on?

251
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:30,659
What happened between you and him?

252
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,367
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

253
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:33,659
You don't love him!

254
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,159
I'm not a naive 20-year-old girl.

255
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:36,783
Do you think I'm concerned about love?

256
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:40,950
A marriage is the biggest business

257
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:42,034
you can get in your life.

258
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,576
That's why I chose Dan Tae.

259
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,451
What about our daughter?

260
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:49,326
Do you think Eun Byeol will

261
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,284
accept this marriage?

262
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,159
I'm doing this for me.

263
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:02,451
You left Yoon Hee,

264
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:04,242
and that's all I needed.

265
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:06,159
I can never bear to see you

266
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,117
live a happy life with Yoon Hee.

267
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:10,783
What?

268
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:11,783
Why?

269
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:14,367
Didn't you know I was always like this?

270
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,492
I've been using you.

271
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,492
I had to cover up Eun Byeol's crime,

272
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:19,909
so I needed

273
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,117
your blind love for her as her father.

274
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,950
Then I pretended like I wanted you again

275
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,492
to get my revenge on Yoon Hee.

276
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:30,534
You're lying.

277
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,783
No matter how low you go,

278
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,659
you can't treat me like this.

279
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,659
Don't get so clingy, and get away from me.

280
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,075
I never wanted to go back

281
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,783
and be with you anyway.

282
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,242
The man who suits me

283
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,742
should be wealthy and gentle to his bones,

284
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:50,700
just like Dan Tae.

285
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:53,034
Seo Jin.

286
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,618
So take Eun Byeol and leave.

287
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,867
Go to the US or wherever you want.

288
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,950
You're going to abandon our daughter now?

289
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,492
My life is more important

290
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:05,534
than my daughter's life.

291
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:08,159
And this is better for her anyway.

292
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,950
So...

293
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,618
make sure you leave

294
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,909
before the wedding!

295
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,117
I am

296
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:23,492
done talking.

297
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,618
You are

298
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,117
the worst.

299
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:46,909
You need to...

300
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,326
You need to keep Eun Byeol safe now.

301
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,492
That's the only way now.

302
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
What's all this?

303
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,075
Wedding gifts from Chairman Joo.

304
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,451
He bought gifts for you too.

305
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:27,451
Do you want to see them?

306
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:28,992
He bought you

307
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,967
a dress and shoes for the wedding...

308
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,426
Is she determined

309
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,783
to go ahead with this ridiculous wedding?

310
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:35,950
Darn it.

311
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:42,742
Seok Hoon, where are you right now?

312
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,992
Isn't it hilarious?

313
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:47,867
Hey, wait.

314
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Ma Ri! Ma Ri!

315
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:52,117
Ma Ri!

316
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:55,409
Goodness, what are all these?

317
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:58,326
Why did you get so many designer's bags?

318
00:16:58,492 --> 00:16:59,950
These are from the Queens.

319
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:01,576
They were really thoughtful

320
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,200
because my birthday is coming up.

321
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,700
My goodness, they got you all these?

322
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,534
Wait, then all those new products you had

323
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,326
were gifts from the Three Queens?

324
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:12,159
I knew it.

325
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,618
You must be closer to them

326
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,867
than their families.

327
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,492
Those look heavy. Let me help.

328
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:18,700
Forget it.

329
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,284
Some might see it

330
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,950
and think I'm trying to order you around.

331
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:25,783
Who would have such thoughts?

332
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:28,075
My submission is voluntary.

333
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,825
Kyu Jin is good at carrying these.

334
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,117
I'm the politician with best manners

335
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,242
in the 21st National Assembly.

336
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,159
Let's go.

337
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,659
Good manners, my foot.

338
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:43,451
Hey, forget it! - Come on.

339
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:44,700
Give it back!

340
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:46,992
My gosh. - Be careful.

341
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,659
You're such an important person.

342
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,618
My goodness.

343
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,825
What's going on?

344
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:02,700
It's okay, they were bound to find out.

345
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,034
Let's go.

346
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,909
They're very friendly.

347
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,700
They're siblings!

348
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,867
On which floor did they start doing that?

349
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,242
What did you say?

350
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,409
Their parents already have a date set.

351
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:23,700
I can't believe Seok Hoon

352
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,117
and Eun Byeol began to date.

353
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
They do make a cute couple.

354
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:27,618
It made my heart flutter.

355
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:28,992
Chairman Joo.

356
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,700
What if your wedding falls through?

357
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:32,618
If they keep doing that,

358
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,742
the word will get around very quickly.

359
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,075
No one will hear about it

360
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,409
if you stay silent, Mr. Lee.

361
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,534
I'm a very quiet guy.

362
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Goodness.

363
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,034
Ma Ri was there too.

364
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,534
What if the word gets around her sauna?

365
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,742
It'll be game over.

366
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,451
Seok Hoon wouldn't do anything foolish.

367
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:52,075
I guess Eun Byeol came up

368
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,284
with a plan to stop the wedding.

369
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:54,700
And these immature kids take this further

370
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,117
if you react to them in any way

371
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,367
when they do something like this.

372
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,659
I'd like to refuse your high interest

373
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:00,992
in my family affairs.

374
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,534
You can go that way and get lost.

375
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,659
Chairman Joo,

376
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,534
you can be honest with me.

377
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,825
Why do you want to go ahead

378
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,659
with this marriage anyway?

379
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,576
Your fiancee got together with Yoon Chul.

380
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:17,326
And I doubt that you love her.

381
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:18,909
You're in love with her shares

382
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,867
for Cheonga Foundation.

383
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:24,783
I don't want to resort to violence

384
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,284
this early in the morning

385
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,534
when my big day is coming.

386
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:31,034
After all, you are an assemblyman.

387
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,576
I'm all for this.

388
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,618
This is what we call true love.

389
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:37,742
My dear Chairman Joo is

390
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,075
willing to get his love

391
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,284
despite his children's opposition.

392
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:42,783
Kyu Jin almost got touched.

393
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:45,284
Whoa.

394
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,825
I have an aide too.

395
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,242
He was the best fighter in Beolgyo!

396
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,534
My son, you pulled a pretty funny prank.

397
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:11,909
You've been bold and rebellious lately,

398
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:13,242
so I thought you've grown a little.

399
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,534
But you were still a baby.

400
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:17,534
A baby

401
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,451
who needed to be looked after

402
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,367
in my arms.

403
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,909
I heard Ms. Cheon is getting fired.

404
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:30,618
Then we'll see

405
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
what Eun Byeol can really do.

406
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:32,700
It's her first time

407
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,326
taking an exam without her mum's help!

408
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:35,700
Her mind is too unstable

409
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:37,159
to do well on the exam.

410
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:38,367
You're right.

411
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:39,700
I heard Mr. Ma

412
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:40,992
got rid of Eun Byeol's toilet.

413
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,576
She'll have to eat like us too.

414
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,742
She fell from her life

415
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,700
as the princess of Cheonga to a nobody.

416
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,909
Mr. Ma is really quick with these things.

417
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,200
Run, run.

418
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:00,618
Do you have to do this?

419
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,534
Why are you at school anyway?

420
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,367
You don't care about me, do you?

421
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:06,700
The wedding, the school,

422
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:07,992
you're doing everything only as you like!

423
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,576
Don't lose your energy in the morning

424
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,659
by taking the taxi.

425
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,783
If you don't want to come with me,

426
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,159
I'll get you another car.

I hate you.

428
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:17,075
You're a selfish woman

429
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,284
who has no trace of love as a mother.

you're dating my brother?

436
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:39,783
Is this your childish way of protesting

437
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,409
and telling them to stop their marriage?

438
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,326
We're not protesting. It's real.

Seok Hoon and I like each other.

Do you think your feelings

441
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:47,909
could do anything to stop this marriage?

442
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:50,618
Seok Hoon will just get beaten to death.

No.

444
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,700
He might really die.

This is what your future stepdad is like.

So stop trying to convince my dad

452
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,284
and make your mum back out.

453

If anything you do hurts my brother,

Before we cast our votes,

I'd like to share a word with you.

462
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,200
Cheonga Foundation is

463
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,367
the most prestigious

464
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:51,700
private school foundation in Korea.

465
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,534
This was a cradle of education

466
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:54,950
created by astronomical donations

467
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:56,492
and relentless passion

468
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,159
from our former chief directors.

469
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:01,492
Yet Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin

470
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:02,950
has brought shame to our name

471
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,534
with her incompetence and pride.

472
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,659
Therefore, I strongly urge

473
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,492
that the chief director is dismissed.

474
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:13,200

a fatal mistake.

I won't forget the mercy of our directors.

514
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:50,909

to cajole them over to your side,

left us with this favour before he passed.

What did he say?

My daughter will have a long way to go.

She's a very ambitious girl,

Once she becomes the chief director,

534
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:44,700
her mother will make all kinds of excuses

One second.

623
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,159

Of course.

I heard it directly from Mr. Joo himself.

Of course, I love them.

You three have the best taste in Korea.

662
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,409
What about that rude woman from that time?

663
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,451
Does she still bully you?

664
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,284
Did you say she lives in Hera Palace too?

665
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:55,825
Once you taught her a good lesson,

666
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:57,034
she has been lying low

667
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,534
and crawling like this before me.

668
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,075
You don't have to worry.

669
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,367
Let us know right away

670

671
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:05,700
How dare some wife of an assemblyman

try to look down on Lady Jincheon?

673
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:09,950
Stop putting up with her

674
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,075
and why don't you move?

a 130-storey apartment complex

679
00:32:18,117 --> 00:32:20,409
will soon be built in Cheonsu District.

680
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:22,742
Ms. Song, you heard the rumours too.

681
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:25,992
Even Chairman Joo began to make a move.

00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:26,909
I guess the announcement

683
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,200
for redevelopment will be made soon.

684
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Chairman Joo?

685
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,700
He's awfully quick with these things.

686
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,950
Lady Jincheon, go out and get one too.

687
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:36,659
That area will

688
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:38,409
soon become the wealthiest village

689
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:39,783
instead of Hera Palace.

690
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Are you serious?

691
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:43,534
This is the hottest

692
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:45,200
and the highest-quality information.

693
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:48,117
Since it hasn't been announced,

694
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,783
I'm sure it's not all that expensive.

695
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,367
But you still have to hurry.

696
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:54,909
I heard Chairman Joo

697
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:56,534
already took all the good spots.

698
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:01,659
Honey!

699
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,242
Honey, honey, honey. Kyu Jin!

700
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:06,659
You need to dress me

701
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,451
so I can go out to look after our people

702
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:09,867
and bring stability to their lives.

703
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:11,451
What the heck are you wearing?

704
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:12,950
You're like a woman with a story to tell.

705
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,034
Were you at Mari Sauna again?

706
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,409
You might as well work there.

707
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,367
Did you save a country in your past life?

708
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:22,825
How did you marry a woman like me?

709
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,075
I must have met you

710
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,242
because I had failed to save one.

711
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:27,867
Where would you find

712
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,409
the money for your campaign without me?

713
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:31,618
Why?

714
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,659
Did you hear something?

715
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:33,909
Cheonsu District

716
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:35,742
will be redeveloped very soon!

717
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,576
That rumour is about 200 years old!

718
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:40,992
Kyu Jin is a man who went out with Mum

719
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,075
on real estate shopping

720
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,117
since primary school.

721
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,576
I'm sure of this.

722
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:45,909
I heard the Three Queens say it

723
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:47,700
with these two ears.

724
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:48,992
Don't you know who they are?

725
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:50,409
They have the golden information

726
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:51,618
when it comes to real estate.

727
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:54,200
On top of that, Chairman Joo heard of this

728
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,200
and has been buying the area out.

729
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,367
Dan Tae never mentioned a word to me!

730
00:33:58,742 --> 00:34:01,200
Is he trying to have this all by himself?

731
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:02,367
Wait.

732
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:03,492
How much extra cash do you have?

733
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:04,284
Forget that.

734
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:05,867
Let's call Mum right now. - Okay.

735
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:07,576
Let's put on

736
00:34:09,117 --> 00:34:10,451
our talent show tonight

737
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:12,783
and make her give me some cash.

738
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:16,492
Yes, Mother. Hello. - Beverly Hills.

739
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,492
Beverly Hills.

740
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:18,700
Yes, we're good.

741
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:21,492
This is very precious.

742
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,200
In just two years,

743
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,242
this would reach its 100th year.

744
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,576
You didn't have to.

745
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:28,492
And this.

746
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:29,618
Thank you. - Take this.

747
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,825
You didn't have to bring this.

748
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:33,576
My goodness.

749
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:35,367
This is a good place. - I see.

750
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,700
Take a look.

751
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,618
Looks great.

752
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:46,700
All right.

753
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,075
"Real Estate Purchase Agreement"

754
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,909
All right. Right here.

755
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:50,783
And here.

756
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,825
All done.

757
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:56,909
Open up. - What is this?

758
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,117
It should be enough for a simple meal.

759
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,409
This will soon be worth

760
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:09,700
50 billion won per pyeong.

761
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,200
50? - 50 billion.

762
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:14,326
All right.

763
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:16,783
Let's seal the last one together.

764
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,409
Okay. - Hold my hand.

765
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,576
"Real Estate Purchase Agreement"

766
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,700
Sealed.

767
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Congratulations.

768
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:27,783
Just sit, relax, and wait for the jackpot.

769
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,409
I like that talk.

770
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:30,700
Yes, of course.

771
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,200
"JKING Holdings"

772
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:33,825
I'm not sure how the information leaked,

773
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:35,700
but there is a spike in sales

774
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,034
of real estate in Cheonsu District.

775
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:39,867
Who smelled this and got here?

776
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,034
I haven't checked that yet.

777
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,742
You stupid idiot!

778
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:45,867
You use so much money on duty,

779
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,117
yet you haven't found that out yet?

780
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:48,742
Go find out right away!

781
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:49,576
Find out who owns the new places

782
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,534
and who actually came to seal the deals!

783
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:51,742
No, wait.

784
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,950
First, go and get all the properties

785
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,284
I've kept my eyes on.

786
00:35:56,742 --> 00:35:57,700
Get out of here!

787
00:35:57,909 --> 00:35:58,783
Yes, Chairman Joo.

788
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,409
That idiot.

789
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:08,034
No way.

790
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:10,492
Oh Yoon Hee, is it you again?

791
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:12,659
So I have a new goal now.

792
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:16,284
I want to become extremely wealthy.

793
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:18,659
I'll do whatever it takes to become rich.

794
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,284
Rich enough to own this penthouse.

795
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:22,742
Man.

796
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:24,909
That cheeky brat.

797
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:28,200
How dare you come after my penthouse?

798
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:38,492
Hey, honey, it's me.

799
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,950
I have a favour to ask you.

800
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:42,242
I need you to be in charge

801
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,700
of this woman who's a huge headache.

802
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,117
That's my expertise.

803
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,451
Let's talk when we meet later.

804
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:56,367
Thank you for calling me, Ms. Na.

805
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,909
I didn't think you'd call me so soon.

806
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:00,492
There's no need to thank me.

807
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,659
I just came to see how good you are

808
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:08,451
in keeping promises.

809
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:10,992
Are you sure you just want to

810
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:11,783
see them from afar?

811
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,117
Or what?

812
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:17,909
Should I hug them and cry a river?

813
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:22,700
They're here.

814
00:37:30,242 --> 00:37:31,409
"Coffeebay"

815
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:34,742
You got here early.

816
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:36,034
You're here.

817
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:37,742
What is this?

818
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,742
You wanted to talk. Why is she here?

819
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,200
Don't be rude.

820
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,867
She has something to tell us.

821
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,075
What do you want?

822
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,659
Let me get you something delicious.

823
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:47,576
They have great strawberry shake.

824
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:53,200
It's nice and sweet.

825
00:38:00,284 --> 00:38:01,034
Happy now?

826
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:03,618
My stomach isn't strong enough

827
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,825
to let me sit here

828
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,326
and talk with my mum's killer.

829
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,242
Sit down, Seok Kyung.

830
00:38:10,576 --> 00:38:11,700
It's about your mother.

831
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:13,451
My mum?

832
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:15,700
Your biological mother.

833
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,117
She's alive.

834
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:19,284
Our biological mother?

835
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:20,451
Ms. Oh.

836
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:21,992
I'm sorry,

837
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:23,700
but our biological mother died

838
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,200
of blood poisoning after the labour.

839
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:26,992
Do your research before you pull this.

840
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:29,451
Do I have to put up with this nonsense?

841
00:38:29,992 --> 00:38:31,618
Your father lied to you.

842
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:34,783
Your biological mother is alive.

843
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:41,909
This is your biological mother.

844
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:52,409
Have you gone insane?

845
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:54,117
Are you joking with us?

846
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,534
This is our mum who is dead.

847
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:58,200
No, she's your biological mother.

848
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,200
She looks

849
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:01,825
amazingly similar to Soo Ryeon.

850
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:04,783
It's hard to believe, but it's true.

851
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:06,492
I recently met her

852
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,242
and confirmed this.

853
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:09,492
Are you serious?

854
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:11,326
Where is she right now?

855
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:12,700
Do you actually believe this woman?

856
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:14,534
She's messing with us

857
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,242
because we bullied Ro Na.

858
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:17,867
It's a piece of cake

859
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:19,200
to fake photos like this one.

860
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:22,242
I can go ask dad.

861
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:26,409
Do you trust him?

862
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:27,618
Do you still have no idea

863
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,909
what kind of a man he really is?

864
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,075
Our dad is our biggest abuser

865
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,576
and manipulator.

866
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:33,867
What kind of truth

867
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,867
do you expect to get from him?

868
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,284
Just stay still.

869
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,909
Ms. Oh is trying to help us.

870
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,576
She's very close to you.

871
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:44,825
If you want to meet her,

872
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,117
I'll make it happen.

873
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:49,618
I never asked you to find her for me.

874
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,867
How dare she claim to be my mum now?

875
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,159
Who says she can?

876
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,200
I only have one mother.

877
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:57,825
And this fake mum?

878
00:39:58,367 --> 00:39:59,326
I don't need her.

879
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:30,825
Be honest with me.

880
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,700
You know something, don't you?

881
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:34,867
What is it?

882
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:36,284
Tell me!

883
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,659
The person who killed Mum...

884
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:42,659
It might have been dad.

885
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,159
Have you lost your mind?

886
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:54,867
Why would dad do that?

887
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:56,950
Why would he kill mum?

888
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,825
Why?

889
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,075
Because he no longer needed her.

890
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:02,659
That's how dad is.

891
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,200
He only keeps what and whom he needs.

892
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:05,284
We're no exception!

893
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:07,950
He can abandon us anytime.

894
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,909
So we can no longer trust him, okay?

895
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:16,618
We're on our own now.

896
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:18,909
I'll never abandon you.

897
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:20,451
Even if I must risk my life,

898
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:23,159
I will protect you from dad.

899
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:24,867
If dad

900
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,200
really killed mum,

901
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,367
I won't let him go unpunished.

902
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,075
I will never forgive him.

903
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,159
What do you want?

904
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,576
"JKING Holdings"

905
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:49,200
What are you using to threaten Seo Jin?

906
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:50,742
Call off the wedding at once.

907
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,242
A scumbag like you

908
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:53,492
does not deserve Seo Jin.

909
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:57,367
Know your place.

910
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,200
You think you can patch things up with her

911
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,242
if I let her go?

912
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:02,992
Let's be honest.

913
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:05,492
Didn't you come back for her money?

914
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:12,034
I guess that's all you can do

915
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:13,034
with your hand now.

916
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,950
I should've completely crushed it that day

917
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,825
but I got too soft.

918
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:19,618
You psycho!

919
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:22,909
I'll do whatever it takes

920
00:42:22,992 --> 00:42:24,200
to get this wedding cancelled,

921
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:25,492
even if I have to risk my life.

922
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:28,492
My, I like this brazen attitude.

923
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:32,159
But I guess Seo Jin hasn't told you yet.

924
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,700
Unbelievable. It's about your daughter.

925
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:36,700
The father should know.

926
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:38,867
What the heck are you talking about?

927
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:40,700
I found out

928
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,034
that your daughter killed Ro Na.

929
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:52,659
What can you do?

930
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,867
Parents should be responsible

931
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:56,700
for their kids' mistakes.

932
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,367
Seo Jin will bear it all.

933
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:01,825
She loves her daughter a lot, you know.

934
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:07,576
Too bad I'm the only one

935
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:08,992
who can see that look on your face.

936
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,367
Go on. Punch me.

937
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:15,242
If you can handle what I'll say,

938
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,242
hit me.

939
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:20,034
I said, hit me.

940
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,367
Take your daughter

941
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:25,075
and get out of my sight

942
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:26,742
before I turn her in to the police.

943
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,492
I... I will kill you.

944
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:33,992
I will kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

945
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,950
Good luck with that.

946
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:40,075
I will kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

947
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:42,783
I'm going to kill you.

948
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:44,742
I will kill you!

949
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:51,492
"JKING Holdings"

950
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,284
"Restricted Area"

951
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,159
I can't figure out

952
00:44:40,284 --> 00:44:41,659
what Na Ae Gyo is thinking.

953
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:43,742
She didn't even bat an eye

954
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:44,992
after seeing her kids.

955
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:48,075
She won't readily show her emotions.

956
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,700
Let's wait and see.

957
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,409
What about Cheonsu District?

958
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,159
Any progress?

959
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:55,659
As expected,

960
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,825
it has reached Kang Ma Ri and Lee Kyu Jin.

961
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:00,618
The tip we leaked to the Three Queens

962
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:01,992
seems to have worked.

963
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,742
Then,

964
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,867
it's time to make our move.

965
00:45:15,492 --> 00:45:17,700
Oh, Mr. Hwang. It's Oh Yoon Hee.

966
00:45:18,618 --> 00:45:20,576
I'll sell lot 27 in Cheonsu District.

967
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,825
Yes, can you find out

968
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:24,075
if anyone's interested?

969
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:25,825
As soon as possible.

970
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:27,326
Thank you.

971
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,742
Dan Tae should be arriving at his villa.

972
00:45:37,992 --> 00:45:40,075
"Voice Spy"

973
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,075
You wanted to meet to give me

974
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,242
this stupid invitation?

975
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:44,867
I can't believe this!

976
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:50,451
If Cheon Seo Jin refuses to divorce you,

977
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,492
will you live with her forever?

978
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:53,992
Do you think I'm insane?

979
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,909
She's marrying me only because

980
00:45:55,992 --> 00:45:57,576
I'm blackmailing her.

981
00:45:57,742 --> 00:45:59,075
This marriage means nothing to me.

982
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,159
He's blackmailing her?

983
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:01,618
It's like betting on stocks.

984
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,700
Then put all the land you bought

985
00:46:03,783 --> 00:46:04,618
in Cheonsu District

986
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:06,326
under my name.

987
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,200
Let's go with half.

988
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:13,367
No, 70 percent.

989
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:14,867
I won't go any lower.

990
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:18,700
In exchange, I'll get you the land

991
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:19,909
Oh Yoon Hee currently owns.

992
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:22,492
Still, isn't 70 percent too high?

993
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:25,783
You think it's too high?

994
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,284
Really?

995
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:30,159
Fine.

996
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:32,783
But only until I divorce Seo Jin.

997
00:46:41,326 --> 00:46:43,867
When do you plan to end that marriage?

998
00:46:43,992 --> 00:46:45,618
Registering the marriage will make me

999
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:48,284
the largest shareholder of Cheonga Group.

1000
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:49,742
As soon as I get the shares,

1001
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:51,659
I'll chop up the company and sell it off.

1002
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:53,576
I'll make the stock price go up to the max

1003
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:55,075
and bow out.

1004
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:56,534
Don't you trust me?

1005
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:58,117
You tried to kill me.

1006
00:46:58,659 --> 00:46:59,867
So how could I trust you?

1007
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:03,700
Would you, if you were me?

1008
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:06,492
I already explained that.

1009
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,326
Who knows what the truth is?

1010
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:11,284
I may disappear quietly one day

1011
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:13,492
just like Soo Ryeon did.

1012
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:21,367
Get lost.

1013
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,742
I'm not in the mood to drink with you.

1014
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:29,742
Hey, we're not done talking!

1015
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:32,242
Gosh, seriously.

1016
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:34,700
She has such a nasty temper.

1017
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,034
What happened to your face?

1018
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,742
Who did this to you?

1019
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:02,242
Call off the wedding now.

1020
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:03,618
This is insane.

1021
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:05,700
Is Joo Dan Tae blackmailing you?

1022
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:07,492
Don't be afraid.

1023
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:09,117
He has no way to prove

1024
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,451
that Eun Byeol did it.

1025
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:11,867
How did you know?

1026
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:14,367
Did that jerk tell you?

1027
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,242
No matter what he says to threaten you,

1028
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:17,618
stand firm.

1029
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,909
I'll deal with Eun Byeol's treatment.

1030
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:22,618
Just say you know nothing.

1031
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:25,700
He has evidence.

1032
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,492
Eun Byeol's necklace.

1033
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:30,909
It has her DNA

1034
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,326
and Ro Na's blood.

1035
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:36,700
He also has a recording of my confession.

1036
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:38,618
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

1037
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,867
You can't handle this on your own.

1038
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,492
Don't underestimate me.

1039
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:52,117
I can easily control Dan Tae.

1040
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:55,700
You just take care of Eun Byeol.

1041
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,409
I'll handle the rest.

1042
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,117
Please leave quietly.

1043
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,909
This is my final request.

1044
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:18,492
I didn't do it, did I?

1045
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:22,492
No, that can't be.

1046
00:49:22,867 --> 00:49:24,075
There's no way.

1047
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,367
But why do I keep remembering the trophy?

1048
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:41,534
It's time to take your medicine.

1049
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:43,284
Your mum said you must take it on time.

1050
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,618
Will this make my headache go away?

1051
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:48,409
Does it hurt a lot?

1052
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,618
Oh, no. You've reviewed the chapters

1053
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,242
only three times.

1054
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:59,284
My head is about to explode.

1055
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,909
As I'm solving the math problems,

1056
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:04,326
the numbers keep crawling in my head.

1057
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:09,284
What if I really end up going crazy?

1058
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:11,367
You've been doing well. What's wrong?

1059
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:12,909
Ro Na is gone now.

1060
00:50:13,117 --> 00:50:14,034
My gosh.

1061
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:16,909
This isn't good.

1062
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:18,534
Stop studying. Just go to bed.

1063
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:20,659
I'll wake you up early tomorrow. Come on.

1064
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:34,284
How's Eun Byeol doing?

1065
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:36,700
She's having a really tough time.

1066
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,075
Her mother's wedding is coming up,

1067
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:41,451
and something's wrong with her memory.

1068
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,284
What about the pills she's taking?

1069
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,117
Isn't it hindering her

1070
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,159
from getting her memory back?

1071
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:48,117
I've swapped them out with vitamins,

1072
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:49,867
so it won't have any effect.

1073
00:50:51,326 --> 00:50:52,700
Soon, she'll remember

1074
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:54,783
what she exactly did.

1075
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:56,576
No matter how much she struggles,

1076
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:57,783
she's back to square one.

1077
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:00,576
I feel bad for her.

1078
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:06,867
"Seok Hoon"

1079
00:51:08,034 --> 00:51:09,825
Why did you want to see me?

1080
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,783
I know that someone else...

1081
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:17,326
killed Ro Na.

1082
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,200
What?

1083
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:21,825
Was it

1084
00:51:23,783 --> 00:51:24,867
Eun Byeol?

1085
00:51:30,034 --> 00:51:31,825
I do suspect her,

1086
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:33,992
but I'm not sure.

1087
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,867
There's no evidence.

1088
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,867
I think my dad had something to do

1089
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:39,909
with Ro Na's death.

1090
00:51:40,284 --> 00:51:42,783
He has the necklace Eun Byeol wore

1091
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,992
during her performance.

1092
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:51,326
Dan Tae knew everything.

1093
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:53,075
That Eun Byeol was the killer.

1094
00:51:53,992 --> 00:51:55,700
He's blackmailing Seo Jin with it

1095
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:57,284
so he can marry her.

1096
00:51:58,242 --> 00:51:59,159
"Golden Real Estate"

1097
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,659
A nice lot in Cheonsu District

1098
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,618
just became available.

1099
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:05,367
Then I should buy it, of course.

1100
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:06,783
I'll pay 50 million won more

1101
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:08,117
than the highest bidder...

1102
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,576
No, 100 million more.

1103
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:13,034
I'm counting on you, Mr. Hwang.

1104
00:52:15,117 --> 00:52:17,117
Gosh, a good lot became available already?

1105
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:20,950
It was a good call to bribe Mr. Hwang.

1106
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,409
If that land becomes mine,

1107
00:52:23,742 --> 00:52:26,117
I'll be set for life!

1108
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:29,783
A 130-storey apartment complex

1109
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:31,742
will go up on that land.

1110
00:52:31,825 --> 00:52:34,409
Compared to that, Hera Palace is a joke.

1111
00:52:34,492 --> 00:52:36,659
My gosh, the Three Queens

1112
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,700
have incredible sources.

1113
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,492
Hurray. Hurray!

1114
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,783
What did I tell you?

1115
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,783
I said going to Mari Sauna was like

1116
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,576
attending the Ministry of Land's meetings.

1117
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,534
Who would've thought I'd benefit

1118
00:52:49,618 --> 00:52:51,159
from a scrub mistress?

1119
00:52:51,576 --> 00:52:53,783
Let's send Je Ni's mum a few boxes

1120
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:54,867
of the nicest scrubbing mitts.

1121
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:56,367
Yes, we should.

1122
00:52:56,618 --> 00:53:00,451
Honey, we hit the jackpot!

1123
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:02,034
Mari Sauna?

1124
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:03,492
A scrub mistress?

1125
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:05,492
Come on, say my name. - Kyu Jin!

1126
00:53:05,576 --> 00:53:07,242
I love you!

1127
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,700
Hey, Je Ni.

1128
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,034
Do you know that candy costs

1129
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:26,618
more than 100,000 won a piece?

1130
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:29,200
If you have a sore throat,

1131
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:32,992
just get cheap candy at the supermarket.

1132
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,326
Mind your own business, will you?

1133
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,242
Stop picking a fight. Go away.

1134
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:43,700
Isn't that humidifier from Switzerland?

1135
00:53:44,326 --> 00:53:45,825
You only use expensive stuff.

1136
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:48,659
All your clothes are from designer brands.

1137
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,659
Je Ni, this is not okay.

1138
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:55,992
Did you buy them for me?

1139
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,867
Did I steal them from you guys?

1140
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,742
I can afford them.

1141
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:01,409
Why do you even care?

1142
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,867
I have to study, so get lost.

1143
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,284
Still, it's not okay.

1144
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:09,159
Your mum must've had to scrub

1145
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:10,451
countless people's backs

1146
00:54:10,534 --> 00:54:11,618
to earn all that money.

1147
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,284
Shouldn't you be more frugal?

1148
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:15,034
What?

1149
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,367
Who had to scrub what?

1150
00:54:18,576 --> 00:54:20,700
Hey, you really didn't know?

1151
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:24,867
I was so touched when I heard about

1152
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:27,742
how hard your mum works.

1153
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:29,825
So I prepared a little something for you.

1154
00:54:30,242 --> 00:54:32,242
Guys, what are you waiting for?

1155
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,451
It's time to give her our gifts.

1156
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,700
Ta-da!

1157
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:44,075
Here you go! - How pretty.

1158
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,909
Isn't it so pretty?

1159
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:50,742
My gosh, I'm exhausted.

1160
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:54,034
Why is my wrist aching so much?

1161
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:55,909
It can't break down yet.

1162
00:55:01,117 --> 00:55:03,659
Missus! This is insane!

1163
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,659
What if Je Ni sees this?

1164
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:07,242
Why would you dry these

1165
00:55:07,326 --> 00:55:08,700
in the living room? My gosh.

1166
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:10,075
Missus!

1167
00:55:10,783 --> 00:55:11,909
I hung them there.

1168
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:15,284
Je Ni.

1169
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:20,576
Well... I can explain.

1170
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:22,242
When are you going to tell me?

1171
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:24,117
If you're that ashamed of your job,

1172
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,284
why do you even do it?

1173
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,117
Quit that job immediately.

1174
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,576
How did you find out?

1175
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:32,950
I wasn't trying to keep it from you.

1176
00:55:36,742 --> 00:55:37,909
I'm sorry, Je Ni.

1177
00:55:38,242 --> 00:55:39,367
For what?

1178
00:55:40,284 --> 00:55:41,367
Did you steal something?

1179
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:43,200
Did you get paid for beating someone up?

1180
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:44,950
No, it's not that!

1181
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:46,659
Then why did you hide it from me?

1182
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:47,992
I've never done anything

1183
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:49,242
I should be ashamed of.

1184
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:51,700
Even if you're embarrassed of my job,

1185
00:55:51,783 --> 00:55:52,825
I can't quit.

1186
00:55:53,326 --> 00:55:54,700
What did I do wrong?

1187
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,909
I always pampered you

1188
00:55:57,992 --> 00:55:59,159
with the finest things.

1189
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:00,700
I've done everything I could.

1190
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:02,200
Isn't that enough?

1191
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,659
"Mari Sauna"

1192
00:56:15,992 --> 00:56:17,742
Dry them well, or they'll stink.

1193
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:19,618
If you don't satisfy your customers,

1194
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:21,659
they'll leave.

1195
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,825
Then, we'll starve.

1196
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,659
What?

1197
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:28,576
After what happened to Ro Na,

1198
00:56:28,783 --> 00:56:30,825
I'm not ashamed or scared of anything.

1199
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,909
I don't care if the kids make fun of me

1200
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:35,909
or if I can't get into SNU.

1201
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,950
The only thing that scares me...

1202
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:44,783
is that someone close to me may leave

1203
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:45,700
and never come back.

1204
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:50,700
With dad gone,

1205
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,492
we only have each other to rely on.

1206
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,367
Why would you keep secrets from me?

1207
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,825
I'm your daughter.

1208
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,117
Why must I find out about your job

1209
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,159
through that jerk, Min Hyuk?

1210
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:03,742
Je Ni.

1211
00:57:07,284 --> 00:57:08,742
I've run us a bath.

1212
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,034
Come in when you're ready.

1213
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:12,909
Let me see how good you are.

1214
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:15,700
Don't forget the banana milk!

1215
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:24,367
My princess is all grown up now.

1216
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:27,992
Now that she's found out,

1217
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,200
should I tell her about her dad too?

1218
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:31,783
Or not?

1219
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:33,867
Mum, hurry! The water's getting cold.

1220
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,367
Yes, okay!

1221
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,867
I'm coming!

1222
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:39,618
Here I come!

1223
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,242
Come on. Let me scrub your back.

1224
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:46,451
Gosh, stay still.

1225
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,867
Your mum's a pro

1226
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,534
with 25 years of experience.

1227
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:52,867
There's a long line of rich ladies

1228
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,326
waiting to be scrubbed by me.

1229
00:57:56,618 --> 00:57:57,867
Do you not trust me?

1230
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,242
Gosh, look how dirty your back is!

1231
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:03,618
You were too busy scrubbing others' backs.

1232
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,700
My gosh, this is so gross.

1233
00:58:06,742 --> 00:58:08,534
What are you talking about?

1234
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,700
I bathe every day.

1235
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,867
Drink this.

1236
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:14,700
Let me learn some scrubbing skills.

1237
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,117
Why would you even learn this?

1238
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:19,909
You'll go to Seoul National University

1239
00:58:19,992 --> 00:58:22,618
and live a very comfortable life.

1240
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,867
That's why I'm working so hard.

1241
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:27,659
Are you listening?

1242
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:30,326
Lady, you're awfully chatty.

1243
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:32,950
You don't have to pay me.

1244
00:58:33,034 --> 00:58:34,576
Just stay still.

1245
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,034
Just for today.

1246
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,659
Mum!

1247
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:20,451
Mum.

1248
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:22,242
Have some snacks and study.

1249
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:24,534
Did you tell dad to take me to the US?

1250
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:25,534
Is it true?

1251
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:30,075
Your dad

1252
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:32,659
has to visit the headquarters.

1253
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:34,700
Go with him and get some fresh air.

1254
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:35,950
Your vacation's coming up.

1255
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:37,075
You're lying.

1256
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,034
You're sending me away

1257
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,992
to have your wedding!

1258
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:44,242
How could you do this to your daughter?

1259
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:47,409
Mum.

1260
00:59:48,242 --> 00:59:50,284
Can you please cancel the wedding?

1261
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:52,950
I can't live without you, Mum.

1262
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:55,534
Please don't abandon me.

1263
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:57,576
I'm so scared, Mum.

1264
00:59:58,117 --> 00:59:59,117
Eun Byeol.

1265
01:00:01,534 --> 01:00:03,367
You're my everything,

1266
01:00:03,992 --> 01:00:05,909
so please don't get remarried.

1267
01:00:07,284 --> 01:00:09,117
If I have to go to the US,

1268
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:11,200
I want you to come with me.

1269
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,700
I just want you in my life, Mum.

1270
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,284
I don't care about college.

1271
01:00:16,075 --> 01:00:18,367
I can give up on everything. I mean it.

1272
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:21,034
Why would you give up on college?

1273
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,618
You came this far.

1274
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:24,117
Don't be so weak.

1275
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,492
Just do as I say.

1276
01:00:35,075 --> 01:00:37,409
I'm staying behind to protect you.

1277
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,075
To keep you safe from that monster.

1278
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,783
Why?

1279
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:56,034
I told you that I'm not angry.

1280
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,159
Forget it.

1281
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,867
Just focus on planning

1282
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,326
your wedding with Seo Jin.

1283
01:01:58,117 --> 01:02:00,700
Are you sure you'll come in a few days?

1284
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:02,326
Yes, of course.

1285
01:02:03,075 --> 01:02:05,117
I'll come as soon as I sort things out

1286
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,326
at the company and foundation.

1287
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:08,825
Don't worry.

1288
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,618
Stay with your dad until I come.

1289
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:22,576
I'm not sure

1290
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:24,284
if this is the best thing to do.

1291
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,576
Eun Byeol can't find out.

1292
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:28,284
Don't say anything about me.

1293
01:02:30,117 --> 01:02:31,367
I can't do this.

1294
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,950
I can't leave you here alone.

1295
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:35,367
Let's just kill Joo Dan Tae

1296
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:36,700
and run away together.

1297
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:40,075
Stop talking nonsense. Just go.

1298
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:41,367
Leave now.

1299
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:43,492
Seo Jin.

1300
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:31,367
Goodbye.

1301
01:03:38,367 --> 01:03:39,950
Don't get weak, Seo Jin.

1302
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,200
You're getting married today.

1303
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:54,284
And you sent your daughter away

1304
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,409
without letting her see the wedding?

1305
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:57,783
I suppose Dan Tae

1306
01:03:58,242 --> 01:04:00,117
doesn't make a good stepdad.

1307
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,825
Stay out of my family's affairs

1308
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:03,659
and please leave this place.

1309
01:04:04,284 --> 01:04:05,618
Both your child and husband are gone.

1310
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,242
Why are you still here, all alone?

1311
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:10,992
Because

1312
01:04:12,117 --> 01:04:13,284
I like this place.

1313
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,909
I also like seeing you all anxious

1314
01:04:17,783 --> 01:04:18,783
to get rid of me.

1315
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,117
And I'm curious to see

1316
01:04:20,783 --> 01:04:23,909
how happy you and Dan Tae will be

1317
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:25,117
in that penthouse.

1318
01:04:25,742 --> 01:04:26,700
What did you say?

1319
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:27,700
And that's why

1320
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:29,409
I'm going to

1321
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,534
sincerely wish you a happy marriage.

1322
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:33,034
I'll see you later,

1323
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:35,326
the happy bride, Cheon Seo Jin.

1324
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:46,409
Why does my bride's skin look so dry?

1325
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,367
Did the excitement keep you up all night?

1326
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:50,700
If you couldn't wait,

1327
01:04:50,742 --> 01:04:53,034
why didn't you suggest we expedite it?

1328
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:56,825
"Cheon Seo Jin"

1329
01:04:57,742 --> 01:04:58,909
This is what you need, right?

1330
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:01,034
You can register the marriage yourself.

1331
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:08,451
I wanted to rent the entire hotel

1332
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:10,075
and make you the happiest bride

1333
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:11,326
in the world,

1334
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,284
but your reputation is a bit...

1335
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:16,367
You know.

1336
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:22,659
"Cheon Seo Jin"

1337
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,242
So we'll keep it simple.

1338
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:28,284
I hope you understand.

1339
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,950
But you're becoming the owner

1340
01:05:31,034 --> 01:05:32,075
of the penthouse today,

1341
01:05:32,409 --> 01:05:33,618
so enjoy.

1342
01:05:34,992 --> 01:05:37,117
Oh, did Eun Byeol leave?

1343
01:05:37,909 --> 01:05:39,200
The weather in California

1344
01:05:39,284 --> 01:05:40,700
must be amazing now.

1345
01:05:40,783 --> 01:05:42,451
Don't say her name.

1346
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:43,867
Even if I marry you,

1347
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,117
Eun Byeol isn't your child.

1348
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,618
She'll have nothing to do with you.

1349
01:05:46,867 --> 01:05:49,992
Oh, that's disappointing.

1350
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,034
I was so happy

1351
01:05:52,117 --> 01:05:53,659
to get another daughter.

1352
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:00,492
Looks like they're really getting married.

1353
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:03,326
Apparently, Eun Byeol left for California.

1354
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,409
What? Eun Byeol left?

1355
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,576
Where are you going?

1356
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,367
"Seok Hoon"

1357
01:06:24,326 --> 01:06:25,284
Don't answer

1358
01:06:25,783 --> 01:06:26,825
anyone's calls.

1359
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,451
"Seok Hoon"

1360
01:06:40,825 --> 01:06:42,284
Pull over.

1361
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:44,326
Pull over now.

1362
01:06:44,492 --> 01:06:45,451
Pull over!

1363
01:06:57,867 --> 01:06:59,326
"Police"

1364
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:04,034
Don't come out.

1365
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:11,492
Are you Ha Yoon Chul?

1366
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,909
Yes, what is this about?

1367
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:15,242
You're under arrest

1368
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:16,492
for the murder of Bae Ro Na.

1369
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,242
What?

1370
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:21,950
What are you talking about?

1371
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:23,659
Dad! What's going on?

1372
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:27,409
What are you doing to my dad?

1373
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:28,867
Park Jung Sik, who's locked up

1374
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,409
for the murder, confessed everything.

1375
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:31,992
He said you bribed him

1376
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:33,117
to lie and confess.

1377
01:07:33,492 --> 01:07:34,451
Come with us.

1378
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:36,618
Wait, just a second!

1379
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:37,742
Something's not right. Wait!

1380
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,200
Wait!

1381
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:40,867
I didn't do it! Just a second.

1382
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:41,825
Dad. - Hold on.

1383
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:42,825
I need to talk to my daughter.

1384
01:07:42,909 --> 01:07:45,200
Eun Byeol, take a taxi to the airport.

1385
01:07:45,326 --> 01:07:46,534
Okay, Eun Byeol? - Dad!

1386
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,783
I'll be fine, so don't worry!

1387
01:07:48,867 --> 01:07:49,867
Go to the airport now!

1388
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:51,409
Dad! - You can do this, Eun Byeol!

1389
01:07:51,492 --> 01:07:52,909
Let me go!

1390
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:54,659
Dad!

1391
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,950
Dad!

1392
01:07:57,534 --> 01:07:58,867
Dad!

1393
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,659
Dad!

1394
01:08:05,783 --> 01:08:06,992
Dad!

1395
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:09,867
Dad, no...

1396
01:08:11,117 --> 01:08:13,618
Dad!

1397
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:17,909
Dad...

1398
01:08:27,825 --> 01:08:30,326
"Trap"

1399
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,451
The police just arrested him.

1400
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:43,117
"Secretary Cho"

1401
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:44,659
Good work.

1402
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,909
"Good work."

1403
01:08:53,783 --> 01:08:55,492
"Eun Byeol"

1404
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:08,492
"Power off"

1405
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:49,992
Eun Byeol, what's going on?

1406
01:09:50,075 --> 01:09:51,034
What happened?

1407
01:09:51,117 --> 01:09:52,284
Seok Hoon...

1408
01:09:53,034 --> 01:09:54,700
What do I do?

1409
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:18,409
Thank you, everyone in Hera Club.

1410
01:10:18,825 --> 01:10:21,075
We're finally getting married.

1411
01:10:21,867 --> 01:10:23,075
You made it happen.

1412
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,200
You two are perfect for each other.

1413
01:10:25,576 --> 01:10:27,867
Oh, here comes the bride!

1414
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:34,700
Look. - My gosh.

1415
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:35,742
The bride!

1416
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:37,326
Oh my.

1417
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:57,783
You were wrong.

1418
01:11:58,576 --> 01:11:59,825
I will not let you

1419
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,242
take anything away from me.

1420
01:12:04,075 --> 01:12:05,367
Not my dad,

1421
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,326
not Seok Hoon,

1422
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,451
and certainly not the grand prize trophy.

1423
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:14,867
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

1424
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,159
Ro Na.

1425
01:12:17,742 --> 01:12:18,742
It was Ro Na.

1426
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:20,825
I killed Ro Na.

1427
01:12:35,326 --> 01:12:36,242
Smile,

1428
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:38,700
as if you're ecstatically happy.

1429
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,242
I said, smile.

1430
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,950
I'm sorry for realising this so late.

1431
01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:27,451
I loved you, Yoon Chul.

1432
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:42,451

=Penthouse 2=

1434
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:58,534
Welcome to this nightmare.

1435
01:13:58,618 --> 01:14:00,367
I need to learn from you.

1436
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:01,409
I killed her.

1437
01:14:01,492 --> 01:14:03,742
The regret will tear your heart to shreds.

1438
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:05,783
I don't think you're a bad person.

1439
01:14:05,867 --> 01:14:07,534
Whatever the reason is, just use me.

1440
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:09,284
I remember everything now.

1441
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:10,700
Someone else was there?

1442
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:11,700
Why did Ro Na die?

1443
01:14:11,783 --> 01:14:12,700
This is a trap.

1444
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:14,159
I need you in order to find out

1445
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:15,075
who really killed Ro Na.

1446
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,492
I'll find out everything you did

1447
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:17,909
even if I must strangle you.
