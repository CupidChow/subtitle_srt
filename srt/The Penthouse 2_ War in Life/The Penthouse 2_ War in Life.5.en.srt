Why are you here?

You said I was your daughter too.

8
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,909
Can't I visit my mum to hang out?

9
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,550
I'm busy.

10

Just say what you need and leave.

11
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,217
I have many reports to go through.

12
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,535
Cheonga Arts Festival is in a few days.

13
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,928
I've waited so long for it.

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,210
What kind of dress should I wear?

15
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm really excited.

16
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,399
The notice should be up by now.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,348
At the meeting today,

18
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,919
the teachers decided to disqualify you

19
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:56,535
from entering.

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,702
You got yourself in big trouble,

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,509
so I had no choice.

22
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,285
Please don't crack such jokes.

23
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:10,301
My dad asked you, remember?

24
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,410
Just let me enter.

25
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:15,091
You have the power as the chief director.

26
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:22,925
Oh, did I surprise you?

27
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:25,842
I was imitating Eun Byeol.

28
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,176
I don't need to respond anymore, right?

29
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:32,828
Well, since you're being nice,

30
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,759
why don't you

31
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:37,734
just give me the grand prize?

32
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,302
- What?
- If you truly love my dad,

33
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,345
you can do that for me, right?

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,028
Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,336
You have no skills.

36
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,878
How can you ask for the grand prize?

37
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:50,354
You know

38
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,800
I can't beat Eun Byeol with my skills.

39
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:55,642
That's why I'm being shameless

40
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,242
and asking you for this favour.

41
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,618
Must I call your dad

42
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,829
to make you shut your mouth?

43
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:02,935
Get out.

44
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:04,800
Now.

45
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:10,550
You'll regret kicking me out like this.

46
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,967
I know a big secret,

47
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:16,498
lady.

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,507
What?

49
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:25,819
When Mr. Cheon Myung Soo passed away,

50
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,633
you were on the staircase with him.

51
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,050
Why did you run away?

52
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,290
Instead of saving your dad?

53
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,759
What did you just say?

54
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,661
You seem shocked.

55
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,402
All right, then.

56
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:52,002
Shall we restart our discussion?

57
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,342
Seok Kyung.

58
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,461
What kind of nonsense is this?

59
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:01,610
Do you want to compete

60
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,145
in Cheonga Arts Festival that badly?

61
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,193
No matter what you do,

62
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,151
you're already disqualified.

63
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:09,276
Do you think the parents of the victims

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,025
will just sit on their hands?

65
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,068
This proposal isn't just for me.

66
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,901
It means I'll keep your secret too.

67
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:17,193
A win-win situation, so to speak.

68
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:19,500
Stop this crazy talk right now.

69
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,735
Do you think I'll play along

70
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,667
with this absurd threat?

71
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:27,500
So you have to see the evidence yourself.

72
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:29,735
Fine.

73
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,000
If you want it, I'll send it to you.

74
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,292
But if you see it,

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,042
it'll torment you even more.

76
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,875
You should have some water.

77
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,126
You look so pale.

78
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,642
You should look after your well-being.

79
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,167
That brat.

80
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,084
What did she see?

81
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,527
Wait.

82
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,652
Did she blackmail me with that text?

83
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,235
No.

84
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,735
No, it can't be her.

85
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,652
If she had the video,

86
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,500
she would've shown it to me right away.

87
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,500
Stay calm.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,376
Stay calm.

Hello?

92
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:50,318
Ms. Cheon, things have gone crazy here.

93
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:52,318
How can you do this to her?

94
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,985
What did Je Ni ever do to you two?

95
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,776
Wasn't turning her into an outcast enough?

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,151
You forced her to eat until she threw up,

97
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,276
took videos of her, and humiliated her!

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,110
How do you call yourself a human?

99
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,694
How will you take responsibility

100
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:05,026
for all the pain Je Ni went through?

101
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,527
Please stop.

102
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,376
What are you doing at my house?

103
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,110
You shouldn't be like this, Ms. Cheon!

104
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,318
You're trying to cover up this case

105
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:14,568
by suspending Seok Kyung.

106
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:16,485
But don't think of me as a joke.

107
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,818
I won't let anyone who's involved

108
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,527
get away with this.

109
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:21,985
I'll make sure they're all punished!

110
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:24,000
Both Eun Byeol and Min Hyuk

111
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,776
won't be an exception.

112
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,610
The only thing other kids did was

113
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,859
just standing there at the scene.

114
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,318
We already checked everything!

115
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:31,360
Right.

116
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:33,694
So you'll use Seok Kyung as a scapegoat?

117
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:34,735
Why?

118
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,776
Because your daughter is

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,110
one of the bullies?

120
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:39,000
It's very uncomfortable

121
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,834
to hear you call them bullies.

122
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,301
They're also my dear students.

123
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:45,837
Will you only let this go

124
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,385
if we punish all of our best students?

125
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,510
Please consider the school's position too.

126
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:51,801
Of course.

127
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:53,719
My innocent Min Hyuk had no choice

128
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,218
but to take part because of Seok Kyung.

129
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:56,884
This is unfair for us too.

130
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,801
How dare you lie to me?

131
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,510
Je Ni told me everything.

132
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,468
She said no one helped her

133
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:02,843
while she was getting bullied.

134
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,510
Standing by there is violence too!

135
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:07,176
So we let Je Ni compete in the finals.

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,109
That's a given!

137
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:10,552
I want everyone

138
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,843
who was involved to be punished severely.

139
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,051
I won't settle for anything

140
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,385
or make an exception!

141
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,968
Goodness.

142
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:19,427
How can you be so stern?

143
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:22,385
After all, we're old friends.

144
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,385
Darn you.

145
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:24,801
Exactly.

146
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,843
We can't let you go on about this.

147
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,260
We'll continue to see each other

148
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,552
living in the same building,

149
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:34,225
so why don't you compromise on this

150
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,696
at an appropriate level?

151
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,060
I am

152
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:39,185
telling you this

153
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,487
for the sake of our future relationship,

154
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,045
Ma Ri.

155
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,550
Don't do this.

156
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,268
Our relationship?

157
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,884
Darn you.

158
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,508
Relationship, my foot.

159
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,801
The war begins now.

160
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:04,925
I won't associate with anyone

161
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,176
who bullied my daughter.

162
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,051
I've completely lost it.

163
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:11,343
- You!
- Goodness.

164
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,677
If you don't apologise to Je Ni now,

165
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,485
I'll break your legs in half.

166
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:19,192
You too!

167
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,650
And you'd better get a grip too.

168
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:25,801
Don't stop me. Don't.

169
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:28,484
- She already left.
- Where? What?

170
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,218
Is she a thug or what?

171
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,067
Fine. This is a war.

172
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:40,567
Goodness. My goodness.

173
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:46,010
My dear,

174
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,093
you've grown so much.

175
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,385
My son.

176
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,385
Make sure you're prepared

177
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,552
for Cheonga Arts Festival.

178
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,801
Dad will manage this situation--

179
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,510
Be quiet.

180
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,093
Look at your face. Okay?

181
00:07:58,117 --> 00:07:59,218
Seriously...

182
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,635
You're such a disgrace.

183
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,051
I thought you'd be more powerful

184
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:05,260
as an assemblyman.

185
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,817
Gosh.

186
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:22,025
Kang Ma Ri.

187
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,443
How dare you treat me, Lee Kyu Jin,

188
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,151
as if I'm a huge pushover?

189
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,801
It's me, Kyu Jin.

190
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:37,093
Yes, Kyu Jin. I mean, Mr. Lee. Yes, sir.

191
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,552
There's this woman named Kang Ma Ri

192
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:40,176
in Unit 4503 of this building.

193
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,510
Find everything you can on her.

194
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:43,908
Yes, of course, sir. Don't worry.

195
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:49,629
All I need now is Eun Byeol's phone.

196
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,192
Are you out of your mind?

197
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,218
I heard you were suspended.

198
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:58,260
Bullying someone goes down on your record.

199
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,635
Then you won't even get to apply

200
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,051
for the early admission!

201
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,010
Do you know how much money

202
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,176
I've given to your school to this day?

203
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,968
I could've built a new building with that!

204
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:07,385
Why does everyone blame me?

205
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:08,846
Your awesome fiancee's daughter

206
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:10,218
bullied Je Ni when no one was around,

207
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:12,135
and what she did was way worse than me.

208
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,427
You shouldn't have been caught either!

209
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:16,801
How is Eun Byeol always better than you?

210
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:18,427
You have a great house, good tutors,

211
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,427
and all kinds of support money can buy.

212
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:21,719
Why can't you ever win?

213
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,218
What can I do? I was born as a dimwit!

214
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,260
I'm sure my birth mum was stupid.

215
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:27,817
You little...

216
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:30,176
It's unfair for me to be punished alone.

217
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,317
That sly brat hid under her mum's shadow.

218
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,926
I won't let this end with me.

219
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,801
Just go study abroad.

220
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:38,135
I never expected you to win

221
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,677
the grand prize anyway.

222
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,343
Why should I go abroad?

223
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:42,385
I can get into Seoul University.

224
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,135
I'd rather have you go abroad and graduate

225
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,760
than to be humiliated

226
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,092
by applying for some second-grade college.

227
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,135
It'll be much cheaper

228
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,299
to get you the SAT ahead of time.

229
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,260
I don't need your help any more, Dad.

230
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,093
I'll compete in Cheonga Arts Festival

231
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,232
and win the grand prize,

232
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,719
so make sure you keep your promise

233
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,433
and let me move out.

234
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:03,884
Joo Seok Kyung.

235
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:05,525
Come here!

236
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,401
Joo Seok Kyung!

237
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,769
I'll talk to her.

238
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,317
I...

239
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,026
Why did you blow up the situation?

240
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,528
Making Dad angry won't get you anything.

241
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:32,652
I told you to be patient for a while.

242
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:33,610
Then I'll find a way to take you--

243
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,721
Stop pretending like you care about me.

244
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,014
Ro Na came back to school.

245
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,548
Aren't you horrified to see her face?

246
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:39,858
Don't be so stubborn.

247
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:41,776
Her mum wasn't the real culprit.

248
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,418
Do you believe that?

249
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,360
Do you really think Ms. Yang killed Mum?

250
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,917
That's...

251
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,943
I didn't expect to get paid for it.

252
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,901
Just take it.

253
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,193
You've become

254
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,917
an important person to me.

255
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,692
"100 million won"

256
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,817
I do know that it wasn't Ro Na's mum.

257
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:08,945
So stop blaming other people

258
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,276
just because you feel guilty.

259
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,902
How can you say something like that?

260
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,079
You're no different from Ro Na.

261
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,776
We're even now,

262
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,694
and I don't owe you anything anymore.

263
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,235
You gave me an apartment

264
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,610
to cover up what you did to my husband.

265
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,193
Shall I expose what you did?

266
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,402
It's not a good idea to bring that up,

267
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:46,360
Ms. Kang Ma Ri.

268
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,834
He agreed to go to jail instead of you

269
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:51,334
for Je Ni's sake.

270
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,485
But your daughter

271
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:55,334
ripped her heart to pieces.

272
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,209
Brace yourself.

273
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,292
I may...

274
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,667
just kill your daughter.

275
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,818
Yoo Dong Pil is rather quiet

276
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:11,443
and doing well in prison.

277
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:14,126
I don't think he heard about his daughter.

278
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,652
When was he getting released again?

279
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,402
In about two months.

280
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:20,084
Two months.

281
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,542
I can't let him come out already.

282
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,875
Your wife

283
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,959
dared to provoke me, Joo Dan Tae.

284
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:36,402
Why did you want to see us?

285
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,568
The girls have to go to school.

286
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,652
If you're trying to ruin our mood--

287
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,251
I'm sorry.

288
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:44,500
Je Ni, Ro Na.

289
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,610
I want to make a sincere apology.

290
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,110
Stop putting on an act.

291
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,709
You can't pull that on us.

292
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,235
I know that

293
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:54,709
everything I did was wrong.

294
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,583
But ever since what happened to my mum,

295
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,500
things have been so hard.

296
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:04,000
I wasn't even ready to accept her death,

297
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,625
and my dad was getting engaged.

298
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,709
Then Eun Byeol and I will become family.

299
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,694
I couldn't deal with everything.

300
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:15,151
Do you think that passes for an excuse?

301
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:16,402
Why did you take it out on them

302
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,500
just because your life is tough?

303
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:21,875
I still hated Ro Na and Ms. Oh a lot,

304
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,110
so I got very angry when Je Ni

305
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:25,694
became friends with her.

306
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:27,292
So...

307
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,209
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,735
Something like that won't happen again.

309
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,334
Please.

310
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,875
Please forgive me this once.

311
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,776
I'll gladly accept my punishment.

312
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,652
It was my dream to compete in the finals.

313
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,193
So please.

314
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,026
Please just let me do that.

315
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,583
Please.

316
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,610
You don't think Seok Kyung meant

317
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:08,459
what she said, right?

318
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:10,610
It's obvious that she tried to trick us.

319
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,985
Her eyes still showed a lot of confidence.

320
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,151
She didn't look sorry.

321
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:18,583
But that proud girl even kneeled down.

322
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,625
She's still a kid.

323
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:24,443
Shouldn't we give her one more chance?

324
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:27,084
No. I can't forgive her.

325
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,235
"It was my dream to compete

326
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,859
in Cheonga Arts Festival"?

327
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:33,459
That's the more reason to stop her.

328
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,901
She needs to lose something

329
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,276
that's the most meaningful to her.

330
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,667
That's what you call a punishment.

331
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,334
At the very least,

332
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:54,292
shouldn't you apologise to me

333
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:57,000
for what Seok Kyung did to Ro Na?

334
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:58,652
The district school board is

335
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,875
also taking this very seriously.

336
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,402
Do whatever you want.

337
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:04,667
Make her transfer by force or sue us.

338
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,652
But I'm not going to bow my head to you.

339
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:08,360
If Soo Ryeon saw

340
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,709
what Seok Kyung had become,

341
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:13,110
what would she say?

342
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:16,084
How dare you bring up her name?

343
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:18,527
You begged me to get rid of her.

344
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,167
Is that why...

345
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:23,209
you killed her?

346
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,167
For me?

347
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,292
What?

348
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,500
Forget it.

349
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:32,334
I don't want to nit-pick over the past.

350
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,500
I also wanted Soo Ryeon

351
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:37,443
to disappear from my sight.

352
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,875
Why did you come back?

353
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,402
Do you want to get back at me

354
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,376
for getting used and abandoned?

355
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,917
Do you think that's actually possible?

356
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,652
You must've thought I'm that easy.

357
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,694
Stop wasting your time

358
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,583
and leave with Yoon Chul,

359
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,376
unless your kid has another life to spare.

360
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,776
Thanks for your concern,

361
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,068
but you should look after

362
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,667
your company first.

363
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,776
The rumours of your financial difficulty

364
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,583
made your stock prices plummet.

365
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,875
I saw an article on a financial newspaper.

366
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:15,151
They advised against

367
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,126
investing in your company.

368
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,110
It looks like your merger

369
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:21,276
with Cheonga Foundation has failed.

370
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,276
Your relationship with Seo Jin

371
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,776
isn't looking good either.

372
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,235
The banking world might cut you off soon.

373
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,485
You must be under a lot of pressure

374
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:29,167
to finance your business.

375
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,542
Will you be all right?

376
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,084
I refuse to accept

377
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,875
your presumptuous meddling.

378
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:46,100
"JKING Holdings"

379
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,443
We already lost five per cent today.

380
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,443
Who let the word out

381
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,996
on our financial difficulty?

382
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,485
It wasn't the bank.

383
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:55,349
Ms. Cheon's scandal had an impact--

384
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:57,151
My business might fall apart

385
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:59,637
unless I announce the merger right now.

386
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,363
"Non-disclosure Agreement"

387
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,235
"I, Park Young Ran, hereby promise"

388
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,193
"to not disclose anything regarding..."

00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,328
"Signed by Cheon Seo Jin, Park Young Ran"

390
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,500
Do I have no choice but to pull this move?

391
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:40,084
All ready to give me the grand prize?

392
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,792
Have the trophy engraved with my name.

393
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:49,251
That's enough cheekiness from you.

394
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,818
Don't worry.

395
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,735
I'll send you the evidence you wanted

396
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,667
very soon.

397
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,959
You can look forward to it.

398
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,251
What does that girl know?

399
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,899
"Cheonga Foundation"

400
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:19,884
You're here.

401
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:20,968
Yes.

402
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:22,593
Long time no see, Seo Young.

403
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,926
Yes, we came without calling.

404
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,760
You must be very busy.

405
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:27,760
I was in the auditorium

406
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:29,525
to prepare for Cheonga Arts Festival.

407
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,218
What brings you here?

408
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,510
Your 20th anniversary concert was

409
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:33,926
so moving.

410
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,176
I wanted to celebrate, but it's belated.

411
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,801
There's no need. We're family.

412
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,525
Especially the first song.

413
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,468
It almost didn't sound like you.

414
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,525
It was that perfect.

415
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,968
Your dad would've been thrilled

416
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,192
to see such a performance.

417
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:54,051
It was such a shame.

418
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:56,051
What are you trying to say?

419
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,942
I can't believe this.

420
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,608
Open it.

421
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,414
"Non-disclosure Agreement"

422
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:12,510
How dare you?

423
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:13,593
How dare you use a shadow singer

424
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,135
during such an important concert?

425
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,343
I was really shocked.

426
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,427
The best vocalist of Korea

427
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,218
deceived the entire nation?

428
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,592
You give me the creeps.

429
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,192
Where...

430
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,218
did you get this?

431
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,427
We received it anonymously

432
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:32,260
through the foundation's ethics committee.

433
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,900
What kind of a disgrace is this?

434
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:37,218
Do you know how hard I had to try

435
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,343
to shut up the committee members?

436
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,234
I'm sure you didn't do it for me.

437
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:42,968
If you're a mother,

438
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:45,234
you would've asked about my vocal health

439
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,900
and how badly I was ill

440
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:49,942
before you did that.

441
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,608
If you were a real mother.

442
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,926
Isn't that so?

443
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,567
What did you say?

444
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,801
Step down from your office

445
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,635
before you're humiliated any further.

446
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:06,443
Hand over the foundation to Seo Young.

447
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:07,801
What did you say?

448
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:08,926
Do you know how much damage

449
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,385
this could do to the foundation

450
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,801
once it gets disclosed?

451
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:12,843
Your father worked his entire life

452
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:13,926
to build up this foundation,

453
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,151
and it'll all collapse at once.

454
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,608
Is that what you want?

455
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:22,176
Taking away your stepdaughter's position

456
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,926
to give to your birth daughter?

457
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,135
That's the only way you'll find peace.

458
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,677
Now that Dad isn't around,

459
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:31,692
you won't have to play my mother anymore.

460
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,843
You wicked brat.

461
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,884
How dare you speak to me like that?

462
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:38,218
I've looked after you

463
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:39,926
for the last 30 years,

464
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,010
but you never accepted me as your mother.

465
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,218
There's no mother in this world

466
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,692
who can love a daughter who won't open up.

467
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,801
It's all because of you.

468
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,635
You lived your entire life

469
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,276
trying to make Dad hate me!

470
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:56,276
Resign,

471
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,900
before I expose this myself.

472
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:06,817
Right.

473
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,051
And sell off Cheonga Art Centre

474
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:12,552
as soon as it's finished.

475
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:14,468
How much did you spend from the foundation

476
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,427
to make that useless opera house?

477
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,967
That was Dad's long-cherished ambition.

478
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:21,093
I'll operate it no matter what!

479
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:23,010
I'll stop you.

480
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:23,968
I have 30 per cent

481
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,942
of the foundation's shares.

482
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:28,801
You believe you're the only one

483
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:29,926
who's cut out for this job.

484
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,801
You should get rid of that idea.

485
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,834
"Cheonga Foundation"

486
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,775
"Cheonga Foundation"

487
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,401
Oh Yoon Hee.

488
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:54,317
You really exposed this?

489
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,843
There's a lot of moisture in...

490
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,719
Why did you want me here so early?

491
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,218
I'm too distressed to be here.

492
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:12,385
There are no reservations from the ladies.

493
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,525
She was referred here by one of them.

494
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,483
She really wanted you to work on her

495
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,635
and asked me to give this to you too.

496
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:19,968
Really?

497
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:22,093
She's waiting, so get ready in a hurry.

498
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:25,525
And she paid the membership fee in cash.

499
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:26,760
Is she

500
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:28,635
in the scrub room right now?

501
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,654
All right.

502
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,968
"Mari Sauna"

503
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:33,234
Hello.

504
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:35,593
I wonder who referred you here.

505
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:37,135
I rarely ever take

506
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,801
reservations on the same day.

507
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,135
But since you were referred here

508
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,968
by one of our members,

509
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,567
I decided to...

510
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,504
So this was the reason why

511
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,468
you always smelled fresh and soapy

512
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:02,843
whenever you went out, Ma Ri.

513
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,593
I thought you were having an affair,

514
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,484
but this is way more shocking!

515
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:11,567
You're such a nobody of Hera Palace!

516
00:23:12,784 --> 00:23:14,317
How did you find me here?

517
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,025
You'd better get dressed.

518
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:25,734
Assemblyman Lee isn't used to waiting.

519
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,109
My gosh.

520
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,025
Sorry.

521
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,082
"Sauna"

522
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,401
Honey.

523
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,443
My gosh, what is this?

524
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,051
This looks perfect on you

525
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:58,176
now that I see it in real life.

526
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,260
When my aide said

527
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,926
you work as a scrubbing lady,

528
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,884
I didn't believe him.

529
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,218
But this is why people need to live

530
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,593
with an identity they're born into.

531
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:10,010
You look great.

532
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:11,567
Doesn't she, honey?

533
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,552
Exactly.

534
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,968
I knew she seemed awkward when she got

535
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:17,677
all haughty back in Hera Palace,

536
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,025
and this was the reason.

537
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,859
So what?

538
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,801
I don't feel ashamed about this.

539
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,552
I lived a more ethical and decent life

540
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:29,317
than you two.

541
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,884
I worked hard to make money,

542
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:34,176
so I got no reason to feel inferior.

543
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,317
Then why did you hide it to this day?

544
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,301
It's...

545
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:43,010
Because of your girl, of course.

546
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:45,301
But, you know,

547
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,719
your sauna looked a bit too shabby.

548
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:50,317
Since you slave away in a place like this,

549
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:53,260
Je Ni should study very hard.

550
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,093
That's why I told my aide

551
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:57,093
to send a few photos back home

552
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:58,801
for Je Ni to see.

553
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,692
It's about time she grew up.

554
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:02,260
What?

555
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:03,801
You need to start dashing,

556
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:06,025
Ms. Kang Ma Ri!

557
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,859
That was awesome.

558
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,234
My stomach hurts.

559
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:19,109
Ro Na.

560
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,427
You're home.

561
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:22,801
Did anything happen at school?

562
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,093
Ms. Oh.

563
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,635
May we practise for the finals together?

564
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,859
It's nerve-racking to practise alone.

565
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,343
Yes, of course, you can.

566
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,859
Let's go. I'll make some tteokbokki.

567
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:41,859
- Goodness. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

568
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:43,107
- Oh, I'm--
- I'm...

569
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:45,919
- Ouch.
- Why is her head so hard?

570
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:51,401
Goodness, I'm sorry.

571
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,359
It's all right.

572
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,567
Excuse me.

573
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:59,995
Who are you?

574
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,508
It's a secret.

575
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:09,734
A sauna?

576
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:12,317
Who is this?

577
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,677
Hey, it got to the wrong house.

578
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,443
It's for us.

579
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,900
Je Ni!

580
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,801
Je Ni.

581
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:25,025
Je Ni, are you okay?

582
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:28,468
Was... Was anybody here?

583
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:29,468
- Mum.
- Yes?

584
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:30,801
Why are you dressed like this?

585
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:32,484
Where are you coming from?

586
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:34,801
Right.

587
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:38,234
I rushed out while I was at a sauna.

588
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,884
I forgot that I had a dinner engagement.

589
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,051
You and Je Ni should go out for dinner.

590
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:46,092
I'll make tteokbokki for you next time.

591
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:47,531
- Mum, may I do that?
- What?

592
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,135
Yes, okay.

593
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:50,677
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

594
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,942
- Let's go, Ro Na.
- I'll be back.

595
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:59,572
Are you looking for this?

596
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,760
That scumbag.

597
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:21,401
Darn it.

598
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,427
Lee Kyu Jin, you jerk.

599
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:31,843
Is this why you became an assemblyman?

600
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,777
Darn it.

601
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,561
Who's calling me?

602
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:43,719
"Dubai"

603
00:27:43,743 --> 00:27:46,192
Hello? Yes, warder.

604
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,109
Did something happen to my husband?

605
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,409
What?

606
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,891
What do you mean?

607
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,760
He's hurt?

608
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,801
There was a fight between inmates,

609
00:27:58,825 --> 00:27:59,884
and Mr. Yoo was badly hurt,

610
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:01,608
so he's in hospital right now.

611
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,926
He got into a fight?

612
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,968
What's going on?

613
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:08,093
He has been trying to stay away from that.

614
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:10,593
This has never happened before.

615
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:11,968
We're trying to find out what happened.

616
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:13,843
I thought you should know.

617
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:14,968
He should've watched out

618
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:15,884
for the smallest conflict

619
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:17,468
as he was days away from leaving.

620
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,051
If anything happens,

621
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:21,385
his release may get delayed.

622
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,385
Hello?

623
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,900
Warder. Warder?

624
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:29,359
What in the world is going on?

625
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:32,025
Who did he get into a fight with?

626
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:37,234
Wait, could it be Joo Dan Tae?

627
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:42,612
That scumbag.

628
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:48,843
Was this your plan all along?

629
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,301
How dare you try to topple me over

630
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,926
with this darned shadow singer deal?

631
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,843
What are you talking about?

632
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,817
You need to help me understand.

633
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,343
Why did you take it to my mum?

634
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,635
Why did it have to be my sister?

635
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:00,843
You must have thought

636
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:02,760
they would make me the most miserable.

637
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,552
But no matter what you do,

638
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,677
no one can take

639
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,552
Cheonga Arts High from me.

640
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:10,234
I won't let anyone take my office!

641
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:18,510
I don't know what's going on,

642
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:19,635
but whenever your life goes wrong,

643
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:22,109
will you come and take it out on me?

644
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,010
Sadly, I haven't done anything yet.

645
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,650
You must have

646
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,510
a lot of other enemies other than me.

647
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,552
Shut up.

648
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:33,484
What are you doing?

649
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:39,801
Get out of my house.

650
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:41,468
I thought I warned you.

651
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:43,010
I'm not going to stay still

652
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:44,427
if you treat my wife without respect.

653
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,552
You knew, didn't you?

654
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,218
You knew what she had been up to.

655
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:50,843
Since you live with her,

656
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:53,151
I'm sure you knew everything too.

657
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:54,884
You must have had a good laugh.

658
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:56,510
Did you have a lot of fun?

659
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:59,734
Did you have fun laughing at me, you jerk?

660
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:02,552
What are you talking about?

661
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:04,650
No matter how much you hate me,

662
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:08,260
how can you join hands with Yoon Hee

663
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,942
and stab me in the back?

664
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,692
You know

665
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,567
what Cheonga Foundation means to me.

666
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:30,801
Are you all right?

667
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,650
What happened between you two?

668
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,510
Nothing.

669
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:36,218
I think there was a misunderstanding.

670
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:37,593
I can't let her do this anymore.

671
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,984
She does this because we always let her.

672
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:43,567
Don't do anything.

673
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:45,135
If you blow this up,

674
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,051
it'll only make your life difficult.

675
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:47,552
You need to stop letting her do this!

676
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,859
When she comes at you, attack her back!

677
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,443
I'm right here

678
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:01,093
to protect you.

679
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,942
You aren't alone anymore.

680
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,510
It's nothing.

681
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,276
Stop overreacting.

682
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:12,010
Dinner is ready.

683
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:13,801
I have to go out for a moment.

684
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,093
It won't take long.

685
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:16,775
Be careful.

686
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:38,176
Why is it so hard to reach you?

687
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,025
I've been worried sick.

688
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:42,093
Why were you worried?

689
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,984
Your mother called.

690
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:47,484
She said

691
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:49,801
you're resigning from the foundation.

692
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,525
Is that true?

693
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,301
Did my mum say that

694
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:54,942
to you?

695
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:06,093
What's going on?

696
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,443
Is there a problem I don't know about?

697
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:11,093
Tell me. I need to know to help you.

698
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:12,942
Is everything going smoothly

699
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,484
with Cheonga Art Centre?

700
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:17,552
Of course.

701
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:18,719
It'll turn into the most prestigious

702
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:20,010
opera house in the world,

703
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:21,567
just as you dreamed.

704
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:40,443
Please speed up

705
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:42,401
the merger.

706
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,692
Is it because of your mother?

707
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,552
You don't have to rush.

708
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,427
It's an important decision, so give it--

709
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:01,010
No, I've given it enough thought.

710
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,900
There's no reason to put this off.

711
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:06,760
You can announce our merger.

712
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,093
I'll let Mum and Seo Young take over

713
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:09,801
the department store and the hotel.

714
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:12,135
All I need is Cheonga Art Centre.

715
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,093
I'll entrust you with the entire process

716
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,025
of the merger.

717
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,719
If that's what you want,

718
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,359
I'll get started.

719
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,260
It'll be a huge issue in the stock market.

720
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:25,801
You might become much richer

721
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:28,401
than anything you have ever imagined.

722
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,525
I've already satisfied

723
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,401
my desire for money long ago.

724
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:36,692
I don't know. Is that

725
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:38,692
something that can be

726
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,900
fully satisfied?

727
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:43,635
Even if you live in the penthouse

728
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,234
on the 100th floor,

729
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:48,301
you'll want to go up higher and higher.

730
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,151
That's human nature.

731
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,817
Isn't that why you chose me?

732
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,427
Let's not put off our marriage.

733
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,093
Move into the penthouse

734
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:00,817
as soon as Cheonga Arts Festival is over.

735
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:04,234
Your daughter, Seok Kyung.

736
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,608
Do you think I can deal with her?

737
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:10,635
If we move in together...

738
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,359
What about her?

739
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,525
Did she get in trouble again?

740
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,801
No.

741
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,650
Let's talk later.

742
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,468
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,135
Could you please leave?

744
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,552
I need to get some rest.

745
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,109
Sure.

746
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,263
"Joo Dan Tae Village"

747
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:59,524
Seo Jin will make my dream come true.

748
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:00,801
"Cheonga Art Centre"

749
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:02,301
"27, Cheonsu District"

750
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:05,515
I just need to find that wench, Hye In.

751
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:07,926
Then I can take over this land

752
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,900
for myself.

753
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,843
If it hadn't been for Soo Ryeon,

754
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,443
it would've been mine already.

755
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,925
Stop drinking.

756
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,842
Will you be drunk in front of Je Ni?

757
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,508
Don't stop me.

758
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,717
I'll drink until I die. Actually, no.

759
00:35:38,517 --> 00:35:40,201
We'll all die together.

760
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,967
Because you're embarrassed

761
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,343
that you work at the sauna?

762
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,368
You saw?

763
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:47,925
You saw, didn't you?

764
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,910
Why did you see that? Why?

765
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:52,201
What's wrong with working there?

766
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,701
It's not like you stole something.

767
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:55,701
Are you making fun of me now?

768
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,243
Those who are threatening you with that

769
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,410
should be embarrassed.

770
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:01,199
You have no reason to be embarrassed.

771
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,660
Min Hyuk's parents

772
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:05,201
sent the photos, didn't they?

773
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:07,076
That jerk.

774
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,759
He doesn't care that his son's at fault.

775
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:11,743
Instead, he's busy threatening me

776
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,717
using my weakness.

777
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:17,717
That jerk deserves to suffer.

778
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:21,076
There's no point in grumbling.

779
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,577
When you're weak,

780
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,384
you get trampled all over.

781
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,925
I've been through that many times.

782
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,217
The people at Hera Palace did that to me.

783
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,035
You probably can't stand me

784
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:38,176
for only apologising now,

785
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,384
but I must've been out of my mind.

786
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:44,675
This is how people are, you know.

787
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,592
I had no idea

788
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:50,092
until I experienced it myself.

789
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:54,301
If you're still angry, just sue me.

790
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,243
Of course,

791
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:00,925
this is how you'd apologise.

792
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,967
As for this bullying incident,

793
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,134
you don't have solid evidence.

794
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,826
If you keep pushing forward,

795
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,467
you'll be the one getting hurt.

796
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,118
Why don't you

797
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:14,217
just settle things with them?

798
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:16,743
I know

799
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,134
that I'm being stubborn now.

800
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,134
But you see,

801
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,425
until my daughter ended up in that mess,

802
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:26,493
I had no idea whatsoever

803
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,425
even though I'm her mother.

804
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,134
I can't forgive myself for that.

805
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:35,259
I feel horrible.

806
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,717
Let them have one,

807
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:45,634
and make sure

808
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:47,425
you get one too.

809
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,301
Get what?

810
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:58,743
I want to go to school with Eun Byeol.

811
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,076
Where is she?

812
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,134
She's in the shower now.

813
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:03,535
Then I'll wait for her.

814
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,743
It'll take a while.

815
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:06,550
Take a seat and wait here.

816
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:25,285
What? Why isn't it here?

817
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,259
Did she take it into the bathroom?

818
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,967
Eun Byeol, aren't you ready yet?

819
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:44,301
What are you doing here?

820
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,577
- Come.
- That hurts!

821
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:51,701
I get it, so let go.

822
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:53,160
What are you plotting?

823
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,842
What are you doing in Eun Byeol's room?

824
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:59,076
I'm here to go to school with Eun Byeol.

825
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,452
Why don't you trust me?

826
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,701
Since when did you care so much about her?

827
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,717
Mum, what's going on?

828
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,384
Come out!

829
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,634
You know you're overreacting, right?

830
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:19,160
Didn't you say you were innocent?

831
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:21,134
At this rate, you'll get caught.

832
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,176
Joo Seok Kyung.

833
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:25,619
I guess I came too early.

834
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,259
I'll see you at school.

835
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,051
Mum, what is going on?

836
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,160
Keep your distance from Seok Kyung.

837
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:40,201
If she talks nonsense, just ignore her.

838
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:41,701
Do you understand?

839
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:43,717
Yes, I understand.

"Personal Practice Room"

841
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,134
Eun Byeol, stop.

842
00:39:57,892 --> 00:39:59,160
Did you know?

843
00:39:59,184 --> 00:40:02,452
Seok Hoon and Ro Na are back together.

844
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,826
What?

845
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,784
Who said that?

846
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:08,301
I saw them together last night.

847
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:10,910
Gosh, they seemed quite serious.

848
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:13,009
I don't think Seok Hoon

849
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:15,925
is over Ro Na yet.

850
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:18,701
Do you know anything about it?

851
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:21,384
No, not at all.

852
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:34,076
Let go!

853
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,675
What are you doing? Let me go!

854
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:39,452
Stop making a move on Seok Hoon.

855
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:41,410
Do you and your mum have no conscience?

856
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,035
Do you enjoy stealing someone's boyfriend?

857
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:44,577
Watch your mouth.

858
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:46,368
What on earth are you talking about?

859
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:48,493
Seok Hoon is my boyfriend.

860
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:50,076
We're dating.

861
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,285
So don't talk to him.

862
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:53,327
Don't even look at him

863
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,701
or hover around him.

864
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:56,508
It really irks me.

865
00:40:56,892 --> 00:41:00,384
But your mum is engaged to his dad.

866
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,660
How can you two be dating?

867
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:05,842
I don't want to explain it to you.

868
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:09,868
I've clearly warned you.

869
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:11,868
If you're seen with him once again,

870
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:13,675
that will be

871
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:15,884
the end of us.

872
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,301
You got that?

873
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:26,508
They're dating?

874
00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:28,884
It must be a lie.

875
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:30,800
That can't be.

876
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:38,076
What did you just say?

877
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,118
The bullying incident.

878
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:40,967
I'll just let it go.

879
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:42,743
Let's just drop it with Seok Kyung

880
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,285
on probation.

881
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:45,701
That's what you should've said

882
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:47,410
from the start.

883
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:50,243
Have you finally come to your senses?

884
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:53,201
And let Seok Kyung participate

885
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:55,051
in the festival.

886
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,343
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

887
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,784
I wonder too.

888
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,868
Isn't it better for Je Ni

889
00:42:00,892 --> 00:42:02,701
that Seok Kyung isn't there?

890
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:04,868
The more participants there are,

891
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:07,327
the lower her rank is going to be.

892
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:11,285
Je Ni can easily beat Seok Kyung.

893
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,634
I want everyone to see that.

894
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:16,201
And after all, I did receive

895
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:17,910
a so-called apology.

896
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,550
Anyway,

897
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,051
thank you for making this decision.

898
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,118
Ms. Oh, you agree with this, right?

899
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:27,925
I do,

900
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:31,826
but on one condition.

901
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,743
What is it?

902
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:36,035
I'll join Cheonga's Parents' Committee.

903
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,910
As a member,

904
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,076
I'll have the right to observe school life

905
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,009
and check the security footage as well.

906
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,826
There's no guarantee that the kids

907
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,452
won't harass Ro Na any more,

908
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:47,701
and it makes me anxious.

909
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:49,577
Are you saying you'll monitor them?

910
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:52,301
I have to protect my daughter, don't I?

911
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:53,784
And that being said,

912
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:56,701
let the committee choose

913
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:59,535
the judges for the upcoming festival.

914
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,259
Only the school

915
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:04,425
has the authority to do that.

916
00:43:04,684 --> 00:43:06,634
Isn't that why

917
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,051
there has been all the corruption?

918
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:10,577
Including some

919
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,592
questionable grand prize winners.

920
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,076
You're out of line.

921
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,619
It's true that the fairness

922
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:19,925
has always been questioned.

923
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,118
If you want to avoid such suspicions,

924
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,384
you just can proceed with her suggestion.

925
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,343
I think we should.

926
00:43:28,434 --> 00:43:30,118
What about you, Ms. Ko?

927
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:33,925
I have no reason to oppose.

928
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:36,118
Oh, right.

929
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:37,743
I'll notify the district school board

930
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,368
that we'll settle and drop the case

931
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:41,759
only after my request is granted.

932
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:44,009
What do you say?

933
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:56,415
"7 days before the festival's final round"

934
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,242
Nothing too salty.

935
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:26,910
You have to eat balanced meals

936
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:28,743
with all the nutrients.

937
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,035
You need to eat well

938
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:31,410
to have the strength to sing.

939
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:34,770
Here, open wide. Good, that's my boy.

940
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:43,285
No, no!

941
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:44,785
- Mum, my throat.
- No.

942
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,675
Here, wrap this around your neck.

943
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,118
Again!

944
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:53,784
Is that all you can do?

945
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:55,160
The higher you sing,

946
00:44:55,184 --> 00:44:56,993
the lower your breaths should be.

947
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:58,292
You also need to raise your pitch

948
00:44:58,317 --> 00:44:59,737
and make your upper lip vibrate.

949
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:02,212
Okay, I'll try again.

950
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:06,576
"Mi Yeon"

951
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:19,759
What's wrong, Mum?

952
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:21,160
Is something wrong?

953
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:22,800
It's nothing.

954
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:25,351
Just focus on the song.

955
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:38,176
Why can't you hold your breath longer?

956
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,650
You can't win the grand prize with this!

957
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:43,775
If you let Ro Na win the grand prize,

958
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,926
my life will be over.

959
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,192
Beat Ro Na no matter what,

960
00:45:49,492 --> 00:45:51,400
even if you must kill her.

961
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:54,400
I can do it.

962
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,525
I'll win the grand prize.

963
00:45:56,783 --> 00:45:58,859
I won't lose to Ro Na.

964
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,635
Your singing must be flawless

965
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,885
so we can squash the idiots

966
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:03,218
complaining about fairness.

967
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:04,635
Practise non-stop

968
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,400
until you can do it.

969
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,650
Start over with the diaphragm breathing.

970
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:24,926
Flex your abs.

971
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,567
More!

972
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:29,594
I was worried for nothing.

973
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:31,650
She has no evidence.

974
00:46:31,783 --> 00:46:33,676
Why did I let a kid scare me?

975
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,359
That was very unlike me.

976
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:37,026
More!

977
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:03,343
It'll be hard not to win the grand prize.

978
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:04,510
Was I really okay?

979
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:05,718
Yes.

980
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,218
Just take good care of your throat

981
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:08,843
until the finals.

982
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,510
Congratulations in advance.

983
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:12,192
Thank you.

just the two of us.

997
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:01,427
We're engaged

998
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:03,051
and merged the companies.

999
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,567
I feel like we're really one now.

1000
00:48:05,742 --> 00:48:07,510
I'm relieved too.

1001
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,468
It took me a while to decide,

1002
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:11,051
but now that it's done,

1003
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:12,734
I trust you.

1004

and investment.

1006

They're your specialities.

1007
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:23,359
I already have a detailed business plan.

1008

Here.

"Joo Dan Tae Village"

1010
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:32,968
This is what I'm developing.

1011
00:48:32,992 --> 00:48:34,718
It's only 20 minutes away from Gangnam.

1012
00:48:34,742 --> 00:48:36,343
Your Cheonga Art Centre

1013
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,320
will be at the core of it.

1014
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:41,759
The construction will be completed soon.

1015
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:42,885
I'm excited.

1016
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:44,635
The moment the development is announced,

1017
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,676
it'll be impossible for anyone

1018
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,926
to buy the land.

1019
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,151
It'll be worth more than Hera Palace.

1020
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:50,594
This will become

1021
00:48:50,618 --> 00:48:52,010
the wealthiest neighbourhood,

1022

if anything at this school

1190
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,510
is ever done "fairly".

1191
01:00:56,534 --> 01:00:59,343
You bluffed that you'd bring evidence.

1192
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:02,192
Was this all you could come up with?

1193
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,510
The results will be announced soon.

1194
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:08,359
I didn't mean to be all dramatic,

1195
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:11,051
but you want to see it so desperately,

1196
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:12,859
so let me show you the evidence.

1197
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,942
Here it is.

1198
01:01:18,117 --> 01:01:19,817
The evidence.

1199
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:27,718
What are you talking about?

1200
01:01:27,742 --> 01:01:30,151
Eun Byeol had it all along.

1201
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:31,984
The evidence

1202
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:35,318
that you killed her grandpa.

1203
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:38,260
I'm not interested in knowing why

1204
01:01:38,284 --> 01:01:40,302
she kept it and what she was planning

1205
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:42,151
to do with it.

1206
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:44,984
I just want the grand prize trophy.

1207
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:46,718
Even without it, Eun Byeol

1208
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:49,010
can get into Seoul University of Music.

1209
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:50,900
So all you need to do

1210
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,260
is call my name regardless of whose name

1211
01:01:53,284 --> 01:01:55,567
you find in the envelope.

1212
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,468
I feel like we've finally become

1213
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,109
a real family.

1214
01:02:06,284 --> 01:02:07,718
See you in a bit,

1215
01:02:07,742 --> 01:02:09,400
Mum.

1216
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,218
Seo Jin.

1217
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:07,775
Help...

1218
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,817
Where are you, ma'am?

1219
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:37,359
We have to announce the winner.

1220
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:47,276
"JKING Holdings, Chairman Joo Dan Tae"

1221
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,247
"28th Cheonga Arts Festival"

1222
01:03:57,075 --> 01:03:59,051
What did you and Seok Hoon talk about?

1223
01:03:59,075 --> 01:04:01,609
He congratulated me for doing a good job.

1224
01:04:01,783 --> 01:04:02,926
They'll announce the winner soon.

1225
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:04,525
I have to go.

1226
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,926
Why?

1227
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,385
Do you think you can win the grand prize?

1228
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,093
That will not happen.

1229
01:04:11,117 --> 01:04:12,676
My mum will never

1230
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,151
give it to a loser like you.

1231
01:04:16,783 --> 01:04:18,688
"28th Cheonga Arts Festival"

1232
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:20,859
Like what she did to my mum?

1233
01:04:20,992 --> 01:04:23,276
- What?
- Even back then,

1234
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,276
she stole the grand prize trophy from her.

1235
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,343
Your mum stole

1236
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:30,010
what was rightfully my mum's.

1237
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:32,376
She could do it thanks to your grandpa.

1238
01:04:33,534 --> 01:04:36,442
My mum won it because she deserved it.

1239
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,385
Do not insult my mum.

1240
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:40,942
After that, she slashed my mum's throat.

1241
01:04:41,284 --> 01:04:42,759
Because of your mum,

1242
01:04:42,783 --> 01:04:44,635
my mum had to give up on college

1243
01:04:44,659 --> 01:04:45,676
and had her trophy

1244
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,801
and her dream stolen from her.

1245
01:04:46,825 --> 01:04:47,801
No.

1246
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:49,676
My mum would never do that!

1247
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,942
You can deny it, but everyone knows

1248
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:53,676
that even back then,

1249
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,775
my mum was much better than Ms. Cheon.

1250
01:04:57,742 --> 01:04:59,609
And she still is.

1251
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:02,567
You lost to me, Eun Byeol.

1252
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,900
Your dad

1253
01:05:06,492 --> 01:05:08,609
bribed my pianist, didn't he?

1254
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:11,276
I bet you asked him to do it.

1255
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:13,318
To ruin my performance.

1256
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,276
Did you want the grand prize that badly?

1257
01:05:21,576 --> 01:05:23,525
But I can't let you have it.

1258
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:25,635
I must win this year's grand prize

1259
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:27,775
no matter what.

1260
01:05:38,825 --> 01:05:40,010
You know, right?

1261
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:41,510
No matter what anyone says,

1262
01:05:41,534 --> 01:05:43,650
you're my only daughter, Eun Byeol.

1263
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:45,843
I know that you'll win

1264
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:47,692
the grand prize today.

1265
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:49,692
Trust me.

1266
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:51,759
Do you

1267
01:05:51,783 --> 01:05:52,843
really mean it?

1268
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,885
Yes, of course.

1269
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,926
Why? You don't believe me?

1270
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:58,692
Then prove it.

1271
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:01,026
Prove that I'm your only daughter.

1272
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,385
Sure, what can I do?

1273
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:05,759
I'll do anything you want.

1274
01:06:05,783 --> 01:06:07,218
What must I do?

1275
01:06:07,242 --> 01:06:10,483
Ruin Ro Na's performance.

1276
01:06:10,992 --> 01:06:13,318
Break the piano

1277
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,525
or bribe the pianist.

1278
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,218
Make sure Ro Na doesn't win the prize.

1279
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:20,510
Eun Byeol, that's--

1280
01:06:20,534 --> 01:06:23,442
You promised me to do anything I ask.

1281
01:06:26,492 --> 01:06:29,400
You'll do it for me, right?

1282
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:32,234
If you don't,

1283
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:35,483
I'll never talk to you again.

1284
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:44,734
Eun Byeol.

1285
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:47,109
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

1286
01:06:47,534 --> 01:06:48,885
If you let Ro Na win the grand prize,

1287
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:50,718
my life will be over.

1288
01:06:50,742 --> 01:06:52,859
Beat Ro Na no matter what,

1289
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:55,400
even if you must kill her.

1290
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:57,817
Stop.

1291
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:00,483
Stop!

1292
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:09,676
You lost to me, Eun Byeol.

1293
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,343
Your dad, Seok Hoon,

1294
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:14,400
and the grand prize

1295
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:16,400
are all mine.

1296
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:25,010
No.

1297
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:26,817
Shut your mouth!

1298
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:56,067
Eun Byeol, what are you doing?

1299
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,885
We'll now bring our chief director,

01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,709
So all you need to do

1357
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,402
is call my name regardless of whose name

1358
01:11:20,426 --> 01:11:22,917
you find in the envelope.

1359
01:11:31,883 --> 01:11:33,568
The winner is Bae Ro Na.

01:11:33,592 --> 01:11:36,062
"28th Cheonga Arts Festival"

1361
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:22,114
=Penthouse 2=

1362
01:12:22,192 --> 01:12:23,710
Is it a murder case?

1363
01:12:23,734 --> 01:12:25,773
The killer was at the school that day.

1364
01:12:25,798 --> 01:12:27,364
Seok Kyung tried to kill Ro Na!

1365
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:28,459
What happened?

1366
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:29,918
Tell the truth!

1367
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:31,767
Seok Kyung isn't the killer.

1368
01:12:32,442 --> 01:12:33,376
Did you do it?

1369
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,162
No.

1370
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:36,085
I'm telling you the truth. Believe me!

1371
01:12:36,109 --> 01:12:37,763
I will protect her with my life.

1372
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:38,972
Even if you must kill Ro Na?

1373
01:12:38,997 --> 01:12:41,471
Yoon Chul, you can't do that to Ro Na.

1374
01:12:41,496 --> 01:12:43,750
The culprit in Ro Na's case...

1375
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:46,767
Who are you?
