You're here.

7
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:31,776
What are you doing?

8
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,442
Why are you here?

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,734
What are you doing?

10
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:58,859
Why are the lights off?

11
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,526
Is Ms. Jin not here?

12
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:01,942
Don't turn on the lights.

13
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,983
I can't wait any longer.

14
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,609
Show me how you feel about me, Seok Hoon.

15
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,275
What are you doing?

16
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,192
Joo Seok Hoon!

17
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,734
You can't just leave like that!

18
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,150
What are you doing then?

19
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,275
We are supposed to be studying together

20
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,692
and sharing the tutor. That's it.

21
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:31,983
If you are going to do this,

22
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,192
we should drop the tutoring.

23
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:37,442
Don't ever call me again.

24
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,484
Promise me one thing.

25
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:44,734
That you won't get shaken by Bae Ro Na.

26
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,567
There's nothing

27
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,442
between Ro Na and me now.

28
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,192
I got over her a long time ago.

29
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:30,734
You didn't wait for long, right?

30
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,942
No. I got here a little early.

31
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,567
They recommended a wine.

32
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:37,609
Do you want the same thing? - Sure.

33
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:42,275
How do you like this hotel?

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
I rented it long-term.

35
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,109
Use it freely whenever you want to rest.

36
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:47,734
Better if we are here together.

37
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:48,900
Thank you.

38
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,609
I never expected it.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,900
The view is amazing.

40
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,442
It's nice and snug too.

41
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,526
Oh, there's one more thing.

42
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:57,692
It's a surprise.

43
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:10,275
Come on.

44
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:21,317
What is it?

45
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:23,317
I saw you wearing Ms. Baek's dress often,

46
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:24,859
so I asked for a few.

47
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,109
You can wear them to this year's concerts.

48
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,442
I will get more dresses for you next year.

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,776
Here.

50
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:35,859
Aren't you going to look at them?

51
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,317
What do you think? Do you like it?

52
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:48,859
Yes.

53
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:50,983
They're so pretty.

54
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:53,983
Let's see.

55
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,317
Why don't you

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,942
wear it to the banquet at the Blue House?

57
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,567
This is a specially tailored one.

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,776
Gosh.

59
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:05,900
I'm touched.

60
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,818
When did you prepare all these?

61
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,150
I'm happy to see you being so happy.

62
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,067
Should we make a toast?

63
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:19,692
Let's relax and drink until late tonight.

64
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,067
I am sorry,

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,484
but I think I need to go.

66
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:26,734
What do you mean?

67
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,526
Mum called

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,609
and said she isn't feeling well,

69
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:32,609
and I'm worried.

70
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:34,192
Is she seriously ill?

71
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,526
That's why you seemed nervous.

72
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,400
You are shivering now.

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,818
I don't think it's serious.

74
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,234
I should hurry and go see her.

75
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:46,859
Okay. Let's go.

76
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:00,359
You don't look well.

77
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:01,359
I will take you there.

78
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,526
I'm fine. I can go alone.

79
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,609
I'll get going then.

80
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,234
Check how your mum is and give me a call.

81
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:46,150
Whoa.

82
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:47,859
Did you come back? To see me?

83
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,317
What are you playing at?

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,359
What do you want?

85
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:52,900
How did you know that I was here?

86
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:54,067
Did you follow me?

87
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,400
Relax.

88
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,859
I've been wondering why you came back.

89
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,067
It's obvious that

90
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,234
that cheeky girl, Oh Yoon Hee,

91
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:02,776
is using you to show me.

92
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:04,150
Do you not know?

93
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,275
Or are you playing innocent?

94
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:06,859
Listen to me first!

95
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,942
You

96
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,150
still have feelings for me, don't you?

97
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:11,651
That's why you are getting on my nerves

98
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:12,692
by bringing Yoon Hee

99
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,275
and even her daughter into this.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,067
Do you think I will be shaken by this?

101
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,275
Do you think I will throw away everything

102
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,234
and go back to you?

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,526
That's so you, Ha Yoon Chul. Truly.

104
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:28,442
Did you just laugh?

105
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,734
Well, that would be fun

106
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:45,567
if I was putting on a play

107
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:46,484
to take you back.

108
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:48,900
But it's too bad.

109
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:50,526
You let your imagination run wild,

110
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:51,734
and I am sorry to disappoint you.

111
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,150
But I love Yoon Hee.

112
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
You must've been bothered by my return.

113
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,400
I thought you and Joo Dan Tae

114
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:02,484
were really happy together.

115
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,400
I guess that's not the case.

116
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,067
Tell me why you came to this hotel.

117
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,317
Why did you do that to me in New York?

118
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,484
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:14,067
I don't remember anything.

120
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:17,150
How about now?

121
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,526
Stop it!

122
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,734
I came to the hotel for a meeting,

123
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:29,275
and I saw you in the lobby.

124
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:31,900
I wanted to check if what happened

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
between us in New York was a mistake.

126
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:36,983
Now I know that it was a mistake.

127
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:38,400
That's all.

128
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:46,900
Your feelings for Yoon Hee are real?

129
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:48,734
You expect me to believe that?

130
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,359
I don't care if you don't believe it.

131
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,150
What I'm certain of is that

132
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:53,900
you no longer have

133
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,275
a place in my heart.

134
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,109
So please be more careful from now on.

135
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,484
Jerk!

136
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,359
Never show up in front of me again

137
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,484
if you want to live.

138
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,359
I wouldn't want to do that.

139
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,067
"Get lost,"

140
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,609
"murderer!"

141
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,567
"Get lost, murderer!"

142
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,317
You are the daughter of the murderer.

143
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,692
I will never let you get away with it.

144
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,942
Hey! What are you doing here?

145
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,734
Gosh, did you do this?

146
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,442
Stay out of it, lady.

147
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:01,651
Unless you are siding with the murderer.

148
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:06,983
That rude brat!

149
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,484
How dare she talk to an adult like that?

150
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,859
"Get lost, murderer!"

151
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,275
Why are you so late?

152
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,442
Did you hide gold bars at Min Hyuk's?

153
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:32,900
Something like that.

154
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,776
By the way, why are you still awake?

155
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,192
I was waiting for you

156
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:39,317
because I wanted to tell you something.

157
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,400
Can we talk tomorrow?

158
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:46,900
I had a few drinks, and I feel sleepy.

159
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,067
What is it about?

160
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:52,734
It's nothing.

161
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:54,317
I will tell you next time.

162
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,983
Okay. I am sorry, darling.

163
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,067
I'll go to bed then.

164
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,859
Love you, my princess. - Love you too.

165
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,526
What are you doing?

166
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,651
Bae Ro Na is back at school.

167
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:14,359
Ms. Cheon let her come back!

168
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:17,484
She let her re-enrol?

169
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,776
Bae Ro Na is a murderer's daughter.

170
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,983
Just living with her drives me mad.

171
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,442
And I am to go to school with her too?

172
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,484
If you have time to get worked up,

173
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:26,942
why don't you spend it

174
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,359
to prepare for Cheonga Arts Festival?

175
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,275
Other kids are talented enough

176
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,317
to get into the university, but you...

177
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:32,609
Without the headmaster's recommendation,

178
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,942
you won't be able to get into

179
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,526
any decent university in Seoul,

180
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:36,734
let alone Seoul University of Music.

181
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,234
You're a hopeless case

182
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,442
who can't even take a midterm

183
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:41,442
without the answer sheet I steal for you.

184
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,067
You won't ask me

185
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,900
to buy the answer sheet of CSAT, will you?

186
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:47,776
What will you give me

187
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,942
if I win the grand prize trophy?

188
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,234
Anything you want.

189
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:57,109
Let me move out then.

190
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:58,567
Move out?

191
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:00,776
Living with Eun Byeol makes my hair stand.

192
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,025
If I get into college, I am moving out.

193
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,859
There's an apartment bought under my name.

194
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:09,942
You want to move out?

195
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:13,317
All right.

196
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:15,818
I will think about it

197
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,942
after you bring the trophy home.

198
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,150
I promise you.

199
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,734
I will do whatever it takes to bring

200
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,526
the trophy from Cheonga Arts Festival.

201
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,567
"Get lost, murderer!"

202
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,900
This is what you signed up for?

203
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:45,025
Is this why you came back?

204
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,484
I won't change my mind.

205
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,484
You should go back to the US.

206
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,150
Don't even dream about staying here.

207
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:54,442
I...

208
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:56,484
am going to live here.

209
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:57,942
Says who?

210
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,776
I told her to come.

211
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,442
What are you doing?

212
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:05,192
Welcome home, Ro Na.

213
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:07,818
You must be tired after a long journey.

214
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,609
I cleaned up your room. Come on in.

215
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:11,651
Watch out.

216
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,859
"Let's make this work"

217
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,651
"Don't forget that there are people"

218
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:33,692
Let's make this work.

219
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,275
Don't forget that there are

220
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,150
people on your side around you.

221
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:38,442
I will root for you.

222
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:39,442
From Yoon Chul.

223
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,109
"Permission for Bae Ro Na's re-enrolment"

224
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:59,067
"has been granted."

225
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:04,567
Have you ever met Seol A?

226
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,734
No.

227
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:08,567
Not once.

228
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,734
Mr. Lee,

229
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:15,983
my mum

230
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,109
did what she did to Seol A

231
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:20,692
all because of me.

232
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:22,734
I made a big fuss about wanting

233
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:23,900
to go to Cheonga Arts High.

234
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:26,442
I pestered Mum every day.

235
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,317
So...

236
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:31,942
hate me,

237
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:35,109
and don't hate my mum so much.

238
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:42,275
Whenever I saw you at the school,

239
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,150
I was reminded of Seol A.

240
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,025
Seol A was a great singer like you.

241
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,317
Singing was

242
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,317
her dream.

243
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:58,526
She called me the day she met

244
00:13:58,651 --> 00:13:59,859
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin for the first time.

245
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
Anna Lee, right?

246
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:05,150
Yes.

247
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,067
But you can call me Anna.

248
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:09,776
I saw Ms. Cheon Seo Jin for the first time.

249
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,942
I got so nervous that my mind went blank.

250
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,776
So I didn't even get to say

251
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:14,776
what I prepared to say.

252
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,734
That I am her big fan.

253
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,442
She was much more beautiful in real life,

254
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:21,776
and I was just in awe of her presence.

255
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,651
I saw the photo of her singing,

256
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,025
and my heart raced like crazy.

257
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,942
It suddenly made me sing desperately.

258
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:32,442
Getting admitted to Cheonga Arts High,

259
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:33,900
becoming her student,

260
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,400
singing a beautiful song on stage,

261
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,067
and winning the grand prize trophy

262
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,192
at Cheonga Arts Festival.

263
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,942
Imagining those made me so happy.

264
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,484
Could I have sung too

265
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:49,150
if I had a mother?

266
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,192
"Bae Ro Na"

267
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:57,942
Min Seol A,

268
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:00,484
I will make your unfulfilled dreams

269
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,234
come true.

270
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,526
I will win the grand prize trophy

271
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,484
at Cheonga Arts Festival.

272
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,317
After that,

273
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,526
I won't sing again.

274
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:16,900
What are you talking about?

275
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:17,983
Of course, she should come home.

276
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:18,942
Why would that little girl

277
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,025
stay in the US alone?

278
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,067
So you signed the consent form

279
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:24,192
without discussing it with me?

280
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,025
Ro Na called me personally and asked.

281
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,192
How could I say no?

282
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,651
Yoon Hee, why are you against it?

283
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,567
I can't understand why you are so upset.

284
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,692
Ro Na shouldn't be here.

285
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,109
You know very well what kind of a place

286
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:40,317
Cheonga Arts High School is.

287
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,818
Do you think

288
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,983
Seo Jin will leave Ro Na alone?

289
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,609
You don't have to worry about that.

290
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,983
Ro Na!

291
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:49,442
I just got a permission to re-enrol.

292
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,150
I'll go to school then.

293
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:54,900
Ro Na, I'm coming with you.

294
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:57,692
I'll go to work straight away.

295
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:58,651
Eat some breakfast.

296
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,609
Wait. - Ro Na!

297
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:02,900
Let's go, Ro Na.

298
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,067
You look great today.

299
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:12,859
Ro Na.

300
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,983
Here. You didn't have breakfast.

301
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,400
Thank you.

302
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,234
Thank you for the necklace too.

303
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,025
I like it.

304
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,317
Mr. Ha. - Yes.

305
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,192
Please be good to my mum.

306
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,067
Be good to her,

307
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,025
even if it's just you.

308
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,359
Ro Na, wait for me.

309
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:48,651
This is so annoying.

He's famous for being my anti-fan.

318
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,150
Did he write something nasty again?

319

What happened?

00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:27,776
Last night, didn't you say

326
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,234
you were going to your mother?

327

Yes. That's...

328
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,317
I left my wallet in the hotel room,

329
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,234
so I went to get it.

330
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,942
I bumped into someone on the way out.

331
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,359
He was a total stranger.

332
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,776
He was drunk and hitting on me,

333
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,025
so I lost him and ran away.

334
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,734
It's a rubbish made-up story.

You want me to believe that?

336
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,692
Since when did you keep secrets from me?

337
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:53,067
You lied to me

338
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,359
and went to meet another man.

339
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,317

I told you! He was a stranger.

344

who ran into me by mistake?

345
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:05,900
So he's a stranger?

346
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:10,609
Come in, Mr. Cho.

347
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,776
Who is he?

348
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,150
The photo is rather blurry,

349
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:18,317
so I am still searching.

350
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,275
What did the hotel say?

351
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,442
I asked for the security camera footage,

352
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,192
but they denied it due to privacy policy.

353
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,859
If you have time to give me

354
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,776
a lame answer like that,

355
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,359
go find that jerk!

356
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,942
The rumours must've spread already.

357
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,192
Our stock prices plummeted.

358
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,484
I will give you an hour.

359
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,067
Find the guy and bring him to me.

360

Stop!

361
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:47,734
You can leave, Mr. Cho.

362
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,526
When I say it's nothing,

363
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:55,983
shouldn't you believe me

364
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,192
regardless of what it may seem?

365
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,234
I can get this under control

366
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,275
only if you tell me the truth.

367
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:00,359
He's like a leech,

368
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,526
so he will do whatever he can

369
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:02,442
to get the articles out.

370
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,317
We have to make a money deal with him.

371
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,484
There's no need to make a deal.

00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,859
I will take care of it.

I said I will take care of it.

You got upset at me and blamed me

without giving me a chance to explain.

377
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:15,734

And it happened to be in a hotel.

You promised that she wouldn't come back.

00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:36,651
We need to give them a chance.

685
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,275
"Preliminary Round"

686
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,025
What are you doing?

687
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:49,109
Move.

688
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:50,192
I am not giving up.

689
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,900
I will never lose to them!

690
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,067
It won't change anything.

691
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,983
Let go!

692
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:01,400
Yoo Je Ni.

693
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,025
"Cheonga Arts High School"

694
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,818
Come on out.

695
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
We don't have time.

696
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:20,484
What are you doing?

697
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,109
The last team finished.

698
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:33,484
Waiting longer doesn't seem fair.

699
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:34,859
Why don't we say

700
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:37,526
Seok Kyung and Eun Byeol won by default?

701
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:39,150
Good. - Great idea.

702
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:42,900
I guess we don't have a choice.

703
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,192
Je Ni and Ro Na are disqualified.

704
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,042
Seok Kyung and Eun Byeol

705
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,400
will go to the finals.

706
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,317
I... I am here.

707
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:58,067
I am not late, am I?

708
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:03,734
I'm sorry.

709
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:05,651
It's already over.

710
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,900
You just got disqualified.

711
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,192
Let me do it.

712
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,359
It's not over yet.

713
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,776
Being punctual is the most important

714
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:13,859
part of an exam.

715
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,542
You didn't show up on time,

716
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:16,567
so you should get disqualified.

717
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,025
Accept it.

718
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:20,900
Someone locked me inside the ladies' room.

719
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:22,484
On purpose.

720
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:26,170
Who would do that?

721
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,484
Joo Seok Kyung. Ha Eun Byeol.

722
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,067
Why did you do that?

723
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,651
You tell them the truth.

724
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:35,150
Were you that insecure?

725
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,192
Is that how much you feared

726
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:38,651
about me going to the finals?

727
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:40,609
Bae Ro Na!

728
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,651
What nonsense are you saying now?

729
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,776
You still won't be getting another chance.

730
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,025
But it's true.

731
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:47,442
Please believe me.

732
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:50,609
How will you prove it?

733
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,109
Je Ni was there with me.

734
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:54,109
Je Ni is the witness.

735
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,275
She's lying.

736
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:57,442
What? - What?

737
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,250
Ro Na forced me to pretend

738
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,651
to be locked in the ladies' room.

739
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,859
She said we had to accuse

740
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,317
Seok Kyung and Eun Byeol as bullies

741
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,442
since we can't beat them otherwise.

742
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:06,359
She said only then...

743
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:09,942
we would make it to the finals.

744
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:12,859
She locked me in the ladies' room

745
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:13,942
and stopped me from leaving.

746
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:16,942
You staged an act?

747
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:18,400
Ro Na,

748
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,609
are you mad?

749
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:23,025
Je Ni, why are you doing this?

750
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,359
Are you done?

751
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,734
Yes.

752
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,109
Je Ni,

753
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:42,692
you're in my team, aren't you?

754
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:45,484
How can you be so unlucky?

755
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:46,818
Do you already have no chance

756
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,192
of making it to the finals?

757
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,150
You're not going to sing hard

758
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,734
to beat me, are you?

759
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:57,234
Don't get intimidated.

760
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:59,359
We called you to help you.

761
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:01,609
There's only one way

762
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:02,942
you can pass the preliminary round.

763
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,400
What is that?

764
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,526
You just have to prove to us

765
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,942
that you are our friend, not Ro Na's.

766
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:13,900
Then you can go to the finals.

767
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:15,484
And you won't be an outcast any more.

768
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,651
I can even put you back in

769
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:18,776
the prep class for Seoul University.

770
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:21,317
What do you say?

771
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,275
Bae Ro Na.

772
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,484
Were you a cheap person like this?

773
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,651
Cheonga Arts Festival is important,

774
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:28,859
but how can you use such a trick?

775
00:37:29,442 --> 00:37:32,651
You are just a wicked girl, aren't you?

776
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,776
Yoo Je Ni.

777
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:35,317
Is what you're saying true?

778
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:36,983
Can you be responsible for your words?

779
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:39,484
Yes.

780
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,317
I can take responsibility for my words.

781
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:44,609
No.

782
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:45,692
She's lying.

783
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,192
I never did that.

784
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:48,442
I am the one who got locked.

785
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:49,567
I am the victim.

786
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,400
Mr. Ma.

787
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:52,900
As the chief director,

788
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:53,942
I will refer Ro Na

789
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:55,609
to the disciplinary committee.

790
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:57,942
She tarnished the pure meaning

791
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,067
of Cheonga Arts Festival.

792
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,859
And we cannot let this slide.

793
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:04,150
Punish her strictly according to rules

794
00:38:04,692 --> 00:38:06,067
without doing her a favour.

795
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:10,442
Go tell them.

796
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,025
Tell them I didn't do it

797
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,526
and that they put you up to it.

798
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:15,484
Were you...

799
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:17,609
in on this from the get-go?

800
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,192
Were you one of them, after all?

801
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Why?

802
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:23,734
Why can't I be?

803
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,983
I went through so much because of you.

804
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:28,900
I was bullied

805
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:30,067
and cursed at instead of you!

806
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,150
Just because I bought you some bread

807
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,109
and made the mistake of saying

808
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:35,109
I felt bad for you!

809
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,150
So shouldn't you take one for me too?

810
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,942
To make up

811
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,067
for everything I've been through,

812
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,234
I must get into Seoul National University.

813
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,900
College is the only way

814
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:51,942
out of this nightmare.

815
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,400
So you're saying

816
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,458
it's okay for me to be expelled again?

817
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,442
I was never a nice person.

818
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:28,609
Get up.

819
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:34,983
When did you get here?

820
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:36,734
I saw everything.

821
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:37,859
You and Je Ni.

822
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,609
I know that you hate me,

823
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,484
but just let me help you with this.

824
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:51,825
I'll make sure you can stay at Cheonga.

825
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:56,700
A bully?

826
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:58,284
Min Hyuk is the one with a broken arm.

827
00:39:58,367 --> 00:39:59,618
Who stabbed whom?

828
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,742
I can't believe this.

829
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:02,451
Ro Na's mum has no shame!

830
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,717
That's not important now.

831
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:06,217
Because of Ro Na,

832
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:08,117
Je Ni didn't pass the preliminary.

833
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,326
It's utter nonsense!

834
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,367
The parents' committee

835
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,492
should make sure she gets reprimanded.

836
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,909
My gosh. What? A bully?

837
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,825
Hey, you.

838
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:31,783
Just back out if you feel insecure.

839
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,159
Why drag my innocent Je Ni into this?

840
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:35,992
Because of you, she got eliminated.

841
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:37,034
What will you do now?

842
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,200
No one's happy to see you. Why come back

843
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,075
and ruin my daughter's future?

844
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,492
I really didn't do anything!

845
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,618
Gosh, Ma Ri. Calm down.

846
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,451
We'll get blamed for what happened.

847
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:50,825
How can I calm down right now?

848
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:52,426
"Made it to the finals

849
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,659
in Cheonga Arts Festival".

850
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,593
You know how important that is

851
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:56,700
for college applications.

852
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,950
This girl stripped Je Ni of the chance

853
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:00,783
to obtain that title!

854
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,659
Je Ni is resilient.

855
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,659
She'll ace the CSAT

856
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,618
and get into a good college.

857
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,409
Ms. Cheon.

858
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:11,367
Please help Je Ni.

859
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:13,700
She was unfairly stripped of her chance.

860
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:16,175
Shouldn't you give her another chance?

861
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,825
Ms. Kang, do you even care about Je Ni?

862
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:22,326
What is she saying now?

863
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:26,242
Have you still not learned your lesson?

864
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:28,675
Just tell them the truth!

865
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,075
Get your hands off my daughter!

866
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:32,992
Ro Na.

867
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:34,950
Are you okay?

868
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,409
Are you hurt?

869
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:38,367
How can an adult do this to a child?

870
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:39,783
Don't you know that this is abuse?

871
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:41,884
I can't believe none of you

872
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:43,200
stepped in to stop this child abuse!

873
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,742
If you try to hurt Ro Na one more time,

874
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:49,576
I will sue you all.

875
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,451
You sure love saying that. But you see,

876
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:55,284
you just can't help it

877
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,992
when it runs in your blood.

878
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:58,326
A criminal mum raised a bully.

879
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,409
Nice, well done.

880
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:03,534
This is why I say the family matters.

881
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,242
You lowborn good-for-nothings.

882
00:42:05,618 --> 00:42:07,075
Shut your mouth!

883
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,618
Hit me.

884
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:09,742
If you want to go to jail.

885
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,618
That will serve you right.

886
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:13,950
Enough!

887
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,242
Act in accordance

888
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:17,576
with the prestige of Hera Palace.

889
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:20,200
Everyone, take your seat.

890
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:21,618
Unbelievable.

891
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:24,783
Jeez.

892
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:31,284
Ro Na.

893
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,742
So who are the bullies?

894
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:36,576
Joo Seok Kyung,

895
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:39,492
Lee Min Hyuk,

896
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,909
and Ha Eun Byeol.

897
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:45,451
What?

898
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:48,700
Do you have proof that you were assaulted?

899
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:50,326
Obviously, there is no proof.

900
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:51,492
I'm sure she made it up

901
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:52,992
so she doesn't get expelled.

902
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:54,409
This is called

903
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,409
a false accusation.

904
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,534
Hey.

905
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,075
Do you know that this is

906
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,075
considered a serious crime?

907
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:01,576
My daughter

908
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:03,159
is here as the victim,

909
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:04,284
not as an assailant.

910
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,950
Shouldn't you listen to the victim first?

911
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:08,659
"Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin"

912
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:10,992
Ro Na, go on and tell them.

913
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:13,367
Earlier today, Seok Kyung filled a bucket

914
00:43:13,451 --> 00:43:14,492
with water and paint

915
00:43:15,117 --> 00:43:16,200
and poured it on me.

916
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:17,909
Then while I was washing up,

917
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:18,867
she intentionally

918
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,451
locked me and Je Ni in the lavatory.

919
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:22,742
Ro Na.

920
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,075
I suppose you want to become a novelist.

921
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:28,451
Both Eun Byeol and Min Hyuk watched on

922
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,367
but did nothing to stop them.

923
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:31,700
No one saw it,

924
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:32,825
and no one says they did it.

925
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:33,992
Why should we believe you?

926
00:43:34,576 --> 00:43:36,492
It's your word against theirs.

927
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:39,075
The kids are lying.

928
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:42,492
If the assailants deny it,

929
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,284
does it mean there's no victim?

930
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:45,409
Ms. Oh.

931
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:47,492
How could you blindly trust

932
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:48,634
your daughter's claim

933
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,800
and post such a serious lie

934
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:51,409
on the district school board's webpage?

935
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:53,159
Post a correction immediately

936
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:54,492
and apologise officially.

937
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:57,742
If not, you may face a criminal charge.

938
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:58,992
The school has no interest

939
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:01,700
in uncovering the truth anyway.

940
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:03,909
One more thing.

941
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,992
The disciplinary committee

942
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,075
has already decided to forcibly

943
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,409
transfer Ro Na for ruining

944
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:11,534
the school's public image

945
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,825
and trying to turn students

946
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:13,783
against each other.

947
00:44:15,075 --> 00:44:17,200
As all the faculty members have consented,

948
00:44:17,284 --> 00:44:19,492
we'll move forward with it expeditiously.

949
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,159
Okay.

950
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,492
If you'll keep on denying it like this,

951
00:44:23,742 --> 00:44:24,659
I have no choice.

952
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:26,825
I'll file a formal complaint

953
00:44:27,284 --> 00:44:29,242
with the Ministry of Education.

954
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,242
"Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin"

955
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,576
Are you mad?

956
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,950
You're not calling anyone!

957
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:38,284
Are you trying to keep our kids

958
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:39,200
from going to college?

959
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:40,783
Let go. - You should apologise!

960
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:41,992
How shameless! - Let go!

961
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:42,950
What are you doing?

962
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,075
Is this why you came back?

963
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:46,825
Honey, sue this woman! - Yes, do it!

964
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,909
Fine! Tell the Ministry of Education.

965
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:51,534
Then I'm going to tell all the reporters

966
00:44:51,618 --> 00:44:53,200
and file a public petition. - Hey, you!

967
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,326
Get off. - Mum.

968
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:55,742
Hey. - I said, let go.

969
00:44:55,825 --> 00:44:57,075
How dare you!

970
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,492
Mum, stop it!

971
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:02,451
Je Ni! I'm so glad you're here.

972
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,384
Tell them everything she did to you.

973
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:06,842
Make this brat stop lying.

974
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:08,200
She's not lying.

975
00:45:10,242 --> 00:45:11,159
What Ro Na said...

976
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,159
is all true.

977
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:16,700
What?

978
00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:20,492
What?

979
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,384
Are you saying Min Hyuk is a bully?

980
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:25,867
You'd better tell us the truth.

981
00:45:26,117 --> 00:45:28,867
Did Ro Na threaten you?

982
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:30,992
You conniving brat.

983
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:34,409
What did you do to my innocent daughter?

984
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:36,117
Stop, please!

985
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:40,367
I'm the one who was bullied!

986
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:43,353
They beat me up and cursed at me

987
00:45:43,378 --> 00:45:44,326
for a whole year!

988
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,530
I'm the one who was bullied.

989
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:53,242
I'm an outcast, just like Ro Na.

990
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:55,492
Mum, you don't know anything!

991
00:45:55,576 --> 00:45:56,992
So stop it already!

992
00:45:59,075 --> 00:45:59,992
"Outcast"?

993
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,576
What do you mean? Why?

994
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:04,742
Why did they bully you?

995
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,950
Gosh. - My goodness.

996
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:36,426
Hey, what happened here?

997
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:37,451
When did this start?

998
00:46:39,034 --> 00:46:39,992
When did it start?

999
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:44,950
Who was it?

1000
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,700
Who did this to you?

1001
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:53,659
Who was it?

1002
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:56,867
Who did this to my daughter?

1003
00:46:57,706 --> 00:46:58,747
Tell me!

1004
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:06,675
Here's Je Ni's diagnosis,

1005
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,618
which I picked up today.

1006
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:10,092
She's been suffering from

1007
00:47:10,426 --> 00:47:11,467
stress-induced hair loss

1008
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,009
and reflux esophagitis for a while.

1009
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:14,925
"Cheonga Parents' Meeting"

1010
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:34,300
Je Ni won't betray us, right?

1011
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:35,883
She definitely can't.

1012
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:37,551
If she wants to compete in the festival,

1013
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:39,300
she'll have to do as we say.

1014
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:41,259
But why bother making it to the finals?

1015
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:42,718
She won't win anyway.

1016
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:44,134
Wouldn't it be better

1017
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,509
to frame her as Ro Na's accomplice?

1018
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:47,634
She should know her place.

1019
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:48,984
Seoul University of Music? Please.

1020
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,050
Gosh, this is top secret.

1021
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,800
Je Ni's mum isn't an Ewha graduate.

1022
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:55,759
She lied.

1023
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:57,800
Are you serious?

1024
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,234
My mum's the alumni chair

1025
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:00,467
of Ewha's School of Communication.

1026
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:01,842
My mum looked into it,

1027
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:04,509
and Je Ni's mum wasn't on the list of

1028
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:06,317
Home Economics graduates.

1029
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,134
So she lied about her education?

1030
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:10,651
I knew it. I always wondered

1031
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,092
how she could be so ignorant.

1032
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:14,217
Even the way she speaks is so cheap.

1033
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,592
Isn't she an outcast in Hera Palace?

1034
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,426
That's why Je Ni and Ro Na are friends.

1035
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:19,509
Birds of a feather.

1036
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,900
Yes, birds of a feather.

1037
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:23,217
It's scientifically proven.

1038
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,634
Maybe all her designer bags are knockoffs.

1039
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:28,734
It must be exhausting to act rich

1040
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:29,718
when they're poor.

1041
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:47,718
Are you going to just let them bully you?

1042
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,259
Let go of me.

1043
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:51,509
I've informed the district school board

1044
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,676
that you were assaulted by school bullies.

1045
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:55,800
So just

1046
00:48:56,592 --> 00:48:57,551
tell the truth.

1047
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Why did you do that?

1048
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:01,384
Who gave you the right?

1049
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:02,800
I said I didn't want to.

1050
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:03,925
I said no!

1051
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,634
Your mum needs to know.

1052
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,092
If she finds out later,

1053
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:10,883
she'll be even more heartbroken.

1054
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:26,342
I recorded this myself today.

1055
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:41,509
What was that?

1056
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:49,467
Ro Na did nothing wrong.

1057
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:52,925
I lied.

1058
00:49:57,883 --> 00:49:58,842
My gosh...

1059
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:06,175
We'll post this

1060
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,634
on the district school board's website

1061
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:11,509
as evidence of school violence.

1062
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:21,759
Seok Kyung.

1063
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:24,359
What on earth were you thinking?

1064
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:26,109
A bully at Cheonga Arts High School?

1065
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:28,128
Do you know how serious this is?

1066
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:35,050
Sorry.

1067
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:37,134
I got too worked up.

1068
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:39,551
No.

1069
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:41,092
Seok Kyung is in the wrong here.

1070
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
I think Ro Na's family is determined.

1071
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:46,384
The school board already knows about it.

1072
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:47,842
The investigators will come tomorrow.

1073
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:49,800
If Je Ni's incident also gets out,

1074
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,259
things will get out of hand.

1075
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:52,718
I'm sorry.

1076
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,217
You'll have to fix this.

1077
00:50:55,718 --> 00:50:57,342
Apologise to her at once!

1078
00:50:57,676 --> 00:50:59,800
I only did as Eun Byeol told me.

1079
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:01,676
I may be the only one in the video,

1080
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,009
but she was right next to me.

1081
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:05,967
From throwing the paint

1082
00:51:05,992 --> 00:51:07,092
to locking her in the lavatory,

1083
00:51:07,117 --> 00:51:08,676
it was all Eun Byeol's idea.

1084
00:51:08,883 --> 00:51:10,050
I'm telling you the truth.

1085
00:51:10,217 --> 00:51:11,634
Putting the blame on Eun Byeol

1086
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:12,759
is too much, don't you think?

1087
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:14,134
I'm disappointed.

1088
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:16,192
I heard Eun Byeol tried to stop you,

1089
00:51:16,217 --> 00:51:17,718
but you went ahead and did it.

1090
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:20,259
Did Eun Byeol say that?

1091
00:51:20,592 --> 00:51:21,800
That she tried to stop me?

1092
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:23,800
That's what all the kids said.

1093
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:25,275
They also said

1094
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,676
you led the bullying of Je Ni.

1095
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
Eun Byeol brought all the foods

1096
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,800
that we fed Je Ni.

1097
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,467
Why are you only protecting her?

1098
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,467
Oh, does she get preferential treatment?

1099
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,009
You said we were family.

1100
00:51:38,384 --> 00:51:39,592
Was that a lie?

1101
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
That's enough!

1102
00:51:41,092 --> 00:51:42,150
You should repent!

1103
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:43,426
How dare you accuse her?

1104
00:51:44,676 --> 00:51:46,426
Dad, why won't you believe me?

1105
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:53,175
I can't believe she weaselled out alone.

1106
00:51:53,718 --> 00:51:54,676
Ha Eun Byeol...

1107
00:51:56,426 --> 00:51:58,050
You must be careful until

1108
00:51:58,134 --> 00:51:59,592
you get into Seoul National University!

1109
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:01,634
This is the most crucial time.

1110
00:52:01,842 --> 00:52:03,551
If bullying is in your student record,

1111
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,009
forget about early admission!

1112
00:52:06,134 --> 00:52:07,925
You need to get your act together.

1113
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,384
An assemblyman's son

1114
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:10,967
shouldn't be involved in such things.

1115
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:12,693
Stay out of it,

1116
00:52:12,718 --> 00:52:14,759
and just blame everything on Seok Kyung.

1117
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:16,384
Answer me!

1118
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,592
Gosh, I know how to handle it.

1119
00:52:21,092 --> 00:52:22,634
Who's here at this hour?

1120
00:52:26,134 --> 00:52:27,426
"Entrance, Unlock"

1121
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:29,800
Who is it? My gosh!

1122
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:31,300
Goodness.

1123
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:34,800
What's the matter?

1124
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:38,634
Ms. Kang, what are you doing?

1125
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:39,634
Shut it!

1126
00:52:39,842 --> 00:52:41,342
What's going on?

1127
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:42,718
Why are you taking away my son's phone?

1128
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,634
Start!

1129
00:52:43,718 --> 00:52:44,759
Start.

1130
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:46,800
Come on. Drink it.

1131
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:47,925
Drink up.

1132
00:52:48,217 --> 00:52:49,800
You look the prettiest

1133
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:50,842
when you're drinking cola.

1134
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,509
Drink faster. - My gosh.

1135
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:03,217
Ma Ri, you're scaring me.

1136
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,551
Get off me!

1137
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,967
Calm down, Ma Ri.

1138
00:53:10,342 --> 00:53:13,551
Think about our friendship.

1139
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:15,175
Calm down first.

1140
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:17,634
Kids fight all the time, you know?

1141
00:53:17,842 --> 00:53:19,342
It's no big deal.

1142
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:23,883
Shut it, you jerk.

1143
00:53:33,342 --> 00:53:34,259
What...

1144
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:36,426
Is she out of her mind?

1145
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:38,676
Darn it. I was about to

1146
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:39,842
capture the castle.

1147
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,718
This is not okay.

1148
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:47,967
That woman

1149
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,467
is out of line.

1150
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:53,009
Seok Kyung! Open the door!

1151
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:54,467
What is it, ma'am? - Let me in!

1152
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:55,634
What's the matter, ma'am?

1153
00:53:55,718 --> 00:53:56,842
Calm down. - Out of my way!

1154
00:53:56,925 --> 00:53:57,967
Ma'am. - Where's Seok Kyung?

1155
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,009
Calm down. - What's the matter?

1156
00:53:59,092 --> 00:54:00,050
Get off me!

1157
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:01,467
My gosh. - Seok Kyung!

1158
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:03,842
Ma'am. - Seok Kyung, where are you?

1159
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:05,134
Ma'am. - Ma'am.

1160
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,509
I said, get off me!

1161
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,259
What is going on?

1162
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:09,883
It's still very early.

1163
00:54:12,426 --> 00:54:13,467
How can you be sleeping?

1164
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:15,092
Apologise to Je Ni at once.

1165
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:16,842
Why should I?

1166
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:19,134
I didn't do anything wrong.

1167
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,025
She's the one who betrayed me

1168
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,592
and sided with Ro Na.

1169
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:24,175
That traitor...

1170
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:25,426
Shut it, Seok Kyung!

1171
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:29,676
Have you lost your mind?

1172
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,300
How dare you hit me?

1173
00:54:32,384 --> 00:54:33,384
Who do you think you are?

1174
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:34,342
Does that hurt?

1175
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:35,800
You'd better get your act together!

1176
00:54:36,092 --> 00:54:37,384
My patience is wearing thin.

1177
00:54:37,967 --> 00:54:39,509
I'll blow up the whole penthouse

1178
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,718
if you don't

1179
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,134
at least act like you're sorry!

1180
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:43,800
What is going on here?

1181
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:54,217
You need to discipline your daughter.

1182
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:58,050
Are you lecturing me right now?

1183
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:00,109
Are you in the position to do that?

1184
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:02,175
I won't let this go unpunished.

1185
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:03,676
I'll make sure your daughter

1186
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,467
is disqualified from the festival

1187
00:55:05,883 --> 00:55:07,009
and gets reprimanded,

1188
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:08,942
whether she's expelled or transferred.

1189
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:10,426
You want the daughter

1190
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:11,967
of the Head of Operation transferred?

1191
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:14,175
I don't think that's possible.

1192
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:19,800
Our contract

1193
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:21,718
ended today.

1194
00:55:22,592 --> 00:55:23,800
We're even now,

1195
00:55:24,342 --> 00:55:26,718
and I don't owe you anything anymore.

1196
00:55:27,842 --> 00:55:29,842
You gave me an apartment

1197
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:32,009
to cover up what you did to my husband.

1198
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:33,883
Shall I expose what you did?

1199
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,050
It's not a good idea to bring that up,

1200
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:37,442
Ms. Kang Ma Ri.

1201
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,300
He agreed to go to jail instead of you

1202
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,800
for Je Ni's sake.

1203
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:45,842
To make sure she can have a good life.

1204
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,800
But your daughter

1205
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:49,259
ripped her heart to pieces.

1206
00:55:50,217 --> 00:55:51,800
Nothing can stop me now.

1207
00:55:52,676 --> 00:55:53,967
I don't even know what I'll do.

1208
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:56,217
Brace yourself.

1209
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,092
I may...

1210
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:01,509
just kill your daughter.

1211
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:03,634
You have some nerve.

1212
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:14,925
What?

1213
00:56:15,883 --> 00:56:17,217
Do you think I got what I deserved?

1214
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,676
I bet you're thinking this is only fair.

1215
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:23,800
You must be getting a kick out of this.

1216
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:26,009
Yes.

1217
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,967
I'm wondering if you finally

1218
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,883
understand me.

1219
00:56:30,883 --> 00:56:31,842
What?

1220
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:34,217
When your child is bullied,

1221
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:36,676
you get so upset and angry

1222
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:39,092
that your body shakes

1223
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:41,092
and your blood boils.

1224
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:43,426
You can't sleep

1225
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:45,967
or eat.

1226
00:56:46,509 --> 00:56:47,551
You just want

1227
00:56:48,134 --> 00:56:50,134
to destroy everyone.

1228
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,551
Those who haven't experienced it

1229
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,759
will never understand.

1230
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,300
I had no idea either.

1231
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:01,467
I'm being punished, aren't I?

1232
00:57:03,175 --> 00:57:04,467
The Anti-bullying Committee

1233
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:05,842
summoned Ro Na because of me.

1234
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:09,384
I hit, insulted,

1235
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,175
and bullied that innocent girl.

1236
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:17,509
I'm being punished for all of it now.

1237
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,676
I taught my daughter wrong.

1238
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:29,009
This is all my fault, Yoon Hee...

1239
00:57:43,384 --> 00:57:45,092
Save your energy, Ma Ri.

1240
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:47,842
For now,

1241
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:50,217
focus on staying strong

1242
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,883
and protecting Je Ni.

1243
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:55,067
Let me know

1244
00:57:55,092 --> 00:57:56,217
if I can help you with anything.

1245
00:57:58,883 --> 00:58:01,092
If you fall apart, it's over.

1246
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:03,634
You're the only one

1247
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:05,592
Je Ni can rely on, you know.

1248
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,800
I'm sorry.

1249
00:58:14,842 --> 00:58:17,009
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

1250
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:19,050
I'm so sorry.

1251

"Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin"

1252

Je Ni's mother is asking

1253
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:44,925
the Anti-bullying Committee to step in.

1254
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:46,984
When the school board investigators come

1255
00:58:47,009 --> 00:58:48,775
and discover Ro Na and Je Ni's incidents,

1256
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,467
things will get quite complicated.

1257
00:58:59,718 --> 00:59:01,134
To protect the school,

1258
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:03,800
someone will have to take the fall.

1259
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:06,551
Put up

1260
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:08,342
a notice.

I bet this is your mum's doing.

1273

Ha Eun Byeol...

1274
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,592

01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:37,759
Why didn't you reply to me?

1278
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,009
I sent you an email.

1279
01:00:41,426 --> 01:00:42,342
I've been busy.

1280
01:00:44,676 --> 01:00:45,967
I know you're going through a lot,

1281
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,092
but you don't have to be

1282
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:49,050
awkward around me.

1283
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,634
I wondered how you were doing.

1284
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,300
When I was in the US

1285
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:56,175
and even after I came back.

1286
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:04,509
What about you?

1287
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:09,759
Did you

1288
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,426
not think about me?

1289
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:27,925
What are you doing over there?

1290
01:01:29,842 --> 01:01:31,342
Nothing.

1291
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:40,009
Hey, Ha Eun Byeol!

1292
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:49,718
What was the pattern?

1293
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,426
Was it "J"?

1294
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:56,592
Nice.

1295
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:00,342
I'm the only one being reprimanded?

1296
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,800
Not a chance.

1297
01:02:02,842 --> 01:02:03,842
Eun Byeol,

1298
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,384
I'll tell everyone who your boyfriend is.

1299
01:02:14,883 --> 01:02:17,134
Let go! - Please...

1300
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:19,134
Dad! - No! Let go!

1301
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:26,603
What's this?

1302
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:32,859
Seok Kyung!

1303
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,400
You took my phone, didn't you?

1304
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:41,651
Why did you steal my phone?

1305
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:45,859
I didn't steal it.

1306
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:47,526
You dropped it,

1307
01:02:47,776 --> 01:02:48,942
so I was going to return it to you.

1308
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,442
Did you go through my phone?

1309
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:56,317
I don't know your lock pattern.

1310
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,759
Why?

1311
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,050
Do you have a big secret?

1312
01:03:13,718 --> 01:03:14,592
There's no way

1313
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:16,634
she saw it, right?

1314
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:30,426
Why are you here?

1315
01:03:34,634 --> 01:03:36,175
You said I was your daughter too.

1316
01:03:38,676 --> 01:03:40,676
Can't I visit my mum to hang out?

1317
01:03:41,259 --> 01:03:42,175
I'm busy.

1318
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:44,634
Just say what you need and leave.

1319
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,800
I have many reports to go through.

1320
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,426
Cheonga Arts Festival is in a few days.

1321
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,134
I've waited so long for it.

1322
01:03:56,842 --> 01:03:58,718
What kind of dress should I wear?

1323
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:01,426
I'm really excited.

1324
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:04,967
The notice should be up by now.

1325
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,317
At the meeting today, the teachers

1326
01:04:08,342 --> 01:04:10,175
decided to disqualify you from entering.

1327
01:04:10,842 --> 01:04:12,842
You got yourself in big trouble,

1328
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:14,134
so I had no choice.

1329
01:04:20,718 --> 01:04:22,134
Please don't crack such jokes.

1330
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,883
My dad asked you, remember?

1331
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:26,259
Just let me enter.

1332
01:04:26,676 --> 01:04:28,592
You have the power as the chief director.

1333
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:36,551
Oh, did I surprise you?

1334
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:39,426
I was imitating Eun Byeol.

1335
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,842
I don't need to respond any more, right?

1336
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:46,426
Well, since you're being nice,

1337
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:48,426
why don't you

1338
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,342
just give me the grand prize?

1339
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:53,718
What?

1340
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,050
If you truly love my dad,

1341
01:04:55,676 --> 01:04:57,634
you can do that for me, right?

1342
01:04:57,718 --> 01:04:58,676
Are you kidding me?

1343
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:00,676
You have no skills.

1344
01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:02,150
How can you ask for the grand prize?

1345
01:05:02,175 --> 01:05:03,883
You know

1346
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:07,384
I can't beat Eun Byeol with my skills.

1347
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:09,984
That's why I'm being shameless

1348
01:05:10,009 --> 01:05:11,509
and asking you for this favour.

1349
01:05:11,592 --> 01:05:12,967
Must I call your dad

1350
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,300
to make you shut your mouth?

1351
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:16,592
Get out.

1352
01:05:17,426 --> 01:05:18,426
Now.

1353
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:24,134
You'll regret kicking me out like this.

1354
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:28,718
I know a big secret,

1355
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:30,509
lady.

1356
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:33,592
What?

1357
01:05:37,342 --> 01:05:39,925
When Mr. Cheon Myung Soo passed away,

1358
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:42,175
you were on the staircase with him.

1359
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,676
Why did you run away?

1360
01:05:49,509 --> 01:05:50,759
Instead of saving your dad?

1361
01:05:57,175 --> 01:05:58,426
What did you just say?

1362
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:02,217
You seem shocked.

1363
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,300
All right, then.

1364
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:06,718
Shall we restart our discussion?

1365
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,092
=Penthouse 2=

1366
01:06:41,175 --> 01:06:43,134
I heard you're stepping down. Is it true?

1367
01:06:43,217 --> 01:06:44,592
Even if you hate me,

1368
01:06:44,676 --> 01:06:47,134
how could you attack me with Yoon Hee?

1369
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,259
Looks like you have many enemies, Seo Jin.

1370
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:50,551
Beat Ro Na no matter what,

1371
01:06:50,676 --> 01:06:51,676
even if you must kill her.

1372
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:52,676
No matter what anyone says,

1373
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:53,883
you're my only daughter, Eun Byeol.

1374
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:54,883
Then prove

1375
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:56,342
that I'm your only daughter.

1376
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:58,967
The grand prize, which is given to

1377
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:00,426
the singer with the most divine voice...

1378
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:01,883
Did you want the grand prize that badly?

1379
01:07:02,009 --> 01:07:03,634
Ready to give me the grand prize?

1380
01:07:03,718 --> 01:07:04,592
Joo Seok Kyung...

1381
01:07:04,676 --> 01:07:06,718
I won't let anyone take Cheonga from me.
