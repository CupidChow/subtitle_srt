6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
I've done something to you

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,342
which cannot be undone.

8
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,176
No matter what I do or what I say,

9
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,134
I will never be forgiven.

10
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:36,218
I really missed you.

11
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,842
I liked you a lot.

12
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:41,425
And that's why I resented you more

13
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,176
and I was so sorry.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,592
I will get punished for it.

15
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,467
I will make

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,176
the last atonement for my sin.

17
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,342
Yes. This is Gangnam Police Station.

18
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,884
Gosh! - Let go of me.

19
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,717
Let go! - Say it!

20
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:19,092
Can you let go of this?

21
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:20,300
Let go!

22
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:21,509
Gosh. - I mean...

23
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:22,592
It wasn't me.

24
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:23,509
We will see.

25
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:25,425
Please listen to me.

26
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:29,926
Excuse me.

27
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:31,592
Yes? How can I help you?

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,009
I've come in to turn myself in.

29
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:43,009
I...

30
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:47,218
killed someone.

31
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:50,425
Tower.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,967
Ares.

Sunrise.

34
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,259
Ze... Zepal.

35
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:02,009
Zeus Palace.

36
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,425
What do you think?

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,176
For the name of the new apartment complex.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,967
I love it.

39
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,467
It sounds really luxurious and expensive.

40
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,634
I'm the head

41
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,176
of the Hera Palace residents now.

42
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,967
Should we buy the penthouse?

43
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,051
No way.

44
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:18,383
Why would we move into the place

45
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,467
where people keep dying?

46
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:21,259
In just a few years, we're going to

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,259
move to Cheonsu District.

48
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,759
You still have to look cooler and sharper

49
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,092
than the former head of the residents.

50
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:30,300
My gosh. How can you compare me

51
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,509
to that idiot Joo Dan Tae?

52
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,842
Gosh. I wouldn't trade you

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,926
for a truck load of him.

54
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,342
Since we are here, you should buy suits

55
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,509
made with the best Italian fabric.

56
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:44,675
In every colour.

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,800
How about two to three pairs?

58
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:51,009
You have a cute face,

59
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:53,134
so bright colours suit you well.

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,342
If I were to describe my face,

61
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,300
I would say I have a rather handsome face.

62
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:00,218
Let's just buy everything.

63
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,759
We've got too much money.

64
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:05,009
Those colours aren't for you, Mr. Lee.

65
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,134
You are an assemblyman.

66
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,009
Go with a sophisticated and elegant one.

67
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,218
You know,

68
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,509
you have a petty man's face.

69
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,717
Ma Ri!

70
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,550
Kyu Jin looks glamorous

71
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,717
whatever he wears.

72
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,509
By the way, I am really curious.

73
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:30,300
Are you my stalker?

74
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,634
Are you my stalker fan or what?

75
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,176
Why would you follow me

76
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,218
on my shopping day?

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,176
Come on. Don't be so mean.

78
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,425
Didn't we get on the same boat

79
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,634
when we invested in Cheonsu District?

80
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,300
We are the noblesse of a different class.

81
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,842
You need a best friend.

82
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,342
I came to buy a suit too.

83
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,675
A man's suit?

84
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:52,051
Oh, you don't know.

85
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,759
My husband is coming back to Korea soon.

86
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,176
Mr. Yoo is coming back?

87
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:00,383
Has it already been five years?

88
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,842
Did he close his business in Dubai?

89
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,800
I am going to be handling big money soon.

90
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,342
Why would I make him suffer alone

91
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,218
in that far away foreign country?

92
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:13,634
I will tell you my husband's sizes.

93
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:14,967
Use the best quality fabrics...

94
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,800
No, the most expensive fabrics you've got

95
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,717
and make 10 pairs.

96
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,134
10 pairs, ma'am?

97
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:21,425
Go on.

98
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,342
This way, ma'am.

99
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,009
Hey. Guys.

100
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,051
Hey! Hey.

101
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,425
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!

102
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:36,092
Mr. Lee!

103
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,342
Why would you not answer your phone?

104
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,425
What is it?

105
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,383
Did Chairman Joo call?

106
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:42,300
Is he giving me 30 billion won?

107
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,717
That's not it. Cheonsu District...

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,592
What?

109
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:46,884
What about Cheonsu District?

110
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:48,759
Cheonsu District has all gone

111
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,300
haywire.

112
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:55,675
The land price went up again?

113
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,759
It must've skyrocketed! - Breaking news.

114
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,300
Cheonsu District that - The price went up!

115
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,634
had become the issue as

116
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,592
the country's biggest new town project

117
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:04,300
got embroiled in the collusion controversy

118
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:05,218
of the political and financial world.

119
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Jung Doo Man of Happy Future Party

120
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:08,717
voluntarily retired from his position and

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,509
voluntarily appeared at the Prosecution.

122
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:12,383
He's accused of colluding with

123
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:13,675
Joo Dan Tae, chairman of Cheonga Group,

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,800
who is being investigated

125
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:15,967
for murdering his ex-wife,

126
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:17,425
changing the development area

127
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,009
and encouraging speculation

128
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,634
in Cheonsu District.

129
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,467
People are also paying attention

130
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,800
to the cause of death of his ex-wife Na,

131
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:24,926
who Chairman Joo entrusted

132
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,051
with the investment and development.

133
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,550
According to Ministry of Land,

134
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,967
Cheonsu District was supposed to be

135
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,051
announced as a landfill, but

136
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,884
it was suddenly turned into - Mr. Hwang.

137
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,092
a new town development area. - Open it!

138
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,675
Mr. Hwang!

139
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,675
A landfill?

140
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,967
Did you scam us?

141
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,218
Open the door right now! You jerk!

142
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,800
Mr. Hwang! Please sell mine first.

143
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,884
I can't get married without that money.

144
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,051
Mr. Hwang!

145
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,884
Open the door when I'm talking nicely.

146
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:57,009
Do you want to see me die?

147
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:58,967
You idiot! How can you buy all the lands

148
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,051
without doing a thorough research?

149
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:02,675
I even sold

150
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,509
my Gangnam building for it!

151
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:06,675
Why would you sell that?

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
Besides, how is this my fault?

153
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,176
You were more excited than me.

154
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,134
Kyu Jin,

155
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,092
if your father divorces me,

156
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,342
please look after me.

157
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:16,509
Okay.

158
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,176
Open the door!

159
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,259
Mother.

160
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,634
Just tell me to die.

161
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:23,675
That scares me more than

162
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,383
the family going bust.

163
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,759
What are you talking about?

164
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,634
Open the door, Mr. Hwang! - Oh, gosh.

165
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:31,884
I need to hide.

166
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:32,800
How do you feel right now?

167
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,218
Why would you ask me that?

168
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:37,467
Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin is right here!

169
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,342
Mr. Lee.

170
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:39,717
Tell us something. - Tell us something.

171
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,926
Do you admit to the speculation charge?

172
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,134
Mr. Lee, tell us.

173
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,009
Tell us.

174
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:44,009
Honey!

175
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:44,884
Tell us.

176
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:45,967
Mr. Lee. - Wait.

177
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:47,134
Oh, gosh.

178
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:48,425
Tell us how you feel. - No!

179
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,218
Mr. Lee. - I've only come here

180
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,383
Any comment? - to look at a farming land.

181
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,800
Hey! Move over! - Oh, no!

182
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,051
This is defamation!

183
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:55,300
Move, you idiots!

184
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:56,967
Can't an assemblyman buy land?

185
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,009
Mr. Lee. - Let go!

186
00:06:58,092 --> 00:06:59,176
Mr. Lee! - Move.

187
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,259
Tell us. - Mr. Lee!

188
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,342
Mr. Lee.

189
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:02,300
Move!

190
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:03,176
Move! - Mr. Lee!

191
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,425
Where are you going?

192
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,592
Kyu Jin!

193
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,051
Any comment? - No.

194
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,842
I'm not in the car! - How're you feeling?

195
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:09,967
Lee Kyu Jin!

196
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:11,592
Meanwhile, Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin

197
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,467
of Happy Future Party has been confirmed

198
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,509
to have invested in Cheonsu District too.

199
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,134
Mr. Lee used the names of his parents, son,

200
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,675
and even cousin to buy

201
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,467
30 billion won worth of lands,

202
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,884
and it's shocking everyone.

203
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:22,926
Hello?

204
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,009
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,634
Cheonsu District...

206
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:26,967
Hello?

207
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:29,176
What's wrong with my phone?

208
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:30,425
"Detective"

209
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,300
What?

210
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,425
Lee Kyu Jin, Ko Sang A, Kang Ma Ri.

211
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,550
Come with us to the police station.

212
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,967
My gosh, we are done for. - Mum.

213
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:44,425
That soon?

214
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:45,717
Look.

215
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,759
Don't you know that an assemblyman

216
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,842
has the privilege not to be arrested?

217
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,425
We are the victims of this scandal.

218
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,259
This is about Min Seol A's death.

219
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,218
What did you just say?

220
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,009
Min Seol A?

221
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,467
That was settled a long time ago.

222
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:03,800
Sim Soo Ryeon already

223
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,342
made us suffer enough--

224
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:06,759
The murderer turned herself in yesterday,

225
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,300
and the investigation got relaunched.

226
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,051
The murderer turned herself in?

227
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:11,717
Who is that?

228
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,051
What? Wait.

229
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:17,383
No. - What's going on?

230
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:18,926
Wait. - No.

231
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:20,300
"Gangnam Police Station"

232
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,425
I only did what I had to do.

233
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,800
I came with someone

234
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:28,717
who wants to meet you.

235
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:31,134
Do you want to

236
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,051
see her?

237
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:14,717
Ro Na.

238
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,176
It's my Ro Na, isn't it?

239
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:23,467
Ro Na.

240
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,383
I think the police didn't tell you

241
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,634
because it might affect the testimony.

242
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:33,467
Ro Na is alive.

243
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,342
What happened?

244
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:40,884
Soo Ryeon

245
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:42,967
saved Ro Na.

246
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,759
She's been keeping an eye on her

247
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:49,759
because the suspect might harm her again.

248
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:52,717
If she didn't buy off the doctor,

249
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,884
something terrible would've happened.

250
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:01,134
Ro Na had to live

251
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,383
to prove that Joo Dan Tae is the suspect.

252
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:04,967
So she disguised her as a dead person

253
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,675
and got to move her to another hospital.

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,092
"Funeral Home"

255
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,592
"Bae Ro Na, Murdered"

256
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,134
Ro Na.

257
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,425
It's not coming back.

258
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,092
I think it's too late.

259
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,300
No. You can't give up.

260
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:39,884
You have to save her.

261
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,176
Move.

262
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,009
Please come back, Ro Na.

263
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,134
Please open your eyes.

264
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,383
You can't die for your mother.

265
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,550
She's breathing again.

266
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,634
My goodness.

267
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,009
Ro Na.

268
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,800
Ro Na.

269
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,134
Can you recognise me?

270
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,051
Ms. Sim.

271
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:14,467
Well done, Ro Na.

272
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,176
You did really well.

273
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,300
Soo Ryeon risked her life

274
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,300
and saved Ro Na.

275
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
"Police"

276
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,717
"We promise the citizen's safety"

277
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,092
Ro Na is waiting.

278
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,051
She's got a lot better too.

279
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:49,300
I will go bring Ro Na.

280
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:51,259
No.

281
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,342
She's alive, and that's enough for me.

282
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,134
I will meet her later

283
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,800
when I can face her honourably.

284
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,800
I will meet her then.

285
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,967
Just seeing her

286
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,300
being alive is...

287
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:11,634
I'm so grateful.

288
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,675
I am so very grateful.

289
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,092
"Police"

290
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:33,509
If you look at it

291
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:34,759
with political prejudice,

292
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,176
you might think speculation is bad.

293
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:37,009
But if you look at it with the eyes

294
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:37,926
of a citizen with joint responsibility,

295
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:38,884
then it doesn't become the speculation.

296
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,717
Besides, I became the assemblyman

297
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,926
to bring justice to the society.

298
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,717
How can I abandon a corpse? No way.

299
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:44,800
Mr. Lee.

300
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,300
Do you know me?

301
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,176
Why do you keep talking rudely to me?

302
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:50,550
Kyu Jin did?

303
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,259
Did I talk rudely to him just now?

304
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,383
Gosh, you are mistaken.

305
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,759
Detective, think about it.

306
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,967
How can people like us who have

307
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,634
high social status, wealth, and fame

308
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,717
move the corpse of a poor orphan

309
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,176
who's got nothing

310
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,383
and destroy the evidence?

311
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,884
That's a crime, right?

312
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:17,509
We are the most righteous people.

313
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,300
Righteous? That's funny.

314
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,759
By the way, until when will you keep

315
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:24,134
talking about that darn girl Min Seol A?

316
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,342
Who was it this time?

317
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,592
Who keeps writing this ridiculous script

318
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:29,300
and getting us involved?

319
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,134
Who is it? Tell me who this is!

320
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,842
I said don't talk rudely to me, jerk!

321
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:38,842
Ma Ri.

322
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,342
Who said that?

323
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,051
Who said I cleaned the fountain that day?

324
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,800
I scrub people's bodies,

325
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,717
but I never clean, you know.

326
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:52,259
That day, there was an emergency

327
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,842
watertight procedure at Hera Palace.

328
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:56,300
Other residents already confessed.

329
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:59,675
Didn't you move Min Seol A's body then?

330
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,509
I... I have no idea

331
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,550
what you're talking about.

332
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,926
There's a witness.

333
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,800
A witness who saw you people.

334
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:11,092
So who is that?

335
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:13,176
It's been over two years.

336
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,842
Which lunatic is claiming to have seen us?

337
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,134
Let me see that person's face.

338
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,425
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

339
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,592
Ms. Oh testified

340
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,467
that she saw you people that day.

341
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,009
Oh Yoon Hee said that?

342
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,675
That crazy woman.

343
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,467
So she really wants to be my enemy?

344
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,051
Ma Ri.

345
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:37,634
Why do you keep calling me?

346
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,342
Was it you?

347
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:50,800
You accused us?

348
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:56,884
That day,

349
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,218
I saw it clearly with my two eyes.

350
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,592
What you were planning at the fountain.

351
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,009
You know.

352
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,092
I was at Hera Palace that day.

353
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,842
You said you were too drunk

354
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,176
to remember anything.

355
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:14,509
No.

356
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,717
I remembered everything.

357
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:18,592
Everything that happened that day.

358
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:20,467
Clearly.

359
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,717
Now you are going to make up things

360
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:28,800
to make me a criminal?

361
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:31,634
What did you see anyway?

362
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:33,842
Min Seol A killed herself.

363
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,509
She got abandoned by her mother,

364
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,176
got pessimistic, and took her own life.

365
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:38,218
Min Seol A

366
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,425
didn't kill herself.

367
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:48,967
I killed her.

368
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,051
The suspect who made Seol A die

369
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:57,926
at Hera Palace

370
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,051
is me.

371
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,092
What did you just say?

372
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,717
You killed Min Seol A?

373
00:17:11,383 --> 00:17:12,300
Is that true?

374
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,051
Does Sim Soo Ryeon know about this?

375
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:21,800
She knows.

376
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:45,009
Sorry to bother you while you're eating.

377
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,342
How did you feel

378
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:49,800
to kill Na Ae Gyo with your own hands?

379
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:52,259
Sim Soo Ryeon!

380
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:54,634
Are you...

381
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,259
really Sim Soo Ryeon?

382
00:17:58,218 --> 00:17:59,009
You are?

383
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,759
You must've wanted me to live forever

384
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,592
without knowing about Na Ae Gyo.

385
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:07,759
But too bad.

386
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,509
I found out about her two year ago.

387
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
That's when I realised

388
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,800
why you forced me to wear only the clothes

389
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:17,675
you bought for me.

390
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,926
You wanted to disguise Na Ae Gyo,

391
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:23,134
who was wearing the same clothes as me

392
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,009
as your wife and make her lobby.

393
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:26,300
Anyway, I was

394
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,759
too busy looking after Hye In

395
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,842
that I didn't do much outside.

396
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:33,259
So you didn't have to worry about

397
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,218
anyone finding out.

398
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:36,967
You got to use the name of

399
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,759
Simwoon Construction owner's daughter

400
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:40,884
and cajole the people

401
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,675
in the political and financial world.

402
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,383
How

403
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,092
could I have not recognised you?

404
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,717
How could you have fooled me so perfectly?

405
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,218
Fortunately,

406
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,675
there was a lot of information

407
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,800
about Na Ae Gyo in Thailand.

408
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,009
For two years,

409
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,675
I lived like Na Ae Gyo,

410
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,051
even more like her than herself.

411
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,467
To come back,

412
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,926
I fought with my life.

413
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,509
Only then I could kill you.

414
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,800
How dare you fool me?

415
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,009
It gives me chills that every misfortune

416
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,300
I went through started with you.

417
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:21,425
You murdered Seol A's father,

418
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:22,634
cornered Seol A into a deadly situation.

419
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:23,759
You even killed Na Ae Gyo.

420
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:25,592
On top of that, you also killed

421
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:26,675
the innocent Ro Na.

422
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,092
Every day, I imagined

423
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,717
the most brutal death for you.

424
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,092
How can a man like you

425
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,550
still be alive?

426
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,550
It makes me despise the divinity.

427
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:41,425
Then shut your mouth

428
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,800
and just blame it on the divinity.

429
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:49,800
You know what?

430
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,884
Na Ae Gyo betrayed you a long time ago.

431
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:55,717
That woman

432
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:58,134
was in love with Jung Doo Man.

433
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:00,675
That's why she was trying to leave you.

434
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:04,509
You're talking nonsense.

435
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,926
What do you know about Na Ae Gyo?

436
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,759
Who are you to say such nonsense?

437
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,675
To Na Ae Gyo,

438
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,425
I was the only man in her life.

439
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,342
She was willing to do anything for me.

440
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:17,342
So why did you

441
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,383
kill a woman like that?

442
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:21,218
Joo Dan Tae.

443
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:31,967
Mr. Jung.

444
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,342
What happened?

445
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,342
What did you tell the police?

446
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,884
Do you have any idea

447
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,884
what the police are doing to me?

448
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:42,051
Get me out of here right now.

449
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:44,717
Why

450
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,259
should I do that?

451
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,550
If you act like that,

452
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,759
this isn't going to be good for you.

453
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,717
Are you not going to run for presidency?

454
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,509
Is it all right if I

455
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,509
expose your relationship

456
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:05,967
to Na Ae Gyo?

457
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,425
Na Ae Gyo and I

458
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,717
didn't have a dirty relationship

459
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,926
like you imagine.

460
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,425
How would a vulgar man like you know that?

461
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:25,259
You've never been loved

462
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,467
in your entire life.

463
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:29,884
You're like a vermin.

464
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,425
Are you implying

465
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,218
that you had a real relationship

466
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,800
with my woman, you jerk?

467
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,342
After all you've done,

468
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,218
you still eat and spare yourself to live.

469
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:57,717
How pathetic you look when you shiver.

470
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,300
The only person

471
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:11,134
who pitied someone like you

472
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:13,383
was

473
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,634
Na Ae Gyo.

474
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,218
Killing a woman like that

475
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:23,300
must be

476
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,383
the biggest curse

477
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,550
of your life.

478
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,467
Now there's nothing you can do.

479
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:40,550
All that money you had.

480
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:42,926
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

481
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:45,425
Even the penthouse.

482
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,134
They are all mine now.

483
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,550
Until your last day, I hope you will

484
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,134
miserably die away in jail,

485
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,176
Joo Dan Tae.

486
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,675
Until your misery is perfected,

487
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:03,051
I plan to do everything in my power.

488
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,009
That's how I will show

489
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,842
my royalty to Na Ae Gyo.

490
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:14,009
Be ready,

491
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,134
Joo Dan Tae.

492
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:34,926
Jung Doo Man!

493
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,509
Sim Soo Ryeon!

494
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:45,550
Mr. Baek.

495
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,134
Which son of a gun is it now?

496
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,550
So Na Ae Gyo was right.

497
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,592
She said your real name was different.

498
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,092
Was it Mr. Baek?

499
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:00,425
Come here.

500
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,176
Come here, you jerk!

501
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,176
Say it to my face!

502
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:06,967
But I don't have time to do that.

503
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,509
I am leaving for America today.

504
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:11,259
My parents are

505
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:12,467
getting investigated in America too.

506
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,009
So don't hope for something ridiculous.

507
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,092
They won't be making

508
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,425
any more deals with you.

509
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,759
I am going to expose

510
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,509
your lowest point.

511
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,051
I will show you

512
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,759
that this isn't the end, Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

513
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,550
No. No.

514
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:35,176
Mr. Baek.

515
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:47,218
"Detective"

516
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:07,842
Doesn't it hurt?

517
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:09,300
"25 years ago"

518
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,383
It's bearable.

519
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,051
For you to not confuse me

520
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:13,967
with Sim Soo Ryeon,

521
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,759
I need to put a mark.

522
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:17,967
Why would I confuse you?

523
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:19,842
I can find you even with my eyes closed.

524
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:20,800
You're my woman.

525
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:22,926
Why a butterfly though?

526
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:24,300
Why not just a dot?

527
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:26,009
I want to be born again

528
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:28,425
into a beautiful butterfly.

529
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,509
How does it look?

530
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:34,300
It's pretty, isn't it?

531
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:36,926
It's pretty.

532
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,134
I will make sure

533
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,550
you live like Sim Soo Ryeon.

534
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:47,092
I will make you

535
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,051
the happiest woman in the world.

536
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:50,842
Can you wait until then?

537
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,342
How much longer do I have to wait, honey?

538
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,300
It won't take long.

539
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:57,842
If I use the name Sim Soo Ryeon well,

540
00:25:58,342 --> 00:25:59,383
I will be able to make enough money

541
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,259
to get buried in money.

542
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,259
We will buy a house in Gangnam

543
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
and build a building there.

544
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,342
I will form Joo Dan Tae Village

545
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,509
on the soil my mother died.

546
00:26:09,842 --> 00:26:11,300
I will make all the people in the world

547
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:12,884
kneel down before me.

548
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,176
My goodness.

549
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:17,300
Are we going to have children too?

550
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,592
Of course we will.

551
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:20,926
We will have a son and a daughter.

552
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,383
Our children will live in

553
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:25,009
the most expensive and

554
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:27,134
the highest place in the country.

555
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,176
A place nearest to heaven.

556
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:30,884
In a penthouse.

557
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,800
Just the thought of it makes me so happy.

558
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:52,176
Na Ae Gyo

559
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:54,759
really died?

560
00:26:58,717 --> 00:26:59,425
With my hands,

561
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:02,509
I...

562
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:04,842
I killed Na Ae Gyo?

563
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:47,759
Mum would never be like that.

564
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,509
How can she not want to see me?

565
00:27:50,592 --> 00:27:51,509
She's my mum.

566
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,425
I am going to ask her myself.

567
00:28:15,717 --> 00:28:16,550
Ha Eun Byeol.

568
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,218
Why?

569
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:26,675
Did you see a ghost?

570
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,926
What happened?

571
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,675
Why are you here?

572
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:35,926
You must've hoped I would be dead.

573
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,051
I am sorry that I'm alive.

574
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,550
Why did you do that, Ha Eun Byeol?

575
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:41,967
Why did you try to kill me?

576
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,383
Did you hate me that much?

577
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:44,425
No.

578
00:28:45,176 --> 00:28:46,467
No. I didn't do anything.

579
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,300
It wasn't me!

580
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,300
I didn't think you would admit to it.

581
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,592
I pity your father.

582
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:55,176
I can't believe he took the blame

583
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:56,634
to protect a girl like you.

584
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,383
But that wouldn't make you innocent.

585
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:01,842
You will be punished too, Ha Eun Byeol.

586
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:03,759
Get away!

587
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:08,425
You're dead.

588
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,342
There's no place for you to come back to.

589
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,800
Get away from my sight!

590
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,550
Are you okay?

591
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:25,342
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

592
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,383
Let's go back to the hospital.

593
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:41,675
Ha Eun Byeol.

594
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,051
Where did you go without telling me?

595
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:46,884
I told you not to go anywhere.

596
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:47,967
I told you that it's dangerous outside!

597
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:48,967
Ms. Jin.

598
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:52,259
I don't want to be here.

599
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:53,842
It's scary.

600
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:55,550
It scares me to death.

601
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,218
Please take me somewhere. Anywhere.

602
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:00,884
I don't care where it is.

603
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,259
Somewhere far.

604
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,926
Take me to a place where nobody can

605
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,218
find me. Please.

606
00:30:05,675 --> 00:30:07,675
Ms. Jin. I beg you.

607
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,967
You really don't care where we go?

608
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:15,842
No.

609
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:17,675
As long as Bae Ro Na isn't there.

610
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:22,800
You poor child.

611
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,134
Let's leave all of these behind

612
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,009
and leave.

613
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,634
Call me Mum now.

614
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:34,051
Call me Mum.

615
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,467
Long time no see, Sim Soo Ryeon.

616
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:57,509
Finally we meet.

617
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,383
Can you leave us alone for a moment?

618
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,134
Will you be all right?

619
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:11,509
It suits you very well.

620
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,009
Shut up.

621
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,383
What have I done wrong to you?

622
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,259
It was your darling friend Oh Yoon Hee

623
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,675
who killed Min Seol A.

624
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,092
Compared to Oh Yoon Hee

625
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,467
who's done that beastly thing,

626
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,300
I was just a toothless baby.

627
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,592
You think

628
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:34,134
the only thing you've done wrong

629
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:35,176
is what you did to Seol A?

630
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,717
Oh, I stole your husband, didn't I?

631
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,634
Take him right back.

632
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:41,467
I will forever regret the fact

633
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,009
that I once loved a man like that.

634
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:45,717
Even in a situation like this,

635
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:47,218
how can you show no sign of regret?

636
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,009
I've been punished enough.

637
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Do you know what my family

638
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:52,759
went through because of Joo Dan Tae?

639
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:53,884
You want more?

640
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,383
Do you think I will bend down

641
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,884
and beg for your forgiveness?

642
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,051
No. Don't do anything.

643
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:04,759
I will do everything from now on.

644
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,717
I will make you desperately regret

645
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,717
everything you've done.

646
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,842
Just wait for it quietly.

647
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,425
Who do you think you are?

648
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:19,926
Are you a god?

649
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:20,884
Are you a judge?

650
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,009
What gives you the right

651
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:23,051
to say such things to me?

652
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,550
The only thing I've done wrong

653
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,634
is that I lived too hard.

654
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:28,176
I simply did my best for my daughter.

655
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:30,092
What's wrong with a mother

656
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:30,926
loving her child?

657
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
I haven't done anything wrong.

658
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:35,675
I won't forgive you, Sim Soo Ryeon.

659
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,509
I will pay you back for

660
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,592

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,284
the omnidirectional lobbying

689
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,326
to develop Cheonsu District?

690
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:09,326
Will you reveal the list of politicians

691
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,783
who took the bribe?

692
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,367
I've lost my money,

693
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,659
but I've never bribed anybody.

694
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,576
I don't need their help.

695
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,783
Why would I bribe them?

696
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:16,742
You're going to get tried

697
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:17,700
for murdering Min Seol A.

698
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:19,117
Will you insist that you're innocent?

699
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,742
I swear I never did anything wrong.

700
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:23,117
I am innocent.

701
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,950
Move.

702
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:25,409
Is it true? - Move!

703
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:26,700
Clear the way.

704
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:27,700
I'm innocent. - Tell us.

705
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:28,700
Move.

706
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:29,700
I am not guilty.

707
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,117
I haven't done anything wrong.

708
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,909
"Seoul Central District Court"

709
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,700
Gosh, I won't run. - Did you kill her?

710
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:40,618
Why would I run?

711
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,242
Stop it.

712
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:44,326
Let go of me. It hurts.

713
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:48,867
I will walk on my own.

714
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,409
Mum.

715
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:00,576
Je Ni.

716
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,742
Hey.

717
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:03,783
Mummy's fine.

718
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:06,409
Son!

719
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:07,992
Did you eat?

720
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:09,742
Look to the front. - Don't worry about me.

721
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:10,742
I am okay.

722
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:13,200
My goodness. He got so thin.

723
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:14,700
Attorney Kim.

724
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:16,242
Which batch is the judge from?

725
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:17,659
Eun Byeol.

726
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,284
"The accused"

727
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:40,618
Everyone, get up.

728
00:35:44,618 --> 00:35:45,659
"The accused"

729
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:53,700
"Judge"

730
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:54,618
Sit.

731
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:56,534
"The accused"

732
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,034
Your Honour, we request

733
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:04,909
Sim Soo Ryeon to be the witness.

734
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,534
"Witness"

735
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,618
Wait.

736
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,451
You! - How dare you!

737
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:12,867
Hey! - How dare you come here?

738
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:14,409
That...

739
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:15,742
What have we done wrong?

740
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:16,700
What's going on?

741
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,618
Did you know about this? - How dare...

742
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:19,783
I mean--

743
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,909
Silence.

744
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:21,950
Keep it down. - Wait.

745
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,159
My gosh.

746
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:24,367
"The accused"

747
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:25,367
"Judge"

748
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:26,326
Go on.

749
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:27,284
"Seoul Central District Court"

750
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,284
"Witness"

751
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,367
On the day of the event,

752
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:32,242
you were going down in an elevator.

753
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,200
And you witnessed the person

754
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:35,576
who pushed Min Seol A. Right?

755
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,950
"Witness"

756
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:38,367
Was that person

757
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:40,451
Oh Yoon Hee?

758
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,159
Was it her?

759
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,534
"Gangnam Police Station"

760
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,700
Yoon Hee sent this to you.

761
00:36:57,825 --> 00:36:59,659
Soo Ryeon, I have a favour to ask.

762
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:01,950
Please testify at the court

763
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,576
as the only person who saw

764
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,117
the last moment of Seol A.

765
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,742
So I will get the punishment I deserve.

766
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:09,950
Only then other people can be

767
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:11,783
punished accordingly.

768
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:13,367
Please do it for me.

769
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:16,783
Please testify.

770
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,867
Yes.

771
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,409
It was her.

772
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,284
"The accused"

773
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,618
"Judge"

774
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,034
She's terrifying.

775
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,117
Oh Yoon Hee

776
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:34,159
pushed Seol A from the 47th floor.

777
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,992
I saw it clearly.

778
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:39,284
No way.

779
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,659
You really did that?

780
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:43,075
It doesn't make sense.

781
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,284
It makes sense.

782
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,742
It totally makes sense.

783
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:47,783
I knew it was her.

784
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:50,117
You shouldn't treat the murderer

785
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,618
the same way you treat us.

786
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:53,117
She pushed a girl like her daughter.

787
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,451
You can't compare us

788
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,117
to that terrible woman.

789
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:58,034
Your Honour.

790
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,700
If you were to punish someone,

791
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:00,950
it should be her.

792
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:03,159
We haven't done anything.

793
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,618
I told you to sit.

794
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,825
After killing a girl,

795
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:09,909
she got her daughter into the school.

796
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,659
She crawled into Bosong Village

797
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,492
where the victim Min Seol A lived.

798
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:15,451
She even speculated the amount

799
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,700
several times the price of her house.

800
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:19,618
She deserves an aggravated punishment.

801
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
If you have conscience,

802
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:22,659
you should say something, Oh Yoon Hee.

803
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,034
You even put on a show and pretended

804
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:25,742
to be the best friend of Seol A's mum.

805
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:28,451
Do you mean anything you do?

806
00:38:29,992 --> 00:38:31,700
Will you keep it down?

807
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,159
If you get loud again,

808
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:35,825
I will kick everyone out of the court.

809
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:40,867
Prosecutor.

810
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:44,284
Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

811
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,159
Do you admit to your charge?

812
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,576
I did not move the victim's body

813
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:50,909
or set her home on fire.

814
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,117
How could you believe this murderer

815
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,034
and treat us like criminals?

816
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,326
Do you have proof?

817
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,242
Can you prove that

818
00:38:58,326 --> 00:39:00,326
we were involved in Min Seol A's murder?

819
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:01,700
Korea's legal system is based

820
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:02,700
on evidence and trials.

821
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:05,534
This is in the Constitution.

822
00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:08,117
I had no involvement in it either.

823
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,075
The murderer, Oh Yoon Hee,

824
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,242
acted on her own.

825
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:12,992
I agree!

826
00:39:13,576 --> 00:39:15,700
I swear on my daughter's name.

827
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:18,034
Me too! I'm innocent too.

828
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:26,742
Your Honour.

829
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,451
Two years ago,

830
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,075
the defendants confessed to the crime.

831
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:34,367
I'll submit a video of it as evidence.

832
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,700
It was not submitted in advance.

833
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:37,825
Please keep it out.

834
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,159
I will accept it.

835
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,534
What?

836
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,618
Hey, you.

837
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,200
I paid you so much money.

838
00:39:44,492 --> 00:39:45,783
Do your job properly, you punk!

839
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:47,075
I'm going to...

840
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,909
Order!

841
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,242
This is your final warning.

842
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:00,742
No! No.

843
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:03,409
Me! I'll go first.

844
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,284
That night...

845
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:06,783
All I did was

846
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,117
wipe the blood off the fountain.

847
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,284
Same here!

848
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,034
Ma Ri told me to wipe the blood,

849
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,950
and that's all I did!

850
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:17,867
Stop!

851
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,950
This is a trap.

852
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:19,867
They're putting on a show

853
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,867
to get evidence!

854
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:22,034
Hey.

855
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:23,909
Keep your mouth shut, will you?

856
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,034
You can die alone for this!

857
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:27,576
I can't die.

858
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:30,618
That guy, Joo Dan Tae, said we should

859
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:32,451
dispose of the body quickly.

860
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:33,825
I'm telling you!

861
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,242
I just did what he told me to do.

862
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:37,075
What the heck?

863
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,700
Lee Kyu Jin, you scumbag!

864
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,075
The bag.

865
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,659
You brought the golf club bag

866
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,992
so we could move the body!

867
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,659
Right, that golf club bag.

868
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,075
We moved it in your car!

869
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:49,700
And your ex-wife, this witch.

870
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:50,618
What?

871
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,576
You faked her suicide note!

872
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,492
What?

873
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,992
You two couples staged it as suicide!

874
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,117
We made

875
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:03,034
those false confessions under duress

876
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,659
in order to survive,

877
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,034
thinking there was a bomb.

878
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:09,034
Sim Soo Ryeon threatened us at gunpoint.

879
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:09,992
That's right.

880
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:12,409
If anyone moved the body,

881
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:13,950
it must've been Oh Yoon Hee,

882
00:41:14,034 --> 00:41:15,492
who killed her!

883
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:17,618
I swear, we didn't do anything.

884
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:18,950
This is unfair.

885
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:22,409
It's so unfair that I can't even breathe.

886
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:24,159
All we did that night

887
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:26,075
was enjoy the party. That's all.

888
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,783
They weren't false confessions.

889
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
All of it is true.

890
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:41,867
What the heck are you talking about?

891
00:41:42,492 --> 00:41:43,326
Dr. Ha.

892
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:45,451
Don't do it. Hey!

893
00:41:45,576 --> 00:41:46,700
Think about Eun Byeol.

894
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:48,825
Do you want both of us to go to jail?

895
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,409
That night, we moved Min Seol A's body

896
00:41:58,867 --> 00:41:59,992
to Bosong Village

897
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,534
and faked the cause of death.

898
00:42:03,242 --> 00:42:04,326
We were afraid that she would

899
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:05,742
tell people that our children

900
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:07,159
had assaulted her.

901
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,326
We all knew she was locked

902
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,909
in the mechanical room,

903
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:14,576
but did nothing to help her.

904
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,950
Gosh. - My goodness.

905
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,409
They have no shame.

906
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:21,117
We were...

907
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:22,576
Then what really happened?

908
00:42:23,326 --> 00:42:24,492
We were all crazy.

909
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,950
You are the crazy one! You're insane!

910
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:29,200
This is all gibberish.

911
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:30,492
Do not believe him!

912
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:31,409
Sit down.

913
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:32,451
The evidence is fake!

914
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:33,659
I said, I didn't do it!

915
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:35,367
How dare you... - He's lying!

916
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,367
Let go!

917
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:37,950
I can't believe this! - It's a lie!

918
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:38,742
Hey!

919
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:39,700
Guards!

920
00:42:39,783 --> 00:42:40,700
Let go!

921
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:41,992
I did no such thing.

922
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:43,867
Don't lie, you scumbag! - Let go!

923
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,492
Ha Yoon Chul. - You scum!

924
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,075
Let go! - Let go of me!

925
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:49,284
Will you push me off a cliff

926
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,492
and kill me?

927
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:56,992
Yoon Chul.

928
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,326
Yoon Hee was the one you loved, after all.

929
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:02,950
You wanted to take her side even if

930
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:04,742
it meant you'd fall into a ditch together?

931
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:07,367
You don't care what happens to me?

932
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:09,117
You jerk! - Stop!

933
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:10,159
Let go!

934
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:11,576
I'll get you for this!

935
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:13,034
I will... - Let me go!

936
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:14,242
Ms. Cheon.

937
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,618
Why are you so slow?

938
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,783
You can't do it like this?

939
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:19,618
I've never done this before.

940
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:22,909
Sang A, you're good.

941
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,950
You pass!

942
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,242
Defendant Kang Ma Ri.

943
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:26,783

You are sentenced to 1.5 years in prison.

950
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:38,034
It's easy if you use your brain a little.

951
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:39,284

The rigged admission at Cheonga Arts High.

961
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,159

It's Seol A's bag.

968
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:14,700
I wrote a suicide note.

969
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:15,783
Set that up too.

970
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:19,200
You're sentenced to seven years in prison.

971
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,451
If she fell from there...

972

Okay, she should be facing up.

This is all your fault. - What?

1026

Get off of me!

1033
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:19,850
Jerk. - You lunatic.

1034
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:21,017
Let go. - You scum. Let go!

1035
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:22,226
Hey!

1036
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:23,100
Jerk! - You scum.

1037
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:24,184
Tell them to kill him.

1038
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:26,017
Come here! - Let go!

1039
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,017
Let go of me! - You demon!

1040
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,850
Because of you...

1041
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:30,226
Let go! - Joo Dan Tae!

1042
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:31,351
Jerk, what did you say?

1043
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,184
Let go. - Get back here!

1044
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:34,309
Hey, bring it on.

1045
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:36,184
How dare you. - Gosh!

1046
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:37,600
You scumbag. - Let go!

1047
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:39,267
Come here. - Get over here.

1048
00:46:39,351 --> 00:46:40,184
You punk! - Come here.

1049
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,142
Let go!

1050
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:42,309
You demon. - You little...

1051
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:43,476
Bring it on. - Let go.

1052
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:44,683
If it hurts, - I'll just...

1053
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:45,725
just say so!

1054
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,850
You demon!

1055
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:48,642
How dare you... - Jerk!

1056
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:49,683
Shut it.

1057
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:51,434
My son!

1058
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,017
Min Hyuk! - Let go!

1059
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,142
My dear son, Min Hyuk!

1060
00:46:56,809 --> 00:46:57,559
Mum!

1061
00:46:57,725 --> 00:46:58,934
Mum. - Ma'am, wait!

1062
00:46:59,059 --> 00:46:59,850
Please help me.

1063
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:01,100
I can't go to jail

1064
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:02,100
and leave Je Ni all alone.

1065
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:03,600
Please help me.

1066
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:07,683
Why can't you go to jail?

1067
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:09,683
Then you shouldn't have

1068
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,100
broken the law in the first place!

1069
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:13,309
I understand you were loyal to me,

1070
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:15,309
but I can't forgive you for doing that

1071
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:16,767
to a child.

1072
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,309
We can readily drop

1073
00:47:18,518 --> 00:47:20,392
10 billion won to get you out on bail,

1074
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:22,059
but we never waste money

1075
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,184
on things like this.

1076
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,559
Don't use your daughter as an excuse.

1077
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:28,059
I'll look after Je Ni.

1078
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:29,934
No, wait. Ma'am!

1079
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,226
Please. Je Ni!

1080
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:32,725
You can't leave like this.

1081
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,351
No! Je Ni! - Mum!

1082
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,850
Mum! - How dare you

1083
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:37,059
give me a jail sentence?

1084
00:47:37,184 --> 00:47:39,309
Show some respect for a former lawyer!

1085
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:41,392
The rule of law in this country

1086
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,226
has collapsed!

1087
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,559
Let go!

1088
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,226
Do you know who my father is?

1089
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,309
Min Hyuk!

1090
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:48,892
My son! Mum's okay.

1091
00:47:49,017 --> 00:47:50,142
Don't worry about me!

1092
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:51,975
This is utterly humiliating.

1093
00:47:52,518 --> 00:47:54,309
Stop calling my name, will you?

1094
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:55,975
What about Eun Byeol?

1095
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:57,600
How's she doing?

1096
00:47:57,934 --> 00:47:59,100
How would I know?

1097
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,351
I'm beyond humiliated.

1098
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:02,850
You've disgraced your father's name.

1099
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:04,434
How could you even ask about Eun Byeol?

1100
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:06,267
I'm sure she thinks she's better off

1101
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:07,351
without a mum like you.

1102
00:48:09,142 --> 00:48:09,934
Mum.

1103
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:11,059
Seo Young!

1104
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,559
Bring Eun Byeol to me.

1105
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:15,351
Tell her that I miss her so much.

1106
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,476
Please tell her I miss her!

1107
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:19,059
That her mum misses her!

1108
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:20,600
Mum.

1109
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,184
Mum.

1110
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:29,142
Mum.

1111
00:48:30,434 --> 00:48:32,142
Mum, no!

1112
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:36,725
Mum. Mum.

1113
00:48:38,476 --> 00:48:39,351
Mum...

1114
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:44,683
Mum. Mum!

1115
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:52,642
Mum...

1116
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:56,683
Joo Dan Tae.

1117
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,059
You're the worst person I've ever met.

1118
00:48:59,142 --> 00:49:00,059
What did you say?

1119
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,476
I want to gouge my eyes out

1120
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:02,642
for not seeing how evil you are

1121
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:03,683
and curse my own heart

1122
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:04,642
for falling for you.

1123
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:07,226
Look who's talking.

1124
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:09,267
Weren't you the one

1125
00:49:09,351 --> 00:49:10,892
who jumped into my arms

1126
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:11,892
and said you loved me.

1127
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,683
I was never in love with you, ever.

1128
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,017
From the very beginning,

1129
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,683
you were nothing but prey for me.

1130
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,892
Don't say my name with that filthy mouth.

1131
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:21,392
Cheon Seo Jin, Cheon Seo Jin. - Shut up.

1132
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:22,559
Cheon Seo Jin. - Shut it.

1133
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,850
Shut it! - What will you do?

1134
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:25,184
Shut it! - My gosh.

1135
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:26,892
You two are truly meant to be.

1136
00:49:27,476 --> 00:49:28,351
What? - What?

1137
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,476
Too bad I won't get to see this anymore.

1138
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:31,809
It's such a shame.

1139
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,309
You brats...

1140
00:49:34,267 --> 00:49:36,142
It took you this long to visit your dad?

1141
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,100
Is this how I raised you?

1142
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,600
I gave you everything,

1143
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:40,767
all I had!

1144
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:42,017
Is this the best you can do?

1145
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,934
You're no longer our dad.

1146
00:49:44,392 --> 00:49:46,017
You ruthlessly killed the mother

1147
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,559
who birthed us and who raised us.

1148
00:49:48,642 --> 00:49:49,975
For that, we can't forgive you.

1149
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:52,600
So you'd better watch what you say to us.

1150
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:56,267
When did my dear son grow up so much?

1151
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,559
Being on your high horse doesn't change

1152
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,267
the fact that I am your father.

1153
00:50:00,642 --> 00:50:01,600
No matter what happens,

1154
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:02,600
you're my children.

1155
00:50:02,725 --> 00:50:04,100
If I'm evil, that makes you evil as well.

1156
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:05,809
If I'm a snake, that makes you a snakelet.

1157
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:07,600
Give up your parental rights.

1158
00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:08,850
What?

1159
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:10,142
Give up my parental rights?

1160
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:12,226
As of this moment,

1161
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,600
Mum is our only guardian.

1162
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:15,351
We're here to apply for an usurpation

1163
00:50:15,434 --> 00:50:16,351
of your parental authority.

1164
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:20,100
You can discuss the rest with our lawyer.

1165
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,683
Who says you can do this?

1166
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,434
If I'm out of the picture,

1167
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:25,059
people will treat you like dirt.

1168
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:27,476
You won't inherit any money from me!

1169
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,725
Do you even have money?

1170
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,642
Dad, you're dirt broke now.

1171
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,518
I heard even the penthouse is Mum's now.

1172
00:50:37,351 --> 00:50:38,600
You didn't know?

1173
00:50:38,683 --> 00:50:41,142
How dare you treat me like this?

1174
00:50:41,392 --> 00:50:43,351
You ungrateful brats!

1175
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,600
Joo Seok Hoon! Joo Seok Kyung!

1176
00:50:46,642 --> 00:50:48,184
Is this how I taught you?

1177
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:49,934
You got into that college thanks to me!

1178
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:51,850
You'd better be grateful to me!

1179
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:55,017
You shouldn't be so happy now.

1180
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,351
You've been dismissed

1181
00:50:56,476 --> 00:50:57,559
from the chief director position.

1182
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,767
So what? You and I

1183
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,392
are nothing now, so get lost.

1184
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:01,392
So I don't have to

1185
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,100
keep your secret anymore, right?

1186
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,267
Only Eun Byeol knows, right?

1187
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:16,142
The fact that her grandfather

1188
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,059
died because of you.

1189
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:22,975
It's too big of a secret

1190
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:25,017
for this young girl to handle, you know?

1191
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:27,351
I need to share it,

1192
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,642
so I want to post it

1193
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:31,559
on the National Petition website.

1194
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:38,892
Seok Kyung.

1195
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,476
Joo Seok Kyung.

1196
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,809
No.

1197
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:45,559
Don't do it.

1198
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:48,518
Do you get the situation now?

1199
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,892
Seok Kyung, no.

1200
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:55,017
Seok Kyung!

1201
00:51:55,518 --> 00:51:56,642
Seok Kyung, let's talk.

1202
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,351
Seok Kyung! Wait!

1203
00:51:58,434 --> 00:51:59,434
No, no!

1204
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:00,518
Over here! - How do you feel?

1205
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,226
Over here! - Do you admit to everything?

1206
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:03,309
Oh Yoon Hee! - Any comment?

1207
00:52:03,392 --> 00:52:05,351
How are you feeling now?

1208
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,809
Just a comment, please!

1209
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,309
I admit

1210
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:12,892
to all the charges.

1211
00:52:14,017 --> 00:52:15,809
I know I don't deserve forgiveness,

1212
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:18,100
but I'll repent what I did to Seol A

1213
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:20,683
for the rest of my life.

1214
00:52:26,683 --> 00:52:27,725
Your Honour.

1215
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:29,559
I'd like to say something

1216
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,892
before you announce the verdict.

1217
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
You may speak.

1218
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:34,850
What Oh Yoon Hee did

1219
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,559
cannot be forgiven.

1220
00:52:38,683 --> 00:52:39,600
However,

1221
00:52:40,392 --> 00:52:41,642
she was the only one

1222
00:52:41,934 --> 00:52:43,518
who was there for my daughter,

1223
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,434
who had no one to rely on.

1224
00:52:47,476 --> 00:52:48,476
No, sir!

1225
00:52:48,642 --> 00:52:49,767
I need money.

1226
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,725
You didn't even pay me last month.

1227
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:52,975
Have you lost your mind?

1228
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:56,434
Do you know how many plates you broke?

1229
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,476
Clean up.

1230
00:52:57,559 --> 00:52:58,559
Clean this all up.

1231
00:52:58,725 --> 00:52:59,642
All of this!

1232
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:01,683
What do you think you're doing?

1233
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,476
That grill is very heavy.

1234
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:06,017
How could you expect this young girl

1235
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,309
to carry it?

1236
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:09,518
This is child abuse.

1237
00:53:09,683 --> 00:53:11,476
I'm going to report you.

1238
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:12,434
Who are you?

1239
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:13,892
I'm her mum. Why?

1240
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:16,600
Get up.

1241
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:18,017
You can easily

1242
00:53:18,392 --> 00:53:19,309
get another job.

1243
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:21,892
Hey, lady. Are you out of your mind?

1244
00:53:22,142 --> 00:53:23,351
Stop right there. - Hey!

1245
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:25,642
Get lost before I call the police.

1246
00:53:28,017 --> 00:53:30,767
Sorry. You lost your job because of me.

1247
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:32,184
I can find another job.

1248
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:36,518
Take this.

1249
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:37,934
Get something nice to eat.

1250
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:39,892
It's okay. I have money.

1251
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,809
I just feel so bad.

1252
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:43,392
Just take it.

1253
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:46,142
My daughter remembered her as someone

1254
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:48,226
who was very kind to her

1255
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,683
without expecting anything in return.

1256
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,267
Also,

1257
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:55,476
she already served time in jail

1258
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:56,767
when she was framed for the murder.

1259
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,767
And she has experienced

1260
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,351
what it's like to lose her own child.

1261
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:04,351
I understand that the law must judge her,

1262
00:54:05,518 --> 00:54:06,434
but I

1263
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,934
have already forgiven her.

1264
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,392
Seol A.

1265
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:33,267
You feel the same way, right?

1266
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,725
All defendants, please stand up.

1267
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:01,934
"The accused"

1268
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:05,017
I pronounce the verdict.

1269
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:07,850
Defendant Oh Yoon Hee

1270
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:09,392
admitted to her crimes

1271
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:10,392
and turned herself in.

1272
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,518
She was feeble-minded at the time,

1273
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,934
and she clearly regrets her action.

1274
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:17,059
Moreover, the victim's family

1275
00:55:17,142 --> 00:55:19,184
is pleading for leniency. Ergo, she'll be

1276
00:55:19,518 --> 00:55:21,434
sentenced to three years in prison.

1277
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:23,642
Three years?

1278
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:25,267
Mum!

1279
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:37,434
Just a comment, please!

1280
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,059
Do you admit to everything?

1281
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:40,142
You admit to the charges?

1282
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:41,351
Just a comment!

1283
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:43,559
This is a scheme to take me down!

1284
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:44,683
A political scheme!

1285
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,142
My party

1286
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,184
won't let this slide.

1287
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:49,809
Je Ni. - Mum.

1288
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:51,559
Je Ni! Where is Ms. Song?

1289
00:55:51,725 --> 00:55:52,683
Where is she?

1290
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:53,809
Don't leave me, Mum!

1291
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:54,892
Tell Ms. Song that...

1292
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:56,434
Min Hyuk! My son. - I'm telling you.

1293
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,934
I'm innocent! - Min Hyuk!

1294
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,392
Min Hyuk! - Let me talk to her.

1295
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:01,892
My dear citizens!

1296
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,934
Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin will be back.

1297
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:06,767
Just like those before me

1298
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,309
overcame such tribulation,

1299
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:10,309
I will be back!

1300
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,017
The rule of law in this country

1301
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:13,059
has fallen!

1302
00:56:13,142 --> 00:56:14,309
Eun Byeol. - Let go!

1303
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,518
Eun Byeol!

1304
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,226
Eun Byeol, Eun Byeol!

1305
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:19,100
Eun Byeol! I didn't do it!

1306
00:56:20,642 --> 00:56:21,600
Eun Byeol!

1307
00:56:23,975 --> 00:56:26,142
Son, I love you a lot.

1308
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:28,518
Don't skip meals, okay?

1309
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,725
Eun Byeol! I really didn't do it.

1310
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,642
Eun Byeol! My daughter...

1311
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,559
Step back. - Just a comment, please!

1312
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,642
Over here! - Step back!

1313
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,434
Look here! - Just a comment, please!

1314
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:40,476
Don't glare at me.

1315
00:56:42,142 --> 00:56:43,975
I really can't stand you, jerk.

1316
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,434
Mum! - Mum!

1317
00:56:54,518 --> 00:56:55,683
Mum, no...

1318
00:56:56,642 --> 00:56:59,100
"Emergency Convoy"

1319
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,809
"Joo Dan Tae Village"

1320
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:57,351
"Joo Dan Tae Village"

1321
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:11,226
I can do it alone.

1322
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:13,683
No, you can't.

1323
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:15,809
You haven't been here in a while.

1324
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:18,100
I'm sure there's a lot that needs fixing.

1325
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:25,559
Seok Kyung volunteered to help.

1326
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,559
No, I did not.

1327
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:34,184
Did you hear about Eun Byeol?

1328
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,518
She vanished into thin air.

1329
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,267
You came back,

1330
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:39,434
so she got scared and fled.

1331
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,600
I hope she never comes back.

1332
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,725
That shameless girl creeps me out.

1333
01:00:49,392 --> 01:00:51,267
Hey, Bae Ro Na! Come out!

1334
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:00,351
What the heck are you doing?

1335
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:03,392
What are you two doing? How childish!

1336
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:05,642
Are you losers back together?

1337
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:08,059
You two need to come to your senses.

1338
01:01:08,351 --> 01:01:10,267
This isn't the time to serve Ro Na.

1339
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,809
Our parents are in jail because of her!

1340
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,351
Je Ni. - Stay away from me.

1341
01:01:16,392 --> 01:01:18,600
If your mum didn't kill Min Seol A,

1342
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:20,392
my mum wouldn't be in jail now.

1343
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,184
Stupid me. I had no idea.

1344
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:23,809
I liked your mum so much.

1345
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:25,892
Do you know how heartbroken I was

1346
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:26,809
thinking you were dead?

1347
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,683
How could you do this?

1348
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,226
You say you're my friend,

1349
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:32,267
but you always hurt me.

1350
01:01:32,975 --> 01:01:34,059
You make it impossible for me

1351
01:01:34,142 --> 01:01:35,184
to be happy that you're alive!

1352
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,725
I won't let this go, Bae Ro Na.

1353
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:40,809
You dared to mess with my family.

1354
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:43,683
My grandpa said he'll get back at you

1355
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,767
for getting my dad fired.

1356
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:48,518
Yes, my mum did something terrible.

1357
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
I won't defend her.

1358
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:51,892
But for once, take responsibility

1359
01:01:52,267 --> 01:01:53,559
for what you did.

1360
01:01:54,725 --> 01:01:56,059
I'm ready to be punished

1361
01:01:56,725 --> 01:01:57,767
for making you guys suffer.

1362
01:01:58,142 --> 01:01:59,850
All you jerks who made my poor mum

1363
01:01:59,934 --> 01:02:00,767
so miserable...

1364
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,059
I'll never forgive you.

1365
01:02:04,017 --> 01:02:05,642
My mum means the world to me.

1366
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:07,392
Brace yourself.

1367
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:09,226
My dad won't let this go.

1368
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:10,642
That's right.

1369
01:02:11,184 --> 01:02:13,351
Her dad is very scary.

1370
01:02:14,351 --> 01:02:15,725
You're dead meat now, Bae Ro Na.

1371
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:19,184
Hey, loser.

1372
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:21,184
Worry about your own life.

1373
01:02:21,392 --> 01:02:22,850
If her dad comes back,

1374
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,017
you and I will be the first to die.

1375
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:30,392
Just ignore them.

1376
01:02:30,476 --> 01:02:31,725
Let's finish unpacking.

1377
01:02:38,184 --> 01:02:39,142
What are you looking at?

1378
01:02:39,434 --> 01:02:40,392
You little...

1379
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:43,142
I can't be a nice person

1380
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,351
because of you jerks.

1381
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:46,267
Let's go, Seok Hoon.

1382
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:47,642
We have to go meet Mum.

1383
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:50,725
She must be waiting.

1384
01:02:57,892 --> 01:02:58,934
Darn it!

1385
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,476
She gave birth to you.

1386
01:03:13,142 --> 01:03:14,100
Did you

1387
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:16,809
ever meet her?

1388
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:19,267
Yes.

1389
01:03:20,184 --> 01:03:21,434
What was she like?

1390
01:03:23,975 --> 01:03:25,600
"Na Ae Gyo"

1391
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:27,351
She was really cool.

1392
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:30,559
She was very brave

1393
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:32,267
and loyal.

1394
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,600
She loved you two very much.

1395
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:39,809
Liar.

1396
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,184
Then how come she never came to see us?

1397
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:45,184
She had her reasons.

1398
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,934
I'll tell you more later.

1399
01:03:54,226 --> 01:03:55,226
What about Seol A?

1400
01:03:56,017 --> 01:03:57,017
Where is her grave?

1401
01:04:02,392 --> 01:04:03,518
I want to visit her.

1405
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:29,309
It's yours.

1406
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:35,518
Congratulations. You won the grand prize.

01:05:06,476 --> 01:05:07,476
Here, have this.

1412
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:12,476
I read something interesting

1413
01:05:13,184 --> 01:05:14,476
in the paper.

My princess.

1427
01:06:53,434 --> 01:06:54,600
How have you been?

1428
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:56,100
I'm back in Korea now.

1429
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,184
What? Seriously? You're in Korea?

1430
01:06:58,767 --> 01:06:59,683
Hurry home!

I'll be home soon.

I'll see you at home.

All right.

1435
01:07:08,642 --> 01:07:09,600
Hello, sir.

1436
01:07:14,642 --> 01:07:17,184
Where is that scumbag now?

from JFK Airport, will land

01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:28,809
at Incheon International Airport shortly.

1441
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:30,351
Make sure to check your seat belts...

1442

For a marriage proposal?

And open the window shields. - The ring.

Great choice.

1448
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,600
It's very elegant.

1449
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:42,809
You think so?

1450
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,518
Thank you.

1451
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,351
Our flight from JFK Airport will arrive...

1452
01:07:47,518 --> 01:07:48,934
Korea must've changed a lot, right?

1453
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:52,392
Well, it sure has.

1454
01:07:52,476 --> 01:07:54,809
Please open the window shields.

1455
01:07:54,892 --> 01:07:56,518
I'm excited because it's been so long.

1456
01:07:58,892 --> 01:08:01,017
I finally get to see my old friend again.

1457
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,600
I'm glad I lived

1458
01:08:06,476 --> 01:08:07,683
to meet him again.

1459

Soo Ryeon, where are you?

1461
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:24,267
I just got back.

1462
01:08:25,975 --> 01:08:26,850
Already?

1463
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:29,518
I was getting impatient.

1464
01:08:29,725 --> 01:08:31,100
I couldn't wait any longer.

1465
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:33,683
I'm back in the penthouse now.

1466

01:08:43,392 --> 01:08:44,518
Can we meet soon?

1470
01:08:45,476 --> 01:08:47,267
I have something to tell you as well.

1471
01:08:49,184 --> 01:08:50,642
I'm going to my store soon.

1472
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,059
Can we meet there?

1473

Can you come out for a second?

Sure, I'll be right out.

1480
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:52,518
I'm stepping out for a smoke.

1481
01:09:53,184 --> 01:09:54,142
I guess I'm nervous.

1482
01:09:54,683 --> 01:09:55,642
Sure, go ahead.

I couldn't forgive myself

1493

for going to the airport first.

What if you get caught?

The last promise I made to Seol A...

Bae Ro Na?

Can't you give in a little for Seok Kyung?

I love my daughter very much.

what happened to Soo Ryeon?

01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:10,267
Is this how you train your helper?

Help me, Yoon Hee.

No way! That's impossible!

01:13:24,725 --> 01:13:26,476
She was Soo Ryeon, not Ae Gyo.
