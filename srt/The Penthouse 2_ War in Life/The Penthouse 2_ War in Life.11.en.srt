I feel so bad for Soo Ryeon.

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,167
You used her

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,959
until the moment she died.

9
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:22,000
That kind woman didn't deserve that.

10
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you

11
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,375
for remembering me.

12
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,375
What are you doing?

13
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,542
You're Soo Ryeon.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,375
I know you're Soo Ryeon!

15
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't try to run away.

16
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,334
It took me so long to recognise you.

18
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,083
Where is she?

19
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,125
Where are you, Cheon Seo Jin?

20
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,334
She went to the lesson room.

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,709
How dare she leave without my permission?

22
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,042
I asked her to give me a lesson

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,459
to prepare for the finals.

24
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,834
You didn't bring her here

25
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,000
just to cook for us, right?

26
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,125
I'll make use of my stepmum, okay?

27
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,584
Tell her to return as soon as she's done.

28
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:00,626
Okay.

29
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,125
I told him that you're in the lesson room.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,542
He won't call you for a couple of hours.

31
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,709
"Ms. Cheon"

32
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,167
Chairman Joo, you should see this.

33
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:20,125
What is this?

34
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,125
Logan Lee?

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,400
Ae Gyo met with Logan?

36
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:28,626
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,500
They met in secret after the auction.

38
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,584
When did this jerk return to Korea?

39
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,751
Why isn't James keeping his son away?

40
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,334
Where is she right now?

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,459
She's in the villa.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,876
The villa?

43
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,667
It's me.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,167
Do you know who this Logan is?

45
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,250
Come to the villa right now.

46
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:54,626
It's an emergency.

47
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,167
Okay, I'll be there right now.

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,292
Get the car ready.

49
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,083
Help me.

50
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:09,959
Yoon Hee.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,292
How am I supposed to trust you?

52
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,959
Yes, of course, you can't trust me.

53
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,209
I understand.

54
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,709
But why would I fool you

55
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,000
at this point in time?

56
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:19,083
I was ready to go to prison

57
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,042
when I came here.

58
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,375
So?

59
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,876
What are you trying to say?

60
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,459
On the day of Cheonga Arts Festival,

61
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,459
Eun Byeol hit Ro Na with the trophy,

62
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,000
then she rolled down the steps.

63
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,876
Yoon Chul took that trophy

64
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,334
and put it in Seok Kyung's locker.

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,626
We were both crazy

66
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,292
because we just wanted to save Eun Byeol.

67
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,375
Joo Dan Tae found out

68
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,375
and began to threaten us.

69
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,667
He's got Eun Byeol's necklace

70
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:49,042
that was on the scene.

71
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:50,876
Are you looking for this?

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,375
He used your daughter's death

73
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,876
to take Cheonga Group from me.

74
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,209
What does that change?

75
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,334
Eun Byeol still killed my daughter.

76
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,125
No.

77
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:04,876
It may be Eun Byeol,

78
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:07,584
but it may not be her.

79
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,459
Joo Dan Tae was there too.

80
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,417
Eun Byeol heard his ringtone then.

81
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,626
Is this some kind of a joke?

82
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:16,918
Are you telling me to believe her

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,334
when she can't even remember things?

84
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,083
I can... I can prove that.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,959
Joo Dan Tae's outfit changed

86
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,000
during the festival.

87
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,000
Isn't it weird how he got changed

88
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,667
right before the awards ceremony?

89
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,083
I'm sure there's something going on.

90
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,209
Well, in any case...

91
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,125
"Voice Spy"

92
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,834
Bae Ro Na was very useful.

93
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,751
As useful as Min Seol A was.

94
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:41,209
Thanks to those pathetic girls' deaths

95
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,292
at the most opportune times,

96
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,209
I was able to effortlessly

97
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,000
swallow up all of Soo Ryeon's

98
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,751
and Seo Jin's fortune.

99
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:52,751
You want to blame

100
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,459
Joo Dan Tae for everything at this point?

101
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:57,626
Do you think a few photos

102
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,292
are going to prove what he did?

103
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:00,834
There could be many reasons

104
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:01,918
for him to get changed.

105
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:02,876
I am not

106
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,751
doing this to save Eun Byeol.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,125
All I want to know is

108
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,459
the truth of that day.

109
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,959
Please help me kill Joo Dan Tae,

110
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,918
that wicked man, with my own hands.

111
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,125
I beg you,

112
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,292
Yoon Hee.

113
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:23,792
Then make a confession

114
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,626
on everything

115
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,334
you and Eun Byeol did to Ro Na.

116
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,792
"Recording"

117
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,250
All right.

118
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,083
I'll tell you everything.

119
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:51,918
Who do you think you are?

120
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,584
How dare you try to pull this on me?

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,834
How dare you?

122
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,876
Logan!

123
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,834
It has been so long.

124
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,751
I thought your dad locked you up.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,209
But you have been a runaway kid.

126
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,334
Joo Dan Tae.

127
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,626
What brings you here?

128
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:10,751
No, forget that.

129
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:12,000
How did you know about this place?

130
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,167
He followed me from the auction house.

131
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,876
You're still not over Soo Ryeon?

132
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:18,918
You...

133
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,042
I let you go

134
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,334
like a gentleman last time, didn't I?

135
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,209
Take him to the warehouse.

136
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,042
I'll make sure I end him for good.

137
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,125
Let me go.

138
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me go! Let go of me!

139
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,209
Let me go!

140
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,751
What did he say to you?

141
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,542
He said I look exactly like Sim Soo Ryeon,

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,751
then asked me about

143
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:54,792
my relationship with you.

144
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,292
That crazy idiot.

145
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,167
The problem is that

146
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,709
he knew about Jung Doo Man too.

147
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:03,459
What?

148
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,000
It seems like he knows

149
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,334
we have been investing

150
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,834
with the information we got from him.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,918
He even threatened me

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
to expose the truth, that idiot.

153
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,083
Maybe

154
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,626
Soo Ryeon found out about something

155
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:19,626
before she died.

156
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,000
She couldn't have.

157
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,417
There's no way she caught on.

158
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,709
And Jung Doo Man wouldn't have spoken up.

159
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,125
Then go see that guy first.

160
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,459
I'm sure we'll find something.

161
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,292
I'll call you later.

162
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:48,959
Mr. Hong.

163
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:50,334
It's me, Sim Soo Ryeon.

164
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,042
Let me go!

165
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,834
Let me go, you jerks.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,834
Let go!

167
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,125
Let me go!

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,167
You jerks.

169
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,125
Let me go!

170
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,584
Logan!

171
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,834
You must've been thrilled

172
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,417
thinking that Soo Ryeon came back alive.

173
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,042
I'm sorry

174
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,626
that you had to be disappointed.

175
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,751
You shouldn't covet after

176
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,334
someone else's woman, right?

177
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,083
Soo Ryeon died way before her time

178
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,751
because you ridiculously took her side.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,250
You idiot.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,292
A rich boy like you

181
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,083
has too much money to spare,

182
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,792
so I guess you're spending time

183
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,459
obsessing over useless things.

184
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,792
I'm sorry, but your revenge

185
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,876
ends here, you idiot.

186
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,667
Darn it, this idiot.

187
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,375
Take it off.

188
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,000
What? What the heck is going on?

189
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:21,667
Wake him up.

190
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:22,959
Darn it.

191
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:29,959
Mr. Joo.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,876
He got us.

193
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,334
His men followed us.

194
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:38,959
And they had already

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,876
switched out the driver.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,918
They knew Logan was in our car.

197
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,000
Step on it.

198
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:06,709
Who the heck are they?

199
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,709
Just go.

200
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,125
Just hit them and go!

201
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:21,542
Who are you?

202
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:25,250
You jerk. Come out here.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,834
Come here.

204
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:29,918
Come out here!

205
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:35,375
Darn it.

206
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:41,817
Are you all right?

207
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,276
Hey, you dimwit.

208
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,609
Why didn't you check who the driver was?

209
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,059
You idiot.

210
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:00,518
Na Ae Gyo.

211
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:04,309
That brat. Na Ae Gyo.

212
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,934
"Na Ae Gyo"

213
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,809
"Na Ae Gyo"

214
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,975
What happened?

215
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,725
What did that jerk say?

216
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,309
Why didn't you pick up sooner?

217
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,309
I ran out of the shower

218
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:21,892
to pick up your darned call!

219
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:23,934
Why are you always yelling at me?

220
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:24,975
Do you think I'm a joke?

221
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,100
Forget it.

222
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,267
We'll talk later.

223
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,434
You idiot.

224
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,975
Everything was your plan, right?

225
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:47,392
If you were going to save me,

226
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,850
why did you call Joo Dan Tae here?

227
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,725
I had no other choice

228
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,017
to make him trust me.

229
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,226
He already became suspicious

230
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,767
when he found out that we met.

231
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,518
We lived together for 20 years.

232
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,600
It's a matter of time before he notices.

233
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,184
Why did you get yourself into this danger?

234
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,059
Where have you been?

235
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,226
Why haven't you contacted me?

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,559
If you were alive,

237
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,392
why didn't you call me?

238
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,725
Sim Soo Ryeon died.

239
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,642
On that day two years ago.

240
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,559
You're alive and well in front of me.

241
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,100
You and I

242
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:27,683
now have nothing to do with each other.

243
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,809
I have things to do as Na Ae Gyo.

244
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,434
Until the day I complete what I must do,

245
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,100
no one can find out that I'm still alive,

246
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:39,309
not even Yoon Hee.

247
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:41,600
How can I turn a blind eye to you?

248
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,017
You may fall in danger again.

249
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,725
Soo Ryeon.

250
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:49,892
For the last two years,

251
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
I lived in regret every single day.

252
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:55,226
I couldn't protect you.

253
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,476
I couldn't forgive myself

254
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,518
for going to the airport first.

255
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,017
I was driven insane every single day!

256
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:04,934
"GPS Tracking: Target Acquired"

257
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:07,559
"GPS Tracking: Target Acquired"

258
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,975
Joo Dan Tae is coming.

259
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,600
You need to go.

260
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:13,226
I can't help you twice.

261
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,226
I'm not going.

262
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:15,809
You need to come with me.

263
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,683
I'm not leaving alone.

264
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:20,100
Your job here was done when

265
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:21,476
you exposed the truth of Seol A's death.

266
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,809
And this is now my problem.

267
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,518
You need to stay out of this.

268
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,975
Everything will end in two weeks.

269
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,184
If you end up doing something

270
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,600
to ruin my plan,

271
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,600
I'll be tortured for the rest of my life,

272
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,059
blaming you.

273
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,059
You need to go.

274
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,559
Just promise me one thing.

275
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,434
If you fall in danger,

276
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,892
promise me that you'll call me.

277
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,476
That you will...

278
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,767
never leave alone again.

279
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:57,309
You need to go.

280
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,683
Soo Ryeon,

281
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,392
thank you

282
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:02,975
for staying alive.

283
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:28,892
I have to pay off the balance tomorrow?

284
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,683
What kind of a ridiculous term is that?

285
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,267
I had to win the auction

286
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,892
to get my hands on that land.

287
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,017
We need to put up with it.

288
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,267
All the land we own went up

289
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,017
by 20 percent just today.

290
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:43,600
Even so, how are we

291
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,600
going to find 50 billion won overnight?

292
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:47,809
Well,

293
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,059
grab everything you can turn into cash.

294
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,017
Then use the penthouse as collateral

295
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,518
to take out a loan.

296
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,725
There's no way

297
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:56,892
I will touch the penthouse.

298
00:14:58,392 --> 00:14:59,226
Honey.

299
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:03,267
How much does that new safe of yours

300
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,392
have in her hands?

301
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:08,642
The safe?

302
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,059
Cheon Seo Jin?

303
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:13,934
It's an emergency, so give her pressure.

304
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:15,934
We'll lose five billion won, the deposit.

305
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,100
Everything went haywire

306
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,518
because of Oh Yoon Hee.

307
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,142
I'm sure Logan is behind her.

308
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:23,767
She bought Joo Hye In's land

309
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:25,476
and is playing around with it.

310
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,309
That's the more reason to not give up.

311
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,934
Will you let Logan take away

312
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:31,226
the best part of Cheonsu District?

313
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:32,184
Stop it!

314
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:39,326
Did Logan come back here?

315
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,184
If he had come back here,

316
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,309
you would've received a call.

317
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,142
Think of all the security guards here.

318
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,809
Did he really like Soo Ryeon or what?

319
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:52,142
He keeps a close eye on me

320
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,892
and meddles with everything that I do.

321
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,975
It's not like you can kill him.

322
00:15:58,017 --> 00:15:59,059
I heard he's a rich man in the US.

323
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:01,226
Sim Soo Ryeon

324
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,518
will always be a nuisance,

325
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,809
both alive and dead.

326
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:08,559
Don't you think so?

327
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll call you tomorrow.

328
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,059
What?

329
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,267
A times B means...

330
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,184
"Advanced High School Maths"

331
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:35,017
"Connecting"

332
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:36,184
Seok Hoon.

333
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,642
It's me.

334
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Are you really Ro Na?

335
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,184
"Video Call"

336
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,392
Where are you?

337
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,559
Seok Hoon.

338
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:13,267
Ro Na.

339
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:33,559
I've been up for a week.

340
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,767
I kept talking nonsense for a while.

341
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:38,975
They said it's a miracle

342
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:41,518
that I can breathe and talk

343
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,059
after three open brain surgeries.

344
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,392
I see.

345
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,059
I'm so relieved.

346
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,434
I thought you really died.

347
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,725
Who brought you here?

348
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:58,351
Did you call your mum?

349
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:01,226
No.

350
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:02,351
Why not?

351
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,226
She'd be thrilled to know you're alive.

352
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,184
Let's call her right away.

353
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:07,309
I can't do that yet.

354
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,100
But

355
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:12,725
it won't be long.

356
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,184
Before I do that,

357
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,600
I have something to say to you.

358
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,476
That's why I called.

359
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,100
What is it?

360
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,476
The one who did this to me was...

361
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:31,850
Was it

362
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,226
my dad?

363
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,059
I hoped it wasn't him.

364
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,142
I really wished it wasn't him.

365
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:56,476
Why does he keep taking away

366
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,850
everyone that's precious to me?

367
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,600
Why?

368
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,683
I'll never forgive him.

369
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,309
Seok Hoon.

370
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,892
I'll kill him.

371
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:20,059
Seok Hoon.

372
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:22,434
M... Mum?

373
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:26,476
Ms. Sim saved me.

374
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:37,267
Mum...

375
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,642
Mum...

376
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,059
I missed you so much.

377
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,309
Mum, I missed you so much.

378
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:58,767
My son.

379
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:03,934
My son.

380
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,809
Cheon Seo Jin offered to work with us.

381
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,600
She confessed everything she did,

382
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,850
so she seems trustworthy this time.

383
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,434
We can make good use of her.

384
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,267
She's already cornered,

385
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,434
and she has nowhere else to run to.

386
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:30,142
I'm going to go ahead

387
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:31,892
and sign the papers with Na Ae Gyo.

388
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,683
Are you sure we can let her have it?

389
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:36,975
Hand it over

390
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:38,559
just as she wants.

391
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,309
Once Joo Dan Tae takes it, it'll be over.

392
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,600
Do you still trust Na Ae Gyo?

393
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,559
She got rid of the tapping app,

394
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,351
so we can't find out where she is

395
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,392
or what she's up to.

396
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,892
Do you think I put that land on sale

397
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:54,934
without a plan?

398
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:58,892
I have a good plan.

399
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:03,226
How much?

400
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,434
50 billion won.

401
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,559
I need it in cash by tomorrow.

402
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:09,600
Are you kidding me?

403
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:12,934
No one has that much money in cash.

404
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,642
If you don't have it,

405
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,683
make sure you make it.

406
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,267
Use your buildings as collateral,

407
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,683
sell some diamonds,

408
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:22,850
or go steal your mum's money.

409
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:25,518
I'm sure you're capable of doing that.

410
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,142
If you don't,

411
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:29,267
I can't guarantee

412
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,476
Eun Byeol's safety.

413
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:39,975
Have it ready until tomorrow morning.

414
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:41,809
I need it in a hurry.

415
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:47,434
Make it happen.

416
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:04,642
"Real Estate Purchase Agreement"

417
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:05,518
"Sealed by Oh Yoon Hee"

418
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,309
"Sealed by Na Ae Gyo"

419
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,184
Okay, I'll check.

420
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:09,767
It must've been tough

421
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,100
to meet the deadline, honey.

422
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:17,392
He just transferred the remaining balance.

423
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,975
I see.

424
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:20,767
How did he find that much money in a day?

425
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,059
That's so amazing.

426
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:26,809
Goodness, you're very lucky.

427
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:27,934
This is pretty much

428
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,975
the highest price you can get.

429
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,184
You hit a jackpot.

430
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,017
Could you give us some privacy, Mr. Hwang?

431
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,934
Of course, you're all done paying.

432
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,725
You two can take your time.

433
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,017
I'll put the documents together.

434
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:41,892
All right.

435
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:45,642
You made a huge amount of money.

436
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:46,683
Why do you look so down?

437
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,309
It looks like

438
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:49,559
you don't want to hand it over.

439
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:51,725
It's enraging to see the land

440
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:55,226
Soo Ryeon cherished so much

441
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,518
go over to scumbags like you.

442
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:58,351
You took the money. That's enough.

443
00:24:58,518 --> 00:24:59,476
Stop pretending like

444
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,725
you're loyal to that dead woman.

445
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:03,184
You almost had me fooled.

446
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,975
Don't you feel sorry for Soo Ryeon?

447
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,600
She took your kids in

448
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,559
and raised them like her own for 17 years.

449
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:13,351
What have you done

450
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:14,559
going around pretending to be her?

451
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,059
What's between you and Jung Doo Man?

452
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,142
What weaknesses do you hold on him

453
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:22,017
to make him give you all the information?

454
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:23,309
Do you want to know?

455
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:26,892
But bad news.

456
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:28,934
I can't tell that to someone

457
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,100
who snoops around people's back

458
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:31,559
by installing a tapping app

459
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,934
on people's phones.

460
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:34,892
You look like

461
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:37,725
you'd be good at betraying people.

462
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:39,434
You have that traitor's face.

463
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,392
Why? Did I hit your sore spot?

464
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,642
You aren't trying to get your revenge

465
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,267
because you feel bad for Soo Ryeon.

466
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,392
You're just mad that Joo Dan Tae

467
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:53,683
betrayed you.

468
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:56,975
If he reaches out his hand again,

469
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,809
you'll run over to his side again.

470
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,100
You knew how wicked that man is,

471
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:04,518
but didn't you fall for him

472
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,725
because he was rich and gentle?

473
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:08,226
Did you want the penthouse that much?

474
00:26:09,725 --> 00:26:10,892
You were jealous

475
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,351
of everything Soo Ryeon had.

476
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,100
How dare you try to teach me?

477
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:15,600
That's why

478
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:17,850
I'm getting punished right now.

479
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:21,434
I even lost my kid. What more can I do?

480
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,850
Tell me if I have a way to atone for this.

481
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:24,892
I'll die if I have to,

482
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:26,351
and I'll kill if I must!

483
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:30,767
I have a question.

484
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,017
You were with Sim Soo Ryeon

485
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,642
when she died, right?

486
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,226
Then you must've heard.

487
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,351
What did she say before she died?

488
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,267
Did she leave anything behind?

489
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:45,600
She never left a word for you,

490
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:46,767
so don't get curious.

491
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,518
I'm sure she said something to her kids.

492
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,725
I mean, if they ever ask,

493
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,518
I should pass along her last words.

494
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:58,184
She raised them, after all.

495
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:05,559
She told me to run.

496
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,476
Run?

497
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:13,100
"Run.

498
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,392
You have to run."

499
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:21,518
She told someone like me to run.

500
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,725
I betrayed her and wanted her dead,

501
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:26,892
but she told me to run.

502
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:32,683
Yes.

503
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,683
You're right.

504
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:36,934
You and I both

505
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:38,476
leeched off Soo Ryeon's life.

506
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,267
There's no reason to criticise each other.

507
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,642
Let's just wait for our doom, then.

508
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,476
Oh Yoon Hee.

509
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,642
Do you want to play crazy and trust me?

510
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,975
I have

511
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,683
a good plan to end Joo Dan Tae

512
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,683
once and for all.

513
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,434
What did you just say?

514
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,476
You said you wanted to get your revenge.

515
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,184

I'll make sure

660

I make him pay for your death too.

661
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,259
I want more coffee.

662
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:46,800
The coffee smells especially good today.

663
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:04,718
That's enough, Dad.

664
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,342
Do you think that apron

665
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:07,634
actually suits her?

666
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,634
Bring our maids back.

667
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:11,092
It's okay.

668
00:38:11,217 --> 00:38:12,175
I can manage on my own.

669
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,676
I won't eat at home any more,

670
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:17,509
so you don't need to cook for me.

671
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:20,634
Sit back down.

672
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,967
Did I teach you such bad table manners?

673
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,718
I didn't learn anything

674
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:26,551
from you.

675
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:28,384

677
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,759
Stop right there!

678
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,634
You don't need to cook for me either.

679
00:38:35,718 --> 00:38:37,467
Might as well go on a strict diet.

680
00:38:45,384 --> 00:38:46,718
You still haven't won them over

681
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,967
after all this time?

682
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,009
You can't even cook to their taste?

683
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:51,967
You need to care for them

684
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,426
like you would for Eun Byeol!

685
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:55,217
I'll try harder.

686
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:57,342
I've never done these things before.

687
00:38:57,883 --> 00:38:58,800
But once I get used to it,

688
00:38:58,883 --> 00:38:59,883
I'm sure I'll do well.

689
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,175
Where did the arrogant Cheon Seo Jin go?

690
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:09,009
Why have you become so obedient?

691
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:11,800
What changed your mind?

692
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,009
Promise me that you won't hurt Eun Byeol.

693
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,509
Then I'll do my best to cooperate.

694
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,759
Acting like I'm happy isn't all that hard.

695
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,134
I won't see Eun Byeol

696
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:24,342
without your permission.

697
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:32,634
Do you really mean it?

698
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,467
Just make sure Ro Na's case closes

699
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:36,842
with Yoon Chul as the killer.

700
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,092
Then I'll give you what you asked for.

701
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:41,259
The medical centre and everything else.

702
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,009
I'll think about it.

703
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,676
Thanks.

704
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:51,759
See?

705
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,092
Way to go, Cheon Seo Jin.

706
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:55,800
How beautiful is it

707
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,426
to admit your defeat?

708
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:00,800
Thanks to you,

709
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:02,967
my morning is off to a good start.

710
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Sure.

711
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:19,634
Laugh at me all you want.

712
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,676
If I have to die to get out of here,

713
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,050
I will kill you too.

714
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:30,467
Darn it.

715
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:38,342
Did you look into it?

716
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:39,883
Hey, come on!

717
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,467
Tell me. Now!

718
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,384
This is confidential information

719
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:47,551
from the Ministry of Land.

720
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:50,925
I think they're secretly

721
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:53,217
pushing ahead with the redevelopment.

722
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,300
When will it happen?

723
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,759
The plans could be announced as early as

724
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,175
this week.

725
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,342
This week? That soon? - Yes.

726
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,092
My gosh. Hey.

727
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:06,551
But that weasel, Joo Dan Tae...

728
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:07,925
Who's got his back?

729
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,134
Mr. Jung Doo Man.

730
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,384
I think they go back a long way.

731
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:12,467
Jung Doo Man?

732
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:14,967
He's a big shot.

733
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,967
Mr. Jung politely declined.

734
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,050
Is this not good enough or what?

735
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:26,842
Or does this mean

736
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:28,800
he'll cut all ties with me?

737
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:31,800
Kyu Jin's here!

738
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:35,634
Where are your manners?

739
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,134
You can't just barge in here

740
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:38,426
without even calling first.

741
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:40,592
I'm busy right now.

742
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:41,759
With what?

743
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,134
Buying more land in Cheonsu District?

744
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,175
Goodness.

745
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:53,800
Why would I buy more land?

746
00:41:53,883 --> 00:41:54,967
I've sold all my properties

747
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,509
except for the penthouse.

748
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,259
Don't create false rumours.

749
00:41:58,342 --> 00:41:59,509
You sold all your properties

750
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:01,634
to invest in Cheonsu District, I'm sure.

751
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:03,883
You sent your representative to buy

752
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:06,050
lot 27 for 50 billion won at the auction.

753
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:07,175
Don't be so greedy.

754
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,259
Why didn't you offer a higher price, then?

755
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:10,592
The rich getting richer.

756
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:11,800
That's how the world works.

757
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:15,009
My, Kyu Jin is a little sad here.

758
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,092
What happened to the brotherhood

759
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,342
of Hera Club?

760
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:20,092
I hear they will

761
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,467
announce the redevelopment this week.

762
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,217
Where did you hear that?

763
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,759
I'm Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin,

764
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:27,009
representing Gangnam!

765
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:28,718
Of course, I have my sources.

766
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:32,967
Hey, brother.

767
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,800
Hand over

768
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:37,175
just a couple of good ones.

769
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:39,509
I'll give you the best prices.

770
00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:42,883
I'd really like to do that for you,

771
00:42:43,634 --> 00:42:44,925
but you must always be careful

772
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:46,883
and not be tied to worldly desires.

773
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:48,800
As a public official,

774
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,634
you must uphold your integrity.

775
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,842
You even went on a hunger strike

776
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,634
to eradicate real estate speculation.

777
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:57,217
If the people see you

778
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,800
drooling over some properties

779
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,342
wanting in on it,

780
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:03,050
they'll feel awfully betrayed.

781
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:05,134
Do you not need your gold badge anymore?

782
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:08,217
You jerk! This is personal.

783
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,676
Don't use my position to attack me!

784
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,925
You traitor.

785
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:13,050
I can buy that stupid piece of land

786
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,217
without your help!

787
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,842
"Stupid"?

788
00:43:17,676 --> 00:43:18,883
If you're so confident,

789
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,050
go buy some.

790
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:22,134
Why are you here begging me?

791
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:23,217
Fine.

792
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:24,800
Let's take this all the way.

793
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:26,467
If this is how you'll play it,

794
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:28,175
I'll also buy as much as I can.

795
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:30,800
Don't regret this later, you greedy pig...

796
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,050
No, you swindler.

797
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:39,175
Idiot.

798
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,259
That won't happen.

799
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:43,009
It'll be announced in two days.

800
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:46,217
The game's already over.

801
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:49,883
Here.

802
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:51,634
I even brought my son's gold ring

803
00:43:51,718 --> 00:43:53,175
from his first birthday.

804
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:54,759
Give me whatever that is left

805
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,883
in Cheonsu District.

806
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,759
I don't care what it looks like.

807
00:43:57,925 --> 00:43:59,676
Even if it's right by a rubbish dump!

808
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:01,384
Give me something,

809
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:03,426
or I'll get your business suspended.

810
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:06,551
I've told you over and over.

811
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,050
There really is no more land left.

812
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:12,092
That's why we're asking you personally.

813
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:13,592
Would you please

814
00:44:13,676 --> 00:44:15,551
talk to the landowners, Mr. Hwang?

815
00:44:16,509 --> 00:44:18,259
You can't call him like that, Mother.

816
00:44:18,426 --> 00:44:20,967
Call him Sir Hwang Geum Bong.

817
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,175
Cut it out.

818
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:25,718
I'm Red Trousers from Apgujeong.

819
00:44:26,384 --> 00:44:27,759
I built a 19-storey apartment building

820
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
on a mulberry field.

821
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:30,551
I'm that legendary real estate investor.

822
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:33,800
Everyone in the industry knows about

823
00:44:33,883 --> 00:44:35,800
the scale of her investments.

824
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:37,759
If you give us something good,

825
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,509
we'll definitely return the favour.

826
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,718
We'll triple the brokerage fee, okay?

827
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:43,842
Yes!

828
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:47,050
My gosh, this is crazy.

829
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:54,426
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

830
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:57,384
I'm making a special exception for Mr. Lee.

831
00:44:57,676 --> 00:44:58,592
What is it?

832
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,759
Gather around.

833
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:06,467
They'll build a premium sports complex

834
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,092
on this land.

835
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:10,800
No one saw you, right?

836
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:12,800
Don't you worry.

837
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:14,718
I sneaked in through the back door.

838
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:17,259
So? What's the lot that's listed for sale?

839
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,551
A prime spot. They'll build

840
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,883
a high-end shopping centre here.

841
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,009
A listing like this is hard to come by.

842
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,718
Why is the owner selling it?

843
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,009
It looks too good.

844
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:32,634
She borrowed money from loan sharks.

845
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,426
And her husband found out about it.

846
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,009
My gosh, I feel so bad for her.

847
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,925
I'll buy it.

848
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:42,800
All of it. Okay?

849
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,676
I heard there's a good lot for sale.

850
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:53,050
Here.

851
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,551
These are 100-percent pure gold bars.

852
00:45:55,842 --> 00:45:57,175
This is a letter of guarantee.

853
00:45:57,676 --> 00:45:58,800
Sell it to me.

854
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,050
"Golden Real Estate"

855
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,342
"Specialised in Cheonsu District"

856
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:07,676
"Redevelopment and Investment"

857
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:09,384
"Enquiries Welcome"

858
00:46:17,092 --> 00:46:18,800
I sealed the deal without any issues,

859
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:20,759
at the highest price possible.

860
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:22,800
Thank you.

861
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,009
Please sell the rest of the land

862
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:27,592
to those people.

863
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:30,050
Everything under my name.

864
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:34,718
Oh, make sure they pay up front in cash.

865
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:38,842
"Gangnam Police Station"

866
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
Had she known

867
00:46:49,384 --> 00:46:51,050
she was being murdered by her father...

868
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:54,342
What do you mean?

869
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:56,092
What is wrong with you?

870
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:01,634
Apologise to Ro Na, just for once.

871
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:03,925
I feel so bad for my child who died

872
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:05,259
without even getting a chance

873
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:06,925
to be treated as your daughter.

874
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:09,925
You can do that for her, right?

875
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:16,467
After we broke up,

876
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:18,426
I found out I was pregnant with Ro Na.

877
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:21,842
You were already engaged to Seo Jin,

878
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:23,592
so I couldn't go back to you.

879
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,384
I rushed to marry someone else.

880
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:27,509
And of course,

881
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,551
I told him I was pregnant.

882
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:32,050
He liked me a lot,

883
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,092
so he promised to love my baby as well.

884
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:37,592
But once he saw that the baby

885
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:38,592
looked nothing like him,

886
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:39,718
he changed.

887
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:41,300
He never came home

888
00:47:41,718 --> 00:47:43,217
and wouldn't even look at her.

889
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,342
Our Ro Na

890
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,509
had such a sad childhood.

891
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,342
She never received any love.

892
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,842
No.

893
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:05,342
That can't be true.

894
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,509
Why would I

895
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,509
not recognise my own child?

896
00:48:10,384 --> 00:48:11,384
It's a lie.

897
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:13,509
It's all a lie. She lied to me!

898
00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:15,592
She lied to me! - Hey, stop!

899
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:16,800
Hey, you!

900
00:48:17,217 --> 00:48:19,509
Have some manners for your cellmates.

901
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:20,759
Have you lost your mind?

902
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:22,925
Be quiet, okay?

903
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,592
You be quiet!

904
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:26,800
You jerk! - Hey!

905
00:48:27,925 --> 00:48:28,842
Hey.

906
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:31,384
You little... Got a death wish?

907
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:32,467
Yes, kill me.

908
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,009
I want to die like crazy!

909
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:34,967
What's your problem?

910
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,676
You punk.

911
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:39,925
You jerk!

912
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,384
Hey, step on him. - Okay.

913
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,634
You little... - Jerk!

914
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,592
Darn it.

915
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:48,384
Keep it down!

916
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:50,800
Hey.

917
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:52,009
You jerks.

918
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:54,217
Hit me more.

919
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:56,592
Hit me more, you scumbags!

920
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:58,800
You psycho! - Calm down.

921
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,426
Darn it! - Hey!

922
00:49:02,842 --> 00:49:03,925
You jerks! - Hey!

923
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:05,467
What are you doing? - Bring it on!

924
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:06,592
Hey. - Stop!

925
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:07,967
This jerk... - Stop.

926
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:09,467
Darn it.

927
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:11,883
You jerks!

928
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:16,342
Kill me.

929
00:49:16,883 --> 00:49:18,551
Just kill me!

930
00:49:32,676 --> 00:49:33,592
Goodness.

931
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:34,592
My gosh!

932
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:36,050
What are you doing?

933
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Why are you watching TV here?

934
00:49:37,925 --> 00:49:39,342
Don't you have a TV?

935
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:42,759
I'm too nervous to watch it alone.

936
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:44,467
Today's the day, right?

937
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,009
You acted like you were

938
00:49:47,092 --> 00:49:48,217
Yoon Hee's best friend,

939
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,800
but it was one-sided.

940
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:51,551
See? When it comes to land and money,

941
00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:53,092
friendship doesn't matter.

942
00:49:53,342 --> 00:49:55,800
Fine, I agree. You were right.

943
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,634
I learned a lot from this.

944
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,800
You shouldn't be kind to just anyone.

945
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:03,009
That's why I came back

946
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:04,092
to my old stomping ground.

947
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,259
Please be quiet. - Include me.

948
00:50:06,426 --> 00:50:07,467
Oh, sorry.

949
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:08,842
The news is about to start.

950
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,134
Raise the volume.

951
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:11,925
Okay!

952
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,050
A large-scale development plan

953
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:16,551
for a new town in Cheonsu District

954
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:18,050
has just been announced.

955
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,967
Here's the Minister of Land.

956
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:22,509
Hello.

957
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:24,800
I'm Minister Kim Ki Song.

958
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:26,800
Today, I'd like to...

959
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:35,925
I did it! - My gosh!

960
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:38,217
Yes! - Hurrah!

961
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:45,342
Time to celebrate!

962
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:47,718
Yes! - Let's celebrate!

963
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:49,217
Let's open this.

964
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,342
Hey! Do you know what this is?

965
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:55,009
Russo-Baltique Vodka!

966
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,050
What? - It's vodka!

967
00:50:57,509 --> 00:51:00,967
It costs 1.3 billion won a bottle!

968
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:05,592
Mum! We should drink stuff like this

969
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:06,842
now that we're filthy rich!

970
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:12,092
We're filthy rich! - Yes!

971
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:17,759
I'm super rich now!

972
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:21,467
All the relevant industries

973
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:22,676
can't hide their excitement

974
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:24,092
over this unexpected announcement.

975
00:51:24,426 --> 00:51:25,842
Cheonsu District, which was

976
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:27,467
selected for the development,

977
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,509
has been known as... - I own 70 percent.

978
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:31,925
There were many speculations

979
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,092
and expectations.

980
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:35,718
Everything's perfect now. - This news

981
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,175
came as a shock as a redevelopment

982
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:40,300
in the area seemed unlikely.

983
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:42,676
The pre-construction consulting results

984
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:43,676
also came out today.

985
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:45,426
The government plans to change

986
00:51:45,509 --> 00:51:46,883
the permitted use of the land

987
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:47,967
and had the firm

988
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,759
examine deregulation as well.

989
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,467
After this major redevelopment,

990
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:54,050
Cheonsu District will become

991
00:51:54,134 --> 00:51:55,551
the new centre of Gangnam.

992
00:51:55,842 --> 00:51:58,092
The government plans to build a new city

993
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,925
with residential and commercial areas.

994
00:52:00,175 --> 00:52:02,718
It'll be a new leader - Leave a message...

995
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,967
in the 21st century.

996
00:52:04,342 --> 00:52:06,925
The value of the real estate in the area

997
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,175
is expected to skyrocket

998
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,342
due to this announcement.

999
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:12,384
We expect many people will be interested,

1000
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:14,175
so we'll keep updating you

1001
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:16,300
as we receive more information.

1002
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:22,175
What's up?

1003
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,718
We have no reason to see each other.

1004
00:52:25,426 --> 00:52:27,634
Who knew you'd actually end up

1005
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,718
helping me?

1006
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:37,592
What are you trying to say?

1007
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:40,175
I'm in a good mood for a change,

1008
00:52:40,426 --> 00:52:41,634
so I don't want to ruin it.

1009
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:44,384
If you just need someone to talk to,

1010
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:47,050
go see your friend in the kitchen.

1011
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,925
I suppose you weren't confident

1012
00:52:50,092 --> 00:52:52,634
about the redevelopment either,

1013
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:55,217
seeing how you cancelled the contract

1014
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:56,925
the day before the announcement.

1015
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:02,050
I cancelled the contract?

1016
00:53:02,509 --> 00:53:03,676
You didn't know?

1017
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:07,467
Na Ae Gyo notified me last night

1018
00:53:07,842 --> 00:53:10,259
that she was cancelling the contract.

1019
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,967
I know you really wanted the property.

1020
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:14,467
So I came to ask

1021
00:53:14,551 --> 00:53:15,800
why you suddenly changed your mind.

1022
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:18,300
What the heck are you talking about?

1023
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:24,800
She said she needed the money urgently.

1024
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:26,259
She seemed desperate,

1025
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:27,883
so I even let go of the penalty.

1026
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:31,759
Although it all worked out for me

1027
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,217
because they suddenly

1028
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,259
announced the development plan.

1029
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:37,676
She can't cancel it without my permission.

1030
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,259
I never cancelled it.

1031
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:40,509
Does that mean

1032
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,842
Na Ae Gyo deceived you?

1033
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:58,509
You must've trusted her a lot.

1034
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,676
Enough to bet your all.

1035
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:04,134
This was very unlike you.

1036
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:15,883
Please leave your message

1037

My money.

1039
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:20,092
How dare she run off with my money?

1040
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,509
I will kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

1041
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,342
Did you locate her?

1042
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,759
She's at the real estate agency

1043
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,634
in Cheonsu District.

1044
00:54:42,842 --> 00:54:44,634
I told the guards to keep her there.

What the heck did you do?

1050
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:18,300
How dare you sell my land

1051
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:19,759
without my permission?

1052
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,384
Why is it your land?

1053

They're in my name,

Are you finally showing your true colours?

1057
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:33,175
You really have been trying to betray me

1058
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:34,217
for the past two years.

1059
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:36,592
Have you lost your mind?

1060
00:55:36,883 --> 00:55:38,426
Why did you do this? Why?

1061
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,426
I trusted you.

1062
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:41,676

I couldn't just rely on you.

Where is my money?

1070
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,259
Idiot.

I didn't drink that much.

Yes.

I didn't kill anyone! - Stop it.

1200
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,925
Are you people out of your minds?

1201
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,759
Na Ae Gyo

1202
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:40,800
died last night.

1203
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,800
Ae Gyo died?

1204
01:07:45,259 --> 01:07:46,175
My gosh!

1205
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:47,467
Come with us.

1206
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:49,592
Hold on.

1207
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:52,175
Dan Tae, what's going on?

1208
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:53,925
You killed someone?

1209
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:55,467
You didn't, right? Talk to me!

1210
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:58,342
This man can't even kill a bug.

1211
01:07:58,426 --> 01:07:59,634
He has a soft heart.

1212
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:00,800
There must've been a mistake.

1213
01:08:00,842 --> 01:08:01,759
Let go!

1214
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,092
Then can you confirm where he was

1215
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:05,300
last night?

1216
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:07,009
You know

1217
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:08,842
that I came home early and went to sleep.

1218
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:10,175
Tell them.

1219
01:08:11,259 --> 01:08:12,634
We sleep in separate rooms,

1220
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:14,426
so I'm not too sure.

1221
01:08:14,718 --> 01:08:15,925
All I know is that

1222
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,009
he drank and got very upset last night.

1223
01:08:18,467 --> 01:08:22,009
Oh, right. He kept calling someone.

1224
01:08:22,592 --> 01:08:23,509
Who?

1225
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:26,342
He said it was someone named Na Ae Gyo.

1226
01:08:26,426 --> 01:08:27,967
Have you lost your mind?

1227
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:29,175
Let go of me!

1228
01:08:29,551 --> 01:08:31,092
I swear, I did not kill her.

1229
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,384
Bring evidence!

1230
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:33,925
Until you do, I won't even budge.

1231
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,009
Bring Secretary Cho.

1232
01:08:35,092 --> 01:08:36,634
Get my lawyer!

1233
01:08:36,718 --> 01:08:37,718
Darn it.

1234
01:08:37,883 --> 01:08:39,384
We found these in the fireplace.

1235
01:08:40,592 --> 01:08:41,551
My gosh!

1236
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:42,842
A partially burned glove, raincoat,

1237
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:43,967
and shoes.

1238
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:46,467
Take them as evidence. - Yes, sir.

1239
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:47,467
It wasn't me.

1240
01:08:47,551 --> 01:08:48,842
I've never even seen those before!

1241
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,842
It wasn't me! - This morning, I saw

1242
01:08:51,175 --> 01:08:52,925
muddy footprints by the door

1243
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:54,467
and thought it was odd.

1244
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,800
Dan Tae, did you really kill that woman?

1245
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,967
You killed your kids' biological mother?

1246
01:09:03,259 --> 01:09:04,259
How do you know

1247
01:09:05,883 --> 01:09:06,883
who Ae Gyo is?

1248
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,300
Take him.

1249
01:09:12,676 --> 01:09:14,426
"Detective"

1250
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:35,175
"Gangnam Police Station"

1251
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,092
"Gangnam Police Station"

1252
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,676
Your car was clearly caught on camera

1253
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:53,384
in front of the warehouse

1254
01:09:53,467 --> 01:09:54,384
and the crematorium.

1255
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:56,676
You ran over the victim and killed her.

1256
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,676
Then you burned her at the crematorium.

1257
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:00,592
The owner of the crematorium has confessed

1258
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:02,092
to accepting money from you

1259
01:10:02,551 --> 01:10:03,800
in return for letting you use it

1260
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:04,883
anonymously.

1261
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:09,384
I swear, I did no such thing.

1262
01:10:09,759 --> 01:10:11,426
Gosh, this is really insane.

1263
01:10:12,259 --> 01:10:13,925
Last night, I had a few drinks

1264
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,551
and fell asleep in my room.

1265
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,050
I didn't even go outside.

1266
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:18,842
So how could I have killed someone?

1267
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:20,467
If you don't believe me,

1268
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:21,800
ask my wife, Cheon Seo Jin.

1269
01:10:21,883 --> 01:10:24,342
She already said she can't confirm that.

1270
01:10:24,426 --> 01:10:25,426
What? What did you say?

1271
01:10:27,759 --> 01:10:29,592
She's lying.

1272
01:10:29,676 --> 01:10:31,134
I'm innocent.

1273
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,800
You people are falling

1274
01:10:32,842 --> 01:10:34,050
for a ridiculous ploy here.

1275
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:35,175
I swear.

1276
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:36,718
I did not go to the warehouse

1277
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,676
or the crematorium.

1278
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,134
If you don't believe me,

1279
01:10:39,217 --> 01:10:40,676
check the cameras at Hera Palace.

1280
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:42,676
See if I left the building last night.

1281
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:44,426
What time did you discover

1282
01:10:44,509 --> 01:10:45,467
the muddy footprints

1283
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:46,759
by the door?

1284
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,134
I noticed them when I went

1285
01:10:48,217 --> 01:10:49,259
to get the newspapers,

1286
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:52,883
so it must've been around 5 a.m.

1287
01:10:53,718 --> 01:10:55,759
That means he did step out at night.

1288
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:57,467
The strange thing is,

1289
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,217
there's no record of him

1290
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,300
leaving the building after 8 p.m.

1291
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:03,800
in any of the security footage here.

1292
01:11:05,634 --> 01:11:08,342
Is there another way out?

1293
01:11:14,384 --> 01:11:15,426
This is a murder case.

1294
01:11:16,426 --> 01:11:17,759
You have to tell us the truth.

1295
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,551
What's this room for?

1296
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:38,342
This is where he punishes his kids.

1297
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:40,551
We got married recently,

1298
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:42,676
so I only found out a little while ago.

1299
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,092
Photograph everything.

1300
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:46,551
Yes, sir.

1301
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:48,925
And this is...

1302
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,509
how you can leave the building

1303
01:11:51,592 --> 01:11:53,217
without passing the fountain.

1304
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:55,384
There's an elevator that leads

1305
01:11:55,467 --> 01:11:56,676
directly to the car park.

1306
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,551
It means he may have used this passage

1307
01:11:59,676 --> 01:12:00,883
last night.

1308
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,925
Call Captain.

1309
01:12:06,009 --> 01:12:07,009
Tell him about this secret passage.

1310
01:12:07,134 --> 01:12:08,092
Yes, sir.

1311
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,634
He may have hidden important clues,

1312
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,800
so search everything.

1313
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,676
There's something in here.

1314
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:18,300
"Detective"

1315
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:19,342
It's an urn.

1316
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,509
My gosh, I can't believe this!

1317
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,509
Send it to the NFS right away.

1318
01:12:24,634 --> 01:12:26,759
Find out if there's any DNA left. Hurry.

1319
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,800
Yes, sir. - My gosh.

1320
01:12:31,925 --> 01:12:32,842
Hey.

1321
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:34,592
I see.

1322
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,217
They found

1323
01:12:40,259 --> 01:12:41,676
human ashes in your study.

1324
01:12:43,342 --> 01:12:44,384
Human ashes?

1325
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:47,551
What is this ridiculous nonsense?

1326
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:49,592
Why would there be ashes in my home?

1327
01:12:51,092 --> 01:12:52,883
I heard you said you'd kill Na Ae Gyo.

1328
01:12:53,426 --> 01:12:54,342
We have a witness.

1329
01:12:57,092 --> 01:12:58,718
A witness?

1330
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,842
I slept all night.

1331
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:01,259
Who saw me? Where?

1332
01:13:01,718 --> 01:13:02,883
I'm a witness.

1333
01:13:06,342 --> 01:13:07,883
I heard him say

1334
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,634
that he'd kill Na Ae Gyo.

1335
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:11,009
I heard it clearly.

1336
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:12,800
Oh Yoon Hee?

1337
01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:20,759
What is this insane gibberish about?

1338
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:26,342
I met with him yesterday afternoon

1339
01:13:26,426 --> 01:13:27,634
in his penthouse.

1340
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:31,426
He was very angry at Na Ae Gyo.

1341
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,426
The look in his eyes was so terrifying

1342
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:36,883
that I recorded it just in case.

1343
01:13:39,592 --> 01:13:40,467
My money.

1344
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:41,800
How dare she run off with my money?

1345
01:13:42,634 --> 01:13:44,092
I will kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

1346
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:47,217
So there's a clear motive,

1347
01:13:47,634 --> 01:13:49,259
and all the circumstances point to you.

1348
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,050
Will you still deny it, Mr. Joo?

1349
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,342
Oh Yoon Hee.

1350
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,800
How dare you...

1351
01:14:02,426 --> 01:14:04,050
"Police"

1352
01:14:08,718 --> 01:14:09,800
Search thoroughly.

1353
01:14:09,925 --> 01:14:10,883
Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1354
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:33,009
Hey, move this.

1355
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,300
I'm sorry! Please don't kill me.

1356
01:15:00,592 --> 01:15:01,925
It's okay. We're the police.

1357
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:04,592
It's okay. We're the police.

1358
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:12,134
What is your name?

1359
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:16,800
I'm...

1360
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:18,759
I'm Sim Soo Ryeon.

1361
01:15:21,009 --> 01:15:23,050
You've been locked up in here?

1362
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:25,175
Joo Dan Tae...

1363
01:15:26,384 --> 01:15:27,842
He locked me in here.

1364
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:32,300
How long have you been here?

1365
01:15:36,384 --> 01:15:37,759
What's the date today?

1366
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:55,050

Who's alive?

1369
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:12,300
Sim Soo Ryeon! She's back.

1370
01:16:12,384 --> 01:16:13,217
It's payback.

What did we do wrong?

I want a divorce right away.

Don't leave me ever again.

1381
01:16:30,009 --> 01:16:30,967
because you're a mother.
