Did you have the necklace analysed?

7
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, Bae Ro Na's blood was found.

8
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:24,500
It was exactly the same

9
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:26,000
as her DNA we got at her house.

10
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,417
Ro Na's bloodstain was found

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,292
on Eun Byeol's necklace?

12
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,626
Things are looking very interesting.

13
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:39,275
Right. When's her funeral?

14
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:40,359
Today.

Who'll be there?

16
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,275
Ms. Oh didn't tell anyone about it.

17
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:45,885
I believe only her husband,

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,067
Mr. Ha, will be there.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,317
It looks like her parents

20
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,734
never gained people's favour.

21
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:54,734
It'll be one lonely funeral.

I said today is Ro Na's funeral.

I told you not to call me today.

27

Yoon Chul, Eun Byeol is...

28
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,734
Eun Byeol!

29
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:26,818
You need to come home now!

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,859
Get out! - What?

31
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,442
What about her? - Eun Byeol.

Mum!

33
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:33,359
Hurry up and come.

You need to come now!

Eun Byeol.

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,275
Eun Byeol, no. Eun Byeol!

37
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,150
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

38
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,067
There's an emergency at the headquarters.

39
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:04,900

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,818
Let go!

46
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,067
I want to be with Ro Na.

47
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,275
I can't let my daughter be all alone.

48
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,942
Did I save you so you could do this?

49
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,501
Please let me punish myself.

50
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,875
Sure, but before you die,

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,484
you need to find out

52
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:00,651
who did this to Ro Na!

53
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:02,734
The real culprit

54
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:04,900
is someone else.

55
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,025
The real culprit?

56
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:09,442
Who is it?

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,818
Ha Eun Byeol.

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,734
And she has

59
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:19,776
Cheon Seo Jin behind her.

60
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,734
Get lost. Get out of here! - Eun Byeol!

61
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:24,275
Eun Byeol.

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,275
Eun Byeol.

63
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,692
What's wrong?

64
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:27,818
Get lost!

65
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,150
Eun Byeol.

66
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:31,567
Eun Byeol, no! Eun Byeol!

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,025
Get lost!

68
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,150
Eun Byeol!

69
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,234
Eun Byeol, I'm right here.

70
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:41,609
Pull yourself together, please!

71
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:45,526
Mum. Ro Na is over there.

72
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:46,983
Over there.

73
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,109
No.

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,567
Ro Na is dead!

75
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,025
She can't come back!

76
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,859
How many times do I have to tell you?

77
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
No! Over there!

78
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,275
Ro Na is right there.

79
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,067
Please, don't come.

80
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:12,983
Eun Byeol! - Stop!

81
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,109
Please...

82
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:19,609
Eun Byeol.

83
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:23,317
Eun Byeol.

84
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,150
Eun Byeol.

85
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,983
Dad.

86
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:33,567
Eun Byeol.

87
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:34,651
Eun Byeol, it's okay.

88
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,317
It's okay, sweetheart.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,275
Please help me, Dad.

90
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,609
I'm scared to death.

91
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:44,942
I keep seeing Ro Na.

92
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,983
She keeps telling me to go die.

93
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:52,942
That laughter.

94
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:56,983
Eun Byeol...

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,567
What am I going to do with you?

96
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,234
Please cut her out from my head, Dad.

97
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:14,109
You're a doctor.

98
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:18,651
Please get Ro Na out of my head!

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,734
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

100
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,317
No. Eun Byeol!

101
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,734
Please help me, Dad.

102
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,651
I really want to sleep.

103
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,025
I'll save you, Eun Byeol.

104
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:39,526
Trust me.

105
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,275
I'll do whatever it takes

106
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:43,609
to erase your memory.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,484
Dad...

108
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:51,234
Dad. Dad.

109
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,734
Pull yourself together, Yoon Hee!

110
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,109
Will you go down like this?

111
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:00,900
Are you sure

112
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,234
it was Eun Byeol?

113
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,484
You need to live and see for yourself.

114
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:06,983
No.

115
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,150
I don't want to know.

116
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,442
What can I do at this point?

117
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,317
Ro Na wouldn't have died

118
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,109
if I hadn't returned to get my revenge.

119
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,776
Getting revenge doesn't mean anything.

120
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,150
Why did you let her come back here?

121
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,317
You should've stopped her!

122
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:28,484
You should've held her down!

123
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,484
You really don't know why she came back?

124
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,609
She asked me

125
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,317
for a favour.

126
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,275
Please let me go back to Korea.

127
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,442
You can't. It's too dangerous there.

128
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,734
I want to make

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,942
Seol A's dream come true.

130
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,442
I'll make sure I win the trophy

131
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,692
for Cheonga Arts Festival.

132
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:53,359
Then Seol A...

133
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,192
will forgive my mum a little, right?

134
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,109
Why did you do that, Ro Na?

135
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,275
Why did you do that for me?

136
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,818
Why did you do that for me?

137
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:12,150
Why did you do that because of me, Ro Na?

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,526
Do you still wish to die?

139
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:16,859
My poor, poor daughter.

140
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,942
My daughter! - If you really want to die,

141
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:22,192
Ro Na, I'm sorry. - then just die.

142
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,334
If you're going to be broken,

143
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,900
devastated and hopeless,

144
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,776
then you should just die as they want.

145
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,609
But you must remember this.

146
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:31,067
Yoon Chul is

147
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,234
also involved with Ro Na's death.

148
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:40,609
Wait.

149
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,109
What did you just say?

150
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,025
Did you just mention Yoon Chul?

151
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:49,983
Nonsense.

152
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,567
You must have the wrong information.

153
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,983
He wouldn't do that.

154
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:53,942
Yoon Chul is

155
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,192
with Eun Byeol right now.

156
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,818
He knows his daughter did this.

157
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,400
What?

158
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,025
If you want your daughter's murderer

159
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,567
to live a happy life,

160
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,025
do as you wish.

161
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,776
No.

162
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,651
Yoon Chul wouldn't...

163
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,025
Yoon Chul wouldn't do that.

164
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,609
No, no! It can't be true!

165
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,859
Yoon Chul wouldn't do that!

166
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,942
That's the only way.

167
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,359
Eun Byeol wants it too.

168
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:43,818
There might be side effects.

169
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,234
There might not be.

170
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,275
Eun Byeol is

171
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,400
only 19.

172
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:52,567
She still has many more days to live,

173
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,859
as many as the stars in the sky.

174
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:57,442
We can't let her

175
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,900
be tortured for the rest of her life.

176
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:03,942
We can't do that.

177
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:06,900
Right.

178
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:08,983
I'm sure it'll be fine.

179
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,900
It'll be fine.

180
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:22,818
Please don't let Ro Na be lonely

181
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:24,983
as she passes to the other side.

182
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,025
I ask of you.

183
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,609
I'll wait.

184
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,109
"Yoon Hee"

185
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:19,651
Who are you?

186
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:27,692
Sim Soo Ryeon?

187
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,400
How have you been?

188
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:47,442
It's been a while,

189
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,317
Joo Dan Tae.

190
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,526
What are you doing?

191
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,109
You're always aggressive

192
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,442
when you're happy to see me.

193
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,275
Na Ae Gyo?

194
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:07,400
Zip me up.

195
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:12,818
Why?

196
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:15,900
Did you think Soo Ryeon came back alive?

197
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:19,942
Are you surprised, my dear Dan Tae?

198
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,692
You're really surprised.

199
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,526
You're so cute.

200
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,192
What happened?

201
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,442
When did you get here?

202
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,109
I ran over here

203
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:38,025
as soon as I landed at the airport.

204
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,526
What do you think

205
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:42,526
of my surprise visit?

206
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,442
You're always full of surprises.

207
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,692
You should've told me you were coming.

208
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,317
I would've gone out to fetch you.

209
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,400
Fetch me? So tacky.

210
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,567
Don't you know I hate things like that?

211
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,067
I was stuck in that countryside

212
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:04,192
for two years,

213
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,942
and it was awfully hot and humid there.

214
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,484
That darned weather almost drove me crazy.

215
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,900
Then you should've come sooner.

216
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:18,526
Why did you keep putting up a fight?

217
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,442
If you didn't return by this month,

218
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,275
I was going to fly over myself.

219
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:25,734
Sim Soo Ryeon

220
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:27,567
died.

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,859
It felt kind of weird.

222
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,192
As if...

223
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,192
it was my death.

224
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,400
You're right.

225
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,025
I can see why.

226
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:46,900
You lived half of your life as Soo Ryeon.

227
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,609
Did you run into anyone?

228
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,734
Your helpers all went out.

229
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:54,942
They're coming back after 3 p.m.

230
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,359
The penthouse.

231
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,900
This place is insane.

232
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,859
How much is all this anyway?

233
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,109
A rough estimate of things just here...

234
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,692
Gosh, it'd be about a billion won.

235
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:18,776
Soo Ryeon was one lucky woman.

236
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:23,109
She enjoyed this luxury all of her life.

237
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:27,567
But what good is that?

238
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,609
It's over once you kick the bucket.

239
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:35,692
You can't stay here.

240
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:36,942
My kids will be here soon,

241
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,734
and you shouldn't run into the residents.

242
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
So let's go out and talk.

243
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:41,900
Why should I care?

244
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,526
Weren't they going to find out anyway?

245
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,067
That I am

246
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,359
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung's real mother.

247
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:56,692
Then why did you want me back here?

248
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,526
I haven't told our kids yet.

249
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,983
This is an important time,

250
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:02,192
so they'll need time to take this in.

251
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,942
Darn it. Why do they need more time?

252
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:07,317
I'm not going to raise them anyway.

253
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,150
What I want is this penthouse,

254
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:12,567
not the life as their mother!

255
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:17,025
I put on those droopy dresses,

256
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,942
drinking expensive but tasteless wine,

257
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,109
living as Soo Ryeon for what...

258
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:25,484
For the last 20 years!

259
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,526
Then don't I deserve to enjoy this now?

260
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,275
Hello, I'm Sim Soo Ryeon.

261
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:39,275
My late father told me a lot about you.

262
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,818
You have a long history

263
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,526
with Simwoon Construction.

264
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:46,859
I'm so sick of this.

265
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,109
You told me you'll let me live here

266
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,359
as Na Ae Gyo from now on!

267
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,359
We're going to do that. We will.

268
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,776
Give me a little more time

269
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:55,818
until everything is settled.

270
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:58,734
How can I trust you?

271
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,234
It's still undergoing clinical trials,

272
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,651
but the drug can erase recent memory

273
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,234
that could possibly be traumatic.

274
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,859
What are the side effects?

275
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,651
She might have a seizure during injection,

276
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:17,983
or her memories

277
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:19,484
may get distorted after she wakes up.

278
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,692
In the worst case,

279
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,900
she might lose all her memories.

280
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,025
Eun Byeol has...

281
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,275
always been a lucky girl.

282
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,942
Please get started.

283
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,109
"Yoon Hee"

284
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,234
"Yoon Hee"

285
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,692
Your call cannot be connected.

286
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,150
You'll be redirected to voicemail.

287
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,609
Ro Na, wait for me.

288
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,400
Wait... - Ro Na. Ro Na!

289
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,983
Let's go.

290
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,025
Get your hands off my daughter!

291
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,192
Ro Na.

292
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,776
If you try to hurt Ro Na one more time,

293
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,484
I will sue you all.

294
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:49,692
No.

295
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,859
He couldn't have.

296
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,692
Yoon Chul isn't that evil.

297
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:58,454
Logan must be mistaken.

298
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,592
He'll come. Yoon Chul will come.

299
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:16,134
Eun Byeol.

300
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,426
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

301
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:19,800
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

302
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:20,925
What's going on?

303
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:21,925
Did something go wrong?

304
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,718
Eun Byeol! Stay calm. - Step back.

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,925
Eun Byeol! No!

306
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,259
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol.

307
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:28,426
I'm right here.

308
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:29,551
Eun Byeol!

309
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,551
Eun Byeol. Oh, no.

310
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,676
"Inducing REM sleep"

311
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:45,759
The drug went in too quickly,

312
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:47,634
so she went into shock.

313
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,925
I injected a sedative.

314
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:51,842
She'll be fine now.

315
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,676
"Yoon Hee"

316
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,509
"Yoon Hee"

317
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,883
Our goal wasn't just a building

318
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,467
like Hera Palace, only 100 floors tall.

319
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,759
A taller and more extravagant penthouse

320
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,009
will be built very soon

321
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,467
in Cheonsu District.

322
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:21,967
Did you get the development right?

323
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,592
The land compensation

324
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:26,759
will be astronomical.

325
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:27,967
That's not a problem.

326
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,551
I got something huge on Cheon Seo Jin.

327
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:32,800
Like a weakness?

328
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:37,759
A woman like her actually has a weakness?

329
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,800
That's very interesting.

330
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,259
What is it?

331
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,800
Her daughter killed this kid,

332
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,384
and she's the daughter of the woman

333
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,759
who loathes Seo Jin the most.

334
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Well, Seo Jin hates her too.

335
00:18:58,342 --> 00:18:59,259
She killed someone?

336
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,925
No matter how wicked Seo Jin is,

337
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,342
she won't last, when her daughter

338
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,676
is about to be imprisoned.

339
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,634
It's my chance

340
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:11,759
to take over the entire Cheonga Group.

341
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:13,759
Cheonga will be ours.

342
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:15,551
Really?

343
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,967
Is Joo Dan Tae Village

344
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,259
finally coming together?

345
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,342
Be careful not to get caught until then.

346
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,800
Once people find out about you,

347
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:25,883
our plans may come to nothing.

348
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,718
I'm totally looking forward to this.

349
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:33,009
A penthouse in Cheonsu District?

350
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,842
Gosh, just the thought of it...

351
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,217
You know that it's mine, right?

352
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:44,426
So don't get so whiny,

353
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:45,592
and do as I say.

354
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,800
You waited your whole life for this.

355
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,342
A day you'll live in the penthouse

356
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,467
with Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

357
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:56,009
Right?

358
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,800
It's great

359
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,883
to feel your breath after a long time.

360
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:09,259
That must be the kids.

361
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:10,842
Do you want to see them from a distance?

362
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,384
No. I don't need to see them.

363
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:15,342
I lived a good life without seeing them.

364
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,718
I'm not attached to them anyway.

365
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:21,300
This way.

366
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:26,009
Don't you have a private lesson today?

367
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:27,092
Are you skipping it?

368
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,676
What's wrong?

369
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:30,050
I'm not going.

370
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:31,967
I can't believe you.

371
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
The lady first.

372
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,718
Do you like it?

373
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,342
"Bae Ro Na, April 8, 2004 - April 3, 2022"

374
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,009
"Become a bright star in the sky"

375
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:51,426
Ms. Oh.

376
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:52,551
Who was it?

377
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,426
Who bribed you on that day?

378
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,967
Please don't do this.

379
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:58,509
Please show me mercy.

380
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:00,134
I'm so sorry.

381
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,342
Who was it? I'm asking you. Who was it?

382
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:05,883
I...

383
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,592
"Ha Yoon Chul"

384
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,259
"Ha Yoon Chul"

385
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,676
Ha Yoon Chul.

386
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:21,925
"Ha Yoon Chul"

387
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:31,384
"Contacts"

388
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,342
"Logan Lee"

389
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,718
Ha Yoon Chul.

390
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,050
Where is that scumbag right now?

391
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,217
You should get some sleep.

392
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,009
You haven't slept for a second.

393
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Eun Byeol will

394
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,217
wake up without a problem, right?

395
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:03,384
Without all those bad memories.

396
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,883
She will.

397
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,342
I couldn't have held out

398
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,592
if you weren't here.

399
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:14,800
I realised this

400
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:16,858
as I saw you worry about her

401
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:18,175
and did everything you could for her.

402
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:23,384
Both Eun Byeol

403
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:26,217
and I...

404
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:28,925
need you.

405
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:38,800
"Cheonga Medical Centre"

406
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,718
"Cheonga Medical Centre"

407
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,009
But you must remember this.

408
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:02,634
Yoon Chul is

409
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:04,426
also involved with Ro Na's death.

410
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,967
My daughter is dead,

411
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:20,092
but were you busy trying to save your girl

412
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,009
from becoming a murderer?

413
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,883
Your daughter killed my daughter!

414
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,718
Do you pity that murderer that much?

415
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,842
Even more than my dead girl?

416
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,134
Why should your daughter be happy?

417
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,467
She has no right to be happy.

418
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:33,800
No. - Yoon Hee. No, Yoon Hee!

419
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:35,592
No!

420
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,551
Seok Hoon.

421
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,467
Is this really because of Ro Na?

422
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,800
You haven't eaten,

423
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,134
you won't say a word,

424
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,426
and you skipped all of your lessons.

425
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,842
It has been days already.

426
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:13,509
Don't you think you're overreacting?

427
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:15,509
Shut your mouth

428
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,009
if you feel bad for Ro Na at all.

429
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:21,551
Why should I feel bad?

430
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,467
The real criminal is someone else.

431
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:31,134
Because I know

432
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:32,718
who killed Ro Na.

433
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,317
She must be thrilled

434
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,551
now that her mortal enemy Ro Na is gone.

435
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:41,467
You're right.

436
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,308
It's who you think it is.

437
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Ha Eun Byeol.

438
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:48,842
Eun Byeol killed her.

439
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,509
Don't make an absurd claim without ground.

440
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,800
I pulled a little prank on her.

441
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,134
I told her that you love Ro Na a lot.

442
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,401
Then that girl suddenly went insane.

443
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:01,317
But still, how can she kill someone?

444
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,092
I could've never imagined.

445
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,134
What have you done, Seok Kyung?

446
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,092
Why did you do that? Why?

447
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:10,509
What did Ro Na...

448
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:13,509
What did Ro Na ever do?

449
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,967
Don't go.

450
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:37,551
Don't go to Yoon Hee.

451
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:42,509
I have to.

452
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,634
I wasn't at Ro Na's funeral.

453
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,467
It must be too tough to bear alone.

454
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:48,800
Isn't that more brutal for her?

455
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:53,050
Your daughter killed Yoon Hee's daughter.

456
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,275
But you're going to deceive her

457
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
and stay by her side?

458
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,259
Isn't that a true madness?

459
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,092
What would she say if she finds out?

460
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,592
She'll find you brazen and horrifying,

461
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,800
then end up ripping us into pieces.

462
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,842
What can we do?

463
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,300
If Yoon Hee tells us to go die,

464
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:18,925
we'll have to die.

465
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:21,092
Both you

466
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:22,800
and me.

467
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:43,883
Can we...

468
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,426
start over?

469
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:50,259
Are you crazy?

470
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:51,259
I know

471
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:53,718
how much I hurt you.

472
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:58,175 --> 00:27:59,384
I'm sorry to death.

474
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Please forgive me.

475
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:03,342
Please give me

476
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:05,509
just one more chance.

477
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,092
I'll be good to you for life.

478
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:09,883
Don't be delusional.

479
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:11,426
I'm not here

480
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:13,300
because I like you or pity you.

481
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,217
It's because I'm Eun Byeol's dad.

482
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,883
I had no choice because of her.

483
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,092
I'm not your man any more.

484
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:22,509
All I now think of is Yoon Hee.

485
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,942
It's over between you and Yoon Hee.

486
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:26,009
Don't you get it?

487
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,592
I'm not doing this just for myself.

488
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,967
It's for Eun Byeol's sake.

489
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,384
Once you change your mind,

490
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,883
we can have our family back.

491
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:37,384
We can be happy again.

492
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,175
We can be happy?

493
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:42,050
Do you think

494
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:44,759
we deserve anything of that sort?

495
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:51,592
Don't go.

496
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:55,467
Stop right there, Yoon Chul.

497
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,300
Don't go see Yoon Hee.

498
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,259
Don't go.

499
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,467
Darn it.

500
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,009
My goodness, Mr. Ha.

501
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,342
You thought of Ro Na like your own,

502
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:32,342
and she's now gone.

503
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:33,718
You must be really heartbroken.

504
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,050
When is her funeral?

505
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,175
Make sure you call me.

506
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:42,300
If anything, Kyu Jin will

507
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,384
send you the most expensive flowers.

508
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,551
You need some flowers from a politician

509
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,259
to make the funeral look important.

510
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:54,134
Goodness, my dear Yoon Hee.

511
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,342
How is she doing?

512
00:29:57,718 --> 00:29:58,800
You seem drunk.

513
00:29:59,009 --> 00:29:59,967
You should go home.

514
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,759
But you know,

515
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,134
no matter how much I think of this,

516
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:08,467
I don't think the one who killed Ro Na

517
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,259
couldn't have been Mr. Park.

518
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:14,509
Min Hyuk told me that

519
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,967
he really adored Ro Na.

520
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,509
Mr. Park did, I mean.

521
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,551
The case is closed already.

522
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:23,300
The culprit made a confession.

523
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:25,883
You're right, man.

524
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:28,175
The culprit confessed, darn it.

525
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:32,967
But you know,

526
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:36,925
back when Min Seol A died,

527
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,925
everyone said she killed herself,

528
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:40,592
but only Kyu Jin said

529
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,925
she was murdered.

530
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,384
And once again,

531
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:48,467
the culprit might be someone

532
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:49,925
who lives in Hera Palace.

533
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,092
Quiet.

534
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:58,050
Darn it.

535
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,092
Cheon Seo Jin.

536
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:08,259
It wasn't her, was it?

537
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:11,217
Since you remarried Yoon Hee,

538
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:12,800
she could've become furious

539
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:14,342
and pushed off Ro Na like that!

540
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:15,718
You jerk!

541
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:21,009
If you got drunk, go home and just sleep.

542
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,092
Stop talking nonsense out here.

543
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:54,800
The phone is turned off.

544
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,634
You'll be redirected to voicemail,

545
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,842
and you'll be charged after the beep.

546
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:13,592
You're up.

547
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,134
Are you all right?

548
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:18,050
You talked nonsense

549
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,759
and was ill all night long.

550
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,800
If you're that weak,

551
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:26,967
how can you fight against

552
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,217
Cheon Seo Jin and Joo Dan Tae?

553
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:31,634
You'll have to fight Ha Yoon Chul too.

554
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:33,842
How much do you know

555
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:35,842
about Ro Na's death?

556
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:39,676
Tell me what I don't know.

557
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,967
"Assisi"

558
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:47,259
This is what

559
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,858
Cheon Seo Jin and Ha Eun Byeol did

560
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,925
on the day of the incident.

561
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,718
I'm sure

562
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,676
Eun Byeol's dress was in that bag.

563
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:00,175
I checked the dress myself.

564
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,509
There was nothing on it.

565
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,426
It took a lot of work to find this.

566
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:08,025
I searched through

567
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,551
every dress shop in Seoul to find this.

568
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:16,092
She had the same dress

569
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:18,800
tailor-made at another dress shop.

570
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:28,634
Then who set off the fire alarm?

571
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,676
Was that Seo Jin too?

572
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:34,175
Or...

573
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:37,842
was it Ha Yoon Chul?

574
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,984
According to our investigation thus far,

575
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:41,327
it wasn't them.

576
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,842
The time and their location don't match.

577
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:47,109
Then did it really malfunction or what?

578
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:48,491
At that time of all days?

579
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,734
I'm sure she put someone up for it,

580
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:51,800
Mr. Do or whoever else!

581
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:54,967
She did it to destroy the evidence.

582
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:56,676
We only have presumptions

583
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:58,009
without hard evidence.

584
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:00,634
I'm going to kill you, Seo Jin.

585
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:03,426
Yoon Chul, Eun Byeol, I'll kill you all!

586
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:08,551
Ms. Oh!

587
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,509
You shouldn't move around yet.

588
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:11,718
I don't care.

589
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,734
I'll kill them,

590
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,050
then I'll die too.

591
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,217
I don't want to live anymore,

592
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,551
not even for a minute or a second!

593
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:20,300
It's horrifying to be alive

594
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:21,384
even as I speak.

595
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:22,592
You also

596
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:25,217
caused the death of someone else's kid.

597
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:26,651
If you're going to die,

598
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:28,300
you'd better pay back what you owe

599
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,009
to Soo Ryeon and Seol A.

600
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:32,759
Then you'd have a bit of clear conscience

601
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,384
when you meet Ro Na again.

602
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:38,050
What makes you this confident?

603
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:39,401
Your family sent her back

604
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:41,423
as soon as you took her bone marrow!

605
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,608
If you feel that bad for Seol A,

606
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:46,317
go punish your parents first!

607
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:47,300
Ms. Oh!

608
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:51,259
Please give us some privacy.

609
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,259
I have to return to the US.

610
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:00,509
Once I'm gone,

611
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,858
you're the only person who can get

612
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,009
Soo Ryeon and Seol A's revenge.

613
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,759
I killed Seol A.

614
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:20,342
I don't have any right to get her revenge!

615
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:22,925
What can I do anyway?

616
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:27,092
Find Na Ae Gyo.

617
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:28,551
The biological mother of the twins.

618
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,050
She knows all of Joo Dan Tae's secrets.

619
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,634
I'm Na Ae Gyo.

620
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:40,259
There's something I must tell you

621
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:41,300
before I leave.

622
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:44,883
Everything Dan Tae did to Soo Ryeon,

623
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,009
and what he's truly like.

624
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,134
Today might be the only chance

625
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:52,300
I can tell you this.

626
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:53,967
After that,

627
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:55,634
she disappeared.

628
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,842
This is... - That's Na Ae Gyo.

629
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,217
She looks exactly like Sim Soo Ryeon.

630
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:13,676
No way.

631
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,967
We must find this woman.

632
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,892
I've kept a close eye on Dan Tae every day

633
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,509
for the last two years,

634
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,217
but I was never able to find her.

635
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:23,842
She was recently seen again.

636
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:26,551
She came back last week from Thailand.

637
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:29,800
She'll be in contact with Joo Dan Tae.

638
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:45,600
What's going on?

639
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:47,600
I rarely see you awake at this hour,

640
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:48,725
let alone eat breakfast.

641
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,184
Maybe it's because it's a different bed.

642
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,392
I woke up early.

643
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:54,392
And I was quite hungry.

644
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:56,309
What brings you here so early?

645
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:58,476
There are some urgent matters.

646
00:36:58,809 --> 00:36:59,892
I need to sell the buildings in Gangnam

647
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:00,975
under your name.

648
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:01,975
I need cash.

649
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,075
There are some great deals

650
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,059
in Cheonsu District.

651
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,809
I should buy them when they're still cheap

652
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,683
before the redevelopment is announced.

653
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,309
I see. Is that why

654
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,100
you hounded me to return to Korea quickly?

655
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,518
So you can sell my buildings?

656
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,226
No, of course not.

657
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,059
I missed you, more than anything.

658
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,351
I have to say,

659
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,934
you're looking great.

660
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,142
Are you that happy to be with Seo Jin?

661
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:41,518
You know that it's all for show.

662
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,642
You're the only woman

663
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:45,434
I'll ever love.

664
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:47,767
I see that your acting has improved.

665
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,309
How about a game? It's been a while.

666
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:11,518
You've got much better.

667
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:13,642
Is this all you did in Thailand?

668
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:16,600
You were no match for me to begin with.

669
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:19,725
Finish it up.

670
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:23,267
Mum.

671
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:26,440
Mum...

672
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:27,934
Eun Byeol.

673
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,309
I'm here.

674
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:30,725
Are you all right?

675
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Why did I sleep for so long?

676
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,434
Aren't I late for school?

677
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:38,518
You're in the hospital now.

678
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,100
Hospital?

679
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,767
Why am I here?

680
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:44,600
Oh...

681
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:47,100
You were sleep-deprived and burnt out.

682
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,767
You suddenly fainted.

683
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:52,017
I fainted? Really?

684
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,284
What's the date today?

685
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,184
I need to get ready for the Arts Festival.

686
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:01,642
It's already over.

687
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:03,059
What?

688
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,309
It's over? What do you mean?

689
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,767
I don't remember anything.

690
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,267
Then what about the grand prize?

691
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,518
Who won it?

692
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:16,934
The grand prize...

693
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,934
Ro Na won it.

694
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:23,267
Ro Na?

695
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,725
Are you serious?

696
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,059
I'm sorry, Mum.

697
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:36,850
You must be so angry at me.

698
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:40,476
Do you really

699
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:42,392
not remember anything?

700
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:46,600
Even the fact that Ro Na is dead?

701
00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:50,100
Why is Ro Na dead?

702
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:51,434
Why, all of a sudden?

703
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,767
Well...

704
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:58,600
There was an accident.

705
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,850
I'll fill you in on what happened.

706
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,059
Don't force yourself to remember things.

707
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,725
How come I don't remember anything?

708
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,017
Is something wrong with me?

709
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:14,476
I have midterms coming up.

710
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,850
The mock test is coming up too.

711
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:18,975
What if I bomb the exams?

712
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,600
I want to go home.

713
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:22,809
I have to study.

714
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:24,992
No, nothing's wrong with you.

715
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:26,326
You're okay, Eun Byeol.

716
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:27,725
You just need to rest at home.

717
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:31,309
It's all in the past.

718
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,226
Nothing happened, okay?

719
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:40,017
It's okay.

720
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,226
She really doesn't remember anything.

721
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,392
From singing at the festival

722
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:49,725
to Ro Na's death,

723
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,226
she remembers nothing.

724
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:53,642
There seem to be no side effects.

725
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:55,975
It's too early to relax.

726
00:40:56,476 --> 00:40:57,600
Keep an eye on her.

727
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,476
I'll take her home right away.

728
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,725
She'll feel more at ease at home.

729
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:05,226
You'll stop by...

730
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:09,309
to see Eun Byeol, right?

731
00:41:11,683 --> 00:41:12,683
I'll call you.

732
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,600
Where are you, Yoon Hee?

733
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,434
This is Hera Palace's lobby!

734
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,142
My, doesn't it look like

735
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:48,309
a luxury hotel somewhere abroad?

736
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,309
This fountain is Hera Palace's landmark.

737
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:54,725
You should take a picture here.

738
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:58,725
Mr. Lee is the only assemblyman

739
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,683
who lives in Hera Palace, right?

740
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,017
We worry about what others may think,

741
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,850
so we live in small rental apartments.

742
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,392
That is ridiculous.

743
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:08,767
Is it a crime to be wealthy?

744
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,518
An assemblyman should know

745
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,934
how to make money

746
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:15,934
and scam people when it's necessary.

747
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,434
If your own family is poor,

748
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,309
how will you run the government?

749
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:20,642
My point exactly.

750
00:42:21,017 --> 00:42:23,309
You don't get paid extra for being honest.

751
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,892
Right? Let's take a picture.

752
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,142
Stand right there.

753
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:30,975
All right. Kimchi, cheese.

754
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:32,809
Smile!

755
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:37,267
My gosh.

756
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:39,100
Sorry.

757
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:40,725
What's your problem?

758
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,635
I almost fell flat on my face!

759
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:44,850
Hey, do those ladies know

760
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,868
that someone died here?

761
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:50,017
Are you insane? What if they hear you?

762
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:52,850
How is it that

763
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:55,100
you're becoming more shameless by the day?

764
00:42:55,934 --> 00:42:57,309
Ro Na died recently.

765
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:58,434
I can't believe

766
00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:00,600
you're already bringing people here

767
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:01,892
to take pictures and laugh like that.

768
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:04,683
Your husband is an assemblyman.

769
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:07,100
You need to work on your character.

770
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:09,184
Gosh.

771
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,975
That woman... How dare she!

772
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:18,600
"Bodyscrub Waitlist"

773
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:21,309
Number three!

774
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,683
Coming!

775
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:31,975
My, it's so nice seeing you here.

776
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:35,309
I hear you give an amazing body scrub.

777
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:38,184
I came to see if your hands

778
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:39,434
are as fierce

779
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,059
as your mouth, Lady Jincheon.

780
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:44,059
Please lie down, ma'am.

781
00:43:51,683 --> 00:43:53,476
Ouch! That hurts.

782
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,142
Why are you scrubbing so hard?

783
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:56,975
Hey, woman.

784
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:59,017
Are you trying to skin me alive?

785
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:00,683
I'm sorry, ma'am.

786
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,059
I'll be gentle.

787
00:44:08,017 --> 00:44:09,017
That's so cold!

788
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,351
You can't even get the temperature right.

789
00:44:11,434 --> 00:44:12,934
How can you even make any money?

790
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:15,767
The water's hot.

791
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:18,267
Oh, that feels nice.

792
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,892
Lady Jincheon, clip my nails and toenails.

793
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,975
For the other ladies too.

794
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:27,117
That's not included

795
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,600
in the list of services.

796
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,642
I'll pay you 5,000 won more!

797
00:44:32,892 --> 00:44:34,392
What? You won't do it?

798
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,767
Is 5,000 won not real money?

799
00:44:38,438 --> 00:44:39,937
Are you too rich for that now?

800
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,683
Where's the owner?

801
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:46,559
Manage your employee better.

802
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,017
Get the owner in here!

803
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:56,850
Hi.

804
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:59,850
Which one of you old bags own this place?

805
00:45:00,392 --> 00:45:02,100
Who's the owner?

806
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,809
You need to train your employees better!

807
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:08,226
Madam Chairman, what brings you here?

808
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:10,600
"Madam Chairman"?

809
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:13,267
Chairman Song Hee Soo of Haeyeon Group.

810
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:15,351
This is Chairman Byun,

811
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:16,725
and this is Chairman Choi.

812
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:19,267
Get up and introduce yourself!

813
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:21,309
Haeyeon Group...

814
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,809
Ms. Song.

815
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,226
Ms. Kang. - Yes, ma'am.

816
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:32,642
Why accept such riffraff as customers

817
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:33,850
and ruin your ears?

818
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:36,100
This is my job, you know.

819
00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:37,850
It's fine, ma'am.

820
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:39,559
I'm not okay with this.

821
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:41,559
You're someone I cherish.

822
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,575
We're the only ones that can call you

823
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
"Lady Jincheon".

824
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:47,226
Who dares to mistreat Lady Jincheon?

825
00:45:48,142 --> 00:45:49,100
Who was it?

826
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,351
Also,

827
00:45:51,934 --> 00:45:53,392
I refuse to use the same water

828
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:54,351
as political jerks.

829
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,642
Replace the water in the tubs.

830
00:45:57,017 --> 00:45:58,100
Yes, ma'am.

831
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:00,600
Drain the tubs!

832
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,892
Okay!

833
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,809
How's my dear Je Ni doing?

834
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:07,559
She's doing great.

835
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:10,392
She's busy preparing for college.

836
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,100
I told you to call me

837
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:13,934
if anyone ever harasses you.

838
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:15,351
We'll go

839
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,267
trample all over them.

840
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:20,100
You keep too much to yourself.

841
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:21,642
You never ask for any favours.

842
00:46:23,224 --> 00:46:26,600
I'll make you some delicious iced coffee.

843
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:28,017
Let's go. This way.

844
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:29,892
Gosh, I'm still angry.

845
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:41,600
What is going on?

846
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:45,392
My gosh!

847
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,518
Honey!

848
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:56,725
It's me, Kyu Jin.

849
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:58,934
My gosh.

850
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:00,575
You must've had many clients.

851
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,017
You're all puffy.

852
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:03,434
You're totally...

853
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:14,017
Ma Ri.

854
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:17,642
You know that he's an obnoxious jerk.

855
00:47:17,892 --> 00:47:18,892
Please understand

856
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,351
with your magnanimous heart.

857
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:23,017
I could take you down with a single punch.

858
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,059
You little...

859
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,226
Has she lost her mind?

860
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:29,642
How dare she...

861
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,642
How dare you talk to Lady Kang that way?

862
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,934
"Lady Kang"?

863
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,975
Have you lost your mind?

864
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:37,600
Let go. Get off of me.

865
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:39,226
Hold it in.

866
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,159
Whatever it takes, just put up with her.

867
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:43,476
Just hold it all in, please!

868
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:46,975
She's way on top of us.

869
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:51,559
She's those powerful ladies' confidante.

870
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:53,184
What?

871
00:48:04,324 --> 00:48:05,593
How are you feeling?

872
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,559
Eun Byeol.

873
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,335
I haven't seen you since the festival.

874
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,934
What brings you by?

875
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,934
I came to see you

876
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:18,725
and Eun Byeol.

877
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:22,892
Eun Byeol, go to your room.

878
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:31,600
You didn't answer my calls.

879
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:34,392
Is something wrong?

880
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:37,017
Eun Byeol wasn't feeling well,

881
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:39,267
so I took her to the hospital for an IV.

882
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:43,767
Oh, you were at the hospital?

883
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,434
Right.

884
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,559
Don't forget that we're having lunch

885
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,975
with Assemblyman Lee tomorrow.

886
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,142
We are?

887
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,392
I forgot.

888
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:00,600
Can we reschedule?

889
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:02,059
If we do that,

890
00:49:02,142 --> 00:49:03,934
who knows what that bigmouth might say?

891
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:06,767
He still goes on about helping us get

892
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,226
the permit to build Cheonga Art Centre.

893
00:49:08,725 --> 00:49:10,392
I can't stand it.

894
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:12,351
It's just lunch,

895
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:13,518
so we'll make it quick.

896
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:15,309
Okay?

897
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:20,642
"Cheonga Arts High School"

898
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,725
I'll sing this song at the festival.

899
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:35,809
What do you think?

900
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,434
I think it will go well

901
00:49:41,518 --> 00:49:42,600
with your voice.

902
00:49:45,975 --> 00:49:47,934
I want to do a solo performance

903
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:49,975
at our graduation ceremony.

904
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:53,142
Will you be my accompanist?

905
00:49:55,518 --> 00:49:56,850
I never thought about it.

906
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:00,434
Promise me you'll do it.

907
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:02,017
Do it for me.

908
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:05,518
You will, right?

909
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:13,642
I'll think about it.

910
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:20,600
"Cheonga Arts High School"

911
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:44,518
There you are.

912
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,267
I can't believe

913
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,767
that Ro Na is dead.

914
00:50:54,975 --> 00:50:56,226
I know

915
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,892
who killed Ro Na.

916
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,100
Ha Eun Byeol.

917
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,975
She did it.

918
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:08,267
How are you feeling? Better?

919
00:51:10,392 --> 00:51:11,559
You even missed school,

920
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,809
so you must've been very ill.

921
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:15,309
Yes, I was in the hospital.

922
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,100
After the festival ended...

923
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,518
Where were you?

924
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,559
That day?

925
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,267
I was told I fainted at school because

926
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:26,434
I took too many sedatives.

927
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,226
Mr. Do found me and carried me home.

928
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:31,518
I remember nothing after that.

929
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:39,017
You were carried out?

930
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,184
Yes.

931
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,683
You didn't see Ro Na before the ceremony?

932
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,017
No, I didn't.

933
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,184
That's what I remember, at least.

934
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:57,100
You must be devastated by her death.

935
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,100
It's true that I hated her,

936
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:02,600
but I don't want

937
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:03,892
to be jealous of a dead girl.

938
00:52:04,725 --> 00:52:06,351
So grieve as much as you want.

939
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:17,309
Seok Hoon.

940
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:19,683
What's wrong?

941
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,518
Eun Byeol.

942
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:46,934
Will you go out with me?

943
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,518
What?

944
00:52:50,725 --> 00:52:51,725
Go out with me.

945
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
I think I really like you now.

946
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,683
Do you really mean

947
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,017
what you just said?

948
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,351
Here, cheers!

949
00:53:18,476 --> 00:53:19,600
Cheers!

950
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:21,934
Nothing beats drinking during the day.

951
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:23,226
Right, Chairman Joo?

952
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,059
Look at you slacking off

953
00:53:25,142 --> 00:53:26,309
so blatantly now.

954
00:53:26,518 --> 00:53:28,142
Why did you want to meet so early?

955
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,476
I have three appointments this evening.

956
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,434
I have to eat three dinners,

957
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:33,725
Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.

958
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,600
Gosh, I'm just too popular.

959
00:53:36,392 --> 00:53:37,392
Why are there

960
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,392
so many weddings and funerals in Korea?

961
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:41,017
I'm busy stopping by all of them.

962
00:53:42,017 --> 00:53:44,017
It's so nice to see you two.

963
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,892
We haven't done this in a while.

964
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:49,267
So much has happened at Hera Palace.

965
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:52,309
Why don't we start a separate group?

966
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,226
The others are way below our level.

967
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:55,767
The four of us are perfect,

968
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:56,934
don't you think?

969
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:01,059
Ms. Cheon, is something wrong?

970
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,559
You haven't touched any of the caviar.

971
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,184
No, nothing's wrong.

972
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:08,600
Then,

973
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,142
let's take a picture together.

974
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:15,392
I'm on social media now.

975
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,518
I'm thinking more people will follow me

976
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,184
if they see that I'm friends with you.

977
00:54:20,934 --> 00:54:23,100
All right, look here. - Ms. Cheon!

978
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:24,683
Make a V!

979
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,642
Nice!

980
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,518
This looks great.

981
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:29,642
It looks good, right?

982
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,059
I should post it right away.

983
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,351
Let's see.

984
00:54:36,392 --> 00:54:37,309
"Lunch with Soprano Cheon Seo Jin"

985
00:54:37,392 --> 00:54:40,600
Seo Jin, you're so popular!

986
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:42,975
I'm already getting a ton of comments.

987
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,017
What is this?

988
00:54:49,975 --> 00:54:50,892
Chairman Joo.

989
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,184
Is Seo Jin in some kind of trouble?

990
00:54:53,434 --> 00:54:54,600
What? What's wrong?

991
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:57,309
"Lunch with Soprano Cheon Seo Jin"

992
00:54:57,392 --> 00:54:58,683
"Fake Soprano Cheon Seo Jin"

993
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:03,351
Why? What's wrong?

994
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,351
What are they saying?

995
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,600
"Fake Soprano Cheon Seo Jin.

996
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:12,267
Liar Cheon Seo Jin.

997
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,892
Shocking lie"?

998
00:55:15,518 --> 00:55:16,642
What are they talking about?

999
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:28,059
The nation's most renowned prima donna,

1000
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:29,559
Soprano Cheon Seo Jin,

1001
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:31,700
allegedly hired a ghost singer

1002
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:33,909
for her 20th anniversary concert,

1003
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,242
which has left the country in shock.

1004
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,142
The news is not true at all.

1005
00:55:37,518 --> 00:55:39,476
We'll release an official statement soon.

1006
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,600
Are you saying... - Will she...

1007
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:42,392
The police have obtained evidence

1008
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:44,683
that Cheon paid a large sum of money

1009
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,100
to an amateur singer.

1010
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,992
Cheon hasn't released

1011
00:55:48,017 --> 00:55:49,809
an official statement yet.

1012
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:52,226
The public is criticising the prima donna

1013
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,600
for hiding and not taking responsibility.

1014
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,017
That's all for today.

1015
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,226
"Reporter Kim's Eye" seeks truth.

1016
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:59,767
A police investigation?

1017
00:56:00,184 --> 00:56:01,434
The media is keeping a close eye,

1018
00:56:01,642 --> 00:56:02,934
so she can't keep hiding.

1019
00:56:03,351 --> 00:56:05,725
Many Cheonga shareholders have called.

1020
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,309
They want her to step down at once.

1021
00:56:07,392 --> 00:56:08,767
That's not important right now!

1022
00:56:09,518 --> 00:56:10,784
Do whatever it takes

1023
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:11,683
to delay the investigation.

1024
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:13,767
Tell Attorney Park to come up with a plan.

1025
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:15,683
You two may leave now.

1026
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:16,725
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1027
00:56:22,892 --> 00:56:23,767
I'm sorry.

1028
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:25,892
This is all my fault.

1029
00:56:29,392 --> 00:56:31,184
Spend some time away from the company.

1030
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:34,600
We must calm down our shareholders first.

1031
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:44,059
Why didn't you discuss it with me sooner?

1032
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,809
Why keep it all to yourself like a fool?

1033
00:56:47,392 --> 00:56:48,392
It was Oh Yoon Hee.

1034
00:56:49,392 --> 00:56:50,267
What?

1035
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:51,975
The ghost singer.

1036
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:55,309
It was Yoon Hee.

1037
00:56:58,476 --> 00:56:59,476
Are you sure

1038
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,142
it was her?

1039
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:04,559
What the heck happened between you two?

1040
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:06,518
Tell me everything

1041
00:57:06,543 --> 00:57:07,809
so I can help you.

1042
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:14,642
"Oh Yoon Hee"

1043
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:17,725
I'll take it.

1044
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,683
No.

1045
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,059
We should probably meet.

1046
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:29,518
We have a lot to talk about.

1047
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:07,351
Why was standing on this stage

1048
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:09,934
such a big deal?

1049
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:11,809
To you,

1050
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:13,059
to me,

1051
00:58:13,725 --> 00:58:14,683
and to our kids as well.

1052
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:19,476
Ro Na went against me

1053
00:58:19,975 --> 00:58:21,059
and came back.

1054
00:58:21,142 --> 00:58:22,476
"Cheonga"

1055
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,892
Just to perform on this stage.

1056
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,518
To win the grand prize trophy

1057
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,767
at Cheonga Arts Festival.

1058
00:58:30,434 --> 00:58:31,392
For me.

1059
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:34,351
Why are you telling me this?

1060
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:37,975
Do you want to blame me for her death?

1061
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,017
Ro Na died because of your stupid greed.

1062
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:46,017
You're right.

1063
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:48,184
That's what angers me even more.

1064
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:50,226
My daughter

1065
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,850
died because of her foolish mother.

1066
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:54,725
And that's why

1067
00:58:56,017 --> 00:58:57,934
I'm seeing red now.

1068
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:01,309
Don't try to bury the ghost singer deal.

1069
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:02,559
It will only

1070
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,100
provoke me even more.

1071
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:06,850
Why now, of all times?

1072
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:10,309
Eun Byeol is not well.

1073
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:12,309
Because...

1074
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,892
my daughter died.

1075
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,017
She kept

1076
00:59:19,934 --> 00:59:21,642
taking things away from me.

1077
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:23,892
She kept getting in my way

1078
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,392
and spoke ill of you.

1079
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:27,142
She said

1080
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:29,184
you slit her mum's throat.

1081
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:30,975
She also said

1082
00:59:31,683 --> 00:59:33,518
that you lost to her mum.

1083
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:37,850
What is it that you want?

1084
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:40,683
I'll do anything.

1085
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:45,683
Just don't reveal that

1086
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,100
you were my ghost singer.

1087
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,142
If you do, you'll be punished too,

1088
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:51,413
so keep your lips sealed

1089
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:52,434
for your own good.

1090
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:56,975
You want to keep your pride

1091
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,184
even in the midst of this?

1092
00:59:58,975 --> 00:59:59,934
Why?

1093
01:00:00,132 --> 01:00:01,809
Are you afraid people would find out

1094
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,142
that you're below me?

1095
01:00:03,713 --> 01:00:05,575
Are you scared Eun Byeol would find out?

1096
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,142
Yes! I hate it!

1097
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:10,017
I'd risk anything

1098
01:00:11,184 --> 01:00:12,850
to hide the fact

1099
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:15,226
that I borrowed your voice. So...

1100
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:21,725
Please.

1101
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:26,518
I beg you.

1102
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,396
"Cheonga"

1103
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,559
Then,

1104
01:00:38,642 --> 01:00:39,559
get on your knees.

1105
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:41,309
What?

1106
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,934
Get on your knees and apologise

1107
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,892
for slashing my throat.

1108
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,392
Beg, again and again.

1109
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:50,059
Admit that you lost to me 25 years ago.

1110
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:51,309
Get on your knees!

1111
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:22,683
I'm sorry.

1112
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:25,267
I lost to you.

1113
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:32,226
I stole your grand prize.

1114
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,059
I apologise.

1115
01:02:14,817 --> 01:02:17,026

"Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin"

1122
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,175
to apologise to my fans who supported me

as well as...

1124

to the public.

1125

As of this moment,

1126
01:03:09,592 --> 01:03:11,467
there is no Soprano Cheon Seo Jin.

1127
01:03:13,718 --> 01:03:15,300
I will never take the stage

1128
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,800
or sing

1129
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,592
ever again.

1130
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:23,634
The name, Cheon Seo Jin,

1131
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,967
became the nation's most renowned soprano

1132
01:03:28,634 --> 01:03:29,693
thanks to all your love

1133
01:03:29,718 --> 01:03:30,759
and support. - No way.

1134
01:03:31,883 --> 01:03:33,467
This wasn't possible - This can't be.

1135
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:34,718
without your love and trust.

1136
01:03:35,509 --> 01:03:36,676
So I believed

1137
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:39,551
Eun Byeol. - that I owed it to you

1138
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,592
to deliver a fantastic performance.

1139
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:46,384
My gosh, this is truly shocking.

1140
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,134
How could she scam the entire nation?

1141
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:51,858
Dad, I bet you had no idea

1142
01:03:51,883 --> 01:03:53,259
she was like that either.

1143
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,567
I'm worried that they'll humiliate us too.

1144
01:03:57,592 --> 01:03:59,109
Because of this... - Don't worry.

1145
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:00,800
Just focus on your college applications.

1146
01:04:01,723 --> 01:04:03,765
Are you really going to marry her?

1147
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,775
We're already engaged.

1148
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,009
Must I break it off

1149
01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:09,259
just because she can't sing?

1150
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,900
This isn't a big deal.

1151
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:13,009
I was foolish. I know it can't be undone.

1152
01:04:13,092 --> 01:04:14,092
You'll regret it.

1153
01:04:18,842 --> 01:04:19,759
What?

1154
01:04:24,217 --> 01:04:25,509
Because I will

1155
01:04:26,092 --> 01:04:27,342
destroy her.

1156

1159
01:04:39,718 --> 01:04:40,759
Are you officially

1160
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,800
announcing your retirement?

1161
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,259
Yes, I am.

1162
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,342
Will you also step down

1163
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:46,592
as the chief director?

1164
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:49,175
As an educator, I hold myself accountable.

1165
01:04:50,384 --> 01:04:52,551
I will follow the board's decision.

1166
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:54,551
Moreover,

1167
01:04:55,134 --> 01:04:57,009
I will do my best to compensate

1168
01:04:57,342 --> 01:04:58,275
the attendants

1169
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,300
and organisers of the concert.

1170

Everyone wants to know more about

1171

the phenomenal ghost singer you hired.

1172
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:06,170
Could you tell us who sang for you?

1173
01:05:09,217 --> 01:05:11,509
I will take full responsibility.

1174
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,217
I hope no one is harmed because of me.

1175
01:05:17,342 --> 01:05:18,592
I'll also faithfully cooperate

1176
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:20,842

Don't tell me

1181
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:55,509
it was Ro Na's mum.

No.

1183
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:00,365
It was her, right?

1184
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:01,883
What a disgrace.

1185

I'm embarrassed that you're my mum.

Do you have no pride?

1188
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,484
How could you hire her

1189
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:10,509
as your ghost singer?

1190
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,384
I bet you lost to her in high school.

That's why you slit her throat.

Eun Byeol!

1193
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,509
So how dare you

1194
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:20,676
hound me to beat Ro Na?

1195
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:23,300
Why project your insecurities onto me?

1196
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,551
Stop ordering me around.

1197
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,509
Do not try to lecture me

1198
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,759
and don't act like you're all that.

1199
01:06:29,175 --> 01:06:30,217
You disgust me.

1200
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,883
Cheon Seo Jin! You liar!

1201
01:06:57,009 --> 01:06:58,384
You stole someone else's voice?

1202
01:06:58,718 --> 01:07:00,050
You're the worst.

1203
01:07:00,426 --> 01:07:01,651
You were awfully arrogant.

1204
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:03,259
You swindler! Loser!

1205
01:07:14,175 --> 01:07:16,217
Maybe Eun Byeol is a fake too.

1206
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,426
I thought it was odd

1207
01:07:18,509 --> 01:07:20,925
that she got into Cheonga with no skills.

1208
01:07:21,217 --> 01:07:23,676
Like mother, like daughter.

1209
01:07:26,092 --> 01:07:28,300
You must step down for the school's sake.

1210
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:29,883
I don't want our kids to suffer

1211
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:31,592
because of one piece of rubbish.

1212
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:54,467
That's enough.

1213
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,759
I'm fine.

1214
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:02,592
It'll all pass.

1215
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:04,718
This humiliation...

1216
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,134
I can just ignore it.

1217
01:08:09,342 --> 01:08:10,800
As long as Eun Byeol is okay.

1218
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:13,050
For Eun Byeol,

1219
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,259
I can do anything.

1220
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,259
Because I'm a mother.

1221
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:21,384
I'm okay.

1222
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:23,551
I'm really okay.

1223
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:28,883
I'm terrified.

1224
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:32,551
Can I live

1225
01:08:34,092 --> 01:08:36,127
without singing for the rest of my life?

1226
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:39,634
Can I really live like that?

1227
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:42,050
I don't think I can do it.

1228
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:20,800
Yoon Hee.

1229
01:09:22,134 --> 01:09:23,092
I don't think I can

1230
01:09:24,134 --> 01:09:25,967
ever go back to you.

1231
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:30,426
They're trying to stop all the articles,

1232
01:09:30,883 --> 01:09:32,259
but the public is very critical.

1233
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:34,759
Pressure the media companies

1234
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:36,342
to keep publishing articles about it.

1235
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:38,175
Make it more antagonistic

1236
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:40,009
and add juicy details

1237
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,967
so every person in Korea will read it.

1238
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:49,426
Seo Jin must be so anxious right now.

1239
01:09:50,634 --> 01:09:51,551
Oh, right.

1240
01:09:51,842 --> 01:09:53,300
Why was Eun Byeol hospitalised?

1241
01:09:53,718 --> 01:09:55,509
She received sleep brainwave therapy,

1242
01:09:55,676 --> 01:09:57,134
which is confidential even among doctors.

1243
01:09:58,551 --> 01:10:00,634
Sleep brainwave therapy?

1244
01:10:02,634 --> 01:10:04,175
Are they trying to manipulate

1245
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:06,134
her memory of killing a person?

1246
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:09,134
Seo Jin is doing whatever it takes

1247
01:10:09,217 --> 01:10:11,009
to save her daughter.

1248
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:13,134
There's something odd though.

1249
01:10:14,134 --> 01:10:15,009
What is it?

1250
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:15,967
I checked today,

1251
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:17,634
and the land under Joo Hye In's name

1252
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:18,925
had been transferred to someone else.

1253
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:20,842
Who?

1254
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,883
Logan Lee, that jerk?

1255
01:10:26,384 --> 01:10:27,300
"Oh Yoon Hee"?

1256
01:10:27,384 --> 01:10:28,300
"Owned by: Oh Yoon Hee"

1257
01:10:28,759 --> 01:10:30,718
I can't believe this. How did she...

1258
01:10:32,342 --> 01:10:33,300
Darn it.

1259
01:10:38,217 --> 01:10:39,217
Okay.

1260
01:10:39,925 --> 01:10:41,718
I'll see you tomorrow evening,

1261
01:10:42,426 --> 01:10:43,551
Chairman Joo.

1262
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:57,467
You're early.

1263
01:10:57,592 --> 01:10:59,175
I was told to come by 6 p.m.

1264
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:02,384
He told me you'd be here at 7 p.m.

1265
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,467
I must've misheard him then.

1266
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,300
You can wait here.

1267
01:11:08,551 --> 01:11:09,759
He's not home yet.

1268
01:11:10,259 --> 01:11:12,300
He told me to wait in his study.

1269
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:13,467
Pardon?

1270
01:11:15,426 --> 01:11:17,009
Sure, it's this way.

1271
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:21,734
Oh, I'll have tea with him when he's home.

1272
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:22,718
Sure.

1273
01:11:47,618 --> 01:11:48,576
Soo Ryeon?

1274
01:11:57,825 --> 01:11:59,075
In his study,

1275
01:11:59,492 --> 01:12:01,576
you'll notice an odd-looking bookcase.

1276
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,783
Open it,

1277
01:12:05,326 --> 01:12:07,200
and you'll find a door to a secret room.

1278
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:08,159
You'll need

1279
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:09,742
Joo Dan Tae's fingerprint to get in.

1280
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,618
Hello, sir.

1281
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,618
You're home.

1282
01:12:25,992 --> 01:12:27,326
Bring Ms. Oh to the study.

1283
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:29,117
She's waiting for you there.

1284
01:12:31,326 --> 01:12:32,242
What?

1285
01:12:36,117 --> 01:12:37,159
When you open the door,

1286
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:39,326
you'll see a sculpture.

1287
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:40,992
Tilt its head, and you'll see

1288
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,700
secret buttons.

1289
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:46,451
"Open"

1290
01:13:31,284 --> 01:13:32,867
Looking over here

1291
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:36,451
And over there

1292
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,159
But I still can't find

1293
01:13:51,367 --> 01:13:54,783
Yoon Hee

1294
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:54,618
=Penthouse 2=

1295
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,783
Whoever dares to betray me will die.

1296
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,700
We're over.

1297
01:14:58,742 --> 01:14:59,659
Get out!

1298
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,742
I'm realising that I am

1299
01:15:00,825 --> 01:15:02,200
catching feelings for Seo Jin again.

1300
01:15:02,451 --> 01:15:03,659
You are Soo Ryeon.

1301
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,200
I'm sorry I came too late.

1302
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:06,284
The day Ro Na died...

1303
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,783
Do you remember something?

1304
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:10,117
You killed Ro Na by the stairs that day.

1305
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,950
Aren't you cold? I'll come back tomorrow.

1306
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:13,284
The moment I open my mouth,

1307
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:16,075
your reputation will go down the drain.

1308
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,117
This is insane!

1309
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,825
Can you really do anything I tell you?
