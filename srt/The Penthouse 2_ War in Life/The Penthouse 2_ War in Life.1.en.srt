He had important business to take care of.

Tomorrow is my practical test.

The blackmailing has gone over the line.

145
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,525
It's too awful to even speak of this.

146
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:03,525
It has to be Oh Yoon Hee.

147
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,942
She's the only one

148
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:06,942

Calm down.

150
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,400
You might be wrong.

151
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,234
Numbers of people are jealous of you.

152
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,692
Do you know how many times this happened?

153
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
No one could do anything this dangerous

154
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:17,775
unless they wanted to get revenge.

155
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,775
I've been feeling like I'm being watched.

156
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,276
You know that too.

157
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:25,109
As long as Oh Yoon Hee is alive,

158
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:27,734
we can never be completely free.

159
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,775
It has been a year since she disappeared.

160

And she still hasn't been caught,

161
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,775
which means she died while fleeing

162
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:34,859
or in hiding.

163
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:35,984
One or the other.

164
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:36,900
I refuse to believe that

165
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,400
until anyone finds her dead body.

166
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:42,442
Are you keeping your eyes on her daughter?

167
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:44,359
She's a kid of a murderer and fugitive.

168
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:47,318
The police are over her around the clock,

169
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,151
and I have someone tailing her too.

170
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,318
You won't have to worry.

171

If she can't come and visit

172
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,817
her only daughter,

173
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,525
she must have died somewhere.

174
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:58,609
But...

175
00:13:58,692 --> 00:13:59,692
Stress isn't good for you.

176
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,276
You've been too sensitive lately.

177
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:07,984
What is this?

178
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,442
Did you make this?

179
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:11,984
I missed you a lot.

180
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:14,483
You look especially beautiful today.

181
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:16,400
Thanks.

182
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:19,192
How was the party?

183
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,067
Did you get drunk?

184
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,359
Was everything okay?

185
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:28,276
What's not to be okay?

186
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,984
I got tipsy enough to enjoy the night.

187
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:43,692
The current real estate policy is

188
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,567
bringing devastation

189
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:47,400
upon ordinary people with no houses!

190
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,400
We demand revocation!

191
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,775
Revocation! - Revocation!

192
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,942
Ministers with multiple houses

193
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,151
must wake up to the reality

194
00:14:56,276 --> 00:15:00,318
and resign from their offices immediately!

195
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,026
Resign! - Resign!

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,900
On the fifth day of my hunger strike,

197
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,817
one citizen came by

198
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,400
and gave me this hand-made scarf.

199
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,483
Then she said her life's dream was

200
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,525
to buy a house of her own.

201
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,151

My hands tremble when I skip one meal.

230
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,359
So I already prepared everything.

231

grilled shrimps and all.

Eat up.

How long do I have to keep doing

00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,400
this darned hunger strike?

Do you know how freezing it is?

I'm about to have a stroke.

239
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,859
Why do I have to live in this misery?

240
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:53,318
Your acting was right on the point today.

241
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:54,442
Since you fainted today,

242
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,859
we can slowly fade this out.

243
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,359
Why don't they uplift the regulations

244
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,817
on redevelopment to build apartments,

245
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:01,692
then make the banks give out loans?

246
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,192
Wouldn't that resolve all the problems?

247
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,190
Hey, aide. - Yes, sir.

248
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,750
You made me do this on purpose, right?

249
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,407
You wanted to mess with me.

250
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,442
No, sir. To recover from your mistake

251
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:12,942
during the assembly inspection--

252
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:13,942
So you

253
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,359
never make a mistake, do you?

254
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,775
That's the case.

255
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:19,567
Then you can be an assemblyman yourself.

256
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,692
Hey.

257
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:22,567
Cut that off.

258
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,545
I'm sure he's doing his best.

259
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,474
Look at his face.

260
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,942
He thinks I'm a joke

261
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,731
because this is only my first term.

262

Lee Kyu Jin! - Lee Kyu Jin!

263
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,817
I'm the fifth richest assemblyman

264
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,192
among the entire assembly.

265
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,692
Does it look easy to make that fortune

266
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,359
without doing anything fishy?

267
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:37,900
Honey.

268
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,109
Cut that out and look at this.

269
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,525
This article just got released.

270
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,209
Chairman Joo and Ms. Cheon are

271
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:44,723
getting engaged.

272
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:47,167
They're getting remarried

273
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,458
after having an affair.

274
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,817
This isn't the love of the century.

275
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,483
The engagement is still months ahead.

276
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:52,734
Why did they release this already?

277
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,692
I heard Cheonga Foundation is merging

278
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,692
with JKING Holdings.

279
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,567
So their stock prices skyrocketed

280
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,026
once again today.

281
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:02,942
Goodness. My goodness.

282
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:04,734
Hey, Kyu Jin.

283
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,495
Didn't I say we should buy their stocks?

284
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,750
Why don't you know that as an assemblyman?

285
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,109
Hey, come here.

286
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,109
I told you to tell me these things.

287
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,318
Did you buy some?

288
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,234
I put... I put in my entire fortune.

289
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,817

00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,725
You stepped on it. - Darn it.

344
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:29,683
Hey! - You stepped on it!

345
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:30,767
I stepped on the line.

346
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:34,559
You stepped on the line! - It's gross.

347
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:35,934
She's so disgusting.

It's her.

351
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,267
Right? The murderer's daughter.

352
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,975
She's gross.

353
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,059
I'm scared.

354
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,017
Gosh.

355
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
She's this girl, right?

356
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,142
This is insane.

357
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,892
Look at how brazen she is.

358
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,725
You're a murderer's daughter.

"Bae Ro Na, the murderer's daughter"

360
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:06,767
It makes me shiver.

361
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,309
Her mum stabbed someone to death.

362
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:12,559
She probably has the psychopath DNA.

363
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,892
She's a potential criminal.

364
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:16,683
Don't associate with her.

365
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,017
What's she doing?

366
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,642
Get lost. Get out of here.

367
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,392
I told you to get lost!

368
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:32,642
Thanks.

369
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,975
That's awesome.

370
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,100
Gosh.

371
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:43,184
Is everyone here?

372
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,850
You are all here.

373
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,100
Next year, all of you will be

374
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,434
seniors, preparing for college.

375
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,600
The special class for students applying

376
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,559
for Seoul University will begin today.

377
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:55,809
Make sure you come here after school.

378
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:56,850
And...

379
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:03,434
these school contests will look great

380
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:04,850
on your student record and essays.

381
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,309
I made a plan

382
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,434
and split them up evenly among you

383
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,351
so that you won't compete with each other.

This is under the chairwoman's approval

386
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,351
and conducted by the school.

387
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:19,850
So you'll just have to do as I say.

388
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:22,059
Then get back to your seats

389
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:23,226
and fill out the applications.

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,892
and Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin

of Cheonga Foundation

396
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:42,892
have announced their engagement.

397
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,142
They have been in a relationship

398
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:46,642
after years of friendship,

399
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:49,642
then recently decided to get married.

400
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:51,392
JKING Holdings has stated

401
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:53,559
Chairwoman Cheon has been

402
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,100
by Chairman Joo's side

403
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:56,725
after he lost his wife, Sim,

404
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:57,850
last year during the Hera Palace

murder incident. - Hello, sir.

406
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:00,017
"Hello, sir"?

407
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,600
They asked for people's blessings

408
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:02,683
Hey. - in this new beginning

409
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,892
Who are those people? - of the couple...

410
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,934
Are you really a murderer's daughter?

00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:10,850
are you this woman's daughter?

414
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,725

415
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,892

416
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,392
The new company's... - Hey, get lost.

417
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:18,476
Get out of here.

418
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:20,184
Get lost.

419
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,934
Get out of here.

420
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,226
Get out. Go.

Ro Na, may we have a word?

422
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,518
Did your mum ever contact you?

423
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,226
She has, right? - Say something, Ro Na.

424
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,434
Just one word. - Ro Na.

425
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:31,559
Did she call you? - Ro Na.

426
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,767
Hey, Ro Na. - Ro Na.

427
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,809
Did she contact you?

428
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:34,892
Ro Na. - One word.

429
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:35,892
Ro Na! - Wait.

430
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,434
You all read the articles

431
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,476
on our engagement already, right?

432
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:43,600
Congratulations, Mr. Joo.

433
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:45,059
Congrats, Mum.

434
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:46,059
Thanks.

435
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,476
Thanks, Eun Byeol.

436
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:51,351
Above all, I hope you three get along.

437
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:53,767
We have no reason to not get along.

438
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,476
Are we going to live here as well?

439
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,142
I like this house.

440
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,351
Do you two have anything to say?

441
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:03,600
No, we don't.

442
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:07,392
Please excuse me.

443
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,434
Sit down.

444
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:09,683
The adults are still eating.

445
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,767
You know that

446
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:13,184
I get sick if I eat with someone

447
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:14,184
I find disgusting.

448
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:16,809
Joo Seok Kyung!

449
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,059
You should eat.

450
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:21,767
This steak is grilled deliciously.

451
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:38,809
Get up.

452
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:41,892
Don't be such a baby.

453
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:43,892
This is business

454
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,059
before it's considered a marriage.

455
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,267
I mean that you aren't helping your dad

456
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,725
by getting on my nerves.

457
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,351
You give me the creeps.

458
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,434
Does my dad know this side of you?

459
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,351
Don't cut me off. Show some manners.

460
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,017
Now that we've become a family,

461
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:03,392
I won't condone any cheeky behaviours.

462
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:06,683
What a shame.

463
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,392
If you had even a bit of intelligence,

464
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:10,226
you wouldn't be behaving like this.

465
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:12,850
I guess your mum didn't care much

466
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:14,142
for your education.

467
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,017
Don't talk like that about my mum.

468
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,434
No, you need to lose that attitude.

469
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,518
I don't care what you were like before.

470
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,434
If you ever tarnish my reputation,

471
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,934
I will not let it slide.

472
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:34,226
You'd better behave, Seok Kyung.

473
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:53,892
How's the lemon charlotte?

474
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:54,934
I heard you like this,

475
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,184
so I made it myself.

476
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:58,434
You made this yourself?

477
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,850
It's so good.

478
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:05,683
Is there anything you can't do?

479
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:07,392
You're from a good family,

480
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:08,642
you make lots of money,

481
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,059
you're good-looking,

482
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,100
and you can even cook.

483
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,142
I'm glad

484
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,809
you liked it.

485
00:26:18,392 --> 00:26:19,226
You know what?

486
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,600
You don't have to try too hard

487
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,725
when my mum isn't around.

488
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:36,142
What?

489
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:38,850
I'll tell her that you're nice to me.

490
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,600
So you can relax.

491
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,767
It's pitiful to see you try so hard

492
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,642
to get on my good side.

493
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,142
Why does it feel so eerie?

494
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:02,351
Am I too sensitive?

495
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:13,850
"Cheon Seo Jin, you cannot be happy!"

496
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,476
"You'll never be happy, die!"

497
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,434
"The voice of the devil!"

498
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,476
"Go die, Cheon Seo Jin!"

499
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,559
"Die! Just go die!"

500
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,059
"Die"

501
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,767
Mr. Do is checking

502
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,059
the CCTV footage at the security office.

503
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:40,559
He hasn't found a record

504
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,184
of any strangers coming into the building.

505
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,226
But I'm anxious to death.

506
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:44,809
How could this happen

507
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:45,975
as soon as we announced our engagement?

508
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:50,226
It means someone got right under my nose.

509
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,267
What if it's Oh Yoon Hee?

510
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:53,850
What if she came back?

511
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,017
She's a fugitive.

512
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:56,683
She couldn't approach us this easily.

513
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,476
Then who would do something this absurd?

514
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,725
We'll find out.

515
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:01,809
I'll increase security.

516
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:02,892
Don't worry about it.

517
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,226
Was it necessary to take her house away?

518
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,934
You already confiscated her bank account.

519
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:09,142
Wouldn't she come at us if she sees

520
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:10,600
her girl staying in a shabby place?

521
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:11,892
I could've got in trouble

522
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:13,600
if I didn't frame her for embezzlement.

523
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:14,559
You know as well as I do

524
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,809
that I had no other choice!

525
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:17,142
But still,

526
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:20,600
you shouldn't have messed with Ro Na.

527
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:22,934
A mother who lost everything

528
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:24,392
has nothing to be afraid of.

529
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,226
You...

530
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:34,392
made a mistake.

531
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,309
Do you think I put you on her tail

532
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:46,600
to have you return with this report?

533
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,767
You've been very disappointing lately.

534
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,392
How am I supposed to put my trust in you?

535
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
I apologise, Chairman Joo.

536
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,809
I apologise.

537
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:55,226
I apologise, Chairman Joo.

538
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,309
I apologise.

539
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,642
I apologise, Chairman Joo.

540
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,226
I apologise. I apologise!

541
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,809
I apologise, Chairman Joo.

542
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:27,017
Why are you here again?

543
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,809
You just met with your mum, didn't you?

544
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,392
Where did you see her?

545
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,100
Who gave you this?

546
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,518
Your mum?

547
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,392
She came to see you, didn't she?

548
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,809
No.

549
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,767
Where is she?

550
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,267
Where is she hiding? Tell me!

551
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:41,934
I really have no idea.

552
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:43,892
If you know where she is,

553
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,184
please tell me.

554
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,184
You need to stop coming here.

555
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:48,725
How long are you going to keep doing this?

556
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,392
You'll never be freed from Chairman Joo

557
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,434
until that mother of yours

558
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:56,017
who's a murderer shows up.

559
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:57,434
If you ever

560
00:29:57,975 --> 00:29:59,642
let me catch you

561
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,100
contacting your mum or seeing her,

562
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:05,559
I will make sure I kill you.

563
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:06,934
Understood?

564
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:17,267
What do you want from me?

565
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:19,725
I have no other place to run to.

566
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,642
I'm dying to see my mum too,

567
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:26,059
even if it means I get beaten up to death!

568
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:34,725
That foolish girl.

569
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,059
Why did she let her ruin the sandwich?

570
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:38,767
She's so frustrating.

571
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,476
Je Ni.

572
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,434
Why are you...

573
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,683
Did you follow me?

574
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,518
I told you that she seemed fishy.

575
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,309
It was weird how you've been

576
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:56,600
coming to school late every day.

577
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:59,559
You've been deceiving us to this day.

578
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,725
Tell us.

579
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,184
Have you been hanging out with Ro Na?

580
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:04,725
It's...

581
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,434
No, it's not like that.

582
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:11,267
Did you buy her some bread? And meals?

583
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,142
Say something.

584
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,142
Fine! I'm friends with Ro Na.

585
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:17,975
Don't you feel bad for her?

586
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:19,934
She doesn't have a mum or a dad.

587
00:31:20,184 --> 00:31:21,975
She's the daughter of the murderer

588
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:23,184
who killed my mum.

589
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,309
I lost my mum because of her.

590
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:26,267
That's...

591
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,309
not Ro Na's fault.

592
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:29,351
And by that,

593
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,518
you mean you're on Ro Na's side.

594
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,434
I'll let Mr. Ma know

595
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,059
that of tomorrow, you won't be

596
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:37,600
a part of the Seoul University class.

597
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Eun Byeol!

598
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,559
"Die! Just die!"

599
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:38,767
"Die! Die!"

600
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,518
You disgusting witch.

601
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:51,725
Get away from Chairman Joo.

602
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,683
Joo Dan Tae is mine.

603
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,725
I won't let anyone else have him.

604
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,892
Die. Just die, Cheon Seo Jin.

605
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:03,934
Die.

606
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,309
Die, Cheon Seo Jin.

607
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:09,975
Ms. Yang, it was you?

608
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:16,642
Why are you here

609
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,392
at this hour, Ms. Cheon?

610
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:23,559
Unbelievable.

611
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:26,434
I knew those white sneakers

612
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:27,600
seemed familiar.

613
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:30,351
It was you, Ms. Yang.

614
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,683
Were you trying to curse me

615
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,100
with a lousy doll like that?

616
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,392
Do you think doing that

617
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,600
will make the chairman yours?

618
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,226
Please spare me, Ms. Cheon!

619
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:44,934
Please. Please don't tell the chairman.

620
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,767
I can't live without him.

621
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:48,975
It's not worth my time

622
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,226
to deal with a pathetic woman like you.

623
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:52,600
Get out of this house now.

624
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:54,934
If you ever let me catch you again,

625
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,434
you won't leave this place alive.

626
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,683
No, I can't leave.

627
00:34:01,392 --> 00:34:03,518
Please forgive me this once.

628
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,017
If... Even if I must die,

629
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,351
I will die in this house.

630
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,392
No one else other than the chairman can

631
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:11,683
kick me out of this house.

632
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,059
I will be the lady of this house

633
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:16,975
once I marry him!

634
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,017
And that means

635
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,934
I'm the one who gets to fire you

636
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,017
or kick you out!

637
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:31,725
I'm not the one who should leave.

638
00:34:37,017 --> 00:34:38,017
Cheon Seo Jin.

639
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:41,767
It's you, you witch.

640
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:43,767
What?

641
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,309
I lived

642
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:48,351
under the same roof

643
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:52,059
as the chairman for 20 years.

644
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:53,642
Goodness.

645
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,892
I know the way he looks at me.

646
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,226
His breaths.

647
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:01,725
And even the smallest hair.

648
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,267
I remember everything.

649
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,142
And I can lay down my life

650
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,267
for that man.

651
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,600
Joo Dan Tae is mine.

652
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,059
I won't let anyone else have him!

653
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:18,184
Goodness.

654
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,642
You're driving me insane.

655
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:24,600
Chairman Joo.

656
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,809
You still had that awful habit.

657
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,642
You've made a contribution before,

658
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:31,142
so I decided to keep you around.

659
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:33,100
So I'll make sure

660
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,017
I help you get rid of your lunacy.

661
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,975
There's no reason for me to live

662
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,642
without you.

663
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,017
Really, now?

664
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,142
I...

665
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:49,267
love...

666
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:53,809
you to death, Chairman Joo.

667
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:55,975
What are you doing? Get rid of her.

668
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,309
No, Chairman Joo.

669
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:00,850
No, I can't go.

670
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:03,642
Chairman Joo, please don't abandon me.

671
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,434
Chairman Joo!

672
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,309
My goodness. - Chairman Joo!

673
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,934
Don't abandon me! Please! - It's a shame

674
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,625
that I'll never get to have

675
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,100
her braised spicy monkfish again.

676
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:17,518
"Die"

677
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,975
Who else would do something like this?

678
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,184
We'll have to find out.

679
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:21,559
There is someone

680
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,809
I'm suspicious of.

681
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:25,725
Dan Tae.

682
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:29,725
You're one smart guy.

683
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,476
Oh, right.

684
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:33,975
Did your PR team release

685
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,100
the article on our engagement?

686
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:36,309
Why?

687
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,518
Is something bothering you?

688
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,059
You should revise the part that says

689
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:40,642
I'll be the CEO of the company

690
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:41,892
once our businesses merge.

691
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,934
What do you mean?

692
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:44,642
Once Cheonga Group is founded,

693
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:46,975
don't you think Joo Dan Tae will be

694
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,392
the rightful chairman of the group?

695
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:50,184
I'll have too much to do in my hands

696
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,434
trying to turn Cheonga Arts Centre

697
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:53,600
into a world-class opera house.

698
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:56,351
Then I'll ask them to revise that part.

699
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:00,059
What are your plans tonight?

700
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,351
Why?

701
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:05,059
Well, I'm just curious.

702
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,892
"Jakomo"

703
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,809
Hello, sir.

704
00:37:20,392 --> 00:37:22,518
I heard he passed out in a hunger strike.

705
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,059
Why is he sleeping in my office?

706
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:28,725
You made me come all the way here!

707
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,809
Couldn't you have come sooner?

708
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:30,892
"Jakomo"

709
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:33,392
You can't make a civil servant come and go

710
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:34,975
as you please!

711
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:36,850
Goodness.

712
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:38,559
Have you forgotten already?

713
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,392
Who got you that badge?

714
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,850
Half of your votes were from me.

715
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,309
You know that.

716
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:46,809
Thanks to your dead wife,

717
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:47,850
the value of Hera Palace

718
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,683
had gone down the drain.

719
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,100
Who was the one

720
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,725
that pulled it back up like this?

721
00:37:54,226 --> 00:37:55,975
Who was it?

722
00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:57,934
If I didn't become an assemblyman,

723
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:00,059
Hera Palace wouldn't be selling

724
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:01,226
for 150 million won

725
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,559
per 3.3 square metre.

726
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,934
Shouldn't we be thanking Seo Jin

727
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,267
for announcing the plans for building

728
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,767
the second Cheonga Medical Centre

729
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,683
in Samseong-dong?

730
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:11,767
Well, that is true.

731
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,600
But isn't your business doing so well?

732
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:17,559
You didn't have to lift a finger

733
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:18,725
to make this company yours.

734
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,392
Let's be honest.

735
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,975
Thanks to Sim Soo Ryeon,

736
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:27,518
your wealth has doubled.

737
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,975
I suppose good fortune comes to those

738
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,934
who do good deeds.

739
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:37,476
Whatever, forget it.

740
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,725
Just cut to the chase.

741
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,059
What is it? A complaint?

742
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,559
No, not that.

743
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,767
This is very important.

Ms. Cheon.

All right, come on.

00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:03,934
Let's go.

755
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,142
I feel like

756
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,351
I've finally found my soul mate.

757
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:18,059
I'd like to

758
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:20,767
dedicate the rest of my life

to you,

761
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:28,000
I love you.

762
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:31,875
My gosh! He looks like a prince.

763
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,583
You made our busy assemblyman

764
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,126
come here just to propose to me?

765
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,126
My point exactly.

766
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,084
I put the people's welfare behind

767
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:41,418
and ran here.

768
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,126
What are you waiting for?

769
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:45,000
Just say yes.

770
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:48,917
Chairman Joo's knees will wear out!

771
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:51,500
Get up.

772
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,667
I want you to put the ring on me.

773
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,126
This isn't your first marriage proposal.

774
00:40:58,209 --> 00:40:59,459
Come on, you're a pro.

775
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,667
Shouldn't you know better?

776
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,418
Here.

777
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:12,376
It's beautiful.

778
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:14,625
I love it.

779
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,418
Thank you.

780
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,750
Joo Dan Tae!

781
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,625
You're under arrest

782
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:27,792
for the murder of Sim Soo Ryeon.

783
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,209
What?

784
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,042
What are you talking about?

785
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,292
He's a murder suspect?

786
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,709
What do you think you're doing?

787
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,042
Why would I kill my own wife?

788
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:41,500
You'll have to come with us.

789
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:42,709
Let go!

790
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,625
I didn't do anything wrong!

791
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:45,750
Dan Tae! - Let go!

792
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:46,834
Dan Tae!

793
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,500
I didn't kill anyone! - Dan Tae!

794
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:49,792
I'm innocent!

795
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,209
Dan Tae! - What's going on?

796
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:52,834
My gosh. - What is happening?

797
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,917
This sure will be an unforgettable day.

We're Chairman Joo's lawyers.

801
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,126
Why did you arrest him?

802
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,251
We received a report.

803
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:09,334
A report about what?

804
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,667
That he is the real culprit

805
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:13,376
behind Sim Soo Ryeon's murder.

806
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:16,251
Who is making this ridiculous

807
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,625
false accusation?

808
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,709
The first witness

809
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,376
and Chairman Joo's housekeeper,

810
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,209
Yang Mi Ok.

811
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,292
Yang Mi Ok?

812
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:28,583
You dragged me all the way here

813
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,376
just because of what Ms. Yang told you?

814
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,750
This is utterly ridiculous.

815
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,334
Are you ready for the consequences?

816
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,251
This is abuse of police authority,

817
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,418
and we won't put up with it.

818
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,875
I will make you pay for this.

819
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,459
Where is Ms. Yang now?

820
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:43,875
I'd like you to cross-examine us.

821
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:46,251
Ms. Yang

822
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,875
has died.

823
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:52,251
What did you say?

824
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Ms. Yang

825
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,583
was found dead at her home

826
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,000
about an hour ago.

827
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,792
She poisoned herself to death.

828
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:04,084
I loved Chairman Joo Dan Tae all my life.

829
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:06,251
If I can't have him,

830
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,042
I will destroy him

831
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,542
so no one else can have him.

832
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:14,292
Chairman Joo killed Sim Soo Ryeon.

833
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,376
I want to apologise to Oh Yoon Hee.

834
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,292
Ms. Yang named you

835
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:32,251
as the real culprit behind the murder.

836
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,500
What?

837
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,251
She also apologised to Oh Yoon Hee

838
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:37,292
in her suicide note.

839
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:39,875
She must've been

840
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,709
holding a grudge against you.

841
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,209
I don't believe this.

842
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,500
She'd never mess with me like this.

843
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,209
It's her.

844
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:54,792
Pardon me?

845
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,418
I bet Oh Yoon Hee plotted everything.

846
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm sure of it.

847
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:00,542
Oh Yoon Hee killed Ms. Yang.

848
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:02,583
Request an autopsy at once.

849
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,209
Let's see if it was actually a suicide.

850
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,792
If there are any traces of someone

851
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,334
breaking into her home,

852
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,334
and if the suicide note was forged...

853
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:12,500
Hold on.

854
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:22,292
Oh Yoon Hee?

855
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,625
Oh Yoon Hee...

856
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,792
What the heck is she doing here?

857
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:41,792
Oh Yoon Hee!

858
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:42,834
"Detective"

859
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,376
Answer me.

860
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,625
What are you doing here?

861
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
What is going on?

862
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:07,875
Where have you been hiding?

863
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,875
Who are you trying to mess with this time?

864
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,459
Ma'am, please don't do this.

865
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:14,418
You did this.

866
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:16,376
You killed Ms. Yang.

867
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:17,500
You cooked up

868
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,625
this ridiculous ruse!

869
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:20,000
Speak. Tell us what's going on!

870
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,042
Enough.

871
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:23,875
She turned herself in before then.

872
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:26,084
She turned herself in?

873
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:27,459
Take her.

874
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,000
"Detective"

875
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:50,459
I swear,

876
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,459
I did not kill Soo Ryeon.

877
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,376
You can ask me

878
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:58,292
over and over again.

879
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,167
My answer will not change.

880
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,376
I swear, I can bet

881
00:46:05,084 --> 00:46:06,376
my daughter's life on it.

882
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:09,376
My gosh!

883
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,792
Ms. Yang left a suicide note

884
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,209
and took her own life?

885
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:15,418
Chairman Joo is the culprit?

886
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,667
What does that mean?

887
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:19,709
So Oh Yoon Hee didn't kill her?

888
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:22,625
We can't just believe Ms. Yang and assume

889
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:23,750
that he's the culprit.

890
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:26,625
This is horrifying.

891
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:29,334
There's no way Chairman Joo

892
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:31,084
did that to his own wife.

893
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,917
So Yoon Hee was wrongfully imprisoned

894
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,126
and became a fugitive?

895
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:40,334
Hold on, Ms. Yang from the penthouse

896
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,167
named Chairman Joo as the murderer

897
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:44,500
and killed herself? Is that it?

898
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,500
I never said this before,

899
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:49,500
but Oh Yoon Hee killed Sim Soo Ryeon?

900
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:51,459
It never made sense to me.

901
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,917
But with Chairman Joo, it makes sense.

902
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:55,625
After she died,

903
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:56,917
all her money and assets

904
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,959
became his.

905
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:02,000
But...

906
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,167
Oh Yoon Hee requested a cross-examination

907
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:07,084
with Ms. Yang,

908
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:08,334
the first witness at the scene.

909
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,167
And when the police went to her home,

910
00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:12,334
Ms. Yang was already dead.

911
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,126
That witch, Oh Yoon Hee, killed her.

912
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,000
Or she hired someone to do it.

913
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,084
I suspect the same,

914
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,418
but the situation isn't looking good.

915
00:47:20,376 --> 00:47:22,459
Because Ms. Yang named you as the murderer

916
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,542
and died,

917
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,376
they'll have to reopen the case.

918
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:27,917
You'll be the new suspect.

919
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It's unavoidable.

920
00:47:29,084 --> 00:47:31,334
And if word gets out that your men

921
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:33,209
assaulted her on top of that,

922
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:36,334
you may be accused of killing her as well.

923
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,042
Then what?

924
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:39,667
Just let them do this to me?

925
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:44,209
One good thing is,

926
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,000
they found many photos that prove

927
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:47,583
Ms. Yang had been stalking you

928
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:51,084
and had it out for your wife.

929
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:52,792
That psycho.

930
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,167
She never understood her place.

931
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:56,500
This is

932
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,750
a good opportunity for us.

933
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:01,583
Let's do this.

934
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,542
I'll say that...

935
00:48:13,418 --> 00:48:14,334
Breaking news.

936
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:15,459
The real culprit behind

937
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,084
the Hera Palace murder was revealed.

938
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:19,376
The murderer, Yang, was a housekeeper

939
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:20,709
who worked for the victim.

940
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,500
She had been stalking Chairman Joo,

941
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,542
the victim's husband, for many years,

942
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,459
and also had a deep grudge

943
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,459
against the victim.

944
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,126
This was revealed

945
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:32,042
after suspect Oh Yoon Hee,

946
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:35,042
who had been on the run for a year,

947
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,042
No way. - turned herself in.

948
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:38,084
Ms. Yang did it?

949
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,625
Yang left a suicide note

950
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,084
apologising to Oh

951
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,709
and took her own life.

952
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:44,292
What happened?

953
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,583
The police believe that Yang felt...

954
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,750
Dad, is this true?

955
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:50,000
Did Ms. Yang really kill Mum?

956
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:51,542
The police - Did she?

957
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,709
will reinvestigate the Hera Palace case.

958
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:56,625
Since the murderer, Yang...

959
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,418
"Police to Reinvestigate Hera Palace Case"

960
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,251
What the heck is going on?

961
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:11,583
Ms. Yang is the killer?

962
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,126
How could you frame her for it?

963
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,376
Stop talking.

964
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,334
I didn't get any sleep.

965
00:49:16,418 --> 00:49:17,834
Explain what's going on!

966
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:20,792
I'm going crazy too!

967
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,209
I was about to become the target,

968
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
but thanks to Ms. Yang's mental illness,

969
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,084
we were able to resolve it easily.

970
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,959
I brought in five lawyers.

971
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,251
Do you know how much it cost me

972
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,500
to make Ms. Yang the culprit?

973
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:32,917
Yoon Hee is alive.

974
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,917
So what?

975
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:35,875
This was the only way

976
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:37,334
we could get rid of Yoon Hee,

977
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,042
but this means she's innocent again.

978
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,000
Then what was I supposed to do?

979
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:43,625
If I didn't frame Ms. Yang for being crazy,

980
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,000
I'd be convicted of murder.

981
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,334
Do you want me to go to jail?

982
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:48,667
That's not what I'm saying!

983
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,459
What if...

984
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,251
What if Ms. Yang didn't kill herself?

985
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,126
Even if Yoon Hee killed her,

986
00:49:58,334 --> 00:49:59,209
it'll only hurt me

987
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:00,500
if the police dig deeper.

988
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,500
I'm grateful that Yoon Hee

989
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,418
isn't hounding the police to find out

990
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,542
who really killed Soo Ryeon.

991
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:09,667
Even the public sentiment

992
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,418
is moving in Yoon Hee's favour.

993
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,500
I think someone's helping her.

994
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,917
But who?

995
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:20,625
The suspicions surrounding

996
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:21,917
the Hera Palace murder

997
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,542
do not end there.

998
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:25,834
What? - The police did not find

999
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:27,459
Oh Yoon Hee's fingerprint

1000
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,459
anywhere on the forged family portrait

1001
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,376
found in her home.

1002
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,251
Is that for real?

1003
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:34,334
So she was framed for the murder?

1004
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,667
She's actually innocent?

1005
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:37,126
What's wrong with you?

1006
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,500
Why are you watching TV here?

1007
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,667
When did you come here?

1008
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,917
Yang was very jealous of the victim.

1009
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:47,209
Storeowners in the area have stated that

1010
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,750
she went around acting like

1011
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:50,750
she owned the penthouse.

1012
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
What's more shocking is that

1013
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,167
Yang was the last person

1014
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,875
who spoke to Sim on the phone.

1015
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:57,000
"Sim's Last Phone Call Was With Yang"

1016
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:58,500
Why did the police

1017
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:01,000
overlook such a crucial piece of evidence?

1018
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,084
"Gangnam Police Station"

1019
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,542
Oh Yoon Hee, who was branded

1020
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,126
as a murderer for a whole year,

1021
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,500
has requested a retrial.

1022
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,500
Wait! - A comment, please!

1023
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,959
Now that the real murderer

1024
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,042
has been revealed,

1025
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:14,542
she'll most likely be found not guilty.

1026
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:17,209
The police and justice department

1027
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,709
will not be able to avoid

1028
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:20,583
being criticised for their incompetence

1029
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,500
in their investigation and decision.

1030
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:01,709
I saw you every day in my dreams.

1031
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,875
My baby, you still look just the same.

1032
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:12,292
You too, Mum.

1033
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:26,750
I...

1034
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:30,042
I knew you didn't do it.

1035
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:33,334
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

1036
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:34,834
I'm...

1037
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,667
I'm so sorry.

1038
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:39,583
I'm really sorry.

1039
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:42,500
Mum...

1040
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:44,500
Mum...

1041
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:46,084
Mum.

1042
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:49,084
Mum...

1043
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:53,042
Mum...

1044
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:42,209
Are you home?

1045
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:44,875
We spoke earlier on the phone.

1046
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,000
You said you needed a part-timer.

1047
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:04,917
Just a moment, please.

1048
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:10,917
Hello.

1049
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,000
This is all your mum's fault!

1050
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:18,376
Chairman Joo is angry

1051
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:19,667
because your mum fled!

1052
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:21,875
She'll show up if you die.

1053
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:24,959
If her daughter dies because of her,

1054
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:26,875
she'll show up for sure.

1055
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:28,292
Die!

1056
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:29,376
Die!

1057
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:30,376
Just die!

1058
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:31,917
Stop!

1059
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,542
You're alive, Oh Yoon Hee.

1060
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:49,709
You framed me. Isn't that enough?

1061
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,334
Why are you trying

1062
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:53,251
to kill my innocent daughter? Why?

1063
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:56,376
That way, you'll show up.

1064
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:00,376
If your daughter dies because of you,

1065
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:03,583
you'd show your face

1066
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,500
even if you had to rise from the dead.

1067
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:08,292
Did Joo Dan Tae put you up to this?

1068
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:09,500
Did he tell you to kill me?

1069
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:14,750
Good bye,

1070
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:17,834
Oh Yoon Hee.

1071
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:32,042
Logan.

1072
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:33,334
I told you not to go anywhere alone.

1073
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,167
Why show up without my permission?

1074
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,209
Ro Na was in danger, so I had no choice.

1075
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:39,500
I will keep Ro Na safe.

1076
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:41,709
I will kill everyone

1077
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,251
who hurts children.

1078
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:52,209
Ms. Yang!

1079
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:53,583
Ms. Yang! What are you doing?

1080
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:55,251
Ms. Yang.

1081
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Ms. Yang!

1082
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:02,167
That witch...

1083
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,167
I should've taken her with me.

1084
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:18,376
I'll go ahead and wait for you, sir.

1085
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:24,167
I'll see you...

1086
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:36,709
Is she dead?

1087
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,917
Turn yourself in right now.

1088
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,583
Then,

1089
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,418
ask for a cross-examination with Ms. Yang.

1090
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,334
I'll take care of the rest.

1091
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:51,459
"Scan"

1092
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,750
"I loved Chairman Joo Dan Tae"

1093
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:56,292
"all my life."

1094
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,292
"But it's painful to love someone"

1095
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:00,875
"who doesn't love me back."

1096
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,334
"If I can't have him, I will destroy him."

1097
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:07,084
"I loved Chairman Joo Dan Tae"

1098
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,000
"all my life."

1099
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,959
"Die!"

1100
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,667
"Chairman Joo killed Sim Soo Ryeon."

1101
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,209
"I want to apologise to Oh Yoon Hee."

1102
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:28,500
Mum...

1103
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,667
Mum...

1104
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,042
Mum.

1105
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:07,251
Is that right?

1106
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:10,042
Make sure she leaves the country.

1107
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:11,292
Okay.

1108
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,042
She's fleeing abroad?

1109
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:17,667
Oh Yoon Hee?

1110
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:22,000
What if she comes back?

1111
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:24,209
Just forget about her now.

1112
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,583
She's been through

1113
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,292
all sorts of crazy things.

1114
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:28,750
That's why she's leaving.

1115
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:31,542
We can finally

1116
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:33,583
get on with our lives.

1117
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,334
We'll have an engagement ceremony

1118
00:58:39,418 --> 00:58:40,792
and establish Cheonga Group together.

1119
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:44,709
You'll become the greatest prima donna

1120
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:46,209
and take over the music world.

1121
00:58:47,126 --> 00:58:48,376
We'll build a happy family

1122
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:49,542
that everyone envies

1123
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,542
and love each other forever.

1124
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:05,750
What's wrong?

1125
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:09,500
Nothing.

1126
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:11,875
Eun Byeol's lesson will be over soon.

1127
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:13,292
I should head out.

1128
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:14,792
Eun Byeol isn't a kid.

1129
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,126
Don't you think you're too overprotective?

1130
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:18,750
If you're jealous of Eun Byeol,

1131
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:19,917
please don't be.

1132
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,834
When it comes to our kids,

1133
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,418
let's keep it off-limits.

1134
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:52,875
I must be losing my mind.

1135
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:54,959
Cheon Seo Jin, you're going crazy.

1136
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,583
Get it together.

1137
01:00:00,834 --> 01:00:01,792
You must get it together.

1138
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:48,500
"Three months later"

1139
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,875
"Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin"

1140
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,500
"Wedding"

1141
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,292
She's here.

1142
01:01:13,418 --> 01:01:15,709
My gosh! - Oh my.

1143
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:18,126
Ms. Cheon!

1144
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:20,542
You look absolutely stunning.

1145
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:22,917
Who'd believe you've been married before?

1146
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:25,667
Everyone would think you're 20.

1147
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:28,292
Chairman Joo is a lucky man.

1148
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:30,334
You could've got married right away.

1149
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:32,376
Why bother to get engaged at your age?

1150
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,209
This is an important time for our kids.

1151
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:36,292
And with all the upcoming concerts,

1152
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:37,292
I couldn't find the time.

1153
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:38,750
Don't you get it?

1154
01:01:39,084 --> 01:01:40,126
Marriage is like a business.

1155
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:41,667
You have to be very careful.

1156
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,376
When their companies merge,

1157
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:44,542
there will be issues with the stocks too.

1158
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,500
It'll be complicated to calculate alimony.

1159
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,750
Do you know how much money

1160
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:49,959
Dr. Ha took from her

1161
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:51,418
when they got divorced?

1162
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,917
Gosh, why would you bring that up today?

1163
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:56,542
There's no one else here now anyway.

1164
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,625
Let's be honest.

1165
01:01:57,709 --> 01:01:58,875
Even with Chairman Joo,

1166
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:00,834
she's too good for him.

1167
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:02,209
Everyone in this country

1168
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:03,459
knows Cheonga Foundation.

1169
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:06,959
Chairman Joo is one lucky man, you know?

1170
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:12,209
So when will your wedding be?

1171
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,542
Nothing's been decided yet.

1172
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I want to take my time

1173
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:18,500
and get to know him better.

1174
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:21,542
Or maybe I won't marry him after all.

1175
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,418
Congratulations! - You look beautiful!

1176
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,418
Thank you.

1177
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,667
Oh my! - Congratulations!

1178
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:52,042
Why do you look so tired?

1179
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:19,959
Congratulations, Mr. Joo.

1180
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:21,167
Thanks.

1181
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,209
What a beautiful sight.

1182
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,959
What's that?

1183
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:09,251
What? - What is that?

1184
01:04:13,418 --> 01:04:14,418
What is that thing?

1185
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:37,167
Well...

1186
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:39,000
How have you all been?

1187
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:41,917
Were you in the middle of something?

1188
01:05:43,418 --> 01:05:44,376
What?

1189
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,459
Why do you look so surprised?

1190
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:51,459
Am I not allowed to come here?

1191
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:57,750
Oh, let me introduce you

1192
01:05:58,251 --> 01:05:59,209
to my wife.

1193
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:01,167
Oh Yoon Hee.

1194
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:11,209
What?

1195
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:16,667
It's been a while.

1196
01:06:18,376 --> 01:06:19,625
Congratulations, Seo Jin.

1197
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,750
=Penthouse 2=

1198
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:57,167
You two are actually married?

1199
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:58,792
Watch how you speak about my woman.

1200
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,459
Ha Yoon Chul has changed.

1201
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,667
It's an honour to be invited to Hera Club.

1202
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,126
Are you here to see Ro Na?

1203
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:06,209
Did you forget who died in the penthouse?

1204
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:07,167
Let's be happy

1205
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:09,000
with our respective families.

1206
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:11,167
You may not be able to sing again.

1207
01:07:11,251 --> 01:07:13,209
This concert has to be perfect,

1208
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:14,875
no matter what.

1209
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:16,667
Will you go on about Ha Yoon Chul forever?

1210
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,792
He's not yours any more.

1211
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,959
I think another storm is coming.
