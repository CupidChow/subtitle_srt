Hello, sir.

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,706
You're home.

8
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,164
Bring Ms. Oh to the study.

9
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:18,514
She's waiting for you there.

10
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:21,608
What?

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,519
Looking over here

12
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:53,865
And over there

13
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,642
But I still can't find

14
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:02,267
Yoon Hee

15
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:29,918
She looks exactly like

16
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:31,517
Soo Ryeon.

17
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,892
It was you?

18
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,517
Did you come for me?

19
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,642
Of course.

20
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:55,892
What has got into you?

21
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,934
I just missed you.

22
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:07,558
Dad. May I come in?

23
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:17,918
What is it?

24
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:19,751
Ms. Oh was here, but she left.

25
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,335
Something urgent came up,

26
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,793
so she'll be back some other time.

27
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:25,543
Ms. An didn't see her leave.

28
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,460
Oh, I did.

29
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,809
She asked me to pass that onto you.

30
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,475
Okay, I see.

31
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,642
You should study.

32
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,975
Ms. Oh, where are you?

33
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,001
What?

34
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:49,918
My dad's back.

35
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,543
I told him you left,

36
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,142
so that's the story.

37
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:54,876
All right.

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,642
Thank you, Seok Hoon.

39
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,293
You surprised me.

40
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:03,850
You can't suddenly come without calling.

41
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:06,558
Weren't you the one who's in need, honey?

42
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,627
I brought the purchase agreement

43
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,725
for that building in Gangnam.

44
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,751
You know

45
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,418
that I own

46
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,642
half of this building, right?

47
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,642
We split this right down the middle.

48
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,543
If you get any weird ideas,

49
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,475
I'll make sure you're dead.

50
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,377
Once I open my mouth,

51
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,585
the name Joo Dan Tae

52
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,850
will be gone like that.

53
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,460
Don't you forget.

54
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,293
I know what you're like, Ae Gyo.

55
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,850
I've known you since you were 10.

56
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,043
I don't trust anything

57
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,434
other than the money I have in my hands.

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,267
I don't trust you

59
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,558
or me.

60
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,793
If you can't even trust me,

61
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,975
wouldn't that make your life too lonely?

62
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:02,850
You're the only one for me.

63
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,585
My dream is to live in this penthouse

64
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,934
happily ever after with you, Ae Gyo.

65
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:12,059
We're only days away from that dream.

66
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,351
My old pal, suspicion, kicked in again.

67
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:22,142
I was terribly lonely in Thailand.

68
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,517
- Were you really?
- Yes.

69
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,809
Here.

70
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,059
Thank you.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,475
Looks great.

72
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:39,793
Bye, then.

73
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,600
I kept the taxi waiting.

74
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,600
You can take my car.

75
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,517
It's all right.

76
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,710
I'll disappear like smoke

77
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,309
without letting anyone catch me.

78
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,101
"Deluxe Taxi"

79
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,502
Na Ae Gyo?

80
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,293
Find Na Ae Gyo.

81
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:21,267
She knows all of Joo Dan Tae's secrets.

82
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,081
"Deluxe Taxi"

83
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,293

85

Who the heck are you?

86
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:37,793
Why are you following me?

87
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,642
Soo Ryeon.

88
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,267
You were alive?

89
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,834
Soo Ryeon.

90
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:49,126
It's me. Don't you recognise me?

91
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,043
How would I know you?

92
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,059
It's you, Soo Ryeon.

93
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,460
You really don't remember me?

94
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:55,751
Why are you lying?

95
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,850
Don't you get what I'm saying?

96
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,226
I don't know who the heck you are.

97
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:04,017
Who is this crazy woman?

98
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,411
Wait, we need to talk.

99
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,158
"Na Ae Gyo"

100
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,101
See that?

101
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,393
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,876
You looked very much

103
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,558
like someone I know.

104
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,309
Don't touch my stuff.

105
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:40,850
"Voice Spy"

106
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,543
"Installing"

107
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,101
"Installation complete"

108
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,226
Hey, wait.

109
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:55,767
You dropped your phone.

110
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:58,710
What an awful day.

111
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,351
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,475
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,793
Logan.

114
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,669
I found Na Ae Gyo.

115
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:17,834
Where are you?

116
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,418
I'll be there now.

117
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,022
I installed a tapping app on her phone.

118
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,709
I'll call you when I find her residence.

119
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,085
All right, then.

120
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:26,293
Do give me a call.

121
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:27,975
I'll be waiting.

122
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:35,600
Soo Ryeon, I'm sorry

123
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,725
it took me so long.

124
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,627
Why are you

125
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,267
all packed up?

126
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,475
Let's end this.

127
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:20,101
There's the divorce paper.

128
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,210
"Declaration of Divorce"

129
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,418
"Husband: Ha Yoon Chul"

130
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,017
"Wife"

131
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,184
Why should we?

132
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm done with this revenge and everything.

133
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:42,017
What is this?

134
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,184
You lost Ro Na,

135
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:47,101
and I only hurt Eun Byeol.

136
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,017
I can't do this anymore.

137
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:50,642
So?

138
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,059
Do you have to do this now?

139
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,684
It has only been four days

140
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,475
since Ro Na was buried.

141
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,876
We have only married on paper anyway.

142
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,460
What did you expect from a guy like me?

143
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:14,184
This is nothing but a show.

144
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,017
Did you

145
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,809
actually want me to be your husband?

146
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,293
See? Get that!

147
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,393
- Come on. What's the matter?
- You good?

148
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,918
Pull yourself together.

149
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:34,834
Destroying yourself

150
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,669
will only make them happy.

151
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:38,751
Why are you here again?

152
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,475
I told you to stop coming to see me.

153
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,558
Look.

154
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,600
See this?

155
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,918
Thanks to that jerk, Joo Dan Tae,

156
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,725
my petty career as a doctor ended.

157
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,585
So, what now?

158
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,475
Now that my life is doomed,

159
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:06,600
I'll ruin it for good.

160
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:11,184
Yoon Chul.

161
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,850
Let's go back to Korea.

162
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,892
Let's go back and get our revenge

163
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,558
on Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

164
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:21,600
Let's do this together, please?

165
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,351
Yoon Hee.

166
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,267
You and I are losers.

167
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:29,335
We completely lost.

168
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,627
What can we do anyway?

169
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,351
There is

170
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,482
no hospital that will take me

171
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,537
even if I go back to Korea.

172
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,360
No one is there to welcome you either.

173
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,725
A talented man like you can do anything.

174
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,669
You can start a business or get a job.

175
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:46,669
Try doing anything.

176
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,393
I'll help you.

177
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,226
We've seen the worst in life.

178
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:53,684
We have nothing to be afraid of.

179
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,558
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin

180
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,684
are getting engaged soon.

181
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,434
The real reason I wanted to get revenge

182
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,460
all stemmed from my love for Seo Jin.

183
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,434
I was never over her.

184
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,309
I finally realised

185
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,934
that I'm still in love with Seo Jin.

186
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:28,558
Does it make things easier

187
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,226
when you talk like that?

188
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:37,834
Are you an idiot?

189
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:38,751
Are you that clueless,

190
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,460
or are you just pretending?

191
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:42,210
I wanted to return before Seo Jin

192
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:44,751
as a successful businessman by using you.

193
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,126
You were nothing but a tool to begin with.

194
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,475
I can never let go of her!

195
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,725
I'm a scumbag like that. That's me!

196
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,850
You jerk.

197
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:11,226
I'll stay out

198
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,309
until the paperwork is done.

199
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,059
Ro Na...

200
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,309
adored you very much.

201
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,543
One, two.

202
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,393
You should join us too.

203
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:34,418
What?

204
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:36,393
Let's take a picture together.

205
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,418
Right.

206
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,226
Shall we?

207
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,251
Excuse me, could you take a photo for us?

208
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,850
Sure.

209
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,142
Okay, I'll take it now.

210
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:50,600
One, two.

211
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,669
What's with that suitcase?

212
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:47,850
Are you going somewhere this late?

213
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,502
Wait, no way.

214
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,184
No, right?

215
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,627
Wait.

216
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:55,142
Did you two fight in this situation?

217
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,710
Even so, you can't pack up and leave

218
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:58,460
if you're a man.

219
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:00,043
Is that what's going on?

220
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,085
Let me go.

221
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,168
Don't meddle with other people's business.

222
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,543
Other people?

223
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:08,168
Yoon Hee is like my own sister.

224
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,710
You're leaving because you're guilty, no?

225
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,710
Mind your own business!

226
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,267
Goodness.

227
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:16,085
You. You!

228
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,627
If you're getting any weird ideas,

229
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm going to kill you.

230
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,475
I keep hearing this odd melody.

231
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:28,377
Mi, fa, sol, fa, mi, mi,

232
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,892
mi, re, ti, re, mi.

233
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,418
Everything is such a mess.

234
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,126
Ro Na died,

235
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,351
and now mum's retired.

236
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:40,543
My head is a mess, and it drives me crazy.

237
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,834
You still don't remember that day?

238
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,585
I don't recall anything

239
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,725
other than what Mum told me.

240
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:49,960
You'll slowly recover memories.

241
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,809
Don't rush yourself.

242
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,251
So Ro Na died before she found out

243
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:56,725
she won the grand prize.

244
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,210
She was punished for wanting something

245
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,892
that wasn't hers, right?

246
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,793
I'll put you to sleep.

247
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,393
Let's go to sleep.

248
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,502
She came out.

249
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,751
There she is.

your permanent expulsion as a singer?

253
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,210
Rumours say your shadow singer was

254
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:18,126
a friend from your high school.

255
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,043
Is that true?

on your side have recently turned away.

00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,059
any punishment willingly.

346
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:09,434
Joo Dan Tae already knew?

347
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,809
"Noise Control"

348
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,059
Take your seat, everyone.

349
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:56,293
We had a faculty meeting

350
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:58,418
and came to decision just now.

351
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,502
Because Ro Na, the grand prize winner

352
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,251
of Cheonga Arts Festival

353
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,517
has passed away,

354
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:05,335
the recommendation for Seoul University

355
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,184
goes to the gold prize winner,

356
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:09,543
Joo Seok Kyung instead.

357
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,168
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

358
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:12,751
Seok Kyung gets the free pass

359
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,251
for admission to Seoul University?

360
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:16,460
Man, this is huge.

361
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:17,377
"Practical Test: 187 days away"

362
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:18,460
"CSAT: 221 days away"

363
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,309
Midterms are about to begin.

364
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,085
Your grades

365
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,585
in the senior year are the most important.

366
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,418
Forget all the unfortunate events,

367
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,293
and focus on your studies.

368
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:28,168
Do you understand?

369
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:29,627
- Yes.
- Yes.

370
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,043
Let's see.

371
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,418
In that sense,

372
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,293
let's get rid of those flowers.

373
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,251
I think we mourned her long enough.

374
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:38,475
Okay, I'll throw it out.

375
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,267
Get your hands off.

376
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,725
If anyone touches those flowers,

377
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,101
I'll kill you.

378
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,168
Eun Hoo, are you dying to end your life?

379
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,960
That's what I meant!

380
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:59,043
You're all awfully cold-hearted.

381
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,251
One of your friends died,

382
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:03,142
but none of you seems to be truly sad.

383
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,142
Seok Hoon, where are you going?

384
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:09,751
Oh, you're leaving school early?

385
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:11,502
Go home safely. Yes.

386
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:14,101
Gosh, you're so good at answering me.

387
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,168
What are you looking at?

388
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,377
Open your books.

389
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:19,561
"Bae Ro Na, April 8, 2004 - April 3, 2022"

390
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:21,488
"Chocolate Milk"

391
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,293
"Chocolate Milk"

392
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,418
Thanks, Ro Na.

393
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:35,059
Thank you for the milk.

394
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,684
Sure.

395
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,517
Why did you keep this?

396
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:59,351
It's good.

397
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:07,850
Isn't it cold there?

398
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:11,226
I'll come back again tomorrow.

399
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:13,377
I don't want to--

400
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,809
You'll see once we get there.

401
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,642
What are you doing at my place?

402
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,669
Goodness, you were there?

403
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,418
I thought you weren't home,

404
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:27,335
so I was really disappointed I missed you.

405
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,543
You know my mother-in-law is a good cook.

406
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,085
I packed only the dishes

407
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,460
that you love, Ma Ri.

408
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:33,876
Do you want some?

409
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,251
I'm busy right now.

410
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,168
Why?

411
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:37,793
None of your business.

412
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:41,251
Goodness, let me tag along.

413
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:43,767
Are you going to see the three ladies?

414
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,918
Forget it.

415
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,585
Now that I can see right through you,

416
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,126
my appetite is suddenly all gone.

417
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,085
Don't lurk around my house

418
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:52,793
smelling like those side dishes.

419
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,892
Take everything and go home.

420
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:57,017
Goodness.

421
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,710
That crude woman.

422
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:02,059
How dare you speak to me like that?

423
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:06,001
Gosh, I need to hold myself back.

424
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:09,377
Sang A, be patient for Kyu Jin.

425
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:11,335
Now, keep an eye on what I do,

426
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,793
and do exactly that.

427
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:15,502
First, brace your arms,

428
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:18,001
then start brushing.

429
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,085
Ma Ri.

430
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:21,377
If you see water stains, rub them.

431
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,543
Snap your wrists.

432
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,600
If you don't, your wrists will hurt.

433
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,168
Why are you standing around?

434
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,751
You're in charge of the cold bath tub.

435
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,126
If you don't do your job properly,

436
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,059
I'm not going to pay you.

437
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,475
Get to work!

438
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:47,085
Hey, over there. The corner.

439
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:49,377
Make sure you get the corners too.

440
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,043
- All right.
- Good.

441
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,751
Make sure you keep your wrists steady.

442
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,001
Yes, and your arms.

443
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:55,335
All right.

444
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,085
That's it. Keep it up.

445
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:01,085
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

446
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:04,669
When times are tough, look up into the sky

447
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:08,751
You are never alone

448
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,918
Even if it rains and the heavy wind blows

449
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:18,085
The sun will shine again

450
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,001
That's right.

451
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:22,418
When you want to cry in so much pain

452
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:26,960
Try shouting out loudly just once

453
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:31,475
So that the delicate sadness won't find me

454
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:35,725
And run away once again

455
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:40,809
Here. Eat up.

456
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:43,418
The jjajangmyeon you eat at a public bath

457
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:45,725
is the best.

458
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:48,850
I'm

459
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,059
actually hungry.

460
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,210
How brazen of me.

461
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:55,669
It's not sinning to fill your stomach

462
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:58,293
even if you lost your kid or your husband.

463
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,934
Eat up.

464
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:02,725
Your heart must be torn into pieces.

465
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,085
I saw him yesterday.

466
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:07,126
Mr. Ha, I mean,

467
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,184
that scumbag packing up and leaving.

468
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,210
It didn't look like

469
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:13,918
you two had just a little fight.

470
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:16,850
Did that scumbag want to split up?

471
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:22,543
He might as well freeze to his demise.

472
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:26,475
That freaking jerk, the scum of the earth.

473
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,251
People say their true nature comes out

474
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:29,502
when they hit the rock bottom.

475
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:31,126
How can he turn his back on you

476
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,267
after seeing his wife's life torn apart?

477
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:35,627
The noodles are getting soggy.

478
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:37,226
Let's eat.

479
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:40,876
What can I possibly say to comfort you

480
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,101
when you lost your child?

481
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:47,142
But don't get any bad ideas.

482
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,210
Make sure that

483
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:52,850
you continue to stand in this world.

484
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:55,059
That's what Ro Na wants.

485
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:57,517
You get what I'm saying, right?

486
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:09,558
I'm going to hold out no matter what.

487
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:13,434
I'm going to find a way to live.

488
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:30,168
Yes, all right.

489
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:32,293
Look at this jjajangmyeon.

490
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:34,558
You have to eat it without biting it off.

491
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:42,351
Who wrote that?

492
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:48,184
What is this?

493
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,642
That's Ha Eun Byeol.

494
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,059
"Fake Soprano Junior, Ha Eun Byeol"

495
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:02,793
Who did this?

496
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:05,267
Don't be so immature!

497
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:09,627
Hey, I heard Ms. Cheon is getting sacked.

498
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:11,418
You're really tough.

499
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:13,043
How can you memorise English words

500
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,377
when your mum is about to get locked up?

501
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:15,502
Shouldn't you apologise to us

502
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,751
on behalf of your mum, Eun Byeol?

503
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:20,309
You're a fake too.

504
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,585
You don't have any skills,

505
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,585
but you paraded around like a big shot.

506
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:25,335
You have been a real eyesore.

507
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,834
To be honest,

508
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:29,001
Ro Na was way better than you.

509
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:30,684
You give her that, right?

510
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:32,751
Go away.

511
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:34,558
Move aside!

512
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:44,210
- What are you doing?
- Move!

513
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:45,669
This is bad luck.

514
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:47,809
Why is the dead girl's desk still here?

515
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,293
Watch what you say.

516
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:51,751
Bad luck?

517
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:52,876
Why is Ro Na bad luck?

518
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,834
Don't talk like that

519
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,335
about a girl who died a terrible death.

520
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,126
Did you just slap me?

521
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,850
How dare you?

522
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,627
Je Ni's right.

523
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:04,184
What happened to Ro Na is terrible.

524
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:05,710
Seok Kyung.

525
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,793
You of all people can't say that.

526
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:09,975
Why can't I?

527
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,475
I didn't kill her.

528
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:16,351
I've been meaning to ask you.

529
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,017
When the grand prize winner was announced,

530
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,543
you were with Ro Na, right?

531
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:22,834
No.

532
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:23,918
I didn't see her.

533
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:26,475
Only you two weren't in the green room.

534
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,335
Tell us.

535
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,393
Where were you and what were you doing?

536
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:35,751
I was...

537
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:37,293
You took

538
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,585
too many pills.

539
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,751
So you were in the infirmary.

540
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:43,043
Then you collapsed

541
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:45,168
right before the winner was announced,

542
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,475
so Mr. Do brought you home.

543
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,210
I was in the infirmary.

544
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,767
I got dizzy because of my pills.

545
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,627
Are you sure?

546
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:55,876
Really?

547
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,558
Did anyone see you?

548
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,517
Are you okay?

549
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:47,934
Seok Hoon.

550
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:50,460
What happened?

551
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:53,017
You suddenly fainted in the classroom.

552
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,809
I have a splitting headache.

553
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:10,475
You really aren't feeling well.

554
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:12,377
I heard you collapsed

555
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:13,975
during Cheonga Arts Festival too.

556
00:32:14,192 --> 00:32:15,585
Yes.

557
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,267
I guess.

558
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:23,017
It's a little disappointing.

559
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,710
You don't seem

560
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:28,142
to remember what happened on that day.

561
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,460
You don't remember

562
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,475
what you said at the stone staircase?

563
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,934
What did I say?

564
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,351
You really don't remember?

565
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:44,142
I asked you out because of what you said.

566
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,309
I loved it.

567
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,226
I'll get going, then.

568
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:56,642
Seok Hoon.

569
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:12,767
What did I say to him when I was here?

570
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:15,934
Gosh, I can't remember anything.

571
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:22,751
Make sure you remember

572
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,767
what you have done.

573
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:42,085
Goodness. What is it, Yoon Hee?

574
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:44,434
You came out to see Kyu Jin.

575
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,293
As you know,

576
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,085
I have no one to depend on.

577
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,502
So I kept thinking,

578
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:53,377
then I remembered how nice you were to me

579
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:55,335
like you were my older brother.

580
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,710
Kyu Jin is known as an assemblyman

581
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,168
who always listens to what people say.

582
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:00,669
On top of that,

583
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:02,585
we're like siblings, right?

584
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:04,934
That's the more reason to be all ears.

585
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,918
Look at me.

586
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:08,585
You trust your brother, right?

587
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,642
You can tell me everything.

588
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,059
What am I going to do now, Kyu Jin?

589
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:24,642
Whoa, goodness.

590
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,475
Goodness.

591
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,210
It wasn't me.

592
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,809
Hey.

593
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,475
Goodness.

594
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:43,751
I knew they'd end up like that.

595
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:45,710
I had a feeling.

596
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,001
Not long ago,

597
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:49,210
I ran into Yoon Chul late at night.

598
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:50,918
I badmouthed Seo Jin a little,

599
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:51,918
then he said,

600
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,418
"If you got drunk,

601
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:55,834
go home and just sleep.

602
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,751
Stop talking nonsense out here."

603
00:34:57,775 --> 00:34:58,960
He said that to me.

604
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:00,001
I couldn't understand why

605
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:02,085
he was so angry when they're already over.

606
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:05,210
The puzzle is finally coming together.

607
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:07,335
What a huge scumbag.

608
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,793
There are rules in having an affair.

609
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,751
He should find a total stranger,

610
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:12,834
or if he couldn't find one,

611
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:15,085
he should've asked me to set him up.

612
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:17,710
You know, like pen pals or secret buddies.

613
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:20,502
But wait, he went back to his ex-wife?

614
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:22,475
He's out of his mind.

615
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:25,126
He suddenly asked me for a divorce,

616
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,975
so I couldn't stay in my right mind.

617
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:30,710
I'm right here.

618
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,502
Don't worry about it.

619
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:34,502
Back when I was a divorce lawyer,

620
00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:36,043
I was a really big shot.

621
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,418
Yoon Hee,

622
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:40,059
you just need to do as I say.

623
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:46,085
What should I do starting now,

624
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:47,377
Kyu Jin?

625
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:49,502
The most important thing in a divorce is

626
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,377
identifying why the marriage broke down.

627
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,210
You need to find evidence

628
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,475
that proves they're having an affair.

629
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,960
I'll refer you to a great divorce lawyer

630
00:35:57,984 --> 00:36:00,001
who's a junior of mine.

631
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,543
Goodness, you look so worn out.

632
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,142
Okay.

633
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:07,876
Anyway, does Dan Tae know

634
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,850
this important new information or not?

635
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:15,043
Don't hold yourself back and run, Kyu Jin.

636
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,892
I only want one thing from you.

637
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:21,834
You girls are the ones who pay me to work.

638
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:23,418
You pay taxes, right?

639
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:24,751
I'm so thankful.

640
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:25,669
I have nothing to give you,

641
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:27,850
so please take these.

642
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,126
Mr. Lee.

643
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,251
Why did you want to see me

644
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:39,669
at a place like this?

645
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:41,168
Did you get some unexpected money?

646
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,585
I'm going to drink as much as I want

647
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:43,751
since you'll buy, Chairman Joo.

648
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:45,377
Don't try to stop me.

649
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,669
I'm taking the most expensive

650
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:47,751
and prestigious bottle.

651
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,502
I don't owe you anything.

652
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:51,210
You'll owe me something soon.

653
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,502
Here, take a glass.

654
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:56,267
What is it that it's taking you long?

655
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:57,793
My mum said

656
00:36:57,817 --> 00:37:00,627
waiting is the key to making tasty rice.

657
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,543
Give me a moment.

658
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,751
You know that Seo Jin and I go way back.

659
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,251
We went to the same English preschool

660
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,751
and the private primary school in Apgu-ri,

661
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:10,043
and you know, when my family first

662
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:12,001
moved into Simwoon Mansion,

663
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:14,210
her family lived in the next block.

664
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,293
Cut to the chase.

665
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,934
Don't get so cheeky.

666
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:19,725
Yoon Chul and Yoon Hee are

667
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:21,517
getting divorced.

668
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,460
- Why?
- What do you think?

669
00:37:24,484 --> 00:37:27,309
Gosh, this guy can't take a hint, right?

670
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,684
It's all because of Seo Jin.

671
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,351
Yoon Chul and Seo Jin are...

672
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:39,642
Power Up.

673
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:48,210
Then I should listen to what

674
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:51,975
you have to say since you can take a hint.

675
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:09,267
Spend some time away from the company.

676
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:12,309
We must calm down our shareholders first.

677
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:15,793
Why didn't you discuss it with me sooner?

678
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:18,751
Why keep it all to yourself like a fool?

679
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:20,434
It was Oh Yoon Hee.

680
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,377
What?

681
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,767
The ghost singer.

682
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,975
It was Yoon Hee.

683
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,642
Are you sure it was her?

684
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:34,475
What the heck happened between you two?

685
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,017
Joo Dan Tae.

686
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,918
Did you orchestrate all of this

687
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:44,934
to make Cheonga Group yours?

688
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:49,309
After all, this is

689
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:52,934
the kind of man you are.

690
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:01,293
The things you told me

691
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:02,669
about the night Ro Na died.

692
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:04,393
Is it all true?

693
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:05,918
What do you mean?

694
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,335
Is it true that I fainted

695
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,351
and was brought home?

696
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,085
Of course, it's true.

697
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:14,642
I have no reason to lie to you.

698
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:17,684
Why do you ask?

699
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,351
Do you...

700
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,142
remember something about the night?

701
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:25,710
Why?

702
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:27,001
Is there something

703
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,934
I shouldn't remember?

704
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,142
It's me.

705
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:44,844
Where are you?

706
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:50,017
"JohnBIO"

707
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:02,214
"JohnBIO"

708
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:06,043
What?

709
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,934
You slept here?

710
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:11,017
What's with the suitcase?

711
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,751
I moved out.

712
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:14,627
And you're staying here?

713
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,585
Work's busy, so this is better anyway.

714
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:18,767
Booking a hotel is a hassle.

715
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,059
What happened with Yoon Hee?

716
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,767
I told her I want a divorce.

717
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:27,142
That doesn't mean I'll go back to you.

718
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:30,558
I don't deserve to be with Yoon Hee.

719
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:32,892
That's why I left her.

720
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,684
I'm glad you did.

721
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:37,751
You should look for a place to live.

722
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,892
You can't stay here forever.

723
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,017
I'll figure out what to do.

724
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,558
How's Eun Byeol?

725
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,876
Are you sure her memory is gone?

726
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,918
I'm making sure she takes her pills,

727
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:51,850
but I'm so anxious.

728
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,251
It seems like

729
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:55,126
she's starting to remember things,

730
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,226
but she won't talk to me.

731
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,434
Have you been eating?

732
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,642
I hope you're not skipping meals.

733
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:11,918
Stay strong for Eun Byeol,

734
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:13,600
no matter what.

735
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:15,751
If you get shaken up too,

736
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,475
Eun Byeol is doomed.

737
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:25,434
What's wrong with your hand?

738
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,934
Nothing. I think it's just a cramp.

739
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,725
Did you

740
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:34,210
hurt your hand?

741
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:35,850
Is that why?

742
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:40,043
Who are you?

743
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,377
Why are you doing this?

744
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:42,669
Looks like you put your hands

745
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:44,168
on the wrong woman.

746
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,210
Who sent you?

747
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,585
Was it Joo Dan Tae? That jerk!

748
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:49,809
- Break his hands.
- Got you.

749
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:55,005
No!

750
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,318
Why are you telling me this now?

751
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:01,944
This is my fault.

752
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:03,109
No, it's not your fault.

753
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:05,026
Don't worry. It's none of your business.

754
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,485
It is my business too.

755
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:08,125
I know...

756
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,750
how hard you worked to become a doctor

757
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:14,923
and how much you loved your job.

758
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:18,118
This is all because of Joo Dan Tae.

759
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:20,167
I won't let this go unpunished.

760
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:22,000
That conniving jerk.

761
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,000
What are you going to do?

762
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:26,818
I'll break off the engagement at once.

763
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:27,653
What?

764
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,926
I never loved that man.

765
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,310
I just hated that you couldn't

766
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:34,034
get over Yoon Hee

767
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,018
and needed someone

768
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:36,934
who'd treat me like a lady.

769
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:39,726
I was wrong to believe that was love.

770
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:41,659
If I marry him,

771
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,845
Eun Byeol will become miserable too.

772
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,117
I'm sorry.

773
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,642
For putting you through all this

774
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,683
because of that scum

775
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,082
and destroying our relationship.

776
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:00,810
It's all in the past,

777
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,393
and it can't be undone.

778
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:04,284
It can be undone.

779
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,333
I'm letting my pride go to beg you.

780
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,783
Please stay with me.

781
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,492
I told you not to do that.

782
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:54,992
You're late.

783
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,451
Where were you?

784
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:00,992
I almost fell asleep.

785
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:03,075
Like you care.

786
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:10,435
I couldn't reach my fiancee

787
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:12,101
late into the night.

788
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,367
Of course, I was worried.

789
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,117
Oh, what's going on with your dismissal?

790
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:20,618
Shall I try to persuade the board members?

791
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:23,326
What are you really after?

792
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:24,976
Do you want me to leave Cheonga Group

793
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,727
in your hands and just be

794
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,393
the chief director of the school

795
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,367
until I grow old and die?

796
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,075
Why are you so angry?

797
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,143
Well, I understand.

798
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,159
Things have been stressful for you.

799
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:41,018
You knew that Yoon Hee sang for me.

800
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:42,852
I bet you were the one who ratted me out

801
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:44,534
to the foundation.

802
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,351
How dare you threaten my secretary

803
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,852
to do something so sneaky?

804
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:48,976
Why?

805
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,351
You want to rush the merger that badly?

806
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,935
You never wanted me.

807
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:54,476
You were after Cheonga Group!

808
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,742
Deny it if you can!

809
00:44:58,918 --> 00:45:00,492
Your family

810
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,034
is equally obsessed with money.

811
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:07,409
You scumbag.

812
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,560
Now that I know what kind of jerk you are,

813
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,659
I can't marry you.

814
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:16,451
We're over.

815
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,618
Get out!

816
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,742
Cheon Seo Jin.

817
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:41,700
You'll regret this.

818
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,185
Hello, Attorney Park.

819
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:53,602
I want to break off the engagement

820
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,101
as soon as possible.

821
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,783
The merger too.

822
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:58,852
Void it altogether.

823
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:00,935
The agreement states that Cheonga Group

824
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,310
won't be formally established

825
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,326
until after the wedding.

826
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,185
Okay, please take care of it for me.

827
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:11,242
Ma'am, you need to come out for a minute.

828
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,284
Detectives are here.

829
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:17,576
Detectives?

830
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:29,560
There are many eyes and ears in our home.

831
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,727
We can talk comfortably here.

832
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:33,618
Why do you

833
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,284
need to see Eun Byeol?

834
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:37,935
There are some things

835
00:46:37,959 --> 00:46:39,560
we need to confirm with her

836
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:41,435
regarding Bae Ro Na's death.

837
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:43,976
Isn't the case already closed?

838
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,618
It's a shame that Ro Na died,

839
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,059
but why do you need to speak

840
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,992
to Eun Byeol because of that?

841
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:53,685
Because she's our prime suspect.

842
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:56,018
We've found solid evidence.

843
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:57,659
Evidence?

844
00:46:58,292 --> 00:46:59,950
This necklace.

845
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,143
It's your daughter's, right?

846
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,143
We found her DNA

847
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,909
and the victim's blood on it.

848
00:47:08,209 --> 00:47:10,727
The janitor already confessed

849
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:11,685
that he was paid

850
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:13,101
to give a false confession.

851
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,018
Oh, Ha Yoon Chul is being interviewed

852
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,435
at the precinct now.

853
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,492
Your daughter killed Ro Na, didn't she?

854
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,310
The person who struck the victim

855
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:24,685
on the head with the trophy that day

856
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,351
was Ha Eun Byeol, right?

857
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,560
You and Ha Yoon Chul made someone else

858
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:31,367
take the fall to cover that up!

859
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:40,392
Did you kill Bae Ro Na at the hospital

860
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,335
out of fear that the truth

861
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,376
would come out?

862
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,975
No.

863
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:46,543
No.

864
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:47,710
Arrest Ha Eun Byeol!

865
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:50,142
No! Stop!

866
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:52,919
Eun Byeol didn't do anything wrong.

867
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:54,293
I did it.

868
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:56,418
I bribed the janitor and killed Ro Na.

869
00:47:56,442 --> 00:47:57,668
It was all me.

870
00:47:57,692 --> 00:48:00,517
Eun Byeol knows nothing.

871
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:02,960
If you touch my daughter,

872
00:48:02,984 --> 00:48:04,627
I will kill you!

873
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:08,100
My, your maternal love moved me to tears.

874
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:09,418
Your love for your daughter

875
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:11,476
and for your ex-husband.

876
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,343
I'm all choked up.

877
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:16,025
Dan Tae.

878
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:17,802
- Sir.
- Yes.

879
00:48:17,826 --> 00:48:19,718
Take your team out for dinner.

880
00:48:19,742 --> 00:48:21,359
Thank you.

881
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:24,762
Let's have a barbecue!

882
00:48:24,787 --> 00:48:26,320
Sounds good.

883
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:29,301
- That was so moving.
- Arrest Ha Eun Byeol!

884
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:30,510
No! Stop!

885
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:31,885
What a confession.

886
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,203
- Don't tell me...
- Eun Byeol didn't do

887
00:48:33,228 --> 00:48:34,051
anything wrong.

888
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:35,817
- Did you plan this?
- I did it.

889
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:38,885
You want to break off the engagement.

890
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:40,385
Why?

891
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:42,858
To go back to Ha Yoon Chul?

892
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:45,218
How long has it been?

893
00:48:45,242 --> 00:48:47,677
Since that jerk returned to Hera Palace?

894
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:49,134
Or,

895
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:51,885
since the night I shattered his hand?

896
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,817
You scumbag!

897
00:48:56,742 --> 00:48:58,526
What? "Scumbag"?

898
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,343
Did you think I wouldn't know?

899
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:04,192
In New York, you and that jerk...

900
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:08,468
You betrayed me.

901
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:09,677
Get away.

902
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:11,359
Get away from me!

903
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:17,984
Should I take this evidence

904
00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:20,025
to the police now?

905
00:49:20,075 --> 00:49:22,510
No, no.

906
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:23,843
It'd be much more fun

907
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:25,900
to send it to Yoon Hee.

908
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:28,301
She lost her only child, so if I tell her

909
00:49:28,325 --> 00:49:30,900
that her husband betrayed her as well...

910
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:34,927
I can't wait to see exactly how

911
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:37,567
she'll rip you and Eun Byeol to shreds.

912
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:40,234
You...

913
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,067
You're insane.

914
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,051
This is what you get for betraying me.

915
00:49:48,075 --> 00:49:49,775
Don't tell me

916
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:51,510
you didn't expect this much

917
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:54,484
when you decided to call off our wedding.

918
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,677
What should I do?

919
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:58,176
What must I do

920
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,567
to completely shatter Eun Byeol's heart?

921
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:04,192
You choose.

922
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,484
I think

923
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:09,426
telling Yoon Hee would be the most fun.

924
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,885
No.

925
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:11,885
Don't!

926
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,385
No! You can't do that.

927
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:14,677
No!

928
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:17,426
I'll do anything you say,

929
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,150
so don't do anything.

930
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,885
I'll do whatever you say.

931
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:23,051
So please leave Eun Byeol alone.

932
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:24,134
Please.

933
00:50:24,158 --> 00:50:25,593
Please, I beg you.

934
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:27,234
Please.

935
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:29,775
Can you

936
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:33,025
really do anything I tell you?

937
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:05,593
What's this?

938
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:08,745
"Join us to celebrate our union."

939
00:51:14,284 --> 00:51:15,176
"Invitation"

940
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,942
Joo Dan Tae, this scum...

941
00:51:23,534 --> 00:51:25,401
What the heck?

942
00:51:26,034 --> 00:51:28,755
"JohnBIO"

943
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:31,484
The phone is turned off.

944
00:51:40,252 --> 00:51:41,785
"Unit 8501, Calling"

945
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:47,551
Seo Jin, open up.

946
00:51:47,575 --> 00:51:49,150
We need to talk.

947
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:50,817
Seo Jin!

948
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,192
Open up! Let's talk!

949
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:57,067
Seo Jin, let me in!

950
00:51:57,826 --> 00:51:59,442
Open up!

951
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,843
Let's talk.

952
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,651
We need to talk!

953
00:52:12,867 --> 00:52:14,343
Seo Jin.

954
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:16,067
Seo Jin!

955
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:24,317
Did you get it?

956
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,134
The wedding invitation.

957
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:28,900
Yes, I see that it's in two weeks.

958
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,109
I didn't know Chairman Joo would do this.

959
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:36,343
He knows that Seo Jin betrayed him,

960
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:38,651
but he's still pushing ahead with it.

961
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,718
Does he love her that much?

962
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,093
There must be an important reason

963
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:46,234
why he can't dump her.

964
00:52:47,284 --> 00:52:50,150
I have to go. I have an appointment.

965
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,718
What appointment, sweetie?

966
00:52:51,742 --> 00:52:53,900
You promised to tell me everything.

967
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:55,526
Hello?

968
00:52:55,826 --> 00:52:56,969
Hee.

969
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:58,567
Hee!

970
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:03,260
"Sweetie"?

971
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,484
"Hee"?

972
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:07,359
Hee

973
00:53:08,242 --> 00:53:11,858
Please look at me

974
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:20,317
- You used to like me
- You used to like me

975
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:22,942
- Hee
- Hee

976
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,677
I'm sorry I had to cancel last time.

977
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:29,593
Why did you want to meet?

978
00:53:29,617 --> 00:53:31,468
I'm sure you already know.

979
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:33,051
I want to know

980
00:53:33,075 --> 00:53:35,651
how you ended up owning Hye In's land.

981
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:38,093
Hye In is my daughter.

982
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:40,984
She is Soo Ryeon's daughter.

983
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:44,843
Soo Ryeon gave the power of attorney

984
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:46,218
to someone else,

985
00:53:46,242 --> 00:53:48,775
so you probably didn't get the notice.

986
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:51,093
It makes sense.

987
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:53,510
You never deserved to be her dad anyway,

988
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,134
so it's only natural.

989
00:53:55,158 --> 00:53:56,343
There are no plans

990
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,635
to develop Cheonsu District.

991
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:00,010
Why would you want the land

992
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:01,760
in such a run-down area?

993
00:54:01,784 --> 00:54:03,677
Aren't you the one who built

994
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:06,858
Cheonga Arts Centre in that district?

995
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,176
You're quite greedy for someone

996
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,567
who just lost her daughter.

997
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:14,760
In the past, I was fully devoted

998
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,817
to raising my daughter well.

999
00:54:17,492 --> 00:54:19,150
But now,

1000
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,317
she's gone.

1001
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:24,275
So I have a new goal now.

1002
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:27,192
I want to become

1003
00:54:27,284 --> 00:54:29,484
extremely wealthy.

1004
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:34,218
I'll do whatever it takes to become rich.

1005
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:36,942
Rich enough to own this penthouse.

1006
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:40,900
Ro Na wanted to live here.

1007
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:44,010
The penthouse?

1008
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,109
Why don't we make a bet?

1009
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,176
Who do you think

1010
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,775
will be living here in a year from now?

1011
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:56,609
Ms. Cheon is here, sir.

1012
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,010
Why are you so surprised?

1013
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:08,510
I stopped by to discuss some business.

1014
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:10,109
Don't get the wrong idea.

1015
00:55:10,534 --> 00:55:12,635
I didn't know you had a guest.

1016
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:13,677
I'll come back later.

1017
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:15,468
Oh, it's okay.

1018
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:17,651
I was about to leave anyway.

1019
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:20,942
It's been a while, Eun Byeol.

1020
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:23,551
I heard you were unwell. Are you okay now?

1021
00:55:23,575 --> 00:55:24,760
Yes.

1022
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,260
I'm glad to hear that.

1023
00:55:26,284 --> 00:55:28,484
It's nice to see you healthy again.

1024
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,025
Do you meet your dad often?

1025
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:34,359
Why would you ask that?

1026
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,942
I'm just a little jealous. That's all.

1027
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:40,858
Ro Na grew up without a dad, you know.

1028
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,593
And she can't see

1029
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:44,817
her new dad any more

1030
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:47,025
because she's dead.

1031
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:56,359
Oh, congratulations on your wedding.

1032
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:58,510
Chairman Joo was kind enough

1033
00:55:58,534 --> 00:56:01,150
to send me an invitation.

1034
00:56:01,242 --> 00:56:03,484
I'll see you at your wedding.

1035
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:09,051
What?

1036
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:10,775
Aren't you two high school friends?

1037
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:17,677
Our wedding is in two weeks.

1038
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:19,843
We're really becoming a family now,

1039
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:21,567
so let's all get along.

1040
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:25,593
Nonsense.

1041
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:27,734
This is such a stupid idea.

1042
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:29,843
Mum, I thought things were good again

1043
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:31,609
between you and Dad.

1044
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:35,718
Do you want me to be hurt even more?

1045
00:56:35,742 --> 00:56:36,969
I'm sick of the other kids

1046
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,468
pointing the finger at me.

1047
00:56:38,492 --> 00:56:40,858
Now, I have to put up with this wedding?

1048
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:42,760
Tell him now.

1049
00:56:42,784 --> 00:56:45,192
Tell him that you can't marry him!

1050
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:47,442
This is

1051
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,010
my choice.

1052
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:51,134
I guess you're not ready

1053
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,317
to accept me as your dad yet.

1054
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:55,051
That's okay.

1055
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:56,635
We'll work on it little by little.

1056
00:56:56,659 --> 00:56:58,442
I really hate this.

1057
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:01,359
I'll never accept this marriage.

1058
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:08,176
I agree with Eun Byeol for once.

1059
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,677
I will never accept

1060
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,609
this ridiculous marriage either.

1061
00:57:13,284 --> 00:57:14,969
Congratulations.

1062
00:57:14,993 --> 00:57:17,317
You two are perfect for each other.

1063
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,718
This is insane!

1064
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:28,635
Sit back down.

1065
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:30,301
Please stop.

1066
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,927
If you want money,

1067
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:33,760
I'll compensate you as much as you want,

1068
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,010
so let's please call off--

1069
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,609
Shut it!

1070
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:41,593
In this game, you have no choice.

1071
00:57:41,617 --> 00:57:43,858
I decide whether we get married or not!

1072
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:45,010
All you have to do

1073
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:46,051
is move into this penthouse

1074
00:57:46,075 --> 00:57:47,677
as my wife on the day that I choose.

1075
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:49,317
Do you understand?

1076
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:51,734
Ms. An!

1077
00:57:52,325 --> 00:57:53,593
Yes, sir.

1078
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:55,134
Tell the dress shop we're coming now.

1079
00:57:55,158 --> 00:57:56,734
No problem, sir.

1080
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:31,426
Try this on.

1081
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,775
I think it'll look great on you.

1082
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:48,083
"28th Cheonga Arts Festival"

1083
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:50,343
Where were you? You were gone for a while.

1084
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,234
- Hey!
- Ro Na!

1085
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,677
- Mum!
- Je Ni!

1086
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:55,227
"Fire Alarm"

1087
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:01,299
Fire!

1088
00:59:08,534 --> 00:59:10,401
Bae Ro Na...

1089
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:11,927
Thanks to that kid,

1090
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:14,150
things have become a lot simpler.

1091
00:59:16,993 --> 00:59:20,401
I really want to thank her,

1092
00:59:20,742 --> 00:59:22,526
but I can't.

1093
00:59:25,742 --> 00:59:27,051
It's me, Mr. Do.

1094
00:59:27,075 --> 00:59:28,051
Go to my place now

1095
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:29,635
and pick up Eun Byeol's and my passports.

1096
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:32,260
And book us the first flight tonight.

1097
00:59:32,284 --> 00:59:34,067
The destination doesn't matter.

1098
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,093
Looking for these?

1099
00:59:40,117 --> 00:59:41,593
What?

1100
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:43,234
Are you disappointed?

1101
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:45,093
Did you not think

1102
00:59:45,117 --> 00:59:47,442
I'd prepare this much?

1103
00:59:48,409 --> 00:59:49,760
Let's not

1104
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:51,551
waste each other's energy.

1105
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:53,817
Wherever you go,

1106
00:59:53,951 --> 00:59:56,150
I will find you no matter what.

1107
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:02,693
Are you all right?

1108
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:18,442
No, not this one.

1109
01:00:24,784 --> 01:00:26,359
This one's not for you.

1110
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:30,775
This one looks a little funny too.

1111
01:00:34,575 --> 01:00:36,484
Just kill me!

1112
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:44,760
I guess she really doesn't like the dress.

1113
01:00:44,784 --> 01:00:47,442
My bride seems very upset.

1114
01:00:47,575 --> 01:00:49,301
She has a very good eye.

1115
01:00:49,325 --> 01:00:50,843
Can you show her other designs?

1116
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:52,734
You are insane.

1117
01:00:53,158 --> 01:00:55,734
You disgusting scumbag.

1118
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,260
What's this?

1119
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:12,858
A present.

1120
01:01:19,784 --> 01:01:22,192
It's totally my style.

1121
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:24,775
Did something good happen today?

1122
01:01:25,242 --> 01:01:27,885
The best news is that you came back.

1123
01:01:27,909 --> 01:01:29,927
I missed you so much.

1124
01:01:29,951 --> 01:01:33,025
You're being all sweet today.

1125
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:36,551
I'll go change.

1126
01:01:36,575 --> 01:01:38,150
Okay.

1127
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:45,260
I wonder how Joo Dan Tae really feels.

1128
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,718
Is she special to him

1129
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:48,900
because she gave birth to his kids?

1130
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:51,010
A monster like him

1131
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:53,651
has someone that he truly loves?

1132
01:01:53,867 --> 01:01:55,567
It's hard to believe.

1133
01:01:56,534 --> 01:01:57,843
It just doesn't add up.

1134
01:01:57,867 --> 01:02:00,051
Two years ago, Na Ae Gyo

1135
01:02:00,075 --> 01:02:02,775
was determined to escape from him.

1136
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:05,134
The two of them

1137
01:02:05,158 --> 01:02:06,718
are completely on the same side.

1138
01:02:06,742 --> 01:02:08,093
I don't care.

1139
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:09,858
We don't have much time.

1140
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:12,176
I must meet Na Ae Gyo and ask her

1141
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,775
what the heck she did to Soo Ryeon.

1142
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,693
I won't make another mistake.

1143
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,942
What happened

1144
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,067
between you and Soo Ryeon?

1145
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:26,817
Seol A's stepbrother and birth mother.

1146
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,275
There was nothing more?

1147
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:34,359
I wanted

1148
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:37,775
to make her happy.

1149
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:41,817
I should've protected her no matter what.

1150
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:46,109
I'm such a fool.

1151
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,567
I can't forgive myself.

1152
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:59,134
All the properties have sold out.

1153
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:00,843
At the highest prices.

1154
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:03,025
Is that why you're in such a good mood?

1155
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,051
It's a great location,

1156
01:03:05,075 --> 01:03:06,677
so it's no surprise.

1157
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,051
The prices may go up even more.

1158
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,067
Why did you sell them already?

1159
01:03:10,909 --> 01:03:12,510
The prices are at their peak now.

1160
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:14,775
Soon, it'll become a speculative zone,

1161
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:17,025
so no new loans will be issued.

1162
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:19,176
How many people do you think can buy

1163
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,343
such expensive properties

1164
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:21,385
without taking out loans?

1165
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,176
I suppose Jung Doo Man is still

1166
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,301
providing you with useful information.

1167
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:27,718
Yes, all thanks to you.

1168
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:29,551
You are the perfect partner for me.

1169
01:03:29,575 --> 01:03:30,843
You have been, for 20 years.

1170
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:32,858
You're realising that just now?

1171
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:39,942
I have to say, I feel bad for Soo Ryeon.

1172
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,885
All her life, she knew

1173
01:03:42,909 --> 01:03:44,984
so little about her husband.

1174
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:47,927
I don't want to talk about her

1175
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:50,067
on this happy day.

1176
01:03:50,867 --> 01:03:52,817
This is the last bullet.

1177
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:54,526
I'll go first.

1178
01:03:58,492 --> 01:03:59,885
Getting nervous?

1179
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:01,942
Look who's talking.

1180
01:04:07,701 --> 01:04:09,802
You'd better tell me the truth.

1181
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:12,343
You tried to betray me two years ago.

1182
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:13,343
What are you doing?

1183
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:14,843
Answer me!

1184
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:16,551
You can't fool me.

1185
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:17,677
I knew from the get-go

1186
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:18,885
that you had changed.

1187
01:04:18,909 --> 01:04:21,176
You ignored my calls and didn't come back.

1188
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,176
There must've been a reason

1189
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,802
why you avoided me.

1190
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:25,593
What are you up to?

1191
01:04:25,617 --> 01:04:27,693
Were you planning to leave me?

1192
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:31,900
Shoot me if you can.

1193
01:04:32,784 --> 01:04:34,010
If you think you can

1194
01:04:34,034 --> 01:04:36,359
keep your fortune without my help,

1195
01:04:36,701 --> 01:04:38,359
shoot me.

1196
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:40,677
You disgusting scumbag.

1197
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:43,651
Whoever dares to betray me will die.

1198
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:46,234
You're no exception, Na Ae Gyo.

1199
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,134
Don't die, Mum.

1200
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,114
No.

1201
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:14,950
No! No!

1202
01:05:14,975 --> 01:05:17,132
No. No!

1203
01:05:20,575 --> 01:05:22,192
No.

1204
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,629
No...

1205
01:05:25,075 --> 01:05:26,775
No.

1206
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:29,317
No!

1207
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,042
No!

1208
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:47,484
Sir!

1209
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:50,635
Are you all right, sir?

1210
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:52,317
Wake up.

1211
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,694
Na Ae Gyo is gone.

1212
01:05:57,242 --> 01:05:58,218
Find her!

1213
01:05:58,242 --> 01:05:59,900
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1214
01:06:09,993 --> 01:06:11,134
Na Ae Gyo, wake up.

1215
01:06:11,158 --> 01:06:12,775
Open your eyes!

1216
01:06:16,826 --> 01:06:18,010
She's not breathing.

1217
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:19,651
What?

1218
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:21,677
We need to get out of here.

1219
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:23,568
We have no time. Hurry!

1220
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:02,934
"Im Chang Jung - Repeatedly"

=Penthouse 2=

1222
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:18,460
You're marrying Chairman Joo?

1223
01:07:18,484 --> 01:07:20,752
I told you. You'll never be free of me.

1224
01:07:20,776 --> 01:07:23,293
Leave before the wedding, no matter what!

1225
01:07:23,317 --> 01:07:24,585
The person who killed my mum...

1226
01:07:24,609 --> 01:07:25,793
I found out.

1227
01:07:25,817 --> 01:07:28,793
I will kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

1228
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:29,752
The trophy?

1229
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,668
What if I really end up going crazy?

1230
01:07:31,692 --> 01:07:32,793
Seok Hoon, Seok Kyung.

1231
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:34,001
Your biological mother is alive.

1232
01:07:34,025 --> 01:07:35,210
Oh Yoon Hee, you again?

1233
01:07:35,234 --> 01:07:36,460
Would you trust the person

1234
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:38,001
who tried to kill you?

1235
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:39,251
You meant it.

1236
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:41,309
I know it was you!
