I found one here too.

Why are these photos left there?

We found another one.

Isn't this Cheon Seo Jin?

17
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,175
Take it away.

Yes, sir.

No!

It's okay. We're the police.

29
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,342
What is your name?

30
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:26,925
I'm...

31
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,050
I'm Sim Soo Ryeon.

32
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,092
You've been locked up in here?

33
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:34,967
Joo Dan Tae...

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,592
He locked us in here.

35
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,759
How long have you been here?

36
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,092
What's the date today?

37
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,592
Please get her to a hospital right away.

38
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:52,259
I beg you.

39
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:53,551
Please hurry.

40
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,634
Call an ambulance.

41
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:57,009
We found people in the basement.

42
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:57,967
Two, actually.

43
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,009
Are you all right?

44
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:07,426
Be careful.

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,842
Watch your step.

46
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:33,676
Do you want to play crazy and trust me?

47
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,592
I have a good plan to end Joo Dan Tae

48
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,676
once and for all.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,050
What did you just say?

50
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,467
You said you wanted to get your revenge.

51
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,259
You can do your thing.

52
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,384
I'm taking his money.

53
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,759
However,

54
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,925
you cannot tell anyone about me.

55
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,634
So? Deal?

56
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:07,342
Forget it.

57
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,676
I don't trust you either.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,050
What if I use this as my collateral?

59
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:23,217
You need to do

60
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:27,175
whatever you can to protect your kid.

61
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:29,134
You're a mum.

62
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,883
At times, can't mums become evil

63
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,634
for their children's sake?

64
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,134
I told you that a mother should be

65
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,842
willing to do anything for her child.

66
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,467
I cancelled the contract?

67
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,092
You didn't know?

68
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,551
Na Ae Gyo notified me last night

69
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:55,259
that she was cancelling the contract.

70
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:58,050
I know you really wanted the property.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,634
So I came to ask

72
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,925
why you suddenly changed your mind.

73
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,300
What the heck are you talking about?

74
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,509
She said she needed the money urgently.

75
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:11,092
She seemed desperate,

76
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,759
so I even let go of the penalty.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,883
She can't cancel it without my permission.

78
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,551
Does that mean Na Ae Gyo

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,259
deceived you?

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,592
"Golden Real Estate"

81
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,342

You will be redirected to voicemail.

88
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:47,467
How dare she run off with my money?

89
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:49,925
I will kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

91

00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,718
Only if you do as I say.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
We are going to design

94
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:08,509
all of Joo Dan Tae's crimes,

I'll help you, Seo Jin.

97
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:16,883
I'll help your daughter and Yoon Chul

98

be vindicated.

If you cooperate with me,

100

you can take Eun Byeol's necklace

101
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:23,592
from Joo Dan Tae.

102
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:24,883
Really?

103
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,342
What do I have to do?

104
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:30,718
Tonight,

105
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:33,384
someone is going to die.

106
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,676
Who's going to die?

107
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,092
Na Ae Gyo.

108
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,009
Na Ae Gyo?

109
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,592
Seok Kyung's biological mother?

110
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:47,175
So you knew.

111
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:49,467
I've never seen her.

112
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,467
I just know Dan Tae sees her in secret

113
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,009
as his agent for Cheonsu District.

114
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,759
Did she run away with Dan Tae's money?

115
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,092
Something like that.

116
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,883
Why are you

117
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:02,718
going to kill her?

118
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,300
Are you telling me

119
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:05,842
to take part in a murder case?

120
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:07,925
It's not your first time.

121
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:10,634
You helped Joo Dan Tae

122
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,050
kill Soo Ryeon.

123
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:13,967
Am I wrong?

124
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:15,967
Did you forget that already?

125
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,842
It's time to pay him back

126
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,842
for everything he did to me.

127
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,759
Don't do it if you don't want to.

128
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,759
You can choose to get tortured by him

129
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,759
for the rest of your life.

130
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,175
I'll do it. I'll do anything.

131
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,426
But you have to keep your promise.

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,300
You have to give me Eun Byeol's necklace.

133
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,883
Don't worry.

134
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,217
I'll keep my promise.

135

Na Ae Gyo dies at 10 p.m. tonight.

136
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,134
We have to do everything

137
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,259

00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,800
I asked you for drinks ages ago.

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,050
Who are you looking for?

143
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:58,009
This person named Na Ae Gyo. Who is she?

144
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,800
Why? Will you find her for me?

145
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,718
Slow down.

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,759
You'll get drunk.

147
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:09,676
Stop getting on my nerves. Get lost!

148

Gosh, darn it!

I put his clothes and shoes in the bag.

154
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,676
Keep reporting back on his moves.

155
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,759
He might wake up.

156
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,634
He's completely knocked out.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,592
He won't wake up

Are you all right?

177
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:09,883
Are you hurt?

178
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:11,509
I'm fine.

179
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,009
I'm so relieved.

180
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,092
Please take her to the villa safely.

181
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,800
Right.

182
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:20,592
This is a ring Dan Tae gave to Ae Gyo.

183
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,509
It can work as evidence.

You be careful too, Logan.

Where's his phone?

No, I'm coming with you.

You trust me, don't you?

00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,592
I'll keep her safe.

I told her to stay in the study room.

Good.

217
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,592
The police will be there soon,

218
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,509
so you shouldn't go home tonight.

219
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:46,676
Take Seok Hoon and go.

I have to take it from here.

222
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:09,592
I'm on your side, Mum.

223
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,342
Okay.

224
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:13,467
Thank you for trusting me.

Where are we?

I'm about to ask you

228
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,217
to do something very difficult.

229
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,967
I want to punish everyone

230
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:40,842
who did awful things to you.

231
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,175
If I do this,

232
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,842
could you and I go back

233
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,842
to living our old lives?

234
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:53,800
I'll do anything.

235
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:56,967
I want to pay what I owe

236
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
to you and Seol A.

237
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,259
Go to the villa in Pangyo,

238
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:20,259
set up the photos everywhere,

239
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:21,342
then lock up the basement.

242
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:46,234
You need to tell me what's going on.

243
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,192
Is Na Ae Gyo really dead?

244
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:50,942
I doubt you did this on your own.

245
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:52,734
Who's behind you?

246
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,318
Is it Logan?

247
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,984
You'll find out everything tomorrow.

248
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,775
Make sure you get your job done.

249
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:04,942
I did everything as you said.

250
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:06,442
Keep your promise.

251
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,692
Where's Eun Byeol's necklace?

252
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:11,151
At his villa in Pangyo.

253
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:15,900
This is the key to the drawer.

254
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,567
I don't know exactly where it is.

255
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,900
Be back before he wakes up.

256
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,109
By 6 a.m. at the latest.

257
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,525
Come the morning,

258
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,567
the police will begin searching there too.

259
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,151
Come on, now. Run along.

260
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,109
Darn it.

261
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,359
Darn it!

262
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,483
Darn it!

263
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,234
Which drawer is it?

264
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,151
Where's her necklace?

265
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:36,942

How's your stomach?

268
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:09,984
What happened yesterday?

269
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:11,692
You drank so quickly

270
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:12,942
that you blacked out.

271
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:14,817
Shall I make some soup for you?

272
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:17,109
No, it's okay.

273
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,276
My head is splitting.

274
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,192
How come I don't remember a thing?

275
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:24,192
I didn't drink that much.

276
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,483
Where's my phone?

277
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:28,859
It's not in the room.

278
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:29,942
I haven't seen it.

279
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:31,442
Should I try calling it?

280
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:39,984
Who's here?

281
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,609
We have a warrant.

283
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:49,775
Don't step on this.

284
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,525
My gosh, Dan Tae!

285
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,692
Dan Tae! Dan Tae.

286
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:55,859
Don't step on this.

287
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:57,026
Search the place. - These people...

"Arrest Warrant"

289
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,984
Mr. Joo Dan Tae, right?

290
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:03,942
Yes.

291
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,650
You're under arrest for murder

292
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:08,276
and desecration of a human corpse.

293
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:09,276
Cuff him.

294
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,734
What the heck are you talking about?

295
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,192
I didn't kill anyone! - Stop it.

296
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,692
Are you people out of your minds?

297
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:19,400
Na Ae Gyo died last night.

298
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,525
Ae Gyo died?

299
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:24,900
My gosh!

300
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:26,192
Come with us.

301
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,151
Hold on.

302
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,984
Dan Tae, what's going on?

303
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:32,650
You killed someone?

304
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:34,192
You didn't, right? Talk to me!

305
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,942
This man can't even kill a bug.

306
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:38,192
He has a soft heart.

307
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:39,442
There must've been a mistake.

308
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:40,318
Let go!

309
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,942
Then can you confirm where he was

310
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,192
last night?

311
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:45,650
You know

312
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:47,775
that I came home early and went to sleep.

313
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:48,775
Tell them.

314
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,192
We sleep in separate rooms,

315
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:53,026
so I'm not too sure.

316
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,650
All I know is that

317
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,775
he drank and got very upset last night.

318
00:25:57,276 --> 00:26:00,692
Oh, right. He kept calling someone.

319
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,192
Who?

320
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,984
He said it was someone named Na Ae Gyo.

321
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,692
Have you lost your mind?

322
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:07,775
Let go of me!

323
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,692
I swear, I did not kill her.

324
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,026
Bring evidence!

325
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:12,609
Until you do, I won't even budge.

326
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:13,692
Bring Secretary Cho.

327
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,234
Get my lawyer!

328
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,359
Darn it.

329
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:18,151
We found these in the fireplace.

330
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,151
My gosh!

331
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,525
A partially burned glove, raincoat,

332
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:22,525
and shoes.

333
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:24,775
Take them as evidence.

334
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:25,859
Yes, sir. - It wasn't me.

335
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,400
I've never seen those before!

336
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:29,276
It wasn't me! - This morning, I saw

337
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:31,567
muddy footprints by the door

338
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,026
and thought it was odd.

339
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,400
Dan Tae, did you really kill that woman?

340
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,318
You killed your kids' biological mother?

341
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:42,775
How do you know

342
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,567
who Ae Gyo is?

343
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:46,900
Take him.

344
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,318

Why is he here?

What's that jerk doing here?

You jerk!

It's payback.

355

Cut that nonsense. Payback for what?

It looks like he took it out on purpose.

I found a ring.

366

Take it.

The victim, Na,

was identified as the biological mother

It looks like ashes from burning a bag.

Is this the man

383

Yesterday? It must've been over money,

386

but Chairman Joo seemed very angry.

387
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,400
He said she sold his property

388
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:24,859
without his permission,

389
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,775
then beat up that woman

as if he was going to kill her.

391
00:28:28,692 --> 00:28:29,442
He did.

392
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:30,817
Right.

Send it to the NFS right away.

at the penthouse yesterday afternoon.

He was very angry at Ms. Na Ae Gyo.

His eyes looked frightening,

421

so I recorded it just in case.

So there's a clear motive,

426
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:13,984
and all the circumstances point to you.

427

00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:14,951
and my shares in Cheonga Group

519
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:15,867
back from him.

520
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,283
Look into it right away.

521
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:23,283
My goodness.

522
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:26,700
When did you get home?

523
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,659
You said you were at the study room.

524
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:32,450
What you told the police...

525
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,325
Is it all true?

526
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,909
Are you asking me if I'm lying?

527
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:40,826
You look like you've been

528
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:41,867
waiting for this,

529
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,784
as if you knew all the things he had done.

530
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:49,617
Did my dad

531
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,118
really kill my biological mum?

532
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,951
Of course, you're shocked

533
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,242
that he's been arrested.

534
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,492
But this is how your dad really is.

535
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,617
Although,

536
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:08,034
I'm sure you knew that about him.

537
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,742
And you didn't do anything wrong?

538
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,909
Is he the only bad person here?

539
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,118
What?

540
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,325
I don't care

541
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,659
what kind of person you are.

542
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,200
You don't want to be my mum anyway.

543
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:39,784
I guess I really am an orphan now.

544
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,159
Hey, where are you?

545
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:50,867
Come to Cheonga Medical Centre now.

546
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:52,367
Why?

547
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:54,742
To see Mum.

548
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:58,325
Mum?

549
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,742
"Gangnam Police Station"

550
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:03,826
Sir! What happened?

551
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:04,951
Where have you been?

552
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,159
You useless idiot!

553
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,367
You texted me to come to the warehouse,

554
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:09,784
so I assembled all our boys there.

555
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:10,784
What are you talking about?

556
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:12,450
I never sent such a text message!

557
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:13,909
Contact top-notch lawyers at once.

558
00:38:14,076 --> 00:38:14,992
Hire all the good lawyers.

559
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,200
I don't care how many!

560
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:17,492
Get me all of them!

561
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:19,659
Get me out or I will kill you!

562
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,034
Do your job for once, you idiot!

563
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,742
What the heck is going on?

564
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:28,159
Murder?

565
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:30,034
Has Chairman Joo gone insane?

566
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:31,826
I can't believe my neighbour,

567
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:33,867
whom I saw every day, did such a thing.

568
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,700
Gosh, I'm too scared to live here now.

569
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:38,951
But he didn't kill her in this building.

570
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,534
Thank goodness.

571
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,118
What are you talking about?

572
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,826
Chairman Joo and Dr. Ha.

573
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:45,492
How many of our neighbours

574
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,867
have been arrested for murder?

575
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,283
This is insane!

576
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,909
He killed the twins' biological mother?

577
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:54,325
I saw the detectives leaving just now.

578
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:55,826
Do they have solid evidence?

579
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,450
All I know is what you saw on the news.

580
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,659
I'm frazzled right now.

581
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:02,200
Let's talk another time.

582
00:39:02,742 --> 00:39:05,450
I heard the woman we saw at the auction

583
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:07,118
is the twins' birth mother.

584
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:10,534
She was wearing huge sunglasses

585
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:12,700
and those ugly colourful clothes.

586
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,534
The woman who bid 50 billion won.

587
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:16,617
No wonder she could bid so much money.

588
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,700
My gosh, it's her?

589
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,992
She must've planned for a long time

590
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:22,367
to dupe him.

591
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,200
She sold all the land in Cheonsu District

592
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:25,534
and ran off with the money.

593
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:28,200
I feel bad for Chairman Joo.

594
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,076
He lost his money, was betrayed,

595
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,034
and became a murderer. My gosh!

596
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:33,826
Why would you feel bad for him?

597
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:35,826
He hid the woman who bore him two children

598
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,076
as his mistress for 20 long years.

599
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,617
Don't even pity that jerk.

600
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,450
He should be executed right away.

601
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,159
By the way,

602
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:47,076
how much did you know, Seo Jin?

603
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,784
There's no way you were

604
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:49,742
completely unaware.

605
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:53,450
I didn't know anything.

606
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:55,742
And I've never met the kids' birth mother.

607
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,034
Even the fact that Sim Soo Ryeon is alive?

608
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,118
What?

609
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,492
What?

610
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,659
What are you talking about?

611
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,575
Who is alive?

612
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,951
You didn't know?

613
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:15,951
It's all over the news right now.

614
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,826
Sim Soo Ryeon! She's back.

615
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:20,534
And she's alive.

616
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:22,450
Apparently, she was locked up

617
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:24,450
in his villa for two years.

618
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:26,076
What?

619
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,076
The villa?

620
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,367
He locked her up in the basement there.

621
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,534
He only gave her water and tortured her.

622
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,534
I was so scared that I peed myself.

623
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:40,826
So what's going to happen now?

624
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,283
Who's Chairman Joo's wife?

625
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,118
Soo Ryeon or you?

626
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,617
Why is that important?

627
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,951
It's not a nice title.

628
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,617
It'd be best to never get involved

629
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,951
with a psychopath like him.

630
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,784
Soo Ryeon is alive? - How come?

631
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,034
No way.

632
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,617
That's impossible. - He's unbelievable.

633
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:56,700
Why

634
00:40:58,076 --> 00:40:59,367
do you want to kill her?

635
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:00,951
Are you asking me

636
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:02,159
to help you murder someone?

637
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,784
It's not your first time.

638
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:07,617
You helped Joo Dan Tae kill Soo Ryeon.

639
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:09,700
Am I wrong?

640
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:11,617
Have you forgotten all about it?

641
00:41:14,742 --> 00:41:16,534
It's payback time.

642
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:19,450
I'll make him suffer as much as I did.

643
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:23,492
Soo Ryeon was behind Yoon Hee all along.

644
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,742
So I've actually been helping Soo Ryeon?

645
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,159
My gosh!

646
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:31,200
You startled us.

647
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:33,409
No.

648
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,034
No!

649
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:36,409
What's wrong?

650
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:37,409
No!

651
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:38,951
No! No!

652
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:40,367
No! - I guess she's still his wife?

653
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,575
Ms. Cheon?

654
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,409
Where is she going in such a rush?

655
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:44,951
We haven't even told her

656
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,034
that Ro Na is alive too.

657
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,200
What if this results in another bloodbath?

658
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:53,283
I'm sure Soo Ryeon resents all of us.

659
00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:54,867
I'm getting shivers down my spine.

660
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:57,492
I don't have a good feeling about this.

661
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,742
What if Soo Ryeon is out to get us?

662
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:05,367
We didn't even do anything wrong!

663
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:07,367
Chairman Joo is the one

664
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,826
who locked her up and tortured her.

665
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:10,367
Don't be scared!

666
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,784
What happened is all in the past now.

667
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:15,867
Gosh!

668
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:16,909
Goodness.

669
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,367
Don't be scared!

670
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,118
"Unit 4502, Calling"

671
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:40,659
Open up, Oh Yoon Hee.

672
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:42,200
I know you're inside. Come out!

673
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:43,242
Let's talk.

674
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:46,242
I bet you knew

675
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:47,409
that Soo Ryeon was alive all along.

676
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:48,784
Come out!

677
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:50,367
What the heck are you up to?

678
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,076
Oh Yoon Hee! Tell me!

679
00:42:57,034 --> 00:43:01,409
"Cheon Seo Jin"

680
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:04,283
"Power off"

681
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:29,534
My beautiful daughter.

682
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
I...

683
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,325
miss you so much, sweetie.

684
00:44:08,992 --> 00:44:10,951
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

685
00:44:11,784 --> 00:44:12,659
Ms. Jin.

686
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,283
Ms. Jin!

687
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,784
Eun Byeol, Eun Byeol!

688
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:19,867
Eun Byeol.

689
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:23,909
What happened to her room?

690
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:30,700
The person you have reached...

691
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,283
Gosh, Eun Byeol.

692
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,325
Leave a message.

693
00:44:35,784 --> 00:44:37,118
Where is she?

694
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,742
Please leave a message.

695
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:48,534
Where is Eun Byeol?

696
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:51,200
I sent her to the pool

697
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,784
since I'm cleaning out her room.

698
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,325
There were too many books

699
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:55,659
and clothes she doesn't need.

700
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:57,325
I'm rearranging her furniture as well

701
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,909
to cheer her up.

702
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,992
Why are you doing that?

703
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,617
If I don't, who will?

704
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:06,283
From now on, I'll take full care of her.

705
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,034
She needs me more than her mother.

706
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,159
You still don't know that?

707
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:14,742
What?

708
00:45:15,534 --> 00:45:16,575
You crazy...

709
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,700
You're fired.

710
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,283
Get out of my house now!

711
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:23,534
Didn't you hear me?

712
00:45:24,118 --> 00:45:25,742
Get out before I drag you out.

713
00:45:26,118 --> 00:45:27,242
Looks like you're the one

714
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,325
who needs to leave.

715
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,325
Come in.

716
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:37,159
"Warrant for Arrest"

717
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:38,450
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin.

718
00:45:39,076 --> 00:45:40,159
What is this about?

719
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:42,200
If this is about Dan Tae,

720
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:43,784
I have nothing more to tell you.

721
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,534
Do you admit to working with him

722
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:48,409
in the abduction and wrongful confinement

723
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,909
of Sim Soo Ryeon and Bae Ro Na?

724
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:52,742
What? Abduction?

725
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:54,534
I know nothing about it.

726
00:45:54,992 --> 00:45:56,659
We already have the victims' statements.

727
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:58,700
Did you do it to steal

728
00:45:58,784 --> 00:46:00,118
Sim Soo Ryeon's money

729
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:01,992
and her husband?

730
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:03,534
Who said such nonsense?

731
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,325
I didn't even know that she was alive.

732
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,367
Last night,

733
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:09,242
you left through the secret passage

734
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:10,450
to go to the villa

735
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,784
where she was being captive.

736
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:24,034
Oh Yoon Hee.

737
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,867
This was what you were trying to do?

738
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:36,742
Cheon Seo Jin.

739
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:38,450
You're under arrest for kidnapping,

740
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,867
wrongful confinement, and assault.

741
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:40,951
Cuff her.

742
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:44,534
Ms. Jin, where is Eun Byeol?

743
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,951
I have to see Eun Byeol.

744
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:47,283
This is not true at all.

745
00:46:47,575 --> 00:46:48,492
Bring Eun Byeol to me.

746
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,034
Now! Hurry!

747
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,283
Don't worry about Eun Byeol.

748
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,617
I'll look after her as if she's my own.

749
00:46:55,118 --> 00:46:57,867
I told you. She's like a daughter to me.

750
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,076
I asked you where Eun Byeol is.

751
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,118
Where is she?

752
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,450
No! Let go!

753
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:04,826
Let go!

754
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:07,367
Oh, wait.

755
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,700
Ro Na's mother from Unit 4502

756
00:47:09,784 --> 00:47:11,118
asked me to give you this.

757
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,450
She said you'd know.

758
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,159
Take it.

759
00:47:14,492 --> 00:47:15,325
No.

760
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:16,659
No! Give it back!

761
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:17,659
No!

762
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:19,784
Who are you, really?

763
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,200
Are you with Yoon Hee?

764
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:22,742
No, right?

765
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:24,159
Tell me that you're not.

766
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:25,951
Where are you hiding Eun Byeol?

767
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,325
Let go! I'm innocent.

768
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,325
I didn't do it!

769
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:29,450
Something's gone seriously wrong.

770
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:30,534
Let go!

771
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:32,159
Ms. Jin, where is Eun Byeol?

772
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,283
I didn't do it!

773
00:47:37,575 --> 00:47:40,159
Chairman Joo, you'd better be prepared.

774
00:47:40,575 --> 00:47:41,826
The murder of Na Ae Gyo,

775
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:43,159
the kidnapping and wrongful confinement

776
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,034
of Sim Soo Ryeon,

777
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:47,575
and now the attempted murder of Bae Ro Na.

778
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,659
Soo Ryeon was alive all this time?

779
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:54,659
And she was with Ro Na?

780
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,283
In my villa?

781
00:48:00,492 --> 00:48:01,367
Insane.

782
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:02,951
Everyone's insane.

783
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,534
Who came up with this crazy nonsense?

784
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:09,492
I have a question.

785
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,325
When did you quit smoking?

786
00:48:12,617 --> 00:48:13,617
Didn't I tell you?

787
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:17,409
I quit because I couldn't stop coughing.

788
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:21,118
Is it because it has been so long?

789
00:48:25,951 --> 00:48:26,992
You seem

790
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:29,367
sort of strange.

791
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,367
You used to lift your glass

792
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,283
with your left hand,

793
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:37,867
but you've been using your right hand.

794
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,826
You got annoyed playing Soo Ryeon

795
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:43,118
because she wasn't a lefty.

796
00:48:44,283 --> 00:48:47,159
I lived my entire life mimicking her,

797
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:49,200
and I got used to using my right hand.

798
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Sim Soo Ryeon?

799
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,200
She was Soo Ryeon, not Ae Gyo.

800
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:03,867
Then who's the one that died?

801
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:12,534
How could you

802
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
do this to me?

803
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:22,200
No.

804
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:23,992
That can't be.

805
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:26,242
No way.

806
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:27,492
This is insane.

807
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:29,909
No.

808
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,242
No!

809
00:49:31,325 --> 00:49:32,367
I don't believe this.

810
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:33,909
It can't be! - Get him.

811
00:49:33,992 --> 00:49:34,951
No way. - Grab him!

812
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:36,283
No! No!

813
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:37,617
Bring Ae Gyo to me.

814
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,700
I didn't do it!

815
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:39,742
No!

816
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:41,659
Stay still! - No!

817
00:49:42,118 --> 00:49:43,200
Hey! Hold him down.

818
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:44,242
No! - You scumbag.

819
00:49:51,784 --> 00:49:53,575
The detention warrant will be issued soon.

820
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,200
This time, you can't get out of this

821
00:49:56,283 --> 00:49:57,909
no matter who's got your back.

822
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,242
So just give up, Chairman Joo.

823
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:02,742
Wait, please.

824
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,034
Do me a favour.

825
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:06,242
Let me make a phone call. Just one call.

826
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,826
You already called all your lawyers.

827
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:09,909
Give me back my phone

828
00:50:09,992 --> 00:50:11,034
before I rip your mouth!

829
00:50:11,492 --> 00:50:12,450
Now!

830
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:17,118
Originally, Opung District was chosen

831
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,159
for redevelopment,

832
00:50:18,826 --> 00:50:19,951
not Cheonsu District.

833
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:22,367
Did you really change the district

834
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,826
just for Joo Dan Tae?

835
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,367
Mr. Jung?

836
00:50:30,534 --> 00:50:32,409
"The Country We Are Building Together"

837
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:34,200
"For Innovation and Development of Korea"

838
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:35,659
"Happy Future Party"

839
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,034
I know about your relationship

840
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:40,951
with his wife.

841
00:50:41,242 --> 00:50:42,409
Did you give him the information

842
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:43,992
because of her?

843
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,325
Sadly though, the woman you were seeing

844
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:49,409
was not Sim Soo Ryeon.

845
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:53,492
I know.

846
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,200
She was...

847
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:00,867
Na Ae Gyo.

848
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:06,867
You knew?

849
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:08,367
I always looked up

850
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:11,617
to Chairman Sim of Simwoon Construction

851
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:14,534
and received a lot of help from him.

852
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:16,575
At first,

853
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:19,951
I met her because she was his daughter,

854
00:51:21,784 --> 00:51:22,867
but I knew right away

855
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:25,992
that she was

856
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:27,617
a completely different person.

857
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:28,867
Then,

858
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:30,742
why did you keep seeing her?

859
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:32,951
Because

860
00:51:34,283 --> 00:51:35,909
I loved that woman,

861
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,534
Na Ae Gyo.

862
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:41,784
People can judge me all they want.

863
00:51:42,784 --> 00:51:45,076
My feelings for her were real.

864
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:48,450
I felt

865
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:50,867
so bad for her.

866
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:54,450
I really don't get it.

867
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:57,283
If you knew who she really was,

868
00:51:58,325 --> 00:51:59,951
why did you give her the information?

869
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:05,742
That was the only way she could live.

870
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:10,409
Joo Dan Tae

871
00:52:11,034 --> 00:52:12,909
would've killed her as well

872
00:52:13,784 --> 00:52:15,283
if he had deemed her useless.

873
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:18,242
He never forgives anyone

874
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:20,325
who betrays him, no matter who it may be.

875
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:24,200
Then she tried to leave the country

876
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:25,283
two years ago because...

877
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:26,867
To escape

878
00:52:27,992 --> 00:52:29,409
from Joo Dan Tae.

879
00:52:30,992 --> 00:52:31,992
I bought

880
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,200
a house abroad so she could live there,

881
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:41,700
but she never came.

882
00:52:43,242 --> 00:52:44,659
After I lost contact with her,

883
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:46,492
I found out

884
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,076
the one who died wasn't Sim Soo Ryeon,

885
00:52:53,492 --> 00:52:54,951
but Ae Gyo.

886
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,617
Mr. Jung. It's me, Joo Dan Tae.

887
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,242
I'm at the police station...

888
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:10,283
Hello?

889
00:53:11,076 --> 00:53:12,784
"Power off"

890
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:19,826
"Happy Future Party"

891
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:22,700
I think

892
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:24,951
it's time

893
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:27,826
to put everything right.

894
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:31,659
Ae Gyo was murdered

895
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:34,118
by Joo Dan Tae.

896
00:53:36,492 --> 00:53:38,826
And I can finally destroy him.

897
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:42,450
I'm relieved.

898
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:45,659
But you might get hurt.

899
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:49,159
I'm prepared.

900
00:53:50,118 --> 00:53:51,076
This crazy jerk.

901
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,617
How dare he hang up on me?

902
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:55,200
After fooling around with my woman?

903
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:56,909
I won't go down alone.

904
00:53:57,826 --> 00:53:58,867
This little...

905
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:00,575
I guess everyone knows what's going on.

906
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:02,159
Just give up.

907
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:05,076
Please, just one more call.

908
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,575
I'll make just one more call.

909
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,076
An international call, this time.

910
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:11,617
Logan Lee.

911
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:13,951
Your dad won't be able to ignore me

912
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:15,992
if he wants to keep his 35 trillion won.

913
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,325
She's not fully recovered yet,

914
00:54:24,575 --> 00:54:26,367
so make sure she stays in bed.

915
00:54:26,575 --> 00:54:27,534
Okay.

916
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:36,409
"Prescription Medication"

917
00:54:41,617 --> 00:54:43,700
Don't just wait. Why don't you call her?

918
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:45,200
I messaged her earlier.

919
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:47,118
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

920
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:50,200
I don't know

921
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,325
what I should say to my mum first.

922
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:54,826
I bet

923
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:57,492
she's too shocked to even rush over.

924
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:16,450
Thanks, Logan.

925
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,200
The meeting with Mr. Jung went well.

926
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,575
Joo Dan Tae...

927
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:25,867
He must be losing his mind now.

928
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:28,700
Everyone has turned their backs on him.

929
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:33,118
It seems like Mr. Jung truly loved Ae Gyo.

930
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:35,076
Did you know that?

931
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,325
I could sense it

932
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:41,118
when I first saw her at the hotel

933
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,575
two years ago.

934
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,159
Bye.

935
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:17,909
Soo Ryeon.

936
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,034
Are you happy?

937
00:56:21,534 --> 00:56:23,076
Impersonating someone

938
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:24,742
and deceiving people to earn money.

939
00:56:24,826 --> 00:56:25,867
Does it make you happy?

940
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:28,700
This is why I can't stand rich women.

941
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:32,076
I like money,

942
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,367
but it's not like I killed someone.

943
00:56:34,534 --> 00:56:36,450
You'll never understand

944
00:56:36,534 --> 00:56:38,534
because you've never been poor.

945
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:40,951
But everyone else lives like this.

946
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,826
They lie when they can

947
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:44,325
and just deal with the humiliation.

948
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,659
If you're that sick of money,

949
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,826
why do you still live so luxuriously

950
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,742
in that penthouse?

951
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:55,742
When did you start impersonating me?

952
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:57,534
You used my name to obtain

953
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,409
real estate information from politicians

954
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:00,659
and bought buildings.

955
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,867
Did you think no one would ever find out?

956
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:05,118
Please come to your senses.

957
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:07,325
If you care about your kids,

958
00:57:07,575 --> 00:57:09,992
you should not help a scumbag like him.

959
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:13,242
Yes, I stole your name.

960
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:14,450
So what?

961
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,325
I experienced what it's like

962
00:57:16,409 --> 00:57:17,534
to be treated with respect

963
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:18,617
because I look like you.

964
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:20,534
When I said my father

965
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:21,700
owned Simwoon Construction,

966
00:57:21,867 --> 00:57:23,826
people bought me meals and clothes

967
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:25,409
and voluntarily told me

968
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:26,659
all kinds of information.

969
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:28,409
What's so wrong with making use of it?

970
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:31,575
Do I not deserve to live like that?

971
00:57:31,826 --> 00:57:34,700
I'll tell Mr. Jung everything.

972
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:36,575
That you're fake.

973
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:38,951
Stay away from him. Leave him alone!

974
00:57:39,784 --> 00:57:40,909
If you mess with him,

975
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:42,325
I will kill you.

976
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,118
I suppose you do feel bad, after all.

977
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:47,200
Then why are you helping Dan Tae?

978
00:57:48,784 --> 00:57:50,200
I'm helping him?

979
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:52,076
Are you crazy?

980
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:56,367
All I did was get funds from Dan Tae

981
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,409
to help Mr. Jung's political career.

982
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:01,450
It's the only thing I can do for him.

983
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:04,283
The same goes for my kids.

984
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,826
For my kids to live comfortably

985
00:58:06,909 --> 00:58:07,784
in a nice home,

986
00:58:08,992 --> 00:58:11,450
I must give Dan Tae what he wants.

987
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,409
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

988
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:19,867
are not happy.

989
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,076
Dan Tae abuses them.

990
00:58:26,659 --> 00:58:27,659
He abuses them?

991
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:32,992
That son of a...

992
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:37,992
Ae Gyo

993
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,283
also loved Mr. Jung.

994
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:45,076
Mr. Jung wasn't the one fooled by her.

995
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:46,575
It was Joo Dan Tae.

996
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:50,200
He firmly believed she was on his side.

997
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:54,951
I know that Dan Tae

998
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:57,867
will not give up.

999
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:02,200
He'll find someone to blackmail

1000
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:04,283
to get out of this, whoever that may be.

1001
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:07,617
We must find a way to corner him.

1002
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:18,534
Mum.

1003
00:59:20,325 --> 00:59:21,492
Is it really you?

1004
00:59:23,242 --> 00:59:24,325
Seok Kyung.

1005
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,283
"VIP Medical Centre"

1006
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,200
Are you really my mum?

1007
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,159
Answer me. Are you really my mum?

1008
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:48,742
Where have you been?

1009
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:52,575
Why did you lie that you died? Why?

1010
00:59:54,742 --> 00:59:55,700
I...

1011
00:59:56,784 --> 00:59:58,659
I missed you so much.

1012
01:00:00,867 --> 01:00:02,534
Every day, I wanted to die

1013
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:04,283
because of all the regrets.

1014
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:07,742
Why did you do that? Why?

1015
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:15,784
Mum.

1016
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:18,283
I hate you. - Sorry it took me so long.

1017
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:19,283
Mum...

1018
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,450
My dear daughter.

1019
01:00:23,617 --> 01:00:24,951
How have you been? - I hate you.

1020
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:28,242
I'm sorry.

1021
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:37,242
I'm so sorry.

1022
01:00:47,325 --> 01:00:49,283
Your parents are being investigated

1023
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:50,700
by the police in the US.

1024
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,118
Someone reported them

1025
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,575
for illegal bone marrow acquisition.

1026
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,200
Don't tell me you were involved.

1027
01:00:57,492 --> 01:00:58,534
I'll go back once things

1028
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,784
get sorted out here.

1029
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:02,076
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

1030
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,283
Logan.

01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:05,742
It's only right

1032
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:07,909
that I pay for what I've done.

1033
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:10,575
Don't say anything to Soo Ryeon.

1034
01:01:12,076 --> 01:01:13,325
What's going on with Ms. Oh?

1035
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:15,034
You still can't reach her?

1036
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,617
No, her phone is off.

1037
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:19,951
Ro Na hasn't heard from her either.

1038
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:21,784
Oh Yoon Hee...

1039
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:23,742
What is she thinking?

1040
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:31,034
"Jin Boon Hong"

1041
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:33,325
Hello, Ms. Jin.

1042
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:35,367
Have you seen Ms. Oh today?

1043
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:38,700
No, I haven't.

1044
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,992
But I'm sure she went to see Ro Na.

1045
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,200
I haven't said anything to Eun Byeol yet.

1046
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,951
If she finds out that Ro Na is alive,

1047
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:51,450
she'll be so shocked.

1048
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:56,450
The police

1049
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,076
just took Cheon Seo Jin.

1050
01:01:59,992 --> 01:02:01,784
If she's convicted,

1051
01:02:01,909 --> 01:02:03,200
she'll be in jail for a few years.

1052
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:08,076
So I'd say, this is the end of her.

1053
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,492
Thank you for everything.

1054
01:02:11,575 --> 01:02:13,450
Will you go back to the US now?

1055
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
I'm not sure yet.

1056
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,283
I'll take some time and think about it.

1057
01:02:31,242 --> 01:02:34,367
Sweetie, you're sleeping like a baby.

1058
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:36,909
Those people

1059
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,784
don't deserve to be your parents.

1060
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:43,992
I will protect you from now on.

1061
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:46,700
Mummy will keep you safe.

1062
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:53,450
Ms. Jin.

1063
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:56,034
Is it evening already?

1064
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:58,159
How long was I asleep?

1065
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,575
I didn't wake you up

1066
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:02,200
because you were sound asleep.

1067
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,325
My mum called me.

1068
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:09,867
I wonder why.

1069
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:13,742
Your mum

1070
01:03:15,076 --> 01:03:16,492
was arrested by the police.

1071
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,826
What? She was? But why?

1072
01:03:19,076 --> 01:03:20,700
I'm not too sure,

1073
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:22,076
but I think she was involved

1074
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:23,325
in the murder of Seok Hoon's mum

1075
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,575
two years ago.

1076
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:25,784
She was?

1077
01:03:26,575 --> 01:03:28,742
But why would my mum kill her?

1078
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:31,367
Where is she now?

1079
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,118
Mum! - Calm down, Eun Byeol.

1080
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:35,118
Your mum

1081
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:37,617
asked me not to tell you anything.

1082
01:03:38,076 --> 01:03:39,409
She said not to call

1083
01:03:39,826 --> 01:03:41,118
or even visit her.

1084
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,826
I don't think she wants to see you.

1085
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,784
How could she go

1086
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:48,617
without even telling me?

1087
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,534
She's my mum!

1088
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:53,242
You have me.

1089
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:56,200
I'll never leave you.

1090
01:03:56,242 --> 01:03:57,242
Really?

1091
01:03:59,076 --> 01:04:00,951
You won't leave me, ever?

1092
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Don't worry.

1093
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:03,992
From now on,

1094
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,534
I'll be your mum

1095
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:08,867
and your dad.

1096
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:26,409
I'll give you a discount

1097
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:27,534
and charge you a flat fee

1098
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:28,826
of 30 billion won.

1099
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:31,118
Then my firm will put together

1100
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,867
a team of the best lawyers

1101
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:34,325
and get you out.

1102
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,118
What kind of gibberish is this?

1103
01:04:36,617 --> 01:04:38,325
I'm angry that I was framed for murder.

1104
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:40,200
And now, you want to overcharge me?

1105
01:04:40,617 --> 01:04:41,867
I don't care whether or not

1106
01:04:41,992 --> 01:04:43,200
you were framed.

1107
01:04:43,617 --> 01:04:45,867
I've just made some big investments,

1108
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:47,200
so I need cash.

1109
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:48,409
Make a lump-sum payment,

1110
01:04:48,492 --> 01:04:49,826
and I'll give you 10 percent off.

1111
01:04:50,034 --> 01:04:52,242
You'll get out on bail within a week.

1112
01:04:52,492 --> 01:04:54,200
If you pay less,

1113
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:56,200
you'll be detained for longer.

1114
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,034
How dare you try to scam me like this?

1115
01:04:59,367 --> 01:05:00,659
Look, I'm Joo Dan Tae.

1116
01:05:00,742 --> 01:05:01,951
I did nothing wrong.

1117
01:05:02,034 --> 01:05:03,492
Why would I give you 30 billion won?

1118
01:05:03,617 --> 01:05:06,867
Hey. You're in deep trouble, punk.

1119
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:08,118
"Punk"?

1120
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:10,409
Murder, desecration of a human corpse,

1121
01:05:10,492 --> 01:05:11,867
kidnapping, confinement, embezzlement.

1122
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,575
No other law firm

1123
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,450
will represent you.

1124
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,575
What? Will you wait for a public defender?

1125
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:19,742
Hey, you crazy rat.

1126
01:05:19,951 --> 01:05:21,909
You knew, didn't you?

1127
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,742
Didn't you scheme with Soo Ryeon

1128
01:05:23,826 --> 01:05:24,700
and buy all my land?

1129
01:05:26,034 --> 01:05:27,200
Let go. I said, let go!

1130
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:29,784
Lock the door.

1131
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:35,742
You scumbag. I've been too nice to you.

1132
01:05:36,742 --> 01:05:37,867
Know your place.

1133
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,409
How dare a former construction worker

1134
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,450
touch an assemblyman?

1135
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:45,325
You rat, what's your problem? Let go!

1136
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:46,992
Hey! Hold him properly.

1137
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:54,325
Bite down hard.

1138
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,992
Flying dragon kick!

1139
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,159
Sit him down.

1140
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:06,118
Send the money by tomorrow.

1141
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:07,325
Have you lost your mind?

1142
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,159
Don't be scared.

1143
01:06:16,575 --> 01:06:18,867
Have you been listening?

1144
01:06:19,617 --> 01:06:20,784
I went to Na Ae Gyo's villa

1145
01:06:20,867 --> 01:06:21,867
for the first time today.

1146
01:06:21,992 --> 01:06:23,325
How many times must I tell you?

1147
01:06:23,492 --> 01:06:24,367
Then,

1148
01:06:24,867 --> 01:06:27,118
why did you have the key to the basement?

1149
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,742
I got that from Yoon Hee.

1150
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:31,200
It's not mine.

1151
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:33,534
At the villa,

1152
01:06:33,826 --> 01:06:36,200
we found your clothes, bags, shoes,

1153
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,283
and even your wedding photos. Look.

1154
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,492
Will you still deny it?

1155
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:50,076
On top of that,

1156
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:52,200
your fingerprints and hair were found

1157
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:53,492
all over the place as well.

1158
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:55,200
How will you explain this, then?

1159
01:06:58,951 --> 01:07:00,325
Yoon Hee did this.

1160
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:02,492
She schemed with Soo Ryeon

1161
01:07:02,617 --> 01:07:04,076
to trap me.

1162
01:07:05,283 --> 01:07:06,200
Bring Yoon Hee here.

1163
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:07,700
Let me confront her.

1164
01:07:08,076 --> 01:07:09,534
She's the mastermind behind this con.

1165
01:07:09,617 --> 01:07:10,909
You're all being fooled!

1166
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,325
I'm sorry.

1167
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:40,076
I had promised to fix it

1168
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,409
but failed to keep my promise.

1169
01:07:43,034 --> 01:07:44,076
It's okay.

1170
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:46,909
I'm just

1171
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:49,784
so happy that I can sing again.

1172
01:07:51,283 --> 01:07:53,034
I got my voice back.

1173
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:54,742
And I got my first love back.

1174
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,784
Ro Na is back too.

1175
01:07:57,367 --> 01:07:58,534
I'm really happy these days.

1176
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,534
Even though, it's just

1177
01:08:01,617 --> 01:08:03,034
an act that will end eventually.

1178
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:06,575
If you're happy, I'm happy too.

1179
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:11,367
It feels like we're a newlywed couple.

1180
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:14,700
Every day, I'm excited

1181
01:08:16,076 --> 01:08:17,034
to come home.

1182
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:20,200
Yoon Chul.

1183
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:23,034
After we get our revenge...

1184
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:26,951
If I don't let you go,

1185
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:29,575
will you stay with me?

1186
01:08:37,409 --> 01:08:38,659
I was just kidding.

1187
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:39,867
Relax.

1188
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,096
Are you that scared?

1189
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:51,450
I won't let you go

1190
01:08:52,951 --> 01:08:54,118
even if you try to run away.

1191
01:09:34,826 --> 01:09:35,826
2091.

1192
01:09:36,617 --> 01:09:37,534
2395.

1193
01:09:38,784 --> 01:09:40,034
2358. You have mail.

1194
01:09:49,076 --> 01:09:50,992
"To Ha Yoon Chul"

1195
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:01,617
You're probably consumed

1196
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:04,617
by regret and self-loathe every day,

1197
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,367
so I wanted to write to you.

1198
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,159
As for Ro Na...

1199
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:10,951
I know it wasn't you.

1200
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:13,951
They'll find the real killer soon,

1201
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,909
so you'll be cleared of your charge.

1202
01:10:16,909 --> 01:10:18,450
I am the one who failed

1203
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:19,784
to protect Ro Na.

1204
01:10:20,826 --> 01:10:22,742
So stop feeling guilty.

1205
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:24,575
I will take

1206
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:26,534
all the blame with me.

1207
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:27,992
Yoon Hee.

1208
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:35,409
Yoon Hee.

1209
01:10:35,951 --> 01:10:37,076
What are you thinking?

1210
01:10:38,992 --> 01:10:39,951
Yoon Hee.

1211
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:50,118
Yoon Hee is missing?

1212
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:51,575
What do you mean?

1213
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:52,826
I can't reach her.

1214
01:10:52,909 --> 01:10:54,034
And her phone is off.

1215
01:10:56,534 --> 01:10:58,700
Does she not know that Ro Na is alive?

1216
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:00,784
I haven't told her yet.

1217
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:03,784
What if

1218
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,409
she takes her own life or something?

1219
01:11:08,534 --> 01:11:09,534
No, she wouldn't.

1220
01:11:10,076 --> 01:11:11,325
No way.

1221
01:11:11,409 --> 01:11:12,283
Soo Ryeon.

1222
01:11:12,617 --> 01:11:13,534
Soo Ryeon.

1223
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:19,909
Yoon Hee.

1224
01:11:26,242 --> 01:11:27,200
Yoon Hee.

1225
01:11:33,283 --> 01:11:34,492
Yoon Hee, where are you?

1226
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:37,492
You can finally see her again.

1227
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:39,992
Don't scare me like this.

1228
01:11:45,492 --> 01:11:46,450
Yoon Hee.

1229
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:54,867
"To Soo Ryeon"

1230
01:11:59,826 --> 01:12:01,118
To Soo Ryeon.

1231
01:12:03,492 --> 01:12:04,617
What I did to you

1232
01:12:05,283 --> 01:12:07,200
cannot be forgiven.

1233
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:09,992
No words or actions

1234
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:11,909
can bring me forgiveness.

1235
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:19,784
Why did I

1236
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,909
make such a choice back then?

1237
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:31,367
Had I not done such a horrible thing,

1238
01:12:32,242 --> 01:12:33,867
Dan Tae would've never thought

1239
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:35,118
of killing you,

1240
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,909
and Ro Na wouldn't have died either.

1241
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:47,200
"Bae Ro Na"

1242
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:52,200
She's not here either.

1243
01:13:19,951 --> 01:13:21,909
I've missed you so much.

1244
01:13:23,118 --> 01:13:24,575
I loved you a lot.

1245
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:27,118
That's why I resented you more

1246
01:13:27,826 --> 01:13:28,826
and felt so guilty.

1247
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,742
I'll take my punishment.

1248
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:50,534
This is the only thing I can do

1249
01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:53,283
to truly repent what I did to you.

1250
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:55,367
Goodbye.

1251
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:16,951
Yoon Hee...

1252
01:14:47,909 --> 01:14:49,200
"Lee Ye Joon - The Morass"

1253
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:03,242
=Penthouse 2=

1254
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:04,200
Desecration of a corpse?

1255
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:05,242
You killed Seol A's dad,

1256
01:15:05,325 --> 01:15:06,283
pushed Seol A to the edge,

1257
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,283
and killed Ae Gyo.

1258
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:10,283
Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin is here!

1259
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:11,200
Ma Ri.

1260
01:15:11,283 --> 01:15:12,450
I heard your real name was something else.

1261
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:13,492
We finally meet.

1262
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:14,617
I can do it alone.

1263
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,951
Seok Kyung is here to help.

1264
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:16,909
For a marriage proposal?

1265
01:15:16,992 --> 01:15:18,200
What? Are you really in Korea?

1266
01:15:18,242 --> 01:15:19,951
My dad is really scary.

1267
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:21,450
Get me out of here at once.

1268
01:15:21,534 --> 01:15:22,367
Too bad.

1269
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,784
Until your misery reaches its height...

1270
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:25,367
I hope you die a painful death.
