00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:32,917
I can't believe this.

7
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,418
That was a perfect high F.

8
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:55,151
What happened there?

9
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,235
You never said you'd raise it to a high F.

10
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,776
It's hard enough to hit such a high note.

11
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,818
It's nearly impossible

12
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,402
to hold it for that long.

13
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:02,402
Did you intentionally hide

14
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,129
what you could really do?

15
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,278
Hey.

16
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,209
Who are you, really?

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,054
Who are you?

18
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:28,132
How...

19
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:31,411
How could you...

20
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,103
Finally,

21
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,745
I get to say hi.

22
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:39,251
Let's try to get along, Seo Jin.

23
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:45,070
Why...

24
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,209
Why are you here?

25
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,694
Shouldn't you be thanking me first?

26
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,194
How can you sing?

27
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,794
Your...

28
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,356
Your vocal cords were damaged back then.

29
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,468
They were, thanks to you.

30
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,443
I guess I can call this a miracle.

31
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,568
I risked my life

32
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,026
to have my vocal cords restored,

33
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,667
then got rid of the scar too.

34
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,977
My neck you cut with that trophy

35
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:21,370
saved you from a huge humiliation today.

36
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,546
Isn't life very interesting?

37
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,167
So it...

38
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,159
It really was you?

39
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,602
No.

40
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,242
That's impossible.

41
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:37,117
I clearly talked to Park Young Ran.

42
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,644
The number you have reached is

43
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,143
out of service.

44
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,976
Please check your number and try again.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,533
What's wrong?

46
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,268
Are you flustered

47
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,910
because her number is gone?

48
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:56,583
"Park Young Ran"

49
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,909
Was this your design all along?

50
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:03,185
Did you plan everything to deceive me?

51
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,310
How did you know?

52
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,185
Have you been stalking me?

53
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,608
How did you know my voice was troubled?

54
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,685
Move your stuff out now.

55
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,310
I don't care if you two are married

56
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,018
or if you're putting on a show.

57
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:19,477
But you aren't allowed to live here.

58
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,477
And the reason is?

59
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:23,143
It's where your daughter, Eun Byeol lives.

60
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,477
You're going to hurt her if you stay.

61
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,373
How can you call yourself her dad?

62
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:29,223
"Installing app, completed"

63
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:32,459
Why do you seem so anxious?

64
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,652
It can't be someone who's made a debut.

65
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,527
Find an amateur.

66
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,318
She can't be too young or too old.

67
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,318
She must be around my age.

68
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:41,568
We don't have time.

69
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,167
We only have a week.

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,084
This concert has to be perfect,

71
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,625
no matter what.

72
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:54,901
What do you want?

73
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,110
You must have a reason for doing this!

74
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:59,402
I simply took back

75
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:01,959
what you had taken from me.

76
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,485
You remember, don't you?

77
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,500
The most outstanding voice and Yoon Chul.

78
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,985
Both were mine to begin with.

79
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,583
What did you say?

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,318
Who would've known the great Seo Jin

81
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:15,500
would end up looking for a stand-in?

82
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,318
Life really is full of mysteries,

83
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,875
isn't it?

84
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,544
Fake soprano,

85
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,311
Cheon Seo Jin.

86
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,334
You...

87
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:32,959
There she is.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,307
Congratulations on making a new record

89
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,652
in the history of Korean vocal music.

90
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:37,568
Please tell us how you feel

91
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,652
after the performance of your life.

92
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:40,318
You've proven yourself against the rumours

93
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:41,901
of your failing condition and retirement.

94
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,859
You must have had lots of pressure

95
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:43,985
as the best soprano singer in the country.

96
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,443
How did you overcome the pressure?

97
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,776
You put on an amazing performance today.

98
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,943
Please tell us your secret.

99
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,318
You're undoubtedly the best diva in Korea.

100
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:51,026
Please share a remark.

101
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,527
Your performance was wonderful, Seo Jin.

102
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,084
Congratulations.

103
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,443
This is just the beginning.

104
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,901
You can look forward to it.

105
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,959
I'm going to take back my rightful place.

106
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,709
Thank you.

107
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,694
But I'd like to have the interview

108
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:12,776
in an official setting tomorrow.

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,443
I'd like to get some rest.

110
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:15,563
- Mr. Do?
- Yes, ma'am.

111
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:16,939
Could you set up a time for an interview

112
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:18,401
whenever they can come?

113
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,318
Of course.

114
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:20,614
- Please leave.
- But just one word.

115
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,697
- One second.
- Just one remark.

116
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,198
- You can't do this.
- One question, then.

117
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,888
- Just a word.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

118
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:27,406
- Please say something.
- Okay, good bye.

119
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:45,063
She totally made a great comeback.

120
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:47,068
- What's wrong?
- What?

121
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:50,042
- No, it's nothing.
- Let's go.

122
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,818
"Sim Soo Ryeon rests here"

123
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:57,000
"The Hera of the penthouse"

124
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,792
Have you been all right?

125
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:12,124
I know I'm brazen and shameless,

126
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:15,292
but I miss you so much.

127
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,437
"Sim Soo Ryeon rests here"

128
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,418
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,792
Please give me a little more time.

130
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:29,418
I'll sacrifice all of me if I must

131
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,542
to expose the truth behind that day.

132
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,500
And...

133
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,583
I'll pay for what I did

134
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,292
as well, I promise.

135
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,151
Celebrating Seo Jin's 20th anniversary,

136
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,318
the debut of the beautiful prima donna.

137
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:54,443
- For Seo Jin!
- For Seo Jin!

138
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,625
- All right!
- Congratulations.

139
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:01,485
Gosh.

140
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,360
I got chills all over my body today.

141
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,943
How can a person make such a sound?

142
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,859
So many articles are being published

143
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,443
praising your wonderful performance.

144
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,694
Ms. Cheon, you really are

145
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:16,610
the one and only treasure for our country.

146
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,151
Ms. Cheon, what more would you need?

147
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,110
You're from a good family,

148
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,937
and unbelievably talented.

149
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:23,318
Your ex-husband was a doctor,

150
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,318
and he is a successful businessman.

151
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:28,151
How come the deity gave everything to you?

152
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,068
Actually, Chairman Joo is the lucky one.

153
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:32,665
His business is soaring,

154
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,360
his wife-to-be is an amazing success,

155
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,443
and he's Kyu Jin's bestie.

156
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,443
Goodness.

157
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,500
His life is as good as the President's.

158
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,276
Thank you for celebrating with us.

159
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,110
Let's enjoy ourselves through the night.

160
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,068
Everything is on me.

161
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,402
- All right!
- Yes!

162
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,042
This is great!

163
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,193
Your voice in tonight's concert

164
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:55,110
sounded very different than usual.

165
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:59,610
You got up to a high F at the end, right?

166
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,151
I know. You seemed like

167
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,193
a completely different person.

168
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,694
What's your secret?

169
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,859
I'd like to let Je Ni know too.

170
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,068
So, what happened?

171
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,625
Did you master a new kind of skill?

172
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,709
There's no secret.

173
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:16,610
Oh, right.

174
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:19,193
I saw Oh Yoon Hee at the concert hall.

175
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:20,818
Was Dr. Ha there with her?

176
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:23,859
That couple always try to butt in

177
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:26,167
even though they aren't invited.

178
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,610
Oh Yoon Hee was there?

179
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,735
When? I didn't see her.

180
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,568
Let's cut the nonsense and drink.

181
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,818
I'm sure she wanted to ruin her moments.

182
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:37,652
She lives with a sense of inferiority,

183
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,485
thinking Seo Jin is her biggest rival.

184
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,026
She must've got jealous

185
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,776
when she heard you're having a concert--

186
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,042
Oh Yoon Hee wasn't there!

187
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,126
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:58,718 --> 00:10:00,917
I'm not feeling so well.

189
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,459
Please excuse me.

190
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:07,583
Hey, wait. Ms. Cheon.

191
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,985
What was that?

192
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,750
What's with her?

193
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,835
Let's reschedule

194
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:19,252
the celebration.

195
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:23,676
Why is she like that on a great day?

196
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,759
Something is going on with Seo Jin.

197
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,525
And my sixth sense says it's Yoon Hee.

198
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,775
There's no doubt about that.

199
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,694
She has been awfully sensitive

200
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:32,402
ever since Yoon Hee moved back.

201
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,193
Dr. Ha got back with Yoon Hee

202
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,235
because of her nasty temper.

203
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,443
Let's be careful with our words for a bit.

204
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,694
I'm afraid she might

205
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,527
take this out on our kids.

206
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:44,110
That woman and her awful temper.

207
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:45,360
Why did Chairman Joo get into this mess?

208
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:46,652
I feel bad.

209
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,151
Why does he want to remarry her?

210
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:49,735
He should just grow old and die alone.

211
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,500
He just never got enough affection.

212
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:54,675
Quiet.

213
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,776
Fake soprano,

214
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,500
Cheon Seo Jin.

215
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,792
Hey, stop. Stop it!

216
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,439
Is that all you can do?

217
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,818
This audition is absolutely important.

218
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,041
It's your chance to perform

219
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,068
with the best opera company in Italy.

220
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:39,694
Only Oh Yoon Hee,

221
00:11:39,718 --> 00:11:41,026
the best in your school got this chance,

222
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,985
but I went out of my way to fit you in.

223
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,776
I'll practise harder, Dad.

224
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,792
I can do this. I know I can get the part

225
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,901
in the audition.

226
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,200
Are you crying right now

227
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:53,151
just because I said something?

228
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:55,527
Don't you know I hate it when girls cry?

229
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:57,084
Try again.

230
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,000
What happened, Dad?

231
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:11,209
Between Yoon Hee and me,

232
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,084
who made it?

233
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:15,360
You foolish girl.

234
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,625
You can never seem to win against her!

235
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:19,110
Then...

236
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:23,402
is Yoon Hee going to Italy?

237
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,000
I can't let her do that.

238
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,959
I made her turn the offer down.

239
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:30,694
I set up everything for you to take,

240
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:32,110
but you almost let her take it.

241
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,818
This is humiliating.

242
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,542
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,004
Go.

244
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:21,095
What's Eun Byeol doing?

245
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,776
She just finished doing her homework

246
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,583
and fell asleep.

247
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,334
Great work.

248
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:28,789
You should get some rest, Ms. Jin.

249
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,318
Eun Byeol.

250
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:44,902
"Hera Palace"

251
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,709
I finally feel so much better.

252
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,485
I got so annoyed over Mum's engagement

253
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,068
and how my dad got remarried and came back

254
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:18,126
that I almost went insane.

255
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,625
Thanks for coming with me, Seok Hoon.

256
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:26,776
We just have to hold out for a few months.

257
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,610
During your mum and my dad's wedding,

258
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,026
we can drop the bomb first,

259
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,792
then leave this place.

260
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,126
No one can find out about us until then.

261
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,084
You said you won't do this.

262
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,193
Why can't you give me a chance?

263
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:59,167
Aren't you sick of saying that?

264
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:01,542
I told you that I'm not interested in you.

265
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,318
We're just after the same thing.

266
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:04,318
We want to ruin the wedding

267
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,818
to make sure we don't become a family.

268
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:08,625
You can't be with Ro Na anyway.

269
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,694
You can use me to get over her.

270
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:14,776
So...

271
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,235
Eun Byeol.

272
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,583
I told you not to bring her name up.

273
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,735
It's late.

274
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,376
Let's go.

275
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:31,251
Wait for me.

276
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:36,042
Thanks for helping me get some air.

277
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,235
Go home safely.

278
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,917
Sweet dreams.

279
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,917
Where have you been?

280
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:48,193
To the practice room.

281
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:49,402
I couldn't focus on studying,

282
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,151
so I went there to practise.

283
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,709
What were you doing?

284
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,542
I went swimming.

285
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,418
Don't work so hard, best student.

286
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,750
Bye, then.

287
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:08,167
She didn't hear me, did she?

288
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,318
Eun Byeol,

289
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:16,418
so you've made up a lie?

290
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:17,517
Who is this boyfriend of yours

291
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,834
that you were out this late with him?

292
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,416
The door is open.

293
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,735
Dr. Ha usually has meetings with clients

294
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,942
or spends time with Ms. Oh.

295
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,026
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary yet.

296
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,750
What about Oh Yoon Hee's girl?

297
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:32,360
I haven't seen her around.

298
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:35,359
So she hasn't met with her daughter?

299
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:41,318
Was she at the concert?

300
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:42,235
Yes, sir.

301
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,875
She was with Ms. Cheon in the waiting room.

302
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:47,985
They were together?

303
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,859
I saw Oh Yoon Hee at the concert hall.

304
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,126
Oh Yoon Hee wasn't there!

305
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,500
Put a tail on Seo Jin too.

306
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,418
Report back if anything seems odd.

307
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:07,961
Cheon Seo Jin, Oh Yoon Hee.

308
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,985
There is definitely something

309
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,583
between you two.

310
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:21,318
I'm sorry, Ms. Cheon.

311
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,776
A simple apology won't fix this mess!

312
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,276
When did this all go wrong?

313
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,235
How did Park Young Ran become Oh Yoon Hee?

314
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:31,026
Then who was that woman I met?

315
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,167
The broker went off the grid.

316
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,459
I have no excuses to make.

317
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,000
Yoon Hee, what are you up to?

318
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,459
How much do you know?

319
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,776
What are you making?

320
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,959
My gosh, you surprised me.

321
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,859
- Hey.
- Oh.

322
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,652
This is against our rules.

323
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,251
Right.

324
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,917
- Go grab a seat.
- Okay.

325
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,735
Why did you make so much food?

326
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,694
This is hearty enough as breakfast.

327
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:29,459
I did that so I can eat it myself.

328
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,167
What's your plan today?

329
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,859
Weren't we going to keep that a secret?

330
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,667
I'm a busy woman, you know.

331
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,068
That looks good.

332
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:42,026
Give me a bite.

333
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,610
No, this is mine.

334
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,610
Come on, don't be so cheap.

335
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:48,110
- Just one bite, please?
- No way.

336
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,036
Just one bite.

337
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:53,110
Okay, fine. Just one bite, then.

338
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,300
Here.

339
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:58,052
It's good.

Maybe Seok Hoon is

342
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,402
dating someone.

343
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:12,568
- What?
- He must've been out on his bike.

344
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,500
He came home late last night.

345
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:17,735
But he had two helmets in his hands.

346
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,068
Could it be Ro Na?

347
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,402
Ro Na?

348
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,652
That makes no sense.

349
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,985
Seok Hoon was head over heels for her.

350
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:27,985
Now that her mum was found innocent,

351
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,527
he has nothing to worry about.

352
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,026
He wasn't head over heels for her.

353
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,943
He just teased her for fun.

354
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,818
If she ever shows up

355
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,126
and tries to hit on my brother again,

356
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,625
I won't let her live.

357
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:43,583
That won't happen.

358
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,985
She didn't come to Korea.

359
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,443
Her mum said so.

360
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,776
She's still in the States.

361
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,193
Are you sure she never came back?

362
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,376
I'm sure.

363
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,818
Thanks for the great information.

364
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,859
You're very quick with your bestie's news.

365
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,500
It's not that.

366
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:01,985
She's next door, so by chance--

367
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,443
Don't you dare show up at the study group.

368
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,959
A two-timer like you gives me the creeps.

369
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,985
Give me my bag.

370
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:17,610
People might think I made you do this.

371
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,709
Stop pretending like you're so nice.

372
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:24,985
Thank you.

373
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,959
Yes, thank you for coming.

374
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:29,026
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

375
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,235
Your concert was wonderful.

376
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,294
- May I have a picture with you?
- Sure.

377
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,068
Thank you.

378
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,443
- Yes, sure. Thank you.
- Thank you.

379
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,834
- Here.
- Thank you.

380
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:41,610
Hello. What's your name?

381
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,276
"Cheon Seo Jin"

382
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,542
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

383
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,146
What do you think you're doing?

384
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,667
I wanted to get your autograph too.

385
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:09,048
"Oh"

386
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:13,542
This is a gift for you.

387
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,007
Open up.

388
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:26,022
"Oh Yoon Hee"

389
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:28,959
"Non-disclosure Agreement"

390
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:30,694
"I, Park Young Ran, hereby promise"

391
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:31,859
"to not disclose anything regarding..."

392
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,709
"Signed by Cheon Seo Jin, Park Young Ran"

393
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:39,000
I thought you forgot about our agreement.

394
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,193
Don't worry.

395
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,376
I'll keep my promise.

396
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,527
Thanks for the autograph.

397
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,292
I'll cherish it.

398
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:02,193
"Cheon Seo Jin Fan Meet"

399
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:03,985
People overseas are dying to see you.

400
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:05,443
Do you have any plans to hold a tour?

401
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:08,402
I still have much to do in Korea.

402
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:09,901
But I'll think about it.

403
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,943
Your first song received many praises

404
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,235
thanks to your perfect pitch

405
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,818
as if your voice is an instrument.

406
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:17,276
When will you release the live album?

407
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,292
I'd love to listen to it soon.

408
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,667
Well...

409
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,026
Why don't you sing it here for us?

410
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,167
"Una Voce Poco Fa".

411
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:31,568
That song was very moving.

412
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:33,652
Could we ask you to do that?

413
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:35,402
Yes, please do that for us.

414
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:37,709
- Please.
- Please sing for us.

415
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:42,500
I'm a huge fan.

416
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:48,834
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling my best now.

417
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:05,568
I can't let Yoon Hee drag me around.

418
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,776
Find anything I can use against her.

419
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,776
Search her house or put a tail on her,

420
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,193
find anything to keep her on a leash!

421
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:14,000
"Cheonga Foundation"

422
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:22,134
You should postpone your reunion tonight.

423
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:25,403
You aren't in a good shape.

424
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:29,010
But I'm treating all my friends

425
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:31,583
who came to my concert.

426
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,500
Hey, it's me.

427
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:45,070
I'm so sorry.

428
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:47,025
I'm not feeling well today.

429
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,418
I don't think I can be there tonight.

430
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,317
I'll let the chef know,

431
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,418
so you can all eat dinner there.

432
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:00,251
What are you talking about?

433
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:06,750
Why would she be there?

434
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:12,652
I'll report back as soon as

435
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:14,235
- the new products are out.
- Sure.

436
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,443
Chairman Joo.

437
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,360
- Hey.
- You may go home.

438
00:24:17,384 --> 00:24:18,276
Goodness.

439
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,443
A representative of Gangnam, Lee Kyu Jin.

440
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:22,959
Gangnam's representative, Lee Kyu Jin.

441
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:24,652
It seems like

442
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:27,042
they aren't residents in my borough.

443
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,151
Anyway, your furniture business

444
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,735
seems to be flourishing too.

445
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,318
You must be very busy.

446
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:33,443
I was about to go home.

447
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:34,443
What brings you here?

448
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:37,251
Hey, this looks really awesome.

449
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,443
I mean,

450
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,568
I was nearby, so I decided to stop by.

451
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,193
You know, that and something else.

452
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:47,568
It has been a while

453
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:49,459
since we played.

454
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,318
Aren't you sick of playing by ourselves?

455
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:56,542
Also, I feel kind of guilty for winning

456
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:57,859
your money all the time.

457
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:59,290
"Jakomo"

458
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,084
So today, that's why

459
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:04,709
I want to invite an idiot to play with us.

460
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:06,776
Got anyone good?

461
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,583
"Casino"

462
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,527
Thank you for inviting me.

463
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,500
It has been a while since we hung out.

464
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,276
It finally feels like

465
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,276
I'm back at Hera Club.

466
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:28,750
Anyway, you came with a beautiful woman.

467
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:32,276
I ran into Ma Ri on the way.

468
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,568
She wanted to join us.

469
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:37,292
I'll play the dealer to make this fair.

470
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:39,527
Could we up the ante a little today?

471
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:40,776
No limits.

472
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,209
- Call.
- Of course.

473
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,292
Dr. Ha.

474
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,500
10 more.

475
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:05,026
Kyu Jin, will you take all my money?

476
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,443
If you're scared, you can fold.

477
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,042
- Call.
- Call.

478
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,270
And raise.

479
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:15,542
My gosh.

480
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,276
All right.

481
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,859
- Darn it.
- You can do it.

482
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,500
I fold.

483
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:22,318
Will you continue?

484
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:23,875
Let's do this.

485
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:25,458
Dr. Ha, you've become quite bold

486
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,734
ever since you began doing business.

487
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,818
I like your spirit,

488
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,459
but I'm sorry.

489
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:34,193
A full house.

490
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,943
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

491
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,068
Goodness.

492
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:40,459
It's a shame, but I think I won.

493
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,527
But my triple is higher.

494
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,084
My gosh.

495
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,917
- It's nice to see you.
- It really is.

496
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,975
- This is great.
- Goodness, you came.

497
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,985
I thought you couldn't come.

498
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:05,068
Come on in.

499
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,985
I was disappointed I wouldn't see you.

500
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:08,625
Are you fatigued?

501
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:11,235
I must have worked a little too hard.

502
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:14,000
I feel better after taking some medicine.

503
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,402
Someone is already sitting there.

504
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,610
Who?

505
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,209
You're here.

506
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,625
You're late.

507
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:27,084
I can be here too, right?

508
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,652
Although I wasn't invited,

509
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:30,276
I still wanted to celebrate with you.

510
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,042
This dinner is for

511
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,834
graduates of Seoul University of Music.

512
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,610
Wouldn't it make you feel uncomfortable?

513
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,652
Don't be so mean.

514
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:41,818
Yoon Hee went to Cheonga Arts High too.

515
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:44,500
And she was at your concert last night.

516
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:46,735
Doesn't she deserve to be here too?

517
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,776
- Yes.
- Of course.

518
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,776
- Grab a seat.
- I'm glad you're here.

519
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,334
Take a seat.

520
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:52,943
Nice to see you.

521
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,610
- Let's meet more often.
- We should.

522
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,207
I was honestly surprised

523
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:57,859
at what Seo Jin could do.

524
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:59,360
You were absolutely fantastic.

525
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:00,514
To be honest, back in school,

526
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,182
Yoon Hee was a better singer.

527
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,099
Do you all remember

528
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,517
Cheonga Arts Festival in our senior year?

529
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,768
I was reminded of Yoon Hee last night

530
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:08,035
during the concert and got chills.

531
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:09,402
You did too?

532
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:11,943
When she hit the high F,

533
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:13,943
didn't they sound really similar?

534
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,859
If it hadn't been for that incident,

535
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,235
Yoon Hee would've won

536
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:18,818
the free admission to Seoul University.

537
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:20,527
She was admitted to Cheonga as the best,

538
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:21,776
and she always won the grand prize

539
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,625
whenever she was in a competition.

540
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,776
It's all in the past anyway.

541
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,917
I don't even sing any more.

542
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:32,443
I guess Seo Jin really isn't too well.

543
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,193
You won't have any drinks.

544
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,750
Are you all right?

545
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:38,167
Right.

546
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,485
You've all heard of

547
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,402
the Hera Palace incident, right?

548
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:45,128
Yoon Hee had a rough life for a few years.

549
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:46,380
She got framed for murder

550
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:48,192
and became a fugitive too.

551
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:51,235
And now you're out here freely.

552
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:52,834
I'm very glad.

553
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,527
Why are you bringing that up?

554
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:57,110
Why not? Does it make you feel awkward?

555
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:59,792
Didn't you come here because you're fine?

556
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,610
You're right.

557
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:03,402
I got framed for something I didn't do,

558
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:05,318
but I was already found innocent.

559
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:08,042
I'm happier than anyone right now.

560
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:11,869
It's a bit awkward to bring this up,

561
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:14,485
but I got remarried.

562
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:15,334
- Really?
- What?

563
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,403
- What?
- Seriously?

564
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:17,572
When? I can't believe this.

565
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:18,739
- When?
- You're married now?

566
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:20,193
- When?
- When did you get remarried?

567
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,026
What does your husband do?

568
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,652
He runs a small business.

569
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:25,402
You probably haven't heard of it.

570
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:26,652
It's called JohnBIO.

571
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,818
- Where?
- Goodness, I've heard of it.

572
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:30,694
It became a huge success in the US.

573
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:31,610
- Is that so?
- Really?

574
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,251
- Really?
- What is it?

575
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:34,527
What does the company do?

576
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,943
Girls, I need to use the washroom.

577
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,360
Stop searching. It's embarrassing.

578
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:40,667
- My goodness.
- Let me look it up.

579
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:45,696
No way. This guy is Seo Jin's ex-husband.

580
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:47,618
A former doctor of Cheonga Medical Centre.

581
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:50,131
- Exactly.
- I can't believe this.

582
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,672
You're married to Seo Jin's ex?

583
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:55,272
Yes. Things kind of happened.

584
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,177
Oh Yoon Hee.

585
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,660
I'll kill you.

586
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,694
Be honest and tell us while she's gone.

587
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:28,652
What?

588
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:32,151
Did you really cut yourself back then?

589
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:33,443
You and Seo Jin were alone

590
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,068
in the waiting room.

591
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:37,360
We couldn't speak up back then,

592
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:39,110
but no one believed that story.

593
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:43,026
We all thought Seo Jin hurt you.

594
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,875
Tell us.

595
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:46,927
What's the truth?

596
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:57,985
Come on.

597
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:59,735
You can ask Seo Jin yourself.

598
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,402
She knows the truth too.

599
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,402
- Come on.
- Gosh.

600
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:03,985
- Don't be like that.
- Tell us.

601
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:04,985
You don't want to tell us?

602
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:05,985
Just tell us.

603
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:08,000
Are you sure you won't tell?

604
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,026
Let's eat.

605
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,318
- You can ask her later.
- Tell us.

606
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:13,527
- Please tell us.
- Tell us the truth.

607
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:15,292
My goodness.

608
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,151
Yoon Chul is on a roll.

609
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,360
This is unbelievable.

610
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:21,901
Will Mr. Joo Dan Tae go bankrupt soon?

611
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:23,360
Will you two keep your mouths shut?

612
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:24,985
I can't focus.

613
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,583
He's taking it out on us for no reason.

614
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:28,694
People say your true nature shows

615
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:29,652
when you lose your money.

616
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,709
I guess that's the case for him too.

617
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:34,235
Let's call it a day.

618
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,652
It looks like you almost lost everything.

619
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,418
You can't end the game like this.

620
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:41,110
Let's up the ante

621
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,042
and play one big final round.

622
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:44,959
Can you go all-in?

623
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:47,994
If you can't,

624
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:49,610
you can stop here.

625
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,775
Well, I don't mind.

626
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,418
In that case...

627
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,129
You're so cool, Yoon Chul!

628
00:31:58,154 --> 00:31:59,542
Let's bet everything

629
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,126
and play the final round.

630
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,685
Let's do that.

631
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,823
The first four cards are very important.

632
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,276
- A nervous moment.
- They must be nervous.

633
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,834
All right.

634
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:14,652
What's important in poker is

635
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:15,901
- knowing when to fold.
- Yes.

636
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,318
Just as how your spouse must die before 50

637
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:20,026
for you to get remarried.

638
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,193
"Kyu Jin's Love"

639
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,318
Your call cannot be connected. Please--

640
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,667
Is he out drinking again? Goodness, man.

641
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,818
His wife went out to volunteer all day

642
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:31,985
and came back half-dead

643
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:35,084
trying to keep the voters pleased.

644
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:40,652
Gosh, you're out having fun, aren't you?

645
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:43,000
I can't believe he's an assemblyman.

646
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,952
This is exactly why our country is a mess.

647
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:55,000
It's tough to read his face.

648
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:04,110
Whoa, what is this? A three of a kind.

649
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:05,068
Trips!

650
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:06,610
- My gosh, that's amazing.
- Goodness.

651
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,527
This is such a huge twist.

652
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,084
Chairman Joo.

653
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm so sorry.

654
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:16,551
I have four aces.

655
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,418
No way.

656
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:20,060
My gosh.

657
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:23,110
Goodness, no.

658
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,443
Mr. Ha.

659
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:25,985
Did you play poker all the time in the US?

660
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,318
You seem like a high roller.

661
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:29,235
Come on, I just got lucky.

662
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:30,276
Beginner's luck.

663
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,901
How much did Chairman Joo lose today?

664
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,349
1, 10, 100...

665
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:36,443
A billion won?

666
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,084
We should play again sometime.

667
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:39,642
When we do,

668
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,551
I won't let you off easily.

669
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:46,153
Come on, you didn't let him off easily.

670
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:47,071
Chairman Joo.

671
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:48,155
You had to use

672
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,657
every single brain cell while playing.

673
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:52,340
Bye.

674
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:54,110
Mr. Ha.

675
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,151
You need to treat us.

676
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,985
No, I can't do that today.

677
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:59,776
My wife is about to come home.

678
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,193
Maybe next time.

679
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:03,026
Please let me off this once.

680
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,209
Hey, come on.

681
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:06,610
Goodness.

682
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:09,652
If I stop drinking halfway,

683
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,318
it's hard to fall asleep.

684
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,625
Why are you worried?

685
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:17,251
You can drink with me.

686
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:20,792
Just the two of us?

687
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,485
Come on, what are you talking about?

688
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:25,610
It's no fun.

689
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:26,889
No fun.

690
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:30,610
When you drink, are you the type

691
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:34,485
who doesn't remember things?

692
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:35,776
No.

693
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,276
I totally remember everything.

694
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,376
Then do you remember?

695
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:44,226
Just recently, you and I did

696
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:45,875
something like...

697
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,792
We did that.

698
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:53,542
What are you...

699
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,943
What was that? What are you talking about?

700
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:59,416
I can't believe this punk.

701
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,610
You started it. Stop playing the innocent.

702
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,901
You really don't remember or what?

703
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:06,402
What did I do?

704
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:09,042
Why do you keep telling me this? What...

705
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:11,917
Whoa.

706
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:22,701
You remembered.

707
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,625
Oh, boy.

708
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,076
What are you trying to do?

709
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,994
What are you plotting?

710
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:59,175
Trying to hang me out to dry?

711
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:04,800
Why are you so scared, Cheon Seo Jin?

712
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:06,551
This is very unlike you.

713
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,678
Relax.

714
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:12,592
I haven't even started yet.

715
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:15,576
I know that you're coming at me

716
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,050
because you're all anxious.

717
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,384
But I'm starting to pity you now.

718
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:27,703
The more you do this,

719
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:30,800
the more I want to expose the truth.

720
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,535
Shall I tell the whole world?

721
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:35,952
That your singing

722
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,718
is all fake?

723
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:40,259
And that your concert was successful

724
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:43,718
because of me, Oh Yoon Hee?

725
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:49,092
Tell me what you're after.

726
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:53,009
What exactly do you want from me?

727
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:57,239
"Hera Palace"

728
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,175
I want you to retire.

729
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,718
- What?
- I said, retire.

730
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,134
You trampled on others

731
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,300
and stole what was rightfully theirs

732
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:17,451
to get to where you are now.

733
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:20,092
It's all fake, so step down voluntarily.

734
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,970
The best soprano in the country?

735
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,883
Aren't you ashamed?

736
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,869
It's not fake.

737
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,742
I worked myself to the bone to get here.

738
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,967
But you got off on the wrong foot.

739
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,426
You cut my throat

740
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:44,800
and crushed my dreams,

741
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:47,551
but haven't been punished for it.

742
00:37:47,677 --> 00:37:51,027
So everything you're enjoying now

743
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:52,877
is all fake.

744
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:57,394
Cancel all your upcoming performances.

745
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,792
Hold a press conference

746
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:02,336
and admit that you can't sing any more.

747
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,285
Then,

748
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:06,967
I won't tell anyone that I was

749
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,092
your ghost singer.

750
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:11,718
What do you say?

751
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:13,443
It sounds like a generous deal

752
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:15,342
to me.

753
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,175
Singing is my life.

754
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:23,276
Same here.

755
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,886
It was my life as well.

756
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:27,736
Oh Yoon Hee!

757
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:29,586
As for the press conference,

758
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,410
how does this Saturday sound?

759
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:33,618
The press conference

760
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:36,467
for your new opera is that day anyway.

761
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,576
Reporters will come

762
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,300
from all over the world.

763
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,712
Won't it be a good day for it?

764
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,118
Fine.

765
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:51,634
Take this as far as you want.

766
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,163
I won't beg you like a loser.

767
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:59,858
Don't you dare underestimate me.

768
00:39:00,826 --> 00:39:02,260
I'm different

769
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,509
from Soo Ryeon.

770
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,775
Just think about how much you'll lose

771
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,618
and what would be the best way

772
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:11,800
for you to step down.

773
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:20,244
Does your daughter know

774
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,660
what you're up to?

775
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:27,842
Didn't she leave you

776
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,118
because she couldn't stand

777
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:31,009
this side of you?

778
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,362
Isn't that why you returned by yourself?

779
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:46,259
Worry about your daughter first.

780
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,511
Your daughter is...

781
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,823
included in my plan.

782
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:06,092
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.

783
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,825
Leave Eun Byeol out of this!

784
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,785
Oh Yoon Hee.

785
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,759
Oh Yoon Hee!

786
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,800
Oh Yoon Hee!

787
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:33,925
How was dinner?

788
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:35,994
It was okay.

789
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,076
How about a cocktail at the lounge?

790
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,493
I'm exhausted.

791
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:41,326
The fan meet and the interview...

792
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,009
I'm beat.

793
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:47,175
Cheer up, okay?

794
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:55,342
About Oh Yoon Hee...

795
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,426
I'll take care of her soon.

796
00:40:57,726 --> 00:40:58,618
I built Hera Palace,

797
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:00,451
so I choose who can move in.

798
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:01,827
I have

799
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,467
that much power.

800
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,525
Don't mess with her.

801
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,607
Do not provoke her!

802
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,076
What do you mean?

803
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,967
Just for the time being.

804
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,640
Just leave her alone, please.

805
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:53,551
What could it be?

806
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:56,586
What could Oh Yoon Hee

807
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:59,687
have on Seo Jin?

808
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:13,535
It's me, Joo Dan Tae.

809
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,551
Can we meet now?

810
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,285
Did something happen to Ms. Cheon?

811
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,410
That is

812
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:25,967
what I'd like to ask.

813
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:27,592
Mr. Do.

814
00:42:27,642 --> 00:42:28,785
What were you thinking?

815
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:31,800
You let things turn into a total mess.

816
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,159
This is very serious. How could you

817
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:35,910
expect her to deal with it on her own?

818
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:37,702
Could you really call yourself

819
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:40,175
her right-hand man?

820
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:43,787
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

821
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,761
The incident involving Oh Yoon Hee.

822
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,457
Your boss told me everything.

823
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:53,994
How much longer

824
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:56,092
were you going to hide it from me?

825
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:58,050
Did you

826
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,785
not think

827
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:01,952
that it'd break her career

828
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:03,634
if it broke out?

829
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:05,368
You see,

830
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:07,159
she received another threat just now,

831
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:09,201
from Oh Yoon Hee.

832
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:11,994
If my fiancee is going through this,

833
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:14,076
I should be the first to know.

834
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,800
Why didn't you ask me for help?

835
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,453
Mr. Do!

836
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:25,670
It's all my fault, sir.

837
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:28,826
When she developed vocal cord nodules,

838
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,952
I should've made her cancel the concert.

839
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,243
She still would've pushed forward with it,

840
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:33,843
knowing her.

841
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,325
I think the broker deceived me.

842
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,168
I secretly looked

843
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:39,018
for a replacement singer.

844
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,800
I had no idea Oh Yoon Hee could sing.

845
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,368
I checked numerous times,

846
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:48,009
but she completely masked her identity.

847
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,384
I'm really sorry, sir.

848
00:43:54,642 --> 00:43:56,217
So you're saying

849
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,759
Oh Yoon Hee sang

850
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:02,893
instead of Seo Jin at her concert?

851
00:44:13,225 --> 00:44:15,592
Now, that's interesting!

852
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:19,211
So you didn't know?

853
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,611
You said you heard everything...

854
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:27,842
Did you...

855
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,378
Mr. Do, it's time for you to choose.

856
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,102
Will you join hands with me?

857
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:38,411
Or will you get fired by Seo Jin

858
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,842
for running your mouth recklessly?

859
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:21,800
Hey, you scared me.

860
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:24,119
What are you doing here so early?

861
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:26,651
I was going to give you a wake-up call

862
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:28,750
but wanted to see you asleep.

863
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,610
How about breakfast?

864
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,994
Don't do that again.

865
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:36,291
I was tossing and turning all night

866
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,227
and barely fell asleep.

867
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:41,800
You seem irritable.

868
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:43,092
The concert went well,

869
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:45,092
and good things are happening.

870
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,868
Do you

871
00:45:46,892 --> 00:45:48,660
have a concern

872
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:50,800
that I don't know about?

873
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,134
No, not at all.

874
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,785
I'll wash up and come out.

875
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:58,759
Go have some coffee.

876
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,118
Oh Yoon Hee...

877
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:13,551
She's really something.

878
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,076
If I use her wisely,

879
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,009
she'll help me tame Seo Jin.

880
00:46:26,392 --> 00:46:28,134
What are you doing?

881
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:29,925
Can't you tell?

882
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,946
Can't you have breakfast

883
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:35,738
at your penthouse?

884
00:46:35,763 --> 00:46:37,158
I'm a high school senior.

885
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:39,603
I can't study if I'm in a bad mood.

886
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:40,659
Would you be quiet?

887
00:46:40,684 --> 00:46:42,118
I'm losing my appetite.

888
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:43,243
What?

889
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,409
You said I didn't need to try so hard.

890
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:47,576
So I've decided to drop the act.

891
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,994
I hate things

892
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:50,634
that aren't efficient.

893
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,050
How obnoxious!

894
00:47:14,892 --> 00:47:17,092
I love this place.

895
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:21,300
I made many new friends at school today.

896
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,285
I have you with me,

897
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:24,910
and I'm adjusting to the new school.

898
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:27,384
I'm so happy I could die.

899
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,467
Ro Na.

900
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,076
There's something

901
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,035
I need to tell you.

902
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:39,699
What is it? You're making me nervous.

903
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:41,285
Just spit it out.

904
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:43,134
Stop making me nervous.

905
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,050
I have to

906
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:48,785
return to Korea.

907
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:50,285
Why?

908
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,806
I wanted to live a happy life with you

909
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,873
as if nothing ever happened,

910
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,217
but I can't...

911
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,426
because my guilt is smothering me.

912
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,743
Whenever I think about Soo Ryeon,

913
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,118
I feel so guilty.

914
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:09,040
But you said you didn't kill her.

915
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:11,034
Why do you feel so guilty?

916
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,759
I don't get it.

917
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:15,159
Still, I must go.

918
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,800
I know I shouldn't do this to you,

919
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,050
but I have to go back.

920
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:24,175
No, Mum.

921
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,175
Just live here with me.

922
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,326
Forget everything that happened in Korea.

923
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,201
I'll pray every day

924
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:32,785
that Ms. Sim and her daughter will meet

925
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,910
and live happily together

926
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:35,035
in their next life.

927
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,826
So please don't go, Mum.

928
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:38,467
I...

929
00:48:41,976 --> 00:48:43,925
I killed that girl.

930
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:45,973
What?

931
00:48:46,517 --> 00:48:49,342
Min Seol A, Soo Ryeon's daughter.

932
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,108
I did that to her.

933
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:57,426
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

934
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,300
Liar.

935
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,551
Why are you lying to me?

936
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:08,826
You'd never do that, Mum.

937
00:49:10,443 --> 00:49:12,477
I will pay

938
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:15,967
for what I did.

939
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:18,418
Did you do that on purpose?

940
00:49:18,443 --> 00:49:20,150
Because of me?

941
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,285
To get me into Cheonga Arts High?

942
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:23,785
No.

943
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:25,535
It was definitely not on purpose.

944
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:27,326
If you were the one who killed her,

945
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,703
how could you move into her home

946
00:49:29,728 --> 00:49:32,175
and be happy about it going up in value?

947
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,649
You are a monster.

948
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:36,018
You scare me. You make me sick!

949
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,937
At the time, I didn't remember anything.

950
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:39,062
I'm telling you the truth, Ro Na.

951
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:40,355
Please believe me.

952
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,149
Stop it!

953
00:49:42,695 --> 00:49:44,853
You're saying you killed her.

954
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,200
You killed Min Seol A because of me!

955
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:49,119
My mum is a murderer!

956
00:49:49,144 --> 00:49:50,120
No.

957
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:51,330
It wasn't because of you.

958
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,597
Believe me. It wasn't because of you.

959
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,450
This is all me.

960
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:56,844
It has nothing to do with you.

961
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,868
So please don't beat yourself up, Ro Na.

962
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:00,842
Then why did you tell me?

963
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,676
You should've kept it from me forever.

964
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:06,493
What do I do now?

965
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:09,759
How am I supposed to live with this guilt?

966
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:11,910
Wait, Ro Na.

967
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:13,343
Ro Na!

968
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,023
Don't forgive me, Ro Na.

969
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:30,377
Just hate and resent me forever.

970
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,742
Did you tell your daughter?

971
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:41,694
That you're the one

972
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:43,592
who killed Seol A?

973
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:51,842
This is the last favour I ask of you.

974
00:50:53,142 --> 00:50:54,800
Please make sure

975
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,134
Ro Na never goes back to Korea.

976
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:02,967
If you can do that for me...

977
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:10,535
I'll do anything you want.

978
00:51:11,018 --> 00:51:12,925
Don't worry about Ro Na.

979
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:15,493
I'll keep her with me.

980
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:25,792
Do not come here, Ro Na.

981
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:28,967
Not until

982
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:31,509
I destroy all those evil people.

983
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,177
Are you ready for the press conference?

984
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:48,520
Don't forget.

985
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:49,796
It's this coming Saturday.

986
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:51,604
This crazy little...

987
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,217
Come in.

988
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:14,034
How have you been, Ms. Cheon?

989
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:29,800
Has it been

990
00:52:30,205 --> 00:52:31,946
two years already?

991
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:35,551
Why...

992
00:52:37,944 --> 00:52:39,602
are you here?

993
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,676
You want to reenrol?

994
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,493
Did you say "reenrol"?

995
00:52:48,517 --> 00:52:49,868
Yes.

996
00:52:49,892 --> 00:52:51,159
I came back because

997
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:53,551
I want to reenrol at Cheonga Arts High.

998
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,158
I'm sorry, but that is impossible.

And I refuse to go out of my way

1002
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:05,967
just to accept you.

1003
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,785
Does that answer your question?

1004
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,384
I knew you'd say that.

1005

But you see,

1006
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:15,501
you'll have no choice but to admit me.

1007

Are you doing this

1008
00:53:20,684 --> 00:53:23,461

1020
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:06,362
She's gulping it down voluntarily

1021
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:08,117
because she's parched.

1022
00:54:08,142 --> 00:54:10,259
Stay out of it.

1023
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:14,050
I said, enough.

1024
00:54:15,882 --> 00:54:17,076
Me?

1025
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,426
I'm not the Min Hyuk you used to know.

1026
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,592
How dare you?

1027
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:24,925
You little...

1028
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,217
You piece of...

1029
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,092
You guys haven't changed at all.

1030
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:37,800
Bae Ro Na?

1031
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,883
Darn it!

1032
00:54:44,475 --> 00:54:46,800
Je Ni, are you okay?

1033
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:50,368
Hey, how dare you show up at our school?

1034
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:52,451
You guys haven't quit this yet?

1035
00:54:52,475 --> 00:54:53,535
How could you still be the same

1036
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:54,660
after what happened?

1037
00:54:54,684 --> 00:54:57,509
What is this girl saying now?

1038
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,818
Hey...

1039
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:04,652
Guys, I... I think I broke my arm.

1040
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,151
I said, I broke my arm!

1041
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:09,584
That hurts!

1042
00:55:10,676 --> 00:55:12,568
Ro Na won first prize

1043
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:14,610
in the Elizabeth Competition?

1044
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:16,401
According to our school rules,

1045
00:55:16,425 --> 00:55:17,568
an international competition winner

1046
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:19,944
is allowed to reenrol.

1047
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:22,292
This is huge news.

1048
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:23,944
Isn't she

1049
00:55:23,968 --> 00:55:25,276
the youngest Korean winner so far?

1050
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,068
We should have the PR team to--

1051
00:55:27,092 --> 00:55:28,750
Do you think

1052
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:32,584
that's why I asked for you?

1053
00:55:33,217 --> 00:55:34,750
Pardon?

1054
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:38,985
I need the Head of Arts to step in.

1055
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:40,985
While attending this school,

1056
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:44,334
Ro Na got herself in a lot of trouble.

1057
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,026
If she reenrols,

1058
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,652
she might distract the seniors.

1059
00:55:49,676 --> 00:55:52,777
But don't you think she'll raise an issue?

1060
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:54,485
The rules clearly state

1061
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:56,750
that she may reenter.

1062
00:55:57,509 --> 00:56:00,860
We cannot let Ro Na come back here.

1063
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:02,568
Find a way.

1064
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,084
Is this all you can do?

1065
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:17,709
Hello, Ms. Ko.

1066
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,000
An accident?

1067
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:34,276
Where is Ro Na?

1068
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,875
Don't tell me

1069
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:38,792
you're here as her guardian.

1070
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,693
Did you forget that Eun Byeol

1071
00:56:40,717 --> 00:56:41,610
goes to this school?

1072
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:43,109
What if she sees you?

1073
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,109
Stop picking a fight.

1074
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:46,125
Just explain what happened.

1075
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:50,125
I told you everything on the phone.

1076
00:56:50,676 --> 00:56:53,584
Ro Na kicked Min Hyuk to the ground,

1077
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,318
and he's in the ER now.

1078
00:56:55,342 --> 00:56:57,084
Cheonga Medical Centre, right?

1079
00:56:57,185 --> 00:56:58,245
I'll go there.

1080
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,663
I'll see what's going on and call you.

1081
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:01,497
Don't worry. Just wait for my call.

1082
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,431
And make sure Ro Na is okay.

1083
00:57:06,592 --> 00:57:09,000
Are you sure Ro Na was here?

1084
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,292
Why would she come here?

1085
00:57:13,217 --> 00:57:15,792
You really don't know?

1086
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:17,652
Your daughter

1087
00:57:17,676 --> 00:57:19,276
showed up with a prize

1088
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,652
from an international competition,

1089
00:57:20,676 --> 00:57:22,250
asking to be readmitted.

1090
00:57:22,384 --> 00:57:24,276
I thought you sent her.

1091
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,000
She did?

1092
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:32,250
Where is she now?

1093
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,777
As you can probably gather,

1094
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:35,151
we can't readmit her

1095
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,985
due to this assault incident.

1096
00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:38,276
Since she is not our student,

1097
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,459
the school won't reprimand her.

1098
00:57:40,884 --> 00:57:42,318
However, she's likely to be

1099
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:44,292
investigated by the police.

1100
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,652
Explain what really happened

1101
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:50,584
so I can understand.

1102
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,276
Ro Na showed up out of the blue

1103
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,902
and kicked Min Hyuk.

1104
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:56,125
Je Ni threw up from shock.

1105
00:57:56,884 --> 00:57:57,929
You all saw that, right?

1106
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:58,969
- Yes.
- I saw it too.

1107
00:57:58,994 --> 00:57:59,889
- Me too.
- I saw it too.

1108
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:01,068
- I saw it.
- Me too.

1109
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:03,068
She's really strong.

1110
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:04,917
I didn't do that.

1111
00:58:05,384 --> 00:58:07,584
They're lying.

1112
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:12,833
You guys were bullying Je Ni.

1113
00:58:12,884 --> 00:58:14,235
Why leave that part out?

1114
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:16,318
They were bullying Je Ni?

1115
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:19,501
They're Cheonga's model students.

1116
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:21,485
Je Ni.

1117
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:23,109
You tell me.

1118
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,542
Did they bully you?

1119
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:35,125
No.

1120
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:37,693
We were just goofing around.

1121
00:58:37,717 --> 00:58:39,917
Je Ni, how could you...

1122
00:58:45,425 --> 00:58:46,959
Ro Na!

1123
00:58:54,842 --> 00:58:56,750
Are you out of your mind?

1124
00:58:57,384 --> 00:58:58,610
What are you doing here?

1125
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:01,292
Why come back to this horrible place?

1126
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:04,334
I want to graduate.

1127
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,109
I also want the Cheonga Arts Festival

1128
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:07,360
grand prize trophy.

1129
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:08,485
I don't need any of that,

1130
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:10,276
so go back at once. Okay?

1131
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,443
Seoul National University, the prize,

1132
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:14,318
or even if it's something better...

1133
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,526
I don't care.

1134
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,985
I mean it.

1135
00:59:17,009 --> 00:59:18,068
Why do you assume

1136
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:19,792
that I sing because of you?

1137
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:20,860
What?

1138
00:59:20,884 --> 00:59:21,777
You're not the reason

1139
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:23,668
I want to win the grand prize.

1140
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:26,944
It's for me. I'm doing it for myself.

1141
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:29,026
I want to reenrol at Cheonga Arts High.

1142
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,568
And I will participate

1143
00:59:30,592 --> 00:59:32,292
in Cheonga Arts Festival.

1144
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:33,568
I have to.

1145
00:59:33,592 --> 00:59:36,167
But why? Why do you have to do it?

1146
00:59:36,842 --> 00:59:38,501
No.

1147
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:40,443
Please.

1148
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:42,652
Please go back to the US, Ro Na.

1149
00:59:42,676 --> 00:59:44,360
Haven't you been through enough?

1150
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:47,292
Who knows what they'll do to you?

1151
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,125
Are you scared that I'd be bullied?

1152
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:53,875
Mum.

1153
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,042
You're always so selfish.

1154
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:01,276
Now that you know I'm alive,

1155
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,125
can I go?

1156
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:08,839
Ro Na!

1157
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:23,985
Do you think

1158
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:26,026
this can put things right?

1159
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,860
My dear son broke his arm!

1160
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:30,526
His iron arm!

1161
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,610
My baby broke his arm!

1162
01:00:32,634 --> 01:00:35,443
How can Ro Na be so strong?

1163
01:00:35,467 --> 01:00:37,985
You see, I'm a cultured, elegant lady,

1164
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,026
but I lose it

1165
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,568
when my boy is hurt!

1166
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:42,026
Anyway,

1167
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:44,401
how will you take responsibility for this?

1168
01:00:44,425 --> 01:00:45,902
My mum's filing a suit.

1169
01:00:45,926 --> 01:00:47,735
She's so upset that she can't even eat.

1170
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:50,109
An assemblyman's son

1171
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,193
was bullied at school.

1172
01:00:52,217 --> 01:00:53,235
How is this possible?

1173
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:55,318
The doctor said he didn't need a cast,

1174
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:57,875
but you insisted on it.

1175
01:00:58,676 --> 01:01:00,235
Come on. We're neighbours.

1176
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:02,610
Don't be so uptight about it.

1177
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:04,276
Hey, Mr. Ha!

1178
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,318
I'm disappointed in you.

1179
01:01:06,342 --> 01:01:07,568
Just because you're successful

1180
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:09,709
doesn't mean you can be so brazen!

1181
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,750
Kyu Jin

1182
01:01:12,175 --> 01:01:15,042
will not let you off the hook.

1183
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:17,709
We'll take this to court.

1184
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,652
Don't expect us to settle

1185
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,292
or go easy on you.

1186
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:22,693
But I'm not surprised.

1187
01:01:22,717 --> 01:01:25,084
She's a murderer's daughter after all.

1188
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:27,485
She's so used to violence.

1189
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,235
Come on. Go ahead and hit me.

1190
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:30,193
- Don't speak that way
- Hit me.

1191
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:32,209
about my wife and daughter!

1192
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:38,318
Since you used to be an attorney,

1193
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:39,902
you must know that what you just said

1194
01:01:39,926 --> 01:01:42,084
is considered defamation.

1195
01:01:42,509 --> 01:01:45,109
If you say things like that again,

1196
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:47,542
I will rip your mouth out.

1197
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:50,542
Hey.

1198
01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:54,167
People will think

1199
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,693
that you're talking about

1200
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:58,833
your first wife and real daughter!

1201
01:02:16,342 --> 01:02:17,959
Right.

1202
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:21,125
This could be my chance.

1203
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:25,985
I might be able to use Ro Na

1204
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:28,125
as my shield.

1205
01:02:35,217 --> 01:02:37,417
Hello? Who...

1206
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:44,300
Ro Na?

1207
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:55,326
Ro Na, what are you doing here?

1208
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,118
Your daughter came to see me

1209
01:02:57,142 --> 01:03:00,259
and is begging me to readmit her.

1210
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,009
Get up. Come on!

1211
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:08,660
I won't cause any trouble at school.

1212
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:09,994
I promise.

1213
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:11,410
If anything happens,

1214
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:13,592
I'll gladly accept any punishment.

1215
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:15,076
So please...

1216
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,618
Please let me reenrol.

1217
01:03:16,642 --> 01:03:19,076
I want to graduate from Cheonga Arts High.

1218
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,410
Please, I beg you.

1219
01:03:20,434 --> 01:03:22,201
What are you talking about?

1220
01:03:22,225 --> 01:03:23,618
Why would you beg her?

1221
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:24,910
Let go!

1222
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,967
This is none of your business, Mum.

1223
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,910
You used to be my student.

1224
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:33,451
I feel bad because you seem so desperate.

1225
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:35,467
I'll think about it.

1226
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:37,467
One condition though.

1227
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:39,743
Bring me a written pledge

1228
01:03:39,767 --> 01:03:41,243
signed by your mum that she will

1229
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:42,785
cooperate with the school's decisions

1230
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:44,551
without causing trouble.

1231
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:46,576
Without that, I can't trust her.

1232
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,384
I can do that.

1233
01:03:48,976 --> 01:03:50,368
I'll take care of that.

1234
01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:51,785
Ro Na, how could you...

1235
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:53,118
Fine.

1236
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:54,800
You may leave.

1237
01:04:06,225 --> 01:04:08,175
What are you doing?

1238
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,827
She will not go back to Cheonga Arts High.

1239
01:04:09,851 --> 01:04:11,243
I won't let her.

1240
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,243
I thought you'd be very grateful.

1241
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,535
I'm surprised.

1242
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,217
What's your reason?

1243
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,467
I don't want her to.

1244
01:04:18,934 --> 01:04:20,618
Whether you want it or not,

1245
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:22,243
I'll decide according to school policy

1246
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:23,827
as the chief director.

1247
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:25,493
I don't want to be accused of

1248
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:27,326
keeping your daughter out

1249
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,785
because of my hard feelings toward you

1250
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:31,634
since I'm a teacher after all.

1251
01:04:34,018 --> 01:04:35,535
"Teacher"?

1252
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:38,092
I suppose you're trying to use Ro Na

1253
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:40,159
to cut a deal or something.

1254
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:41,842
About that...

1255
01:04:45,434 --> 01:04:48,092
Why don't we put it behind us now?

1256
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,785
If you want the incident with Min Hyuk

1257
01:04:49,809 --> 01:04:51,551
to be resolved favourably.

1258
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:53,076
If word gets out that she assaulted

1259
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,076
an assemblyman's son,

1260
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,827
there will be a bumpy road ahead of her.

1261
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:57,551
Are you okay with that?

1262
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,493
Even to go back to her school in the US,

1263
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:02,217
she can't have a prior for assault, right?

1264
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:04,384
You sly witch.

1265
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,368
Do you think

1266
01:05:06,392 --> 01:05:08,159
this can bury what happened?

1267
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:09,785
What do you gain

1268
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:11,925
from hurting my reputation?

1269
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:14,076
Are you willing

1270
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,576
to destroy Ro Na's life just to get me?

1271
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,259
If you do anything to Ro Na,

1272
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:22,076
I will make you pay for it.

1273
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,759
That...

1274
01:05:30,183 --> 01:05:32,718
depends on you now.

1275
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:50,035
Ro Na.

1276
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:52,576
Why won't you listen to me?

1277
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,994
Please go back to the US.

1278
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:55,076
Please!

1279
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,718
Do you want me

1280
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:57,868
to hide somewhere

1281
01:05:57,892 --> 01:05:59,618
where you can never find me?

1282
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:02,634
Or must I

1283
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:05,134
expose what you did?

1284
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,092
Ro Na.

1285
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:09,967
Don't try to do anything for me.

1286
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:12,925
I'll figure things out on my own.

1287
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:18,243
Where are you going? It's getting late!

1288
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,285
Ro Na.

1289
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,883
Let's talk, please!

1290
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,050
What do you mean?

1291
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,718
Don't raise your voice at the table.

1292
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:40,660
Why would you accept Ro Na?

1293
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:42,118
Mum, what are you thinking?

1294
01:06:42,142 --> 01:06:44,842
I don't want to see her at school!

1295
01:06:45,517 --> 01:06:48,384
You can't stop that as the chief director?

1296
01:06:50,392 --> 01:06:51,743
Are you whining because

1297
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:54,175
you're scared of someone like Ro Na?

1298
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,785
You're the top student now.

1299
01:06:56,809 --> 01:07:00,175
It'd be good for you to have a pacemaker.

1300
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,092
Is this

1301
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,076
about Cheonga Arts Festival?

1302
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,952
Are you afraid she'd beat you?

1303
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:08,118
No, that will not happen.

1304
01:07:08,142 --> 01:07:11,243
I won't lose to a loser like her.

1305
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:12,493
Yes!

1306
01:07:12,517 --> 01:07:14,800
That's my daughter.

1307
01:07:16,018 --> 01:07:18,618
Having a rival

1308
01:07:18,642 --> 01:07:21,050
is a blessing.

1309
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:23,759
We're done talking about this, okay?

1310
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:26,994
Finish your food.

1311
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:28,718
I have plans.

1312
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:36,634
This isn't about the stupid trophy!

1313
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:41,509
Mum doesn't know anything!

1314
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:47,368
You're upset

1315
01:07:47,392 --> 01:07:48,660
because you think Seok Hoon

1316
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,925
might go back to Ro Na.

1317
01:07:52,392 --> 01:07:53,925
Yes.

1318
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,676
I'm so worried.

1319
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,159
He's really...

1320
01:08:00,183 --> 01:08:02,259
Seok Hoon is the only one for me.

1321
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:04,800
Do you want me to call him?

1322
01:08:04,934 --> 01:08:07,342
I got the sample questions for the exam.

1323
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:12,743
I had an important meeting,

1324
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:14,410
so I'm still in the office.

1325
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:16,076
See you at the hotel. I'll be on time.

1326
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,076
How are you feeling?

1327
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,618
Well, not bad.

1328
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:23,384
I'm excited to spend time with you.

1329
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,285
I'm excited too.

1330
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:26,925
I love you.

1331
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:32,509
Gosh, so this is

1332
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:35,118
proof that someone else sang

1333
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:37,009
at Seo Jin's concert?

1334
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,076
I also included messages

1335
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,243
exchanged with the brokers.

1336
01:08:39,267 --> 01:08:41,544
"Non-disclosure Agreement"

1337
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,702
You're really good at your job.

1338
01:08:44,726 --> 01:08:46,076
No wonder

1339
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,092
Seo Jin trusts you so much.

1340
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:50,660
May I assume

1341
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:52,660
that this helped us bond a bit more?

1342
01:08:52,684 --> 01:08:55,134
This is where it ends between us.

1343
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:56,827
If you demand more,

1344
01:08:56,851 --> 01:08:59,551
I'll have no choice but to tell Ms. Cheon.

1345
01:09:00,018 --> 01:09:01,076
That actually

1346
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,175
makes me trust you even more.

1347
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:05,610
I will not answer your calls.

1348
01:09:14,469 --> 01:09:17,051
"Belline Hotel"

1349
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,134
Where are you?

1350
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:54,134
Hurry up. I miss you.

1351
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,718
Eun Byeol.

1352
01:10:01,225 --> 01:10:02,842
Eun Byeol?

1353
01:10:14,434 --> 01:10:16,009
Are you inside?

1354
01:10:17,934 --> 01:10:19,634
You're here.

1355
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,094
Who are you?

1356
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,371
What are you doing?

1357
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:37,055
Why are you here?

1358
01:11:36,828 --> 01:11:39,150
=Penthouse 2=

1359
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:41,276
You deceived me and met another man?

1360
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,276
How long have you been keeping secrets?

1361
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,153
We have

1362
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:45,860
no legal obligations to each other yet.

1363
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,526
I wondered how you were doing.

1364
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,360
Did you not think about me?

1365
01:11:49,384 --> 01:11:51,735
What if it's all an act to get you back?

1366
01:11:51,759 --> 01:11:52,735
Shut it!

1367
01:11:52,759 --> 01:11:54,443
Your mum is the one who killed my mum.

1368
01:11:54,467 --> 01:11:56,235
You promised to keep Ro Na safe.

1369
01:11:56,259 --> 01:11:57,818
I'll do whatever it takes

1370
01:11:57,842 --> 01:11:59,985
to win the Cheonga Arts Festival trophy.

1371
01:12:00,009 --> 01:12:00,944
You have some nerve.

1372
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:04,292
I may just kill your daughter, Seok Kyung.
