Jeez.

=Episode 2=

7
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,293
Are you on a shaky bridge or something?

8
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,250
Why are your legs trembling?

9
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,984
I'm not trembling.

10
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:18,985
Tomorrow is your engagement ceremony.

11
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,739
How's the preparation going?

12
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,859
Do you need any help?

13
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:24,485
I'll just take the thought.

14
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,985
Oh, Unit 4502 has been sold.

15
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:29,715
What? Really?

16
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,484
I'm finally going to have a new neighbour?

17
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,068
That's wonderful.

18
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,527
Who's the new resident?

19
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:39,818
I know Oh Yoon Hee was found innocent,

20
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:41,443
but it's still a bit eerie.

21
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,859
Maybe they don't know who owned it before.

22
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,943
Someone introduced him to Chairman Joo.

23
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,776
A CEO of a biotech company in the US.

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,151
Then is he an American?

25
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,026
Or a Korean-American?

26
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,943
He's Korean.

27
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:57,500
His company is called JohnBIO.

28
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,376
My goodness, JohnBIO?

29
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,985
Our apartment prices are going to go up!

30
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,985
Wait, you've heard of JohnBIO?

31
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,776
Their male vitality product became a hit.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,610
Kyu Jin is an avid user,

33
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:16,750
and it's definitely effective.

34
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:20,068
You know very well that I'm all alone.

35
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:21,527
Are you making fun of me?

36
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:23,418
Or are you teasing me?

37
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:43,776
You should call it a day.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,360
Okay. Shall we?

39
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:47,360
Tomorrow is my engagement ceremony,

40
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:48,610
so I'm a little out of it.

41
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,625
Thank you for coming, reporters.

42
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,527
You must be pretty nervous

43
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:57,542
for your 20th debut anniversary concert.

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,500
Your voice even cracked.

45
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,792
My throat must've been a little dry.

46
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:05,694
You won't report on that, will you?

47
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:07,251
Of course not.

48
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:09,235
Right.

49
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,276
Did you prepare anything special

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,834
for this concert?

51
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,443
The world of music has been

52
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,209
waiting for your new challenge.

53
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:18,376
You won't be disappointed.

54
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,418
Please.

55
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,500
- Mr. Do.
- Yes.

56
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:32,042
Don't you dare to write anything absurd.

57
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,110
Let's try again from that part.

58
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:37,792
You can't sing high F in this condition.

59
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,735
You should go home.

60
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,500
Tomorrow is your engagement ceremony.

61
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:44,235
My concert is more important than that.

62
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,193
You know that this is

63
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:47,585
the most important concert of my life.

64
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,193
I can do this.

65
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:51,397
Let's begin. Just the last part.

66
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,523
"Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin"

67
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:08,292
Well...

68
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,209
How have you all been?

69
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,322
Were you in the middle of something?

70
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,443
Why do you look so surprised?

71
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,500
Am I not allowed to come here?

72
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:25,901
Oh, let me introduce you

73
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,500
to my wife.

74
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,500
Oh Yoon Hee.

75
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,917
What?

76
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,959
It's been a while.

77
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,042
Congratulations, Seo Jin.

78
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:46,151
Your wife?

79
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:48,917
Am I hearing things?

80
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,542
Are you saying you two are married?

81
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:56,859
Wait. Dr. Ha, your wife is Oh Yoon Hee?

82
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:59,209
You two are... Man.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,776
What kind of shocking news is this?

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,901
How did you end up with Yoon Hee?

85
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,610
Tell me about it.

86
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,943
Of all women out there,

87
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,443
why did he get involved

88
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,818
with a murder suspect?

89
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,735
- Ma Ri.
- Yes?

90
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,151
You're still a good talker.

91
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:16,694
- Right.
- But that's enough talking.

92
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,235
You shouldn't refuse to accept

93
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,151
something that was decided by the law.

94
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,066
That's not good manners, is it?

95
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,193
So? Where's Ro Na?

96
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,214
Isn't she with you?

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,568
You picked the perfect dress.

98
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,776
It looks great on you.

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,901
I don't recall

100
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,402
inviting you to my engagement ceremony.

101
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,959
Don't get us wrong.

102
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,667
We came to the hotel on business.

103
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,026
Still,

104
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,943
it's so nice to see you like this.

105
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,818
Dr. Ha, I nearly didn't recognise you.

106
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,485
Hold on.

107
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,110
Didn't you go to the US as a researcher?

108
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:56,318
Oh, that.

109
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:58,776
It seemed I wasn't cut out to be a doctor.

110
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,527
I began a small business.

111
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,167
A business?

112
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:05,500
Sounds like a worse career path for you.

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,776
I hope you two weren't dating

114
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,110
while you both lived in Hera Palace.

115
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,834
Goodness, I wouldn't.

116
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,418
I wouldn't do anything of that sort.

117
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,568
I met her by chance in the States.

118
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,167
Dr. Ha.

119
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,943
I don't think this is very polite of you.

120
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,360
You came here on purpose

121
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:30,735
to turn our wonderful day into a mess, no?

122
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,443
I seriously just stopped by on my way.

123
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,610
Well.

124
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,568
If I caused any disturbance, I'm sorry.

125
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:38,251
See you around.

126
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,527
Congrats, Eun Byeol.

127
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,542
You now have a stepmother too.

128
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,901
And she's a very famous woman

129
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:48,207
who was all over the news.

130
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,776
Don't give me those eyes.

131
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,404
I suddenly began to like you a lot.

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,625
Don't you feel much closer to me now?

133
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:59,084
We have something in common.

134
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,985
Eun Byeol!

135
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,110
Where are you going, Eun Byeol?

136
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,735
You murderer.

137
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,859
How dare you show up? You're brazen!

138
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:18,776
Joo Seok Kyung!

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,151
I don't believe that you're innocent.

140
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,943
Ms. Yang couldn't have killed my mum.

141
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,235
You killed her.

142
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,193
She was nothing but an angel to you.

143
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,443
Why did you kill her?

144
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29,674
Why?

145
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:31,818
It seemed like everyone already forgot

146
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,459
about Soo Ryeon,

147
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,917
so I was actually disappointed.

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,026
It's nice to see that

149
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,376
you still remember your mum, Seok Kyung.

150
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:44,840
Let's go.

151
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,583
Do you think you could fool me?

152
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,859
You murderer. You're a devil!

153
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,959
That girl is feisty.

154
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,000
That's scary.

155
00:07:57,092 --> 00:08:00,318
How did she change that drastically?

156
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:01,875
How?

157
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:20,709
I thought

158
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,402
seven billion won of alimony was

159
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,459
way above anything you deserved.

160
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,901
What more do you want from her

161
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,776
that you showed up like you're a big shot

162
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,151
in expensive clothes that don't suit you

163
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,084
with the dramatic helicopter entrance?

164
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,552
If the best thing you could think of was

165
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:36,427
showing up with Oh Yoon Hee

166
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,218
to rub Seo Jin the wrong way,

167
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,609
I'm deeply disappointed.

168
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,485
That was good for your final effort,

169
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,193
but it ends here.

170
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,360
If you ever lurk around us once again,

171
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:48,917
I--

172
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,709
Let go!

173
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,542
Hey. Let's go.

174
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:08,911
Okay.

175
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:17,485
- Are you all right?
- Of course.

176
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,459
"JohnBIO Korea Business Conference"

177
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,997
"JohnBIO Korea Business Conference"

178
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,209
What's going on?

179
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:28,859
He should've drowned to death already.

180
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,318
Why is he still alive?

181
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,318
I was told that they took care of him.

182
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,818
You idiot!

183
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,694
Find out if Ha Yoon Chul and Oh Yoon Hee

184
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,485
are actually married.

185
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:40,776
And report back on everything

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,014
Oh Yoon Hee did for the last three months.

187
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:00,750
Do you like it?

188
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,193
We couldn't go too far

189
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,585
because of your upcoming concert,

190
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,901
but once it ends,

191
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:06,985
let's visit your favourite place in Italy

192
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,443
for a few weeks.

193
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,000
How does that sound?

194
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,625
The news

195
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,776
on our engagement got out,

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,432
so there's no reason to postpone

197
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,609
the merger of our companies.

198
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:38,675
I'll hire a merger and acquisition expert

199
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,675
and create a team within next week--

200
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,000
Why are you in such a rush?

201
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,370
My schedule this year is already full

202
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:44,694
with concerts and performances.

203
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:47,422
Isn't that why we're engaged, not married?

204
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,068
Is he on your mind?

205
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:52,985
Who is?

206
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,360
Ha Yoon Chul has been on your mind

207
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,167
all along since he showed up.

208
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,360
That's not true.

209
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,360
I know you.

210
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,573
I'm doing my best to make you feel better,

211
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:03,985
but you're somewhere else right now.

212
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,901
Our engagement ceremony was ruined

213
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:07,412
in front of everyone from Hera Palace

214
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:09,220
and all of our VIP guests.

215
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,026
I don't know

216
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,542
what those two are up to.

217
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,292
Maybe Oh Yoon Hee

218
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:21,792
got in touch with Logan Lee in the US.

219
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,068
She must have got

220
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,026
Yoon Chul involved to get her revenge.

221
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,583
He couldn't have helped her.

222
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:27,776
Logan Lee is currently

223
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,276
under house arrest around the clock.

224
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,193
I've been contacting his father regularly.

225
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:34,500
If Logan isn't involved,

226
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,145
then did they really get married or what?

227
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,859
Inconceivable.

228
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,500
Wasn't she his first love?

229
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,776
Two losers must feel sorry for each other.

230
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,776
He wouldn't easily marry anyone

231
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,443
for Eun Byeol's sake.

232
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,943
And what business?

233
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:48,901
The land in Myeong-dong got sold,

234
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,694
so I sent him 10 billion won.

235
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:51,943
10 billion?

236
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:52,985
When was this?

237
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,265
A year ago.

238
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,818
He wouldn't give up on his practice.

239
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,251
He doesn't have the boldness

240
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,418
or ambition to start a business.

241
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,859
We got engaged today.

242
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,625
How long are you going to talk about him?

243
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,235
Can't you just leave it to me?

244
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,235
Did I ever

245
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,688
do anything to fail to earn your trust?

246
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,387
I'm sorry

247
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:20,959
I screamed at you.

248
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,026
I guess I got too concerned

249
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,792
because of Eun Byeol.

250
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:33,583
Ha Yoon Chul and Oh Yoon Hee.

251
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,917
They have nothing to do with me now.

252
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,583
I won't have to see them again.

253
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,231
"45th Floor"

254
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,159
Are you all right?

255
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,059
Ma Ri, what is it?

256
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,159
Ms. Cheon, this is huge.

257
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:52,727
The one who moved into Unit 4502 is

258
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:54,351
Oh Yoon Hee.

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,492
It's Dr. Ha and Oh Yoon Hee!

260
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,534
What are you talking about?

261
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,284
That's...

262
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,909
Let's talk again later.

263
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,226
Oh Yoon Hee is back.

264
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,867
What?

265
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,226
She came back to Hera Palace.

266
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,643
What are you talking about?

267
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,685
The one who bought Unit 4502 is

268
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,310
Ha Yoon Chul!

269
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,909
Ha Yoon Chul?

270
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,159
How could he have bought...

271
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,451
Wait, he's with JohnBIO?

272
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:36,057
"JohnBIO Korea Business Conference"

273
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,838
It's impossible.

274
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,505
Why didn't you even check

275
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,840
who bought it?

276
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:43,935
Why did you approve their purchase?

277
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,128
I had no idea because he signed

278
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,809
everything under his corporate name.

279
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,768
You should've looked more closely!

280
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,894
I thought you kept your eyes on Yoon Hee.

281
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,101
Didn't you think of the possibility

282
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,602
that they could end up seeing each other?

283
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,768
And now I have to check

284
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,768
your ex-husband's whereabouts?

285
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,185
Is this my fault too?

286
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,101
This proves your incompetence!

287
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,059
Just admit the truth.

288
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,185
If you're that competent,

289
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,351
why didn't you send him to a desolate area

290
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,852
where he could never return?

291
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:09,059
Did you forget how I kicked Yoon Hee

292
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,727
out of Hera Palace?

293
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,268
Do you know what I had to do

294
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,831
to get rid of her?

295
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,159
But she came back

296
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,268
because of you.

297
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,059
If you had dealt with Ms. Yang better,

298
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,351
Yoon Hee wouldn't have been freed!

299
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,476
Those things already happened!

300
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,435
And what can she do anyway?

301
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,950
We confiscated her house and her assets!

302
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,976
The law says she's innocent,

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,518
but she will forever be branded

304
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,476
as a murderer.

305
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,849
Yoon Chul is the CEO of JohnBIO!

306
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:41,865
And Yoon Hee is now Yoon Chul's wife.

307
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,783
I shouldn't have thought of her as a joke.

308
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,034
I need to go.

309
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,143
What can you do right now anyway?

310
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,185
It wasn't easy for us to find time

311
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,435
to come on this trip.

312
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,059
Do you have to ruin our precious time

313
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,310
because of some unimportant people?

314
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:59,284
It's already ruined.

315
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,143
I can't trust you from now on.

316
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,284
I'll take care of everything myself.

317
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,284
Darn it!

318
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,435
Speak.

319
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,810
I found out the reason why

320
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:19,976
Dr. Ha came back to Korea.

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,268
He's the actual owner of a new company

322
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,268
called JohnBIO.

323
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,117
Why are you telling me this now, you jerk?

324
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,700
Darn it!

325
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,518
No way.

326
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,852
I can't believe this.

327
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:40,976
Yoon Chul is the developer of Power Up?

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,685
The CEO of JohnBIO is the third person

329
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,268
on the list of people I look up to.

330
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,768
How could he be that loser, Yoon Chul?

331
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,185
My pride is shattered.

332
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,998
Dr. Ha is flying with wings

333
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:52,041
ever since he moved to the US.

334
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,767
He seemed like a charismatic businessman.

335
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,101
Once his company gets listed,

336
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,727
the stock price will keep going up.

337
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,351
He might end up

338
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,351
moving up to the penthouse

339
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,143
on the 100th floor before we do.

340
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,435
You might be right.

341
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,727
Even Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin of Gangnam

342
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:06,143
hasn't even got to the 60th floor yet.

343
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,518
Why is Yoon Hee so lucky?

344
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,810
It's not like I don't have any money.

345
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,393
The voters complain too much!

346
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,935
Didn't you love his style today?

347
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,143
He looked wonderful in his Italian suit.

348
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,810
Has he always been that handsome?

349
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,435
That's why a man should be

350
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,101
with the right kind of woman.

351
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,935
He's much sweeter and courteous.

352
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,435
- Gosh.
- You're right.

353
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,018
I heard they're first love to each other.

354
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:30,185
If Ms. Cheon hadn't come between them,

355
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,976
they would've lived a great life already.

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,018
Ms. Cheon took a huge blow, that's what.

357
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,143
Serves her right.

358
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,727
She must be jealous to death.

359
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,226
Why would she be jealous?

360
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,351
She'll be married to Chairman Joo soon.

361
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,351
That's not how women's mind work.

362
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,268
Why don't you know a thing about women?

363
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,618
That's why girls don't like you.

364
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,935
I'm a hunk.

365
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,476
- I got 52 per cent of the votes.
- Yoon Hee

366
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,768
must've saved a country in her past life.

367
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:56,935
People say I'm really cute too.

368
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,268
- I thought they were
- I've won

369
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,727
- on a photo shoot.
- in the competition

370
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,492
- for good-looking kids.
- The helicopter!

371
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,783
What are you doing, Ms. Jin?

372
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,075
Ms. Cheon.

373
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,185
I thought you were on a trip.

374
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,852
I said what are you doing?

375
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,310
Why are you cooking this late?

376
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:29,768
Eun Byeol said she's in charge

377
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,059
of bringing snacks tomorrow.

378
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,810
I wanted to prepare ahead.

379
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:36,117
Pizza, tteokbokki, and fried food?

380
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,560
When did she go to sleep?

381
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:44,742
I'm not sure what the exact time was.

382
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,268
Ms. Jin, how can you not know?

383
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,059
I told you, you and Eun Byeol

384
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,310
should move as one on her senior year.

385
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,935
You sleep with her, wake up with her,

386
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,643
check if she's well, if she's constipated,

387
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,560
if her period is regular or not.

388
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:01,310
You must know every little thing

389
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,643
that she's doing. Didn't I say that?

390
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,643
Her food, her rides,

391
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,059
her schedule, health, weight,

392
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,560
and the hours of sleep she gets are

393
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,435
all your responsibility, Ms. Jin.

394
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,284
I am aware.

395
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:12,143
And that I should treat her carefully

396
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,268
as if I'm handling porcelain.

397
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,659
I want you to stay on top of everything.

398
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,018
- Mum.
- You weren't asleep?

399
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,351
It's past 3 a.m.

400
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,618
I had to study a little more.

401
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,101
When did you get home?

402
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,700
How was the trip?

403
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,727
I was worried about you,

404
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:33,976
so I just came back.

405
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,393
You don't have to worry about me.

406
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,935
I'm fine.

407
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,976
You haven't been away for long.

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,326
You should've had lots of fun with Mr. Joo.

409
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,894
I wasn't feeling well, so I put it on

410
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,075
in case I catch a cold.

411
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:00,976
Make sure you take

412
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,326
your propolis extract and vitamin.

413
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:05,242
Okay.

414
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,034
Have you been

415
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,143
out of touch with your dad?

416
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,685
You blocked him on my email

417
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,783
and from my phone.

418
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,602
Did you know

419
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,992
that he married Ro Na's mum?

420
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,117
No, not at all.

421
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:29,268
I'm embarrassed to death.

422
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,894
Why Ro Na's mum of all people?

423
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:34,200
He knows how much I dread her!

424
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:37,310
You finally understood, right?

425
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:40,976
Your dad is utterly useless in your life.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,768
I already

427
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,159
crossed him out of my life.

428
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,768
I won't see him even if he calls.

429
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,867
That's my girl.

430
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,409
I will give you my full support

431
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:56,492
until you become the best of the best.

432
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,476
You're the only one for me, Mum.

433
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,560
I'll study a bit more before I sleep.

434
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,200
Get some rest, Mum.

435
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:05,852
Don't strain yourself.

436
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,409
I won't.

437
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,950
You can leave through the back door.

438
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,492
What are you doing there?

439
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:52,867
Are you here to see Ro Na?

440
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,700
No.

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,366
"Fragile: Photo Frame"

442
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:19,351
"Fragile: Photo Frame"

443
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,018
What are you doing? It's their photo!

444
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,887
- Goodness.
- Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

445
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,728
I'll destroy this.

446
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:30,370
It's all right.

447
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,906
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol.

448
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:38,101
My dear, I must have surprised you.

449
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,976
Are you going to live here?

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,909
Here at Hera Palace

451
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:43,659
with Ro Na?

452
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,768
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

453
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,685
I wanted to tell you ahead,

454
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,268
but I had no means to get to you.

455
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,310
You wouldn't answer my calls, texts,

456
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,268
- or emails--
- You don't have to explain.

457
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,268
And you don't have to apologise.

458
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,810
We're as good as strangers anyway.

459
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,727
Strangers?

460
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:57,685
What are you talking about?

461
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,018
You abandoned me and left

462
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:01,721
while my life was the most troubled!

463
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,205
Don't ever say hi to me

464
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,263
even if we run into each other.

465
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,992
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

466
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,185
Goodness, Ms. Cheon.

467
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:24,685
I thought you were on a trip.

468
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:28,159
Or did you just come back?

469
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,602
Sang A, my heart is racing.

470
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,810
Why is everything suddenly so exciting?

471
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,268
Doesn't it look like

472
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,560
bloodshed is on the horizon once again

473
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,326
in this quiet Hera Palace?

474
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,992
Yoon Hee!

475
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,492
Where are you?

476
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,659
Come out, Yoon Hee!

477
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,618
What's up?

478
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,935
Explain what happened here.

479
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,476
Why are you here?

480
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,768
Why did you return here of all places?

481
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,185
Is this the only house you could find?

482
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,783
Are you stalking me?

483
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,992
It's not like I'm banned from this place.

484
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,825
I used to live here,

485
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,200
and I loved it when I first moved in.

486
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:16,451
That's why I came back.

487
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:19,643
Did you forget who died in the penthouse?

488
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,685
I wouldn't even be near this place,

489
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:23,226
and yet you wanted to live here?

490
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,685
There are many people around here

491
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,143
who remember seeing you in handcuffs.

492
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,700
- To them, you're still--
- Even you

493
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,783
live here.

494
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,700
That's what gave me courage.

495
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,326
What?

496
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,268
Stop making a scene at my place.

497
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:39,685
If you're here to talk, take it outside.

498
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,242
No.

499
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,659
I'm going to do it here.

500
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,935
I don't care if you two are married

501
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,825
or if you're putting on a show.

502
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,643
But you aren't allowed to live here.

503
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,200
And the reason is?

504
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:55,852
It's where your daughter, Eun Byeol lives.

505
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,143
You're going to hurt her if you stay.

506
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,618
How can you call yourself her dad?

507
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,200
That's exactly why I came.

508
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,560
You made it impossible

509
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,268
for me to communicate with her.

510
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:08,685
So I had no choice

511
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,602
but to move into the same building

512
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:11,700
and run into her from time to time.

513
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:14,576
We're divorced,

514
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,727
but I want to be by Eun Byeol's side.

515
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:19,242
Gosh, he's so manly.

516
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,992
That was amazingly charismatic.

517
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,226
You have no right to see her.

518
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,075
She doesn't want you as her dad either.

519
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,659
Why are you so anxious?

520
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,101
You already have everything.

521
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,685
You have your dream job,

522
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,018
your dream man,

523
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,034
and Eun Byeol too.

524
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,685
You can keep living your life.

525
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,909
Live happily ever after with Dan Tae.

526
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,950
I'll live my own life

527
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,700
with Yoon Hee.

528
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,534
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

529
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:55,435
I'm actually thankful for you.

530
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:57,226
My life

531
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,492
took a big turn after our divorce.

532
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,643
Stop acting like you're so cool.

533
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,143
You showed up after two years

534
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,351
at my engagement party of all places,

535
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,618
then you crawled back right before me.

536
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,393
If you came here to try to get me back

537
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,185
because you aren't over me, forget it.

538
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:14,894
I'll never go back to be with you.

539
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,643
Stop humiliating my husband.

540
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:17,852
He's not yours any more.

541
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,476
You're the one who will be humiliated!

542
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,326
Everyone in Hera Palace

543
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,976
knows that your husband and I were

544
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,185
once married.

545
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:29,435
Everyone also knows you and Chairman Joo

546
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,451
started off with an affair.

547
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,742
But you live a good life without caring.

548
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,602
Why do you seem so anxious?

549
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,200
I feel for you.

550
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,518
Let's be happy

551
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,976
with our respective families.

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,451
You live your life, and I'll live mine.

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,143
Will you please leave now?

554
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,560
We have to hurry

555
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,200
to move everything in before lunch.

556
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,783
Is this yours?

557
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,117
Hold onto it. You might end up losing it.

558
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,034
Yoon Hee completely won that round.

559
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,700
Oh Yoon Hee.

560
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,935
Why did you come back?

561
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,852
What have you been up to?

562
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,399
Why are you back?

563
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:13,026
"Cheonga Medical Centre"

564
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:15,973
Open your mouth, then make a sound.

565
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:19,810
Okay, good.

566
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:23,409
This time, make five short sounds.

567
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,909
All right, good.

568
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:34,476
Recently, my high notes

569
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,992
have been sounding rather raspy.

570
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,783
And I can feel something in my throat.

571
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,659
It's not a big deal, is it?

572
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:46,117
You need to cancel your concerts now.

573
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,226
What?

574
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,700
Your vocal cord nodules look serious.

575
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,992
I can also see a malignant-looking lump.

576
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,935
If it becomes worse,

577
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,284
you may need surgery.

578
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,075
Surgery? Why should I...

579
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,810
Never.

580
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:07,894
If you leave it like this,

581
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:10,894
you may never get your old voice back.

582
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,810
You need to cancel the upcoming concert,

583
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,602
and make sure you take an absolute rest.

584
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,659
I cannot cancel this concert.

585
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:18,018
I've paid the venue rental fees in full,

586
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,976
and the orchestra is already in Korea.

587
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,783
It's impossible to call this off.

588
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,976
I have to be on the stage.

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,909
Then you may never get to sing again.

590
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,034
Is that all right with you?

591
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,950
Today, I brought twice the usual amount.

592
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,852
Can you finish everything?

593
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,143
Of course.

594
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,159
I'm starving today.

595
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,867
Hey, Je Ni.

596
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,894
Make me feel as if I'm eating the food

597
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,602
so I can imagine the taste.

598
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,659
Make it look more real.

599
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:00,226
You have a knack for making everything

600
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,476
look so unappetising.

601
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,476
Do you not hear me?

602
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,242
Open wide!

603
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:09,894
My gosh, that looks so greasy.

604
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:11,909
She's consuming so much trans-fat.

605
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,268
Gosh! That's disgusting.

606
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,852
Hey, seriously.

607
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,310
I bet you did that on purpose.

608
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:30,310
I guess she's not feeling well.

609
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,200
Don't be so harsh on her.

610
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,643
As promised, I'll think that you won't be

611
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,659
coming to my mum's concert.

612
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,101
Why can't I go?

613
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,101
I did everything you told me to do,

614
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,034
and I even ate everything!

615
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,018
I promised my mum that I'll go with her.

616
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,909
Allow me to be there, Eun Byeol.

617
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:50,852
Since when were we friends?

618
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,825
You have another friend.

619
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:55,534
Do you still talk to her?

620
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,492
No, we've never talked since that day.

621
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,618
It's true. Please believe me.

622
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,727
Come up with an excuse

623
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:03,768
so you can tell your mum

624
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,534
that you can't go.

625
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,242
Let's go.

626
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,166
"JKING Holdings"

627
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:17,642
Sir, someone's here to see you.

628
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,914
"JKING Holdings"

629
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:20,435
What did you say

630
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,101
just now?

631
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,518
I'd like to join Hera Club again.

632
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:25,643
You've got quite brazen

633
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,534
since I last saw you.

634
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
Your move-in hasn't been confirmed yet,

635
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,409
and you're asking to join Hera Club?

636
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,602
For the kids' sake,

637
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,518
don't you think it's a bad idea

638
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,268
for a divorced couple to live

639
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,950
in the same building?

640
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,825
That's exactly

641
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,268
what Seo Jin said.

642
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:45,825
Did the two of you

643
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,393
meet up?

644
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,768
I worked very hard to succeed in the US.

645
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,700
And now that I'm back in Korea,

646
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,059
I'd obviously like to move into

647
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,101
the most valuable building in Korea.

648
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,950
Isn't that only natural?

649
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,685
The committee will not allow you

650
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,560
to move into Hera Palace.

651
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:03,268
Moving out is easy,

652
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,810
but moving back in surely isn't.

653
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,643
That is

654
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,367
Hera Palace for you.

655
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,700
You don't want me around Seo Jin?

656
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,075
Why not?

657
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,700
Because you're only engaged now?

658
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,727
Is that why you're worried?

659
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,326
Or,

660
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,075
is there another reason?

661
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:31,992
My gosh, Ha Yoon Chul has changed.

662
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,059
You can't think straight

663
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,075
now that you've experienced being rich.

664
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:38,659
People are bound to change.

665
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,760
"JohnBIO's Promise to You"

666
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:55,200
Oh, I forgot to give you my business card.

667
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,727
Next time,

668
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,518
just call me "Mr. Ha".

669
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,310
Don't speak casually to me

670
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:04,268
as if we're close or something.

671
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:05,992
"Mr. Ha"?

672
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,976
Mr. Ha...

673
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,742
If that's what you want,

674
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,476
I will call you

675
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,242
"Mr. Ha" from now on.

676
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:18,185
If you want to

677
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:20,975
move into Hera Palace that badly,

678
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,727
make a donation.

679
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,576
What's a good amount?

680
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:26,576
Five billion won?

681
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,435
10 billion?

682
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,852
If you're willing to donate that much,

683
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,576
I'll consider it.

00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,937
"Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin"

685
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,767
"Soprano Cheon Seo Jin"

688
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,016
"are severely damaged"

689
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,700
Those rats!

690
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,518
They wrote about this already?

691
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,695
"Cheonga Foundation"

692
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:21,802

693
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:01,518
No.

694
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,810
It's too risky.

695
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,700
Just do as I say.

696
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,894
It's not impossible.

697
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,651
It's just that the public never found out.

698
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:11,026
Still...

699
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,693
It can't be someone who's made a debut.

700
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:14,610
Find an amateur.

701
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,443
She can't be too young or too old.

702
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:18,318
She must be around my age.

703
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,610
We don't have time.

704
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,334
We only have a week.

705
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:24,292
This concert has to be perfect,

706
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:29,000
no matter what.

"Dan Tae"

708
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:44,626
What's up? I'm about to leave.

709
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,109
Now?

710
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,818
I'm telling you.

711
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:52,860
- Yes, for real.
- Seriously?

712
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,542
Oh!

713
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:56,902
Sorry I'm a little late.

714
00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:58,485
We just got here ourselves.

715
00:35:58,509 --> 00:36:00,360
The traffic's terrible, isn't it?

716
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,985
Sometimes, even the elevator

717
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,750
takes forever.

718
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:08,860
As for Unit 4502, can we decide

719
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:11,235
as the committee to not let them move in?

720
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:14,735
My gosh, you must not have heard.

721
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:16,318
It's already been decided.

722
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,318
What do you mean?

723
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,818
JohnBIO...

724
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,026
I mean, your ex-husband

725
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,818
donated five billion won to Hera Palace.

726
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:27,485
So there's no need for us to vote.

727
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:28,526
Chairman Joo,

728
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,276
why did you make such a silly provision?

729
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,360
Based on the rules regarding donations,

730
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,959
they've automatically been approved.

731
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:38,026
What happened?

732
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,443
You didn't tell me anything.

733
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:42,709
My gosh, hello!

734
00:36:42,926 --> 00:36:44,151
Welcome.

735
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,777
Everyone's here.

736
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:48,735
It's an honour to be invited to Hera Club.

737
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,652
Come and sit.

738
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:50,985
Take a seat.

739
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,068
Sit here.

740
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:53,026
Come join us.

741
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,318
We already know each other,

742
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,568
so no need for introductions.

743
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:58,360
We're happy to move into Hera Palace.

744
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,735
Oh boy.

745
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,626
Hey, you're here too.

746
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:03,193
Thanks for the warm welcome.

747
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:04,875
Yoon Hee!

748
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:07,151
You look great.

749
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:09,652
Oh my. Guess what?

750
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:11,417
I'm an assemblyman now!

751
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:12,652
I know!

752
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:14,318
You've gone so high up

753
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:15,568
since I last saw you.

754
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,526
And you're looking great yourself.

755
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,109
Sang A, I hope

756
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,485
I'll be seeing a lot of you as well.

757
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:23,193
Welcome back!

758
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:25,109
Come over for dinner this weekend.

759
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,401
Sounds good?

760
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,485
I'll bring some fruit and dessert.

761
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,944
Yoon Hee, what do you like?

762
00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:33,401
You know, actually.

763
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:34,902
Mr. Ha, you and your wife

764
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,750
should re-join Hera Club.

765
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:39,026
Residents of the same constituency

766
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,777
should be close.

767
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,235
Totally!

768
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,443
We've been too distant

769
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,068
ever since we lost Soo Ryeon.

770
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:46,568
Since we're all here now,

771
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,318
why don't we vote on it?

772
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:49,443
I'm all for it!

773
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,151
Me too, of course!

774
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:53,610
What are you doing? Hera Club?

775
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,068
Have you all lost your minds?

776
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,151
Since when were we friendly

777
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,526
with Oh Yoon Hee?

778
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,209
Don't you all know who she is?

779
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,442
"JohnBIO"

780
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,084
What?

781
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:15,944
You'll give us JohnBIO's unlisted stock?

782
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:16,860
That's right.

783
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,526
To us? Do you really mean it?

784
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,526
I was dividing them up

785
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,693
with my loyal employees

786
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,860
and thought of you guys.

787
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,610
We used to be like family, you know?

788
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:28,235
Male vitality supplements will always be

789
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:30,276
a steady seller as long as humans exist.

790
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,000
Yes! We're interested, of course.

791
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:35,860
Then can you do me a favour?

792
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:37,985
Of course! You got it.

793
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:40,000
Tell us anything you want.

794
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:46,959
I don't know what they're giving you,

795
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,568
but I'm against this.

796
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,777
Hera Club has a reputation to protect.

797
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,276
How could a woman like Yoon Hee...

798
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,750
Watch how you speak about my woman.

799
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:56,443
Everyone knows that she's a murderer.

800
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,693
Did you see her

801
00:38:57,717 --> 00:38:59,501
committing the murder?

802
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:03,068
Don't you all owe her an apology?

803
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,193
You accused an innocent woman

804
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,109
of murder and just let her suffer.

805
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,818
But she didn't even resent you.

806
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:10,042
She was understanding and patient.

807
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:12,318
Do you know

808
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:14,626
how heartbroken I was to see that?

809
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:18,125
Jeez, I'm almost moved to tears.

810
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,151
Since we're both starting afresh,

811
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:22,818
let's not bring up the past

812
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,501
and hurt each other.

813
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:27,042
I don't care what you say to me,

814
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,750
but I won't let you hurt Yoon Hee.

815
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,026
That's enough. I'm fine.

816
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,026
You're making me uncomfortable, honey.

817
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,902
Why are you uncomfortable, honey?

818
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:37,750
You can be confident.

819
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,459
Ms. Yang killed Soo Ryeon after all.

820
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:42,833
Doesn't Chairman Joo also acknowledge it?

821
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:49,750
Fine.

822
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,376
I'll leave Hera Club, then.

823
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,026
Problem solved, right?

824
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,818
No, why should you leave?

825
00:39:55,842 --> 00:39:57,417
Let go of me!

826
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,485
Wait, Ms. Cheon.

827
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:04,626
Ms. Cheon, Ms. Cheon?

828
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,068
Chairman Joo.

829
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:15,360
My gosh, Mr. Ha.

830
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:17,735
You're such an eloquent speaker.

831
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:18,818
You sound like a spokesperson.

832
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:21,818
My gosh, I was so moved.

833
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:25,568
Dr. Ha, I didn't know you were so manly.

834
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:28,250
You seem completely different!

835
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,026
Why are you so upset?

836
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,151
You know that this won't solve anything.

837
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:36,985
How can I not be upset?

838
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:38,944
Didn't you hear what Yoon Chul said?

839
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:41,318
Since when was he such a loving husband?

840
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:43,709
What? "My wife"?

841
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,334
What is this about?

842
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:46,818
Are you upset because your loser husband

843
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:48,777
has become successful?

844
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:49,860
Or are you bothered by

845
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:52,125
your enemy Yoon Hee's grand comeback?

846
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:53,526
Or is it both?

847
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,137
You disgraced me

848
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,485
with your actions just now.

849
00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:01,151
"She still has feelings for Ha Yoon Chul.

850
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:03,026
She regrets getting engaged to Joo Dan Tae

851
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,735
and Oh Yoon Hee still gets on her nerves."

852
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:06,068
Those big mouths

853
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:07,902
will gossip about it every day.

854
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,276
Are you happy that you humiliated me?

855
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,318
What are you talking about?

856
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:13,276
Why would I regret it?

857
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,917
I lost all interest in Yoon Chul long ago.

858
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:18,693
We've been fighting non-stop

859
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,193
ever since we got engaged.

860
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:22,068
Who'd get the most kick out of this?

861
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,235
Yoon Hee is more dangerous than Yoon Chul.

862
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:25,193
We must find out

863
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,125
why she returned to Hera Palace.

864
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,750
It's probably because of us.

865
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:31,151
There's one rule

866
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:33,501
that I always stick to in business.

867
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,568
The more dangerous they are,

868
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,235
the closer I keep them

869
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,542
so I can see what they're after.

870
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:41,026
All Yoon Chul has is his wealth.

871
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,735
I don't know how he became so successful,

872
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:44,875
but he can't sustain it for long.

873
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,485
He offered a donation, so I accepted it.

874
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:49,709
We'll just use him to our benefit.

875
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,360
If you get all feisty and attack him,

876
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,542
you'll only show them you're anxious.

877
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:58,959
I'm sorry.

878
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:02,750
I've been on edge because of the concert.

879
00:42:06,926 --> 00:42:08,626
Look at yourself.

880
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:11,777
Oh Yoon Hee is no match for you

881
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,485
because you're so amazing.

882
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:15,068
She has already hit rock bottom.

883
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:16,360
So,

884
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:17,568
keep your dignity and elegance

885
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,833
as you deal with her, okay?

886
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,026
I don't know

887
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,000
what I'm so afraid of.

888
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,167
Since Oh Yoon Hee came back,

889
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,167
everything's been a mess.

890
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,026
My goodness.

891
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,068
Gosh!

892
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:41,026
Why did you drink so much?

893
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,068
Oh boy.

894
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,334
- Gosh!
- You drank way over your limit.

895
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:46,860
Gosh, I'll break my back while carrying

896
00:42:46,884 --> 00:42:48,276
someone else's husband!

897
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,693
- Honey, here.
- My goodness.

898
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:51,693
Oh, dear.

899
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:53,026
I'm exhausted.

900
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,068
Why is he so heavy?

901
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:56,568
Is he made of stone?

902
00:42:56,592 --> 00:42:58,209
Gosh, my back.

903
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,276
Hold on.

904
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,777
I'll get you something to drink.

905
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:04,026
What would you like?

906
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,151
Anything's fine.

907
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:07,125
Ouch, my back...

908
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:08,833
Honey.

909
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:13,068
Dr. Ha gave me something amazing.

910
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:15,568
- I see.
- His latest product.

911
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,026
It's supposed to work wonders.

912
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,917
You'd better be prepared.

913
00:43:19,092 --> 00:43:22,042
Thank you so much.

914
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,526
What are you talking about?

915
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,459
Your honey is over there--

916
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,068
Are you okay with orange juice?

917
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:34,485
What? Yes, orange juice sounds perfect.

918
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:37,360
If possible, with lots of naked...

919
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:38,276
I mean, crushed ice.

920
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,068
Okay, give me a second.

921
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:43,875
Your orange slush is coming right up!

922
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,068
It's done!

923
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:00,976
Goodness.

924
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,658
My gosh, he's taking off his clothes.

925
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,076
My gosh, honey!

926
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,468
He'll catch a cold.

927
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,880
Honey, what are you doing?

928
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:13,151
This is so embarrassing.

929
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:14,485
Je Ni must be waiting.

930
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,736
I should go home.

931
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:16,975
- Wait!
- Oh, it's this way.

932
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,320
Drink this before you go!

933
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:19,878
Keep it for later.

934
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,275
Gosh, what's with her?

935
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:26,301
You must be tired.

936
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:28,400
Moving is exhausting.

937
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:30,176
Do you like the place?

938
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,234
Yes, I do.

939
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:33,900
Thank you so much.

940
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,760
As we had planned,

941
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:40,776
we managed to get into Hera Club.

942
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,768
With our wedding photos on the wall,

943
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,950
it feels like we're actually married.

944
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:49,685
I couldn't have returned alone.

945
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:51,992
I could come back thanks to you.

946
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:54,476
Cheon Seo Jin and Joo Dan Tae

947
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,160
will do whatever it takes to kick us out.

948
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:00,018
Had I been afraid of that,

949
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:02,597
I wouldn't even have returned.

950
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:06,018
Don't worry.

951
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,935
They can't mess with you again.

952
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:09,826
I'll protect you.

953
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,185
As you know,

954
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,893
I'm your business partner

955
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,576
and husband.

956
00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:19,175
Cut it out.

957
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:22,327
Don't you betray me again.

958
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:24,563
If you do,

959
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,950
you're dead meat.

960
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,033
Never.

961
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:34,966
Oh, what about Ro Na? Not yet?

962
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:37,185
No.

963
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,701
I'm sure

964
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:44,207
I can see her again someday,

965
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,950
when I

966
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,284
deserve to see her.

to my singing all their lives.

They'd notice even the littlest change

983

with the way I breathe.

984

These are not good enough to fool them.

985
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,518
The broker recommended about 10 singers,

986

987

before it's too late?

989
00:46:44,876 --> 00:46:46,576
I can't do that.

990
00:46:46,935 --> 00:46:49,601
Some people are waiting to see me crumble.

991
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:51,843
Should I turn myself into their prey?

992
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:53,427
They'll be thrilled.

993
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:55,842
They'll laugh and gossip.

who sounded so much like you,

but she suddenly informed us

1001

that she couldn't take the job,

1002
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:12,629
so I didn't include her.

1003
00:47:13,685 --> 00:47:15,536
She turned down a teaching position

1004

She's in her late 30s.

00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,325
to bring her to me.

1019
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,117
Contact her now.

1020
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:27,685
Welcome.

1021
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,450
It's nice to meet you.

1022
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,534
Don't turn around.

1023
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:35,701
What's your name?

1024
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,117
I'm Park Young Ran.

1025
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,202
I'm a huge fan of yours.

1026
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:43,511
It's a huge honour to meet you in person.

1027
00:48:44,502 --> 00:48:47,077
I enjoyed listening to your demo.

1028
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,560
You have such a wonderful voice.

1029
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:52,685
I still have a lot to learn,

1030
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,436
but hearing such a huge compliment

1031
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:56,102
from my role model...

1032
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:58,102
I'm truly flattered.

1033
00:48:58,126 --> 00:49:00,742
Why did you turn down the position

1034
00:49:01,168 --> 00:49:02,643
at Cheonga Arts High School?

1035
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,309
Oh, that...

1036
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,435
My father recently had surgery

1037
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:09,601
and is not doing so well.

1038
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,351
Because of that, I don't think

1039
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:13,393
I can work in Seoul.

1040
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,560
He needs me by his side now.

1041
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,226
If that was the reason,

1042
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,742
I can certainly help you.

1043
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:23,325
I can have the best doctors

1044
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,685
at Cheonga Medical Centre

1045
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:28,075
treat your father.

1046
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:29,909
And of course,

1047
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:31,685
he'll also have caregivers

1048
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:33,518
looking after him 24/7,

1049
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:36,409
so you won't have much to do.

1050
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,784
Pardon?

1051
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,284
On the condition that

1052
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,909
you'll do me a little favour.

1053
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,935
Now, we're going to talk about

1054
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:48,935
something very important.

1055
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:52,367
But this must stay between us.

1056
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:55,492
Can you promise me?

1057
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:59,492
This will be

1058
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,768
the most important opportunity

1059
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,325
in your life.

1060
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:07,159
Yes, you have my word.

1061
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:09,950
I won't tell anyone.

1062
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:16,935
First,

1063
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,617
sign this non-disclosure agreement.

1064
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,060
The opening song will be

1065
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:24,409
"Una Voce Poco Fa".

1066
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:28,200
I want you to completely master the song

1067
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,659
and send over a demo.

1068
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,559
The most important thing is that

1069
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:35,518
we have to be in perfect sync.

1070
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,185
"Demo of 'Una Voce Poco Fa'"

1071
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:39,205
"By Park Young Ran"

1072
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,435
No mistakes are allowed.

1073
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:55,060
You must sing

1074
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:58,200
exactly like you practised.

1075
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,242
Don't forget that.

1076
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:19,450
Seo Jin.

1077
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:24,768
Your 20th-anniversary concert is tomorrow.

1078
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:26,185
Congratulations.

1079
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,476
Yes.

1080
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,852
Thanks,

1081
00:51:28,876 --> 00:51:30,701
whether you mean it or not.

1082
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:35,560
- Honey, you must be hungry.
- Yes.

1083
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:37,576
I'll make you something nice.

1084
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:40,367
- Put it down. It's heavy.
- Okay.

1085
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:43,518
Oh, I made cheonggukjang, your favourite.

1086
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:44,810
- Really?
- Yes.

1087
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,226
My gosh, you're the best.

1088
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,701
I'm happy that you like my cooking.

1089
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,033
My gosh, what did I do to deserve you?

1090
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:06,492
What do you think? Very natural, right?

1091
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,784
You're so dead.

1092
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,393
Who said you could do stuff like that?

1093
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:16,617
Well, I just couldn't help it.

1094
00:52:54,459 --> 00:52:55,810
I've rehearsed too much

1095
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:57,226
because it's an important concert.

1096
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,226
Why don't we call it a day?

1097
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,852
What? You always treat your rehearsals

1098
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:02,185
like the real thing.

1099
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:03,643
Are you sure you'll be okay?

1100
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,435
Come on, I've done it many times.

1101
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:07,226
I'll just rest a little in the green room.

1102
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,518
I'll check the stage and go.

1103
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,701
I'm counting on you today.

1104
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,009
While you're singing on stage,

1105
00:53:34,034 --> 00:53:35,094
Park Young Ran

1106
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:37,052
will be singing in this secret room.

1107
00:53:37,076 --> 00:53:38,052
"Concert Stage"

1108
00:53:38,076 --> 00:53:39,734
"Park Young Ran"

1109
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,052
I just need this concert to go well.

1110
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:44,426
Once my vocal fold nodules go away,

1111
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,802
I can sing like I used to.

1112
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:47,135
Then,

1113
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:48,942
all will be fine.

1114
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:11,465
"La Prima Donna, 20th Anniversary"

1115
00:54:14,936 --> 00:54:16,553
"Staff"

1116
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:25,956
"La Prima Donna, 20th Anniversary"

1117
00:54:26,378 --> 00:54:28,307
"Staff"

1118
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:47,848
"Soprano Cheon Seo Jin"

1119
00:54:47,873 --> 00:54:49,905
"20th Anniversary Concert"

1120
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:55,424
"La Prima Donna, 20th Anniversary"

1121
00:55:00,951 --> 00:55:03,176
We should've got a bigger one.

1122
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,258
This is big enough.

1123
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:06,032
- You think so?
- Yes.

1124
00:55:06,057 --> 00:55:08,986
I think we should've bought a bigger one.

1125
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:34,734
Suction.

1126
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,078
Again.

1127
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:44,762
Make some noise.

1128
00:57:48,476 --> 00:57:50,092
Again.

1129
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:56,342
Again! Try a loud noise.

1130
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:07,610
Is there some kind of problem?

1131
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:09,501
I think it's too hard.

1132
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:10,568
At this point,

1133
00:58:10,592 --> 00:58:12,792
the vocal cords aren't moving.

1134
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,542
She wants to try one more time.

1135
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:30,668
We're going to try again.

1136
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,750
Make some noise.

1137
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:38,552
Again.

1138
00:59:36,629 --> 00:59:38,829
- Brava!
- Brava!

1139
00:59:39,092 --> 00:59:40,750
Brava!

1140
00:59:46,562 --> 00:59:48,928
Brava!

1141
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:52,542
Brava!

1142
00:59:54,904 --> 00:59:56,588
I can't believe this.

1143
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,896
That was a perfect high F.

1144
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:21,026
Seo Jin, that was incredible.

1145
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,026
I got chills.

1146
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,026
Why didn't you tell me

1147
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,568
you were raising the finale?

1148
01:00:24,592 --> 01:00:27,709
You've certainly surpassed your prime!

1149
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,895
What happened there?

1150
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,020
You never said you'd raise it to a high F.

1151
01:00:44,045 --> 01:00:45,652
It's hard enough to hit such a high note.

1152
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:46,652
It's nearly impossible

1153
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,109
to hold it for that long.

1154
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:49,109
Did you intentionally hide

1155
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:50,792
what you could really do?

1156
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:53,661
There must be a reason

1157
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:55,886
why you tried to fool my ears.

1158
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:01,161
Hey.

1159
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:04,084
Who are you, really?

1160
01:01:10,986 --> 01:01:12,645
Who are you?

1161
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:21,900
How...

1162
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:25,446
How could you...

1163
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,071
Finally,

1164
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:29,796
I get to say hi.

1165
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,063
Let's try to get along, Seo Jin.

1166
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:05,317
=Penthouse 2=

1167
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:06,360
Oh Yoon Hee!

1168
01:02:06,384 --> 01:02:07,568
This is just the beginning.

1169
01:02:07,592 --> 01:02:08,485
I sure won't let you down.

1170
01:02:08,509 --> 01:02:10,608
Find something to threaten her with!

1171
01:02:10,633 --> 01:02:12,854
The greatest voice and Yoon Chul...

1172
01:02:12,879 --> 01:02:14,318
They were both mine, you know.

1173
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:16,358
It feels real that I'm back in Hera Club.

1174
01:02:16,383 --> 01:02:18,394
How dare you come to our school?

1175
01:02:18,419 --> 01:02:21,437
Your daughter is included in my plan.

1176
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:23,234
Have someone tail Seo Jin.

1177
01:02:23,259 --> 01:02:24,526
I'm getting nervous too.

1178
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:27,709
Oh Yoon Hee, I will kill you.
