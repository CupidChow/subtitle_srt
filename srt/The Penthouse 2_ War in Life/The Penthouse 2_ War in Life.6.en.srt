Ro Na, please stay with me.

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,985
I'm so sorry.

177

Did you find anything?

183

Too many people poured out at once,

184
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,426
so it's impossible to detect

I heard it's a murder case.

How long will you hold us here?

190
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:47,901
Do you think we have that much time?

191
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:49,859
Would you say that if it's your daughter?

192
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,652
Some might think you're her birth father.

193
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:53,859
What are you so worried about that

194
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,694
you want to run before you're questioned?

195
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:56,652
You did something, didn't you?

196
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,485
- What did you say?
- Come on.

197
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,652
- What's wrong?
- Seriously.

202
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,151
an assemblyman in office?

all very famous and highly reputable.

She's between life and death right now.

I'll catch the culprit myself.

No matter who did this,

215
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,606
I'll hunt down the culprit

So you all had better cooperate.

00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,610
I only went to the toilet once.

You can check with everyone else.

225
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,527
I was sitting in the same row

226
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,901
as my husband all along.

227
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:09,235
Chairman Joo, were you the first

228
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,527
that was on the scene?

229
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,985
Is it a problem that I'm a fast runner?

230
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,360
And to be exact,

231
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:16,110
the one who found her first was

232
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:17,917
the school janitor.

233
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:20,402
I just ran after I heard Mr. Park scream.

234
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,776
We all saw each other in the concert hall,

235
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,818
isn't that so?

236
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:25,776
- Yes.
- Yes, you're right.

237
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,694
And we had coffee together

238
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,151
while they were judging, right?

239
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,694
- Yes.
- I stuck around to the end.

240
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:31,334
Je Ni didn't see

241
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,859
Eun Byeol in the green room.

242
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,376
Shouldn't you begin there?

243
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,126
Come to think about it,

244
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,625
why haven't I seen her?

245
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,126
I didn't see her in the schoolyard either.

246
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,276
She wasn't feeling well,

247
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,167
so she went home early.

248
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:49,776
She went home?

249
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,110
She went home before the announcement

250
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,026
of the grand prize?

251
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,026
She wouldn't do that.

252
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,459
She was one of the strong competitors.

253
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:57,610
Even if she ended up passing out,

254
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:59,068
she wouldn't have gone home.

255
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:00,735
Did she take

256
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,625
those drugs again?

257
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,151
You all know, right?

258
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:05,652
She relies on calming pills

259
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,276
before any performance.

260
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,126
She got too nervous and didn't feel well.

261
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,652
Wait.

262
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,151
Are you suspicious of her?

263
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,193
No one is an exception,

264
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,917
including you and Eun Byeol.

265
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,026
Don't worry.

266
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,485
I'll have her questioned straightaway

267
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,792
after I check on her at home.

268
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:29,251
And I mean your daughter,

269
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,251
Eun Byeol.

270
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,084

271
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,151

00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,917

"Police Line: Under Investigation"

274
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:43,859
This looks like the weapon,

275
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,985
the wing of the trophy.

276
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,360
The trophy?

277
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,694
She was hit twice with the trophy

278
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,235
on her shoulder and head.

279
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,443
And there was severe bleeding

280
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,818
from the wound on her head.

281
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,694
What about the rest of the trophy?

282
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,193
We couldn't find it at the scene.

283
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,776
We'll focus our investigation

284
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,776
on finding the missing weapon.

285
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,959
The school needs to be closed for a while.

286
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:07,193
I'll take measures to help

287
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:09,652
as much as I can as the chief director.

288
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,110
Is there anyone affiliated with the school

289
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,985
who held a grudge against the victim?

290
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:16,859
Someone set off the fire alarm

291
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,735
to remove the evidence.

292
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,818
They must be familiar with the school.

293
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:24,084
Is there anyone that comes to your mind?

294
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,026
What do you think of

295
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,776
the great Cheonga Arts High School?

296
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,402
Are you saying we tampered with the case?

297
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:34,418
Well, that's not what I meant.

298
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,735
Please cooperate with the investigation.

299
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,334
Of course.

300
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,402
Why are you so sensitive?

301
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:46,318
Then why are you doing this?

302
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:47,568
Are you a detective?

Fine, find the culprit for Ro Na.

305
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:55,376

Who did this to you?

Ro Na.

325

This is yours.

You won the grand prize, Ro Na.

so we can celebrate, okay?

329
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:09,192
Hang in there, okay?

330
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:11,959
Hold on. Hang in there.

331
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,792
That trophy is for Seol A.

332
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:18,625
Give her that trophy.

333

I'm sorry

334

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,781
Ro Na, no!

344
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:46,120
Ro Na, I'm right here.

345
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:48,161
- Please, don't go, Ro Na.
- Please move.

346
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:50,454
Ro Na, I'm right here. Please, Ro Na.

347
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:51,735
Ro Na, don't die!

348
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,318
Please just stay alive.

349
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,151
I won't ask for anything else.

350
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,193
Please, no.

351
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:58,026
- Ro Na, don't leave me.
- She's in arrest.

352
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,251
Ro Na, no, please. Don't leave me.

353
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,527
- Ro Na, no!
- Bring a defibrillator!

354
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,039
- Yes, Doctor.
- Yoon Hee.

355
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:06,678
- Yoon Hee!
- No!

356
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:08,279
The defibrillator!

357
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:11,485
No, Ro Na! Ro Na, don't leave me!

358
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,229
Don't leave me alone!

359
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,734
Please come back. I'm so sorry.

360
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,619
Charge to 200 joules.

361
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:17,776
Please, Ro Na!

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,485
Don't leave me. No!

363
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,068
Please don't go, Ro Na!

364
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:23,042
Please don't leave me.

365
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,583
Why aren't you asleep?

366
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:52,875
I have a question.

367
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,709
Ro Na.

368
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,834
Did you do that to her?

369
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,485
What are you talking about?

370
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,821
Why would I do something like that?

371
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,792
Stop lying.

372
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,792
This has something to do with you.

373
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,110
You always kept your poise

374
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:13,527
when Seol A and Mum died.

375
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:16,418
But I know.

376
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,000
I know you killed...

377
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,583
both Mum and Min Seol A.

378
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:27,068
Why did you

379
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,568
kill my mum? Why?

380
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,943
To marry a woman like that?

381
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:34,459
Or what? Because she gave birth to Seol A?

382
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,110
If you did

383
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,834
something to harm Ro Na--

384
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,318
I never imagined my son would be caught up

385
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,776
with such wild imagination.

386
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,443
How dare you say this nonsense to me?

387
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,625
Don't hurt Seok Hoon!

388
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,402
Seok Hoon and I aren't your belongings.

389
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,110
There's no reason for us to get beaten.

390
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:55,834
I'm glad you're here.

391
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,500
I had a question for you.

392
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:02,959
Do you know

393
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,443
whose necklace this is?

394
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:06,126
Eun Byeol.

395
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,542
She was wearing it during her performance.

396
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,459
Why do you have that?

397
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:17,209
I found it in the concert hall.

398
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:19,875
Go back to your rooms.

399
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,735
Don't touch that.

400
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,917
It could be used as evidence.

401
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,068
- Mr. Assemblyman.
- If you know who I am,

402
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:45,110
you should get your act straight!

403
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:47,026
Do you know how much it costs

404
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,625
to get a bunch of spinach?

405
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,000
So this necklace belongs to Eun Byeol?

406
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:04,943
What's going on?

407
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:07,126
I remember putting it in here.

408
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:10,042
Where did I drop that thing?

409
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,709
You're back.

410
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,542
It's pretty late.

411
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,834
Something came up.

412
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,750
Did Eun Byeol eat dinner?

413
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,235
She didn't.

414
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,443
She washed up and fell asleep right away.

415
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:31,084
She must've been too tired to eat.

416
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,402
It's late. You should get to bed too.

417
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:35,042
But

418
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,959
I couldn't find her dress.

419
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,026
She came back wearing it,

420
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,360
but it's not in her closet.

421
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:44,334
I'm sure she left it somewhere.

422
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:47,209
Is that so important this late at night?

423
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,459
I understand. Please get some rest.

424
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,500
Could it be...

425
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,209
No, it can't be.

426
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,000
Eun Byeol...

427
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,334
can't be the culprit. Never.

428
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,339
"Mr. Do"

429
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:19,959
Mr. Do.

430
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:21,959
What happened to Ro Na?

431
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:25,500
What?

432
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,917
There's no chance

433
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,042
she'll wake up?

434
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,126
Was it...

435
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,500
really you?

436
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,126
What are you talking about?

437
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:42,901
I got mad I couldn't win the grand prize,

438
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,568
so I wanted to throw it out.

439
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:45,776
Then how do you explain this?

440
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,542
The blood on your dress!

441
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:52,625
Tell me every single detail.

442
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:55,418
What did you do to Ro Na?

443
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:57,818
Did Ro Na

444
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:00,667
really die?

445
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,985
No, right?

446
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,776
She couldn't have died.

447
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,000
She's a tenacious kid.

448
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,527
No.

449
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:09,443
No, no.

450
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,459
Pull yourself together and answer me!

451
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:14,167
Did you do that?

452
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:17,126
You have to tell me, Ha Eun Byeol!

453
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,834
She

454
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:22,500
keeps taking my things.

455
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,360
She kept lurking around me

456
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:26,209
speaking ill of you.

457
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,292
She said you slashed her mum's neck.

458
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:31,985
She said

459
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,459
you lost to her mum.

460
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:38,943
But I really didn't mean to kill her.

461
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:41,542
I mean it. Please believe me.

462
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,151
It's all right. Pull yourself together.

463
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:48,875
Pull yourself together, Eun Byeol.

464
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:50,709
Calm down.

465
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,459
Everything is over.

466
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,167
I'm a criminal.

467
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:06,000
The police will soon come for me.

468
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,318
No.

469
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:11,985
I'll just head over to the police station

470
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,193
and tell them everything.

471
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:14,917
I'll tell them that I did it.

472
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,235
Forget university and singing now.

473
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,901
Everything is over.

474
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,026
No!

475
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,985
Your life won't go wrong.

476
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,068
I won't let that happen.

477
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,959
I'll protect you.

478
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:29,818
I don't care if Ro Na is dead or alive.

479
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,485
That's not what's important.

480
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,334
You just need to stay clear of that case.

481
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,318
If someone asks you,

482
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:38,026
tell them you don't know anything.

483
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,318
Do you understand?

484
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:42,402
What if someone saw me?

485
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:46,000
There are CCTVs at school too.

486
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,959
I'll take care of that,

487
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,750
so you don't have to worry.

488
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:58,193
I'll get rid of this dress.

489
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,750
Then it'll be fine.

490
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,709
There won't be any evidence.

491
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,959
The trophy.

492
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,485
The trophy?

493
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:09,652
Your trophy

494
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:12,376
from Cheonga Arts Festival.

495
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:15,500
Where did you put that?

496
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:19,251
In my locker at school.

497
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,376
What?

498
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,068
Please stay away.

499
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:05,901
Another unfortunate incident broke out

500
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:08,859
yesterday at Cheonga Arts High School.

501
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,193
Cheonga Arts Festival is

502
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,610
the most prestigious event

503
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:12,859
with a long tradition in the school.

504
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:15,151
A senior student who won the grand prize

505
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:17,527
fell unconscious before she got a chance

506
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,776
to hold the trophy in her hands.

507
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,776
The police believe she was most likely

508
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,235
attacked by someone with a grudge.

509
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,151
They plan on narrowing down the suspects

510
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,443
on the list of people who were at school.

511
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,527
Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin

512
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,694
of Cheonga Foundation announced

513
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:33,318
all of their classes will be held online,

514
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:34,610
and that she will

515
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:37,000
actively cooperate with the investigation.

516
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:52,126
The damage to her brain is severe.

517
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,418
I don't think she'll make it.

518
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,292
You should get ready to face the worst.

519
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,667
Yoon Hee.

520
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,985
Yoon Hee, this isn't good.

521
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:15,151
I'll get you a hospital room.

522
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,610
Go lie down for a little.

523
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:18,167
No.

524
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,084
I need to find the one who did this.

525
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:25,459
What did the police say?

526
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,151
They haven't found any evidence yet?

527
00:29:28,175 --> 00:29:29,776
They're under investigation,

528
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,818
but not yet.

529
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:33,776
The culprit was there at school.

530
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,000
How could there be no evidence?

531
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:40,360
It's also weird how the fire alarm

532
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:42,126
went off without any fire.

533
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:45,750
I don't trust the police any more.

534
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,485
I need to head over there myself.

535
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:51,610
You're not well enough to do anything.

536
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:52,985
Let's trust them and wait.

537
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,068
I asked a friend of mine

538
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,485
to ask the police for help.

539
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:57,110
They'll call when they find the evidence.

540
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:59,792
I can't trust anyone!

541
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,694
I'll catch them with my own hands.

542
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,402
Do you think I'll let this one live

543
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,459
after they hurt my daughter?

544
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,583
Yoon Chul.

545
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:17,443
What if the worst happens to her?

546
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,568
What if something bad happens to her?

547
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:21,151
I'm about to go crazy.

548
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:23,042
What am I going to do?

549
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:25,917
No, this can't be real.

550
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:28,859
Please let Ro Na live.

551
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:31,292
Please let her live.

552
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,776
Yoon Hee. Yoon Hee.

553
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,776
Yoon Hee. Yoon Hee. Yoon Hee!

554
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,527
What are you doing? Get Dr. Jung!

555
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:43,917
- Yoon Chul.
- Bring an Ambu bag!

556
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,834
Soo Ryeon.

557
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:00,115
Please don't take Ro Na from me.

558
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,360
Just kill me

559
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:04,251
and let Ro Na live. Please.

560
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:06,209
Please.

561
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:41,368
"Sleep Inducer"

562
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:22,292
Clear your mind and sleep well.

563
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,376
Have you seen my phone?

564
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:30,276
I discarded it just in case.

565
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,500
I'll get you a new one.

566
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,360
Stay out of touch with your friends

567
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,209
for a while.

568
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,500
Remember.

569
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,500
You must forget everything in the past.

570
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,167
Once you wake up, it'll be all over.

571
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:21,261
Eun Byeol had it all along.

572
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:22,359
The evidence

573
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:25,418
that you killed her grandpa.

574
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:29,193
Did you enjoy the video I sent you,

575
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,251
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin?

576
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,792
Who is this jerk?

577
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,527
Don't hide like a coward.

578
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:37,625
Show yourself!

579
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:40,875
What about you? Have you moved on?

580
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:43,443
I'm talking about Grandpa's death.

581
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:44,776
What do you mean?

582
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,376
I took

583
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,235
those pills because

584
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,193
I missed Grandpa too much.

585
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:51,583
What are you talking about? Explain!

586
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,639
"No SIM card inserted"

587
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,437
"Authorised Persons Only"

588
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,875
When did you arrive?

589
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:55,377
Today.

590
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,425
How's Ro Na?

591
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,134
Is she still unconscious?

592
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,993
Seo Jin and Eun Byeol

593
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:05,897
are acting suspiciously.

594
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:09,550
Tell me everything you know.

595
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:17,092
I took this at 5 this morning.

596
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,467
Where was she going so early?

597
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:22,935
What's that bag in her hand?

598
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,201
What's weirder is that

599
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:27,118
she came back empty-handed.

600
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:28,577
And on top of that,

601
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:30,508
she came back with Cheon Seo Jin.

602
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,550
Does that mean...

603
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,759
The trophy...

604
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:40,176
I need to get the trophy first.

605
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:43,790
If I get caught, I'll be doomed.

606
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:51,726
The police have finished

607
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,143
investigating the scene.

608
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,143
Are you sure?

609
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,560
The preliminary investigation failed,

610
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:57,268
so they're struggling to find evidence.

611
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,310
There's minimum manning,

612
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:00,430
and most are gone.

613
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,533
Let's go.

614
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,867
- Cheon Seo Jin?
- Cheon Seo Jin?

615
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,047
"Ha Eun Byeol"

616
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,575
It is her, right?

617
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,784
Ms. Cheon.

618
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,950
What brings you here?

619
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:13,644
Look who's talking.

620
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:16,533
What are you doing here at this hour?

621
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:20,242
In this dark classroom with no lights on.

622
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,143
Were you looking for something?

623
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,268
I wonder too.

624
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:25,518
Something smells very fishy here.

625
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:26,435
What were you

626
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:27,726
rummaging through like a thief?

627
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,575
I wasn't rummaging through anything.

628
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,159
What?

629
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:39,076
Those lockers behind you

630
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,935
look like the perfect spot

631
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,076
for hiding things.

632
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:45,935
Move.

633
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,060
That's right!

634
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:49,976
Let's open them up and see.

635
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,602
You start from the left.

636
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:52,602
I'll start from the right

637
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,201
and break them open.

638
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,575
Hold on!

639
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,784
I'll open Eun Byeol's.

640
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,809
What?

641
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,784
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

642
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:45,450
There's only a few left now.

643
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:07,284
I found it!

644
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,409
Whose locker is it?

645
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:13,518
"Joo Seok Kyung"

646
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,159
Joo Seok Kyung!

647
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:17,742
I knew it.

648
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,893
We have to get her.

649
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,034
Let's go. Come on.

650
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,784
What are you doing here?

651
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,518
Let go!

652
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,492
I said, let go!

653
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,619
Do you know who my dad is?

654
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,350
You can't take me against my will!

655
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,782
Dad, where are you? Seok Kyung is...

656
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,034
The police are taking her.

657
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,533
What happened to your hand?

658
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,159
I was rushing to open the locker.

659
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:11,352
How did you know?

660
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,992
Eun Byeol

661
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,950
called me.

662
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:17,851
Did you set off the fire alarm too?

663
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,450
No.

664
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,575
I had no idea then.

665
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,409
Did Eun Byeol really do it?

666
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:30,644
Did Eun Byeol

667
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:32,450
do that to Ro Na?

668
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,310
It's not true, right?

669
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,310
I don't want to believe it either.

670
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:39,560
Why didn't you tell me?

671
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,268
You should've told me first!

672
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,201
How could I?

673
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,060
You are

674
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:47,117
Yoon Hee's husband now.

675
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:53,685
I don't believe this.

676
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,226
How...

677
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,659
How could our daughter do such a thing?

678
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,201
It already happened.

679
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,726
You may not want to believe it,

680
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,101
but just accept it.

681
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,477
No.

682
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:06,284
This can't be.

683
00:41:06,668 --> 00:41:08,909
This cannot be true.

684
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:10,726
You're the one who put the trophy

685
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,352
in Seok Kyung's locker,

686
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,143
which means you also don't want Eun Byeol

687
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,784
to get arrested.

688
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,352
You've been a disappointing dad

689
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,076
all her life.

690
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,018
Don't tell me you'll just let her

691
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:22,742
ruin her own life.

692
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:24,726
They'll find out very soon

693
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,268
that Seok Kyung didn't do it.

694
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:28,575
Right, so get yourself together!

695
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,101
Yoon Hee

696
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,159
will not give up.

697
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,393
She'll keep digging

698
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,284
to find out who really did it.

699
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,909
And in the end,

700
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,326
she'll find out that it's Eun Byeol.

701
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,159
Then Eun Byeol's life is over.

702
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:49,201
Save her.

703
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,742
You're the only one who can save...

704
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,784
our dear Eun Byeol.

705
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,867
You're Eun Byeol's dad.

706
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,450
What do you expect me to do?

707
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:14,950
I can't help Eun Byeol any more

708
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,201
because I feel so bad for Yoon Hee.

709
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,143
Seeing Ro Na like that

710
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,547
drives me crazy!

711
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,188
Ro Na...

712
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,656
She has no hope anyway.

713
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,076
Dr. Jung told me

714
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,284
she'll be pronounced brain-dead tomorrow.

715
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,225
Then shouldn't you save

716
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,492
the one who's not on the verge of death?

717
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,284
What?

718
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:38,226
What are you trying to say?

719
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,518
There's only one way to stop Yoon Hee

720
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,368
from digging further.

721
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,842
While Seok Kyung buys us some time,

722
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,391
we must frame someone else for the murder.

723
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,018
Seo Jin!

724
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:49,950
Right now,

725
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:52,310
I only care about Eun Byeol.

726
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:54,268
I'll only think about Eun Byeol.

727
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:56,159
I am her mother,

728
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:58,310
and a mother

729
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,617
must protect her child.

730
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:03,326
If anything bad happens to her,

731
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,117
my life is also over.

732
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,575
Darn it!

733
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:29,450
Why did you do that to Ro Na?

734
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:32,034
Did you hate her that much?

735
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,477
You should've just hated me.

736
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:34,935
Why take it out

737
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,644
on my innocent daughter?

738
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:37,685
Why?

739
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:39,560
Have you lost your mind?

740
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:41,726
Why in the world would I do that?

741
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,644
Why did you do that?

742
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:44,018
What are you doing?

743
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:44,976
Who are you

744
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,310
to accuse my daughter?

745
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:47,893
You stay out of this.

746
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,409
Seok Kyung tried to kill Ro Na!

747
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,726
The trophy was found inside her locker,

748
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,726
covered in blood.

749
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,935
We suspect that it was used

750
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:56,976
to assault the victim,

751
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,101
so we had to interview her.

752
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,742
The trophy?

753
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:02,768
We heard

754
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,726
there was bad blood between you and Ro Na

755
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,909
due to the recent bullying incident.

756
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:08,992
You dumped some kind of paint on her

757
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:11,617
and locked her in the lavatory.

758
00:44:12,668 --> 00:44:14,393
- That's...
- They are

759
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:15,518
completely unrelated.

760
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:17,310
I assure you. Seok Kyung didn't do it.

761
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:18,809
I can prove it.

762
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,476
Detective.

763
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:23,326
We got the fingerprint analysis results.

764
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:26,041
"Analysis Report"

765
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,934
There were many prints on the trophy,

766
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,726
but none of them

767
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,601
belongs to Seok Kyung.

768
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,685
See? What did I tell you?

769
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,726
I said I didn't do it!

770
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,935
I bet someone

771
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:43,393
put it in my locker to set me up.

772
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:44,893
Who'd do that? And why?

773
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,242
Someone who's holding a grudge against me.

774
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,533
Seok Kyung didn't do it.

775
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,310
Just before the grand prize announcement,

776
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:56,310
we took this picture in the green room.

777
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:57,268
Look.

778
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,284
Seok Kyung is there too.

779
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:01,533
Is this enough proof?

780
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:02,976
Who's missing?

781
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,742
Ro Na and Eun Byeol.

782
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:07,644
We deduce that the incident

783
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:10,352
took place just before the announcement,

784
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:12,602
which means it wasn't Seok Kyung.

785
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,644
What do you take our family for?

786
00:45:15,668 --> 00:45:18,143
This is a clear case of defamation.

787
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,393
I will not

788
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,201
let this go unpunished.

789
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:24,284
Let's go.

790
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:35,617
So Eun Byeol wasn't there...

791
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:38,310
Come to think of it,

792
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:39,851
Ms. Cheon

793
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,284
picked up a necklace at the scene.

794
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:43,518
A necklace?

795
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,185
What did it look like?

796
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,935
A very fancy one with a huge stone.

797
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:50,575
Maybe it was a sapphire, but...

798
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:54,109
Not sure. I only took a glance at it.

799
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,034
Sapphire?

800
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:59,203
"You can do it! From Dad"

801
00:46:00,376 --> 00:46:02,201
You didn't know about it?

802
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:04,809
I thought it was handed off to the police

803
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,700
as evidence.

804
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,060
Oh, gosh.

805
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:15,825
Yoon Hee.

806
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,602
Why are you so jumpy?

807
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:20,101
Oh...

808
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,935
I assumed no one was home.

809
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,659
Didn't you go to the hospital?

810
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:26,196
I came to get some things.

811
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:29,619
Where were you?

812
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,477
I was at the office.

813
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:32,851
I didn't go in for a few days,

814
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,909
so I have a lot of work piled up.

815
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,034
How did it go at the police station?

816
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,352
Seok Kyung's prints

817
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,659
weren't found on the trophy.

818
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:45,201
Oh, I see.

819
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,409
Is there any other evidence?

820
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,784
It wasn't Seok Kyung.

821
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,950
I think

822
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,825
someone tried to frame her for it.

823
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:08,825
But who would do such a thing?

824
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,450
I wonder too.

825
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,450
Anyway, I should go see Ro Na.

826
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,226
Stay home and get some rest.

827
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,867
All right.

828
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,726
Yoon Hee, let me know if you're tired.

829
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,742
I'll come and relieve you.

830
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:40,935
It's not you, right?

831
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,617
Yoon Chul.

832
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:44,435
You can't

833
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:46,352
do that to Ro Na.

834
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:48,034
You can't.

835
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:54,475
Eun Byeol.

836
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:56,600
Why did you do that?

837
00:47:57,401 --> 00:47:59,975
Why did you do that to me, Eun Byeol?

838
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:01,751
Eun Byeol.

839
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:03,892
Why did you do that to me?

840
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:07,725
Come with me.

841
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,669
Ms. Cheon isn't home yet.

842
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:36,751
It doesn't matter.

843
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:37,793
I'm here to see Eun Byeol.

844
00:48:37,817 --> 00:48:40,017
But she's not feeling well...

845
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,309
How are you feeling?

846
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:48,293
I heard you weren't feeling well.

847
00:48:48,317 --> 00:48:50,475
You really don't look well.

848
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:52,475
I'm okay.

849
00:48:53,192 --> 00:48:56,059
What brings you by?

850
00:48:56,484 --> 00:48:58,293
You must've heard

851
00:48:58,317 --> 00:48:59,934
about Ro Na.

852
00:49:00,942 --> 00:49:01,876
Yes.

853
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,017
I came to ask you something.

854
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,809
Were you with Ro Na

855
00:49:06,858 --> 00:49:08,725
just before the announcement?

856
00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:11,642
No.

857
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:13,975
Only the two of you

858
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:16,475
weren't in the green room.

859
00:49:17,775 --> 00:49:19,684
Where were you?

860
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:23,085
I was feeling a little queasy,

861
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:24,876
so I went to the infirmary.

862
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,517
Really?

863
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,351
You saw Ro Na, didn't you?

864
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:37,335
Tell me the truth.

865
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,043
What happened?

866
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,960
Tell the truth!

867
00:49:40,984 --> 00:49:42,850
What is going on?

868
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:45,460
She's not feeling well.

869
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:47,101
What are you doing?

870
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:50,975
Why is Eun Byeol not feeling well?

871
00:49:51,775 --> 00:49:52,669
What?

872
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:53,751
She used it as an excuse

873
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:56,267
to get out of the police interview.

874
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,809
So I came here to ask her myself.

875
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:01,475
Ha Eun Byeol, answer me.

876
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:03,793
You saw Ro Na, didn't you?

877
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:05,043
Tell me the truth.

878
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,710
What did you do to Ro Na?

879
00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:08,434
Tell me now!

880
00:50:09,651 --> 00:50:11,251
I don't know.

881
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,918
I don't know anything.

882
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:14,085
Stop it!

883
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:15,126
Stop harassing my daughter.

884
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,085
Leave at once.

885
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:17,126
Get out!

886
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,168
Get out now. Out!

887
00:50:18,192 --> 00:50:19,251
I know you're lying.

888
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:20,293
- Tell me!
- Get out!

889
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,960
What did you do to Ro Na?

890
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:23,210
- Let go.
- Get out!

891
00:50:23,234 --> 00:50:24,850
Get off of me!

892
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:27,710
Are you suspecting every single kid

893
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,502
in Hera Palace?

894
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,043
First, Seok Kyung. Now, it's Eun Byeol?

895
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:33,517
Seok Kyung has a solid alibi.

896
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:36,126
Your daughter is the only one

897
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,168
without an alibi.

898
00:50:37,192 --> 00:50:39,850
That is for the police to decide.

899
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:42,892
Oh, right.

900
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:44,168
Why hasn't Eun Byeol

901
00:50:44,192 --> 00:50:46,142
returned her dress yet?

902
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:48,710
What?

903
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:50,751
I went to the dress shop earlier.

904
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:51,710
Her dress is the only one

905
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:53,517
that hasn't been returned yet.

906
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:55,834
Can I see the dress?

907
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:57,543
You're insane.

908
00:50:57,567 --> 00:50:59,335
Why must I show it to you?

909
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,460
You're right.

910
00:51:00,484 --> 00:51:02,184
I'm insane.

911
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:03,918
My baby's lying in the hospital like that.

912
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:05,892
How could I not be?

913
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:08,226
I have to see that dress.

914
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,517
I'm sure you have it.

915
00:51:10,775 --> 00:51:12,001
Why?

916
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:14,809
Do you think you'd find some blood on it?

917
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:17,517
You also like being thorough.

918
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,085
Where is the dress?

919
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:21,669
Ms. Jin!

920
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:23,600
Bring Eun Byeol's dress.

921
00:51:24,067 --> 00:51:25,684
Yes, ma'am.

922
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:37,475
Here it is.

923
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,043
You're delusional

924
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:42,918
and paranoid.

925
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:44,001
If you have time for this,

926
00:51:44,025 --> 00:51:46,517
take better care of your daughter.

927
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:48,834
Ms. Jin.

928
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:50,600
Our guest is leaving.

929
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,085
Make the exact same dress.

930
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:31,085
I have to pick it up tonight.

931
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,767
Yes, ma'am.

932
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:45,126
Yoon Hee just came by.

933
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,377
She even asked to see Eun Byeol's dress.

934
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:49,558
She suspects Eun Byeol.

935
00:52:49,942 --> 00:52:51,809
What if the truth comes out?

936
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:53,418
Please!

937
00:52:53,442 --> 00:52:55,168
Please do something.

938
00:52:55,192 --> 00:52:57,725
Find a way, please!

939
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:30,335
Regarding the Cheonga Arts High incident,

940
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:31,960
Gangnam Police Station

941
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:33,834
- has stated that a school janitor
- Sang A.

942
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:35,418
- Sang A!
- turned himself in and confessed

943
00:53:35,442 --> 00:53:36,418
- Sang A!
- to the crime.

944
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:37,793
- What is it?
- The janitor, Park, claims

945
00:53:37,817 --> 00:53:39,460
- Stop yelling.
- that he had been

946
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:40,669
insulted by the victim

947
00:53:40,693 --> 00:53:41,710
- on numerous occasions
- I can't even

948
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:43,293
- and committed
- go to the loo at night.

949
00:53:43,317 --> 00:53:45,543
- the crime
- The culprit turned himself in!

950
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:47,543
- on impulse.
- I mean, Ro Na's case.

951
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,085
- What? Who is it?
- Having worked

952
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:50,251
at the school for many years...

953
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:52,251
You know, the sharp-faced man

954
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:54,418
who smiles a lot. The janitor!

955
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:56,502
You mean, Mr. Park?

956
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:57,918
No way!

957
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,751
Why would that nice man do such a thing?

958
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:01,335
This is why

959
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,684
you can never judge a book by its cover.

960
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,377
He must have a split personality

961
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:07,377
or something like that.

962
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:09,585
Oh, that makes sense!

963
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:10,834
I'm relieved

964
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:12,627
that the culprit has been caught.

965
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:13,793
Otherwise,

966
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,669
Yoon Hee and Yoon Chul would've gone mad

967
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:20,184
and grilled every kid at Hera Palace.

968
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:21,377
The school needs to be

969
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:23,434
considerate of the 12th graders.

970
00:54:24,192 --> 00:54:25,543
But I have to say,

971
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:28,850
I can't believe Mr. Park did it.

972
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:30,627
He was too scared

973
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:31,918
- to even touch a dead sparrow.
- The police

974
00:54:31,942 --> 00:54:32,960
will inspect the scene.

975
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:35,669
He'd never harm a person.

976
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:36,585
What was your motive?

977
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:37,585
A personal grudge?

978
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:39,830
Or were you after money?

979
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:42,279
That kid looked down on me

980
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:45,042
and insulted me on an ongoing basis.

981
00:54:45,067 --> 00:54:46,126
So I got angry and...

982
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,627
It was done on the spur of the moment?

983
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:48,585
What's going on?

984
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:49,627
Why did you hide the trophy

985
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:51,293
- in the locker?
- Mr. Park is the culprit?

986
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:53,001
- Since I couldn't...
- It's okay.

987
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,710
Don't worry about anything, Eun Byeol.

988
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:56,751
Why him of all people?

989
00:54:56,775 --> 00:55:00,892
He was always so nice to us!

990
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:04,001
I feel terrible...

991
00:55:04,025 --> 00:55:05,793
- Hold on!
- A comment, please!

992
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:08,502
What am I going to do now?

993
00:55:08,526 --> 00:55:11,642
Park has admitted to everything.

994
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:13,793
According to Gangnam Police Station,

995
00:55:13,817 --> 00:55:15,543
Park has confessed

996
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,460
to both his motive and method.

997
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,251
The results of the investigation

998
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,630
- Mr. Park...
- will be announced soon.

999
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:47,101
Stop drinking.

1000
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,059
Leave me alone.

1001
00:55:50,226 --> 00:55:52,801
I can't stand being sober.

1002
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:56,000
So you used Mr. Park.

1003
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:57,809
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

1004
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,794
I was closer to him

1005
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:03,334
than to my own father.

1006
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,251
I know.

1007
00:56:04,275 --> 00:56:05,960
That's why I'm trying my best

1008
00:56:05,984 --> 00:56:08,475
to minimise his sentence.

1009
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:12,309
I feel like a monster, and I hate it.

1010
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,168
I feel like it's all my fault.

1011
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:17,393
It's driving me insane.

1012
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,850
If you want to criticise me, go ahead.

1013
00:56:22,234 --> 00:56:25,184
I bet you want to ask me

1014
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:28,168
why I hid Eun Byeol away if I was going to

1015
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:30,142
end up like this.

1016
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:33,142
Fine.

1017
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:36,892
Maybe you were right about everything.

1018
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:41,475
Even I loathe myself.

1019
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:43,960
I told you to stop drinking.

1020
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:46,059
This won't change anything.

1021
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:52,226
Every night in my dream,

1022
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:54,975
I see Ro Na waking up.

1023
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,809
The anxiety is driving me crazy.

1024
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:01,309
If Ro Na wakes up,

1025
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:04,434
all our efforts will go down the drain.

1026
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:06,892
And Eun Byeol

1027
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:09,142
will be arrested.

1028
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:12,393
I'm so scared.

1029
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:14,168
I'm terrified.

1030
00:57:14,192 --> 00:57:16,475
It's killing me.

1031
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:17,834
Neither Eun Byeol nor I

1032
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:19,767
will be able to handle it.

1033
00:57:30,192 --> 00:57:32,267
You must pull yourself together

1034
00:57:33,025 --> 00:57:35,351
so we can protect Eun Byeol.

1035
00:57:40,693 --> 00:57:41,751
What are you doing?

1036
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:43,434
Are you sure

1037
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:46,642
you can protect Eun Byeol?

1038
00:57:57,775 --> 00:58:00,434
I will protect her with my life.

1039
00:58:00,526 --> 00:58:02,226
Our daughter, Eun Byeol.

1040
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,434
Even if you must kill Ro Na?

1041
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:18,517
Promise me that you'll protect her.

1042
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,001
That you'll do whatever it takes

1043
00:58:21,025 --> 00:58:23,600
to save Eun Byeol's future.

1044
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,975
If you can't do it,

1045
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:27,627
I will.

1046
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:30,434
I'll kill Ro Na if that is what I must do

1047
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,168
to save Eun Byeol.

1048
00:58:32,192 --> 00:58:33,585
Seo Jin!

1049
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:35,684
You know,

1050
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:36,834
this is our fault.

1051
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:38,377
That's why this happened.

1052
00:58:38,401 --> 00:58:40,850
We're both responsible.

1053
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,293
Even if there's a 1-in-10 million chance

1054
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:44,502
that Ro Na can wake up,

1055
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:47,017
that slim chance

1056
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,475
could bring misery

1057
00:58:50,775 --> 00:58:53,101
to both Yoon Hee and us.

1058
00:58:54,984 --> 00:58:57,101
Do you want that?

1059
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:06,001
"Yoon Hee"

1060
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:08,377
"Yoon Hee"

1061
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:24,377
"Violent Crimes Unit 2"

1062
00:59:24,401 --> 00:59:25,627
Mr. Park.

1063
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:28,251
I'll wrap up our interview here.

1064
00:59:28,275 --> 00:59:29,751
Is that okay?

1065
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,475
Yes.

1066
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:37,600
You did it?

1067
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,850
Was it really you?

1068
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,267
Did you really do that to my daughter?

1069
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:47,168
I'm sorry.

1070
00:59:47,192 --> 00:59:49,184
I'm really sorry.

1071
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:53,600
Why did you do that?

1072
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:54,834
Why?

1073
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:57,293
What did Ro Na even do to you?

1074
00:59:57,317 --> 00:59:58,627
Why did you do that?

1075
00:59:58,651 --> 01:00:00,710
Why? Why?

1076
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,585
Answer me! Tell me why you did it!

1077
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:04,043
You can't do this, ma'am.

1078
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,085
If I lose Ro Na,

1079
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:07,126
I will never forgive you.

1080
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,585
I will kill you!

1081
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:10,377
I will really kill you.

1082
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,475
I'm going to kill you!

1083
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:17,600
I'll kill you...

1084
01:00:22,942 --> 01:00:24,725
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

1085
01:00:26,025 --> 01:00:27,642
I guess

1086
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,725
this is it for us.

1087
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:34,892
I thought I'd never betray you again.

1088
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:37,751
Do not forgive

1089
01:00:37,775 --> 01:00:39,642
a jerk like me.

1090
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:50,301
"Restricted Area"

1091
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:24,460
My gosh!

1092
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:26,475
Dad, you need to see this.

1093
01:01:26,693 --> 01:01:28,876
All the comments are bashing Ro Na.

1094
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,168
Everyone feels sorry for the janitor

1095
01:01:31,192 --> 01:01:32,627
and thinks he must've had a reason.

1096
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:33,918
Gosh, I get it.

1097
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:35,043
But that's too harsh,

1098
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,543
considering she's dead now.

1099
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,751
Do you know what irks me the most?

1100
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:40,543
Seeing small fry who try to bully others.

1101
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,876
How dare she act like she belongs

1102
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,502
to the upper class?

1103
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:46,335
After moving into Hera Palace,

1104
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:48,585
she forgot that she came from nothing.

1105
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:51,142
She's being bashed even after she died.

1106
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,547
My dear son.

1107
01:01:53,572 --> 01:01:55,751
Focus on preparing for early admission.

1108
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:58,600
You're following my advice, right?

1109
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:00,517
Of course.

1110
01:02:00,775 --> 01:02:03,184
I already have

1111
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,126
over 500,000 followers!

1112
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:07,767
Amazing, right?

1113
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:10,834
Will following your advice really get him

1114
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:12,377
into Seoul University of Music?

1115
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:13,876
Do you not trust me?

1116
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,543
Why do you think I made sure to become

1117
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:17,293
an assemblyman before this year?

1118
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,918
Assemblyman Kang and I have been

1119
01:02:18,942 --> 01:02:20,251
working hard to propose this bill

1120
01:02:20,275 --> 01:02:21,460
since last year.

1121
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:23,585
Special admission for influencers.

1122
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:26,377
But it might disappear next year.

1123
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,460
Min Hyuk, you have to get in this year.

1124
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:32,001
My aide is managing your account well,

1125
01:02:32,025 --> 01:02:33,126
so just follow your mum around

1126
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,460
and do a lot of volunteer work.

1127
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,751
And take good pictures.

1128
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,793
- Okay.
- Got it?

1129
01:02:36,817 --> 01:02:38,210
Yes, got it.

1130
01:02:38,234 --> 01:02:39,669
Because of Ro Na, all the other kids

1131
01:02:39,693 --> 01:02:41,751
are in a state of panic.

1132
01:02:41,775 --> 01:02:43,751
I hope Min Hyuk can use this as his chance

1133
01:02:43,775 --> 01:02:45,751
to get ahead!

1134
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:47,960
This is why they say every crisis

1135
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,168
is an opportunity.

1136
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:51,101

finished everything I had to do.

1147
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:31,142

Let go!

I want to be with Ro Na.

I can't let my daughter be all alone.

Did I save you so you could do this?

Please let me punish myself.

I'll punish myself for killing Seol A!

Sure, but before you die,

1158
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:29,043
you need to find out

1159
01:04:29,067 --> 01:04:31,101
who did this to Ro Na!

1160

is someone else.
