Goodness. Seo Jin, you look so beautiful,

00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:33,368
as if you're marrying for the first time.

7
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:36,685
How much is this dress?

8
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,768
Pink looks perfect on you, Ms. Cheon.

9
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,435
Why did she spend so much on that dress?

Are you happy?

I'm very happy.

I hope your happiness lasts forever.

Thank you for coming, Yoon Hee.

16
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,477
We have a very special relationship.

We've worked together,

18
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,726
we're both members of the Hera Club,

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,809
and you're a high school friend

20
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,726
of my beloved wife, and on top of that,

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,867
Ro Na was friends with our children.

22
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:09,352
Why would you bring Ro Na up

23
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,560
on a day like this?

24
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,726
Goodness.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,976
That was my mistake.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,492
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,518
I'm sure you're still in mourning

28
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,187
for losing your precious daughter.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,867
It's all right.

- What made you do that?
- Anything to say?

Say something!

Members of Hera Club, I truly thank you

39
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,602
for coming here today to celebrate

40
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:47,893
our marriage with us.

41
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,768
We'll love, respect, and adore each other

42
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,242
as we live a good life.

43
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:55,018
Ms. Cheon, say something.

44
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,560
Why do you look so gloomy

45
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,976
as if you're getting dragged

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,784
into a labour camp?

47
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,060
She's right.

48
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:03,352
You look very pale and white.

49
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,368
Are you ill?

50
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:07,935
It's...

51
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,018
She was too edgy last night,

52
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,393
so she hasn't had any sleep.

53
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,608
She's a very sensitive person.

54
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,602
Are you all right?

55
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,742
Hang in there. It'll be over soon.

56
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,909
But we should make a toast before we go.

57
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,644
Assemblyman Lee, please make a toast.

58
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:25,216
- Looking so cool.
- Should I do that?

59
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,602
Actually, whenever I propose a toast,

60
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:31,268
the couples all got divorced

61
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,768
and became mortal enemies.

62
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,518
It's very odd that

63
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:35,560
every marriage I gave a toast

64
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,604
fell apart within a year.

65
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,435
But for these two,

66
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,935
it'll be different.

67
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,492
Let's make a toast.

68
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:46,319
For the beautiful--

69
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,685
It's my mum.

70
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,609
- My gosh.
- Come on.

71
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,644
Goodness, Mi Ja.

72
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:57,989
Your boy Kyu Jin is working right now.

73
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,492
What?

74
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,208
Dr. Ha is...

75
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,602
the real culprit of Ro Na's murder case?

76
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,893
- What is he talking about?
- What?

77
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,517
What did you say?

78
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:13,101
The real culprit? Who?

79
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:13,976
He said it's Dr. Ha.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,477
The real culprit who killed Ro Na.

81
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:17,644
Dr. Ha is the murderer?

82
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:20,685
The gentle Dr. Ha that we know?

83
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:21,602
Hey!

84

00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,477
What?

87
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,310
A new suspect of the Bae Ro Na murder case

88
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,477
at Cheonga Arts High has been arrested.

89
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,644
- Really?
- The new suspect has been

90
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:34,935
identified as the victim's stepfather,

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,726
shocking many people.

92
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,226
Ha, the suspect, is the director

93
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,435
of the Korean branch office

94
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,768
of a well-known pharmaceutical company.

95
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,226
He's also under suspicion

96
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,185
for paying a man

97
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,185
- to cover up his crime.
- No.

98
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,268
- Gangnam Police Station said
- No!

99
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,602
Park, the previously arrested suspect...

100
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,560
Why are you so shocked?

101
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,726
named Ha as the real culprit,

102
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,685
- and arrested him
- That man has nothing

103
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,950
- when he was fleeing.
- to do with you.

104
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,893
The motive of the crime wasn't disclosed.

105
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,893
You...

106
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,060
Many people became furious

107
00:03:58,084 --> 00:03:59,477
at this immoral stepfather who killed

108
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,851
- How's my wedding gift?
- his daughter,

109
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,851
and demanded that his identity

110
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,226
- It's a surprise for you.
- gets disclosed.

111
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,101
The suspect has yet to deny

112
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,784
or admit to his charges.

113
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,644
- Oh, no.
- Goodness!

114
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,159
Darn it.

115
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,809
This is unbelievable.

116
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,693
How could he do that?

125
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,518

She's at her wedding right now.

It should be over by now.

128

00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,726
With who?

130
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,726
What do you mean?

131
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,909
Seok Kyung's dad, of course.

132
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:15,393
Those two really got married

133
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,806
after kicking me out to the US?

134
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,617
You didn't know?

135
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,976
I shouldn't have said that.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,851

It's Seok Hoon.

00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,867
Don't let him in.

141
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,768
I don't want to see him.

142
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,726
Don't ever let him in here again.

143
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,715
Seok Hoon is here.

144
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:46,893
Get out.

145
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,143
I have nothing to say to you.

146
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,492
What's wrong? Is something going on?

147
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:53,934
You remember everything.

148
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,518
You remember now, don't you?

149
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,368
You jerk!

150
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,352
Everything was a lie?

151
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,018
That you wanted to go out with me

152
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,076
and that you liked me?

153
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,935
What did you want to get from me

154
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,076
when you told me such absurd lies?

155
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,066
I just want the truth.

156
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,226
What did you do to Ro Na?

157
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,950
Tell me.

158
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,435
Tell me.

159
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,201
Tell me right now!

160
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,909
I don't know.

161
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:23,117
I didn't do anything.

162
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,644
Please stop talking about Ro Na!

163
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,617
I'm sick of this!

Please get him out of here. Now!

166
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,060
You need to leave.

167
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,726
Eun Byeol can't get worked up like this.

168
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,893
Hey, we need help.

169
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,268
Eun Byeol.

170
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:41,101
I'm going to find out the truth.

171
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,518
I'll make sure you tell me

172
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,143
why Ro Na had to die!

173
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,700
Ha Eun Byeol!

174
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,560
Let go of me.

175
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,575
- Eun Byeol.
- Ms. Jin...

176
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,533
What am I going to do?

177
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,617
I remember everything.

178
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,242
I remember what I did

179
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,368
on the day of Cheonga Arts Festival.

180
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,560
How could he kill his stepdaughter?

181
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:05,726
Then he left home

182
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,435
and wanted to divorce you?

183
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,644
That scumbag.

184
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,409
He's worse than beasts.

185
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,851
Are you okay, Yoon Hee?

186
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,143
I've never liked him since ages ago.

187
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,809
Why did you get involved with such a jerk?

188
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,685
"Gangnam Police Station"

189
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:20,851
Yoon Hee!

190
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,352
You should divorce him immediately.

191
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,343
I'll help you get

192
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:25,477
about 100 billion won as your alimony.

193
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,310
I still can't believe this.

194
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,310
If anything, he should have

195
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:29,726
thought of Eun Byeol before he did that.

196
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,143
I'm sure he did that

197
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,435
because he thought of her.

198
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,518
Ro Na and Eun Byeol are huge rivals.

199
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,018
Wait, did he hurt Ro Na

200
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,955
to give the grand prize to Eun Byeol?

201
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,060
That happened to Ro Na

202
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:42,768
on the day of Cheonga Arts Festival.

203
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,851
That's why he's frightening.

204
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,310
I feel really bad for Eun Byeol.

205
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,393
Her dad is a murderer.

206
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,034
Her mum is a fraud.

207
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,226
Chairman Joo, you really didn't know?

208
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,726
Not at all.

209
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,575
It's all very shocking to me too.

210
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,634
"Gangnam Police Station"

211
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,435
Did Mr. Ha Yoon Chul ask you

212
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,900
to make that false confession?

213
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,201
Yes.

214
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:07,809
He gave me 500 million won in cash

215
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,018
and promised to help

216
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,583
my sick daughter get treated.

217
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,659
You didn't do it, did you?

218
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,284
Who put you up for this?

219
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,226
Was it Ha Yoon Chul?

220
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,101
No.

221
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,768
He never did that.

222
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,076
I'm... I'm the culprit.

223
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,450
So you aren't going to talk?

224
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:45,159
He...

225
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:49,375
He...

226
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,092
He made me do everything.

227
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:56,418
He said he'll give me enough money

228
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:59,194
for my family to spend for life.

229
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:01,115
So I had no other choice.

230
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:03,568
I'm so sorry.

231
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,635
Mr. Ha.

232
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,218
Do you admit

233
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,014
to murdering Bae Ro Na?

234
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,109
I do.

235
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,709
I killed

236
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:19,459
Bae Ro Na.

237
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,635
The reporters are watching,

238
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,775
so I can't give you too much time.

239
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,205
I understand that very well.

240
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,993
Thank you very much, Chief.

241
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:41,859
Yoon Chul.

242
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:46,707
What... What happened to you?

243
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,306
"Gangnam Police Station"

244
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,370
Why are you here?

245
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:50,607
People will get suspicious of you.

246
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,802
Go home.

247
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,510
Dan Tae must have threatened Mr. Park.

248
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,843
I thought he'd let it go once I marry him.

249
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:58,926
I didn't know he would go this far.

250
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,925
I figured.

251
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,501
What about Eun Byeol? Did she leave?

252
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,435
She's home.

253
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,185
Ms. Jin called me and said she's with her.

254
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,351
It's too dangerous for her to be here.

255
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,310
Send her to the US now!

256
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,534
You need to worry about yourself!

257
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,351
Keep telling them it wasn't you.

258
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,159
I'll meet Mr. Park and talk to him.

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,825
I already admitted.

260
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,742
Have you gone insane?

261
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,950
Are you going to live as a murderer?

262
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,284
It's true that

263
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,618
I went there to kill her.

264
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,659
I went to her hospital room

265
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,200
with a bad intention.

266
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,900
I just couldn't do it and came back,

267
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,059
but it feels like her death is my fault.

268
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,030
It drove me crazy.

269
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,398
It all came down to this,

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,918
and it's all for the better.

271
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,486
Do you think I married him

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,306
to see you turn out like this?

273
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,143
Don't worry about me

274
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,977
and pull yourself together.

275
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,810
Joo Dan Tae won't end everything here.

276
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,712
I know he'll get Eun Byeol involved again.

277
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,733
That jerk. I'm going to kill him.

278
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,659
I'll take the blame for everything.

279
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,451
Just keep Eun Byeol safe.

280
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,075
Can you do that?

281
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,200
"Gangnam Police Station"

282
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,867
How does it feel

283
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:50,451
when your ex-husband became a criminal?

284
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,451
I've been curious.

285
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:57,475
Your heart was with Yoon Chul again.

286
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,268
But why did you insist on

287
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,851
marrying Dan Tae?

288
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,451
My heart was with who?

289
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:05,117
That never happened.

290
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,768
I guess there's no more reason

291
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,881
to get blood on my hands.

292
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,412
Joo Dan Tae will do his part

293
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,841
and torment your family to the end.

294
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,075
What?

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,268
Do you think your daughter will be safe

296
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,583
once Yoon Chul goes to prison?

297
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:29,351
It'll only turn you into a wreck.

298
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,659
The truth won't change.

299
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:35,194
What are you trying to say?

300
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,286
All right, then.

301
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,017
I have to go see the detective.

302
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:43,284
He wants to give me a report

303
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,326
on the real murderer.

304
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,475
I wonder

305
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,393
how many more times

306
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,712
the new and real culprit will appear.

307
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,742
Wait.

308
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,117
Does she know?

309
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:11,185
You're home.

310
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,159
I heard Dr. Ha is at the police station.

311
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,310
How's Eun Byeol?

312
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,185
She won't come out of her room.

313
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,768
She seems even more shocked

314
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,268
after finding out about your wedding.

315
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,894
Why did you tell her that?

316
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:23,976
She was already stressed out.

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,976
Why were you in a hurry?

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,367
Eun Byeol's memories came back.

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,310
What did you say?

320
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:33,560
Eun Byeol remembers

321
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,476
what happened on that day.

322
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,700
The day of Cheonga Arts Festival.

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,852
She came home early by herself

324
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:41,909
with blood on her dress.

325
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,075
Ms. Jin.

326
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:45,810
How did you know that?

327
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:49,284
Eun Byeol and I have no secrets.

328
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,159
You didn't know?

329
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,034
I'm much closer to her than you.

330
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,200
But don't worry.

331
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,393
I'm on Eun Byeol's side.

332
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,913
Everything I've seen is unseen.

333
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,367
Eun Byeol.

334
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,075
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you

335
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,268
about the wedding ahead of time.

336
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,742
- I--
- I don't want to hear it.

337
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:31,976
I have to study

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,226
to get into Seoul University.

339
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,075
That's what you want.

340
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,927
Look at me when you speak!

341
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,034
Why won't you ask me about dad?

342
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,226
Don't you want to know?

343
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,909
He killed Ro Na.

344
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,534
He should be punished for his crime.

345
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,659
What did you say?

346
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,062
What did you just say?

347
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,143
I saw it all over the news.

348
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,852
Dad made a confession.

349
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,101
Isn't this what you and dad wanted?

350
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,955
That's why you erased my memories.

351
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,034
Wait,

352
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,810
did your memories come back?

353
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:11,852
You thought you could

354
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,810
get rid of my memories?

355
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,018
You should've done it better.

356
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,809
You should've erased everything!

357
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,685
Do you expect me to be grateful

358
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,457
that dad got arrested in my place or what?

359
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,018
Is that all you can say?

360
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,393
Do you know what we had to do for you?

361
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,310
I never asked you to do this!

362
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,185
I never wanted this!

363
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:35,602
You two did everything as you wanted!

364
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,520
Why did you hit me?

365
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:41,476
I am much stronger

366
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,367
than what you think I am.

367
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,560
Why did you give me that drug?

368
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:47,976
If you had just told me to forget it,

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,904
I would've done that.

370
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,534
- Ha Eun Byeol!
- What?

371
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:58,075
Didn't you know that I'm a monster?

372
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,727
On the day you ran off leaving Grandpa,

373
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,894
I also ran away

374
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,894
leaving him in the middle of the rain.

375
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:07,018
I memorised English words at his funeral!

376
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,018
How could I not go insane?

377
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,326
You made me like this.

378
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,602
But I never told anyone.

379
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,894
I hated you so much

380
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,237
for letting Grandpa die...

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,310
But because you're my mum,

382
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,435
and I had to protect you,

383
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,367
so I kept my mouth shut.

384
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:32,268
So how can you marry Seok Hoon's dad?

385
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,685
Didn't you know that I like Seok Hoon?

386
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,242
What are you talking about?

387
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,700
You like Seok Hoon?

388
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:40,867
Mum.

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,409
What do you know about me?

390
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,476
You know my rank, grades,

391
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,018
and penalty points.

392
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,495
But you don't know anything else about me.

393
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,268
Get out. Get out of here.

394
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,367
Get out of my room!

395
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,518
Get out!

396
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,492
Get out!

397
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,018
Eun Byeol! What are you doing?

398
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,310
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

399
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,018
What are you doing?

400
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,310
- Eun Byeol, no!
- Give me that.

401
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:11,476
- I need to die.
- No!

402
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,643
I'm so sorry.

403
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,852
I'm sorry.

404
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,310
Eun Byeol, don't do this.

405
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,852
Eun Byeol.

406
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,367
Mum...

407
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,992
I'm so scared.

408
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,242
Am I going to get arrested?

409
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,018
- No.
- Is my life over?

410
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,268
No.

411
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,810
I'm sure we'll find a way.

412
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,101
Don't you know that I can protect you?

413
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,560
I won't let you or dad get hurt.

414
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:38,976
You have to trust me.

415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,101
I really wasn't going to kill her.

416
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,560
I mean it.

417
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,976
I remember everything clearly.

418
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,059
I got angry and threw the trophy at her,

419
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,395
then Ro Na rolled down the stairs.

420
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:58,560
Then I heard someone's ringtone.

421
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,783
That suddenly woke me up.

422
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,435
You heard a ringtone?

423
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,602
That ringtone keeps ringing in my ears,

424
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,950
and it's driving me insane.

425
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,852
Mi, fa, sol, fa, mi, mi.

426
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:18,409
Mi, re, ti, re, mi.

427
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,618
Wait.

428
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,643
Are you saying someone else was there?

429
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,326
I don't know.

430
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,075
I got so scared that I just ran away.

431
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,435
If I had got her to a hospital,

432
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,685
she wouldn't have died, right?

433
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,476
I only hurt her shoulder.

434
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,768
I still can't believe she died like that.

435
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:40,976
Her shoulder?

436
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,185
Did you just say her shoulder,

437
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,700
not her head?

438
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,435
It was her shoulder.

439
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,226
Ro Na died because she hurt her head.

440
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,226
No.

441
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,534
I didn't hit her in the head.

442
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,101
I remember that clearly.

443
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,518
Are you sure you remember correctly?

444
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,435
I remember that so clearly

445
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,351
that it still makes me shudder!

446
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,119
Why won't you believe me?

447
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,117
Tell me

448
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,894
everything in detail.

449
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,351
Everything from that day.

450
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,685
From the very beginning.

451
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:17,110
Take your time and tell me everything.

452
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,135
Na Ae Gyo and Jung Doo Man.

453
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,677
They weren't just doing business.

454
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,555
There was something between them.

455
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,215
What's this key for?

456
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:24,885
Did I keep you waiting?

457
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,859
Why are you so late?

458
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,128
There was a bit of traffic.

459
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:36,343
I heard Oh Yoon Hee's land is up for sale.

460
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,968
I'm going to start haggling tomorrow.

461
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,174
I see.

462
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,067
I have a question.

463
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,993
When did you quit smoking?

464
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:52,700
Didn't I tell you?

465
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:56,411
I quit because I couldn't stop coughing.

466
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,429
Really?

467
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:01,359
Good for you.

468
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,359
Is it because it has been so long?

469
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,223
You seem

470
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,401
sort of strange.

471
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,720
You used to lift your glass

472
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,968
with your left hand,

473
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,276
but you've been using your right hand.

474
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,718
You got annoyed playing Soo Ryeon

475
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:34,609
because she wasn't a lefty.

476
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:38,301
I lived my entire life mimicking her,

477
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,051
and I got used to using my right hand.

478
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:41,526
I see.

479
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:43,622
Is that so?

480
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,918
Do you feel better once you check that?

481
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,135
Sorry.

482
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,067
I've been stressed out over the wedding.

483
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,317
You know how suspicious I am.

484
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:05,650
I have to check and check again.

485
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,568
Your butterfly looks more charming today.

486
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,984
Should I stay here tonight?

487
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:14,367
This is your wedding night.

488
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,716
Don't do anything to cause trouble.

489
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:18,760
If you want Cheonga Group for yourself,

490
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:21,303
you need to learn self-control.

491
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,510
You stayed out on our wedding night.

492
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,885
Isn't this too harsh?

493
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,051
Our marriage is only on paper anyway.

494
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:57,216
What are you talking about?

495
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:02,218
I'm ready to live a happy life with you.

496
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,210
Don't lay a finger on me.

497
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,176
Eun Byeol couldn't go to the US

498
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,343
because of your surprise.

499
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,593
I'm going to stay at my place

500
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:11,621
with Eun Byeol for a while.

501
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,663
I came to tell you that.

502
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:17,343
Your house?

503
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,801
You're making me very sad.

504
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:21,135
Our marriage is now registered,

505
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:23,093
so we're legally a married couple.

506
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:24,510
This is your house.

507
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,276
Where else will you go?

508
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,771
I'll give you

509
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:32,188
Cheonga Construction as you wanted.

510
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:33,882
I'll just consider it as alimony

511
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:35,906
I had to pay for a fraudulent marriage.

512
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:39,512
However, give me Eun Byeol's necklace.

513
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:44,840
Seo Jin, you must be very delusional.

514
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:47,507
I'm the one who has the upper hand.

515
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:50,570
It's not your turn to bark like a dog.

516
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,675
You nutcase.

517
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,608
Give me her necklace!

518
00:23:57,532 --> 00:23:59,508
This is our marriage manual.

519
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:01,357
Read it and behave accordingly.

520
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:05,508
"Marriage Manual"

521
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:07,091
I'm going to let you take over

522
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,190
all the chores in the penthouse.

523
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,258
And of course, I already dismissed

524
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:13,940
all of our housekeepers.

525
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:15,300
What?

526
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:16,800
In order for you to do your part

527
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:18,841
as Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung's stepmum,

528
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:20,550
I thought we should do it without helpers.

529
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:21,791
Right.

530
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:23,625
Of course, you cannot see Eun Byeol

531
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:25,717
without my permission.

532
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,954
Are you insane?

533
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:29,613
She's my daughter.

534
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,581
I'm the only one who can look after her!

535
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,612
I don't care about that.

536
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:36,013
Why should I worry about Yoon Chul's kid?

537
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,154
Did you forget what happened to Soo Ryeon

538
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:39,491
when she tried to cover for her daughter?

539
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:46,738
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:48,296
I must have

541
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:50,697
lost my temper again.

542
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,670
That's why you should've behaved.

543
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:58,629
I have given this some thought.

544
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:00,155
Cheonga Medical Centre

545
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,504
seemed like a solid business.

546
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,221
You can hand that over to me too.

547
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:06,863
You scumbag.

548
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:07,946
You can never take

549
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,530
Cheonga Medical Centre or the foundation.

550
00:25:09,554 --> 00:25:11,738
Why are you so angry?

551
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:12,946
You're making me too scared

552
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,670
to talk to you, lady.

553
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:17,793
Who the heck

554
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:19,530
are you?

555
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:22,588
Have you always been after my fortune?

556
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,822
You must have thought I was a joke.

557
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:28,238
I'm the eldest of Cheonga, Cheon Seo Jin.

558
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:29,446
You don't get a penny more

559
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,405
than Cheonga Construction.

560
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,837
Take that with gratitude and get lost.

561
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:37,321
Keep your manners.

562
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:39,795
I'm warning you, lady.

563
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:41,321
We're getting divorced now.

564
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:43,946
I can't live with you even for a day.

565
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,238
Get the papers done now.

566
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:46,780
How many times do I have to tell you

567
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:48,071
that I decide if we keep this marriage

568
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,238
or get divorced, you stupid woman?

569
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:51,421
You're the one who's stupid!

570
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:54,446
Do you think I'll go down by myself?

571
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,697
I'm telling the entire world

572
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,238
that you killed Sim Soo Ryeon.

573
00:25:57,262 --> 00:25:59,510
You scumbag. You murderer!

574
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,964
You need to learn some manners, lady.

575
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,708
Let go of me!

576
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,738
Let go! You scumbag!

577
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:17,071
Let go!

578
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:18,588
Let go!

579
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:21,753
Get off of me! Let go!

580
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,099
Why?

581
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:43,558
You're surprised.

582
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,432
You should've watched what you said.

583
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,834
Soo Ryeon didn't know her place either.

584
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:54,890
She acted like a crazy wench, then died.

585
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:58,125
At least, I'll have some fun with you

586
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,987
unlike Soo Ryeon.

27 Cheonsu District.

596
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,760
I see, many people

597
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:47,552
are interested in that property,

598
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:49,444
and there are already 15 people

599
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,905
who made their provisional payment.

600

Would you like to see another property?

I don't want to see anything else.

602
00:27:58,856 --> 00:28:00,389
It has to be

603
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,389
27 Cheonsu District.

604
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,556
I'm with him.

our chairman.

Yes.

Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

609
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:14,290
I'm sure we own 70 percent of the land

610
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:16,472
in Cheonsu District.

611
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:19,014
I have a plan to let both of us win.

612
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,375
So,

613
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:23,480
are you up for a little game?

615
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:33,738

Let me make this clear for you.

619
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:49,956
I'm not going to betray Dan Tae.

620
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,081
So your stalking ends here.

621
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,415
If I ever see you again,

622
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,874
I'm dragging you to Dan Tae.

623
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:57,847
You wouldn't do that.

624
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,874
If you were going to,

625
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:02,290
you would've told him about me already.

626
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:03,930
Do you want me to?

627
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,248
Should I live up to that expectation?

628
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:06,930
Be honest.

629
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:09,373
You don't trust him either.

630
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,165
He abuses your children

631
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:12,748
and killed his wife.

632
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:14,248
Do you want to die like Soo Ryeon did?

633
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:15,248
Mind your own business.

634
00:29:15,272 --> 00:29:16,665
Why do you care

635
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,556
if I die or not?

636
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,373
Why are you trying to buy

637
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,222
27 Cheonsu District?

638
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:24,823
No matter what the reason is, use me.

639
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:25,915
You can't have that property

640
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:27,763
without firstly going through me.

641
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,794
I'm the actual owner.

642
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,556
I have no reason to work with you.

643
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,264
I'm willing to risk my life for money.

644
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:40,115
I'll destroy anyone who gets in my way.

I'm going to avenge

648
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:53,763
my baby Seol A's death.

Ms. Na suggested that you auction off

651

the property to the highest bidder.

652
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,055
- An auction?
- Yes, sir.

653
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:21,306
Why an auction?

654
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,889
Let go!

00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,456
- Come here.
- Let go!

656
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,139
- Come here.
- Let go.

657
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,180
Let me go.

658
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:37,139
Let go of me!

659
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:40,222
Let me go!

660
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:43,972
Let go!

661
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,290
This is the only place you can enjoy

662
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,956
in this penthouse.

663
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,707
And this is the shares transfer agreement

664
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:53,081
for Cheonga Group.

665
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:54,290
You are not taking a step outside

666
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:57,216
until you sign that thing. Understood?

667
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,996
You should say hi to her.

668
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:13,206
Joo Dan Tae!

669
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,972
Open this door!

670
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:17,680
Joo Dan Tae!

671
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,302
How dare you betray me

672
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:22,652
and go back to Yoon Chul?

673
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:25,097
I'll make sure I pay you back for

674
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,445
everything you did and many times more.

675
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,338
Look forward to it.

Hey!

677
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:38,798
Open the door, Joo Dan Tae!

678
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,139
Joo Dan Tae!

679
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,431
Sim Soo Ryeon.

680
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:05,347
Is this your revenge?

681
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:09,763
Leaving a scumbag like Dan Tae to me?

682
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:18,524
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

683
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,088
This won't take long.

684
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:23,588
"Silence"

685
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:25,672
We're still married on paper.

686
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:26,630
"Protect Human Rights"

687
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,017
So I should visit you at least once.

688
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:35,396
Did you hate Ro Na that much?

689
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,900
To the point that you had to kill her?

690
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:47,332
I don't want to give excuses.

691
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:49,476
I did it for Eun Byeol.

692
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,602
I did it to protect my child.

693
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:52,618
What's so wrong with it?

694
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:54,676
You would've done the same thing.

695
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:56,955
You're right.

696
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:58,804
I was the same way.

697
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,137
If it was for Ro Na,

698
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,674
I did everything, no matter what it was.

699
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,179
But I've learned

700
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:11,592
that if you do anything bad,

701
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,163
it all comes back to you.

702
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:15,746
Even if you try to run away,

703
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,054
karma will come and get you.

704
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:20,929
Don't fool yourself

705
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:22,121
into thinking that this was

706
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:23,871
the best choice for Eun Byeol's sake.

707
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:25,497
What about her?

708
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,595
Eun Byeol did nothing wrong.

709
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,304
Here's our divorce application.

710
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:38,429
I'm submitting it today.

711
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:45,280
I think we should really

712
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,571
end things now.

713
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,925
I wanted to be happy with you and Ro Na

714
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,970
even though it was short-lived.

715
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,221
I was a fool for thinking that.

716
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:03,137
My dear Ro Na...

717
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:08,054
just like you,

718
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:11,304
she was so sweet and loving.

719
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,179
What?

720
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:21,887
I will do whatever it takes to make sure

721
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:25,637
you'll suffer the worst punishment.

722
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:31,622
The regret will tear your heart to shreds.

723
00:34:31,646 --> 00:34:33,388
You deserve it.

724
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:37,346
Because you killed your own child.

725
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:41,553
What...

726
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:45,096
What the heck are you talking about?

727
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,762
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

728
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:50,887
But I have to say,

729
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:53,372
I'm so grateful

730
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:54,580
that Ro Na died

731
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:57,388
without knowing any of this.

732
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,038
Had she known

733
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:01,304
she was being murdered by her father,

734
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,720
she would've been so heartbroken.

735
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,316
"Silence"

736
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:09,346
Yoon Hee.

737
00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:13,104
What do you mean? What is wrong with you?

738
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,553
Let me ask you one last favour.

739
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,096
Apologise to Ro Na

740
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:27,720
with all your heart,

741
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,096
just for once.

742
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,288
I feel so bad for my child who died

743
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:33,829
without even getting a chance

744
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:36,054
to be treated as your daughter.

745
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,970
You can do that for her, right?

746
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:41,929
Yoon Hee, you'd better tell me the truth.

747
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:43,330
You're lying, right?

748
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:45,970
You're lying to make me suffer!

749
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,553
Please do it for her.

750
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:50,330
Wait, Yoon Hee!

751
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:51,538
What do you mean?

752
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:53,413
What the heck are you talking about?

753
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:54,622
Calm down!

754
00:35:54,646 --> 00:35:56,871
Yoon Hee. It's not true, right?

755
00:35:56,895 --> 00:35:59,538
Right? Yoon Hee! Tell me the truth!

756
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,163
- Calm down!
- What exactly do you mean?

757
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:02,497
- Yoon Hee, don't leave!
- Hey!

758
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:03,913
Don't go!

759
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:05,996
- Hey, come on!
- What do you mean?

760
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,372
Yoon Hee!

761
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:09,413
Don't go!

762
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:11,538
What the heck do you mean?

763
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:13,887
What does that mean?

764
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,541
No!

765
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:23,290
Get the smartest lawyers at the firm.

766
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,037
And have the defence argument ready.

767
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,301
Be on standby. All right.

768
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:29,071
Gosh, it's true that you never know

769
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:30,363
what someone's really thinking.

770
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:32,655
I can't believe Dr. Ha did such a thing.

771
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,007
So he wanted a divorce

772
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:34,863
because he felt guilty

773
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,113
after killing Yoon Hee's daughter?

774
00:36:36,137 --> 00:36:39,030
Gosh, it's sending shivers down my spine.

775
00:36:39,054 --> 00:36:41,363
There's no way that nerd killed her.

776
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,863
He's such a chicken.

777
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:45,496
Why are you changing your word?

778
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:47,038
Earlier, you called him a scumbag

779
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:48,330
and went on about it.

780
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:49,664
That was because

781
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:52,080
my dear Hee was there. Anyway,

782
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:54,829
he doesn't have the guts to kill someone.

783
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:55,913
I'm putting together

784
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,538
a defence counsel for him.

785
00:36:57,562 --> 00:36:59,121
With the best lawyers at my dad's firm.

786
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:00,746
Have you lost your mind?

787
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,746
If people find out that

788
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,871
you're helping a murderer,

789
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:05,288
you'll lose the election for sure!

790
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:06,746
Didn't you see it yesterday?

791
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,746
Seo Jin stormed out

792
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,413
as soon as she heard the news.

793
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:10,497
What does that mean?

794
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:11,746
If it's for Ha Yoon Chul,

795
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,746
she can give up all her money.

796
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,746
My firm should take advantage of that.

797
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,746
It's not like she was shot in the head.

798
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,538
Why would she spend her money on her ex?

799
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:22,330
I have a good feeling about this.

800
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,871
I think this one case

801
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:28,622
will make me filthy rich. I just know it.

802
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,788
Enough of your nonsense.

803
00:37:30,812 --> 00:37:34,388
Goodness. Just drink this.

804
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:36,705
We're the only family in Hera Palace

805
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:38,038
without a housekeeper.

806
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,746
That's why I'm trying to figure out a way

807
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,746
to earn money.

808
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,121
Once Cheonsu District blows up,

809
00:37:42,145 --> 00:37:44,121
we'll move to the penthouse

810
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,996
on the 130th floor.

811
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,829
The penthouse? Really?

812
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:49,705
If we get about five units,

813
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:51,038
we'll make

814
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,970
200 to 300 million won in rent alone.

815
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:55,553
Kyu Jin!

816
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,704
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

817
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:05,413
That's why we have to go all-in on this.

818
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,330
Sang A, I need money.

819
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:08,996
The real estate prices keep going up.

820
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,304
I don't have enough money for the deposit.

821
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:13,679
Why are you so lovable?

822
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:23,553
Is this a trend or something?

823
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,205
So this is the furniture company

824
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,304
Soo Ryeon ran?

825
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:32,262
27 Cheonsu District. It's so famous.

826
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,637
It's pretty big.

827
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,304
I always wanted to check it out.

828
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:39,929
I kind of want it.

829
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:42,762
I want to run it.

830
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,913
The sales numbers are quite high.

831
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:47,221
No wonder everyone wants this lot.

832
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,622
Did something good happen?

833
00:38:50,646 --> 00:38:52,470
Why did you bring me here?

834
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:53,955
I wanted to apologise

835
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:55,970
for being irritable yesterday.

836
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,746
Everything's going perfectly

837
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,054
according to my plan.

838
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:05,746
Cheonga Construction is already mine,

839
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,746
and Cheonga Medical Centre will be easy.

840
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,746
The purchase of this lot

841
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,429
is going smoothly, right?

842
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:13,829
I plan to raise the price a little now.

843
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:14,829
How?

844
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,330
I played a little game so that

845
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,664
people will smell money

846
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,497
and gather like a swarm of bees.

847
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:20,788
Is that so?

848
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:22,996
The value of land isn't predetermined.

849
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,246
We decide the price.

850
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,746
As we've always done.

851
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,637
You never let me down, Ae Gyo.

852
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:32,512
Congratulations, honey.

853
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:33,829
Joo Dan Tae Village,

854
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,829
which has been your lifelong dream,

855
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:37,038
is finally coming to fruition.

856
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:38,746
And you no longer

857
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,746
have to live in hiding.

858
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,512
You can stand by me publicly as Na Ae Gyo.

859
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:47,262
Oh, I have something for you.

860
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:49,595
Here.

861
00:39:50,646 --> 00:39:52,788
What is this?

862
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:54,595
A gift?

863
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,205
My gosh! What is this?

864
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:03,246
Seo Jin's lifeline.

865
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,622
Hold onto it until the stock matter

866
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:06,262
is all sorted out.

867
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:09,470
She's looking for it like a mad woman.

868
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:12,372
Is this

869
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:14,804
that necklace, the evidence?

870
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,622
Does Seo Jin know?

871
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,304
What?

872
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,720
That her daughter didn't kill her.

873
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:28,304
What do you mean?

874
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,595
Why are you so surprised?

875
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:32,720
You can't fool me.

876
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:37,137
Seo Jin is more naive than I thought.

877
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:40,038
Right when you were

878
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,996
going after Cheonga Group,

879
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,887
her daughter happened to kill someone?

880
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:48,429
Was it really a coincidence?

881
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:52,038
Who benefited the most from it?

882
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:54,429
You, obviously.

883
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:00,705
Did you kill her?

884
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:02,470
Ae Gyo!

885
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:08,654
"28th Cheonga Arts Festival"

886
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,294
"Mr. Ma Doo Ki"

887
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:20,996
Mr. Ma, how did it go?

888
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,705
I'm sorry, sir.

889
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:25,246
The judges were too adamant,

890
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,246
so I couldn't persuade them.

891
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,538
Just skip to the conclusion.

892
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:30,996
Who's getting the grand prize?

893
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,679
The grand prize

894
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,913
will go to Bae Ro Na.

895
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:35,679
Bae Ro Na?

896
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,429
Why her of all people?

897
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,413
Hey, Ma Doo Ki. Can you do anything right?

898
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:43,288
But Seok Kyung is getting the gold--

899
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:44,372
She can get that easily

900
00:41:44,396 --> 00:41:46,304
without your help.

901
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,595
Our deal ends here. You got that?

902
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:54,038
Gosh, she's as annoying as her mother.

903
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:56,512
Bae Ro Na, this little witch...

904
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:01,829
"Na Ae Gyo"

905
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,470
Ae Gyo?

906
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,007
Jeez.

907
00:42:10,937 --> 00:42:12,637
Is that Eun Byeol?

908
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:15,470
What is that?

909
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,615
Mr. Joo.

910
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:35,366
Mr. Joo.

911
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,929
Please call my mum.

912
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:40,447
I'm...

913
00:42:41,062 --> 00:42:42,693
I'm hurt.

914
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,970
Why you,

915
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,054
of all people?

916
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:50,788
Why are they giving the grand prize

917
00:42:50,812 --> 00:42:52,929
to a loser like you?

918
00:42:54,627 --> 00:42:56,121
If it weren't for you,

919
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:58,455
Seok Kyung will get a free pass

920
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,705
to Seoul University of Music.

921
00:43:00,729 --> 00:43:02,804
What are you saying?

922
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:11,688
Can't you give in a little for Seok Kyung?

923
00:43:11,713 --> 00:43:15,663
You see, I really love my daughter...

924
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:22,480
a lot.

925
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,553
Please don't kill me.

926
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,012
Don't kill me.

927
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,346
Please don't kill me.

928
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:47,222
You always got on my nerves,

929
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:49,487
whenever I saw you.

930
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:53,102
But since you

931
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:56,179
kindly gave it up for my daughter...

932
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:05,737
Ha Eun Byeol.

933
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,971
Who knew you'd end up

934
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:10,096
helping me like this?

935
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,305
My gosh, if I play my cards right,

936
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:13,388
I can get rid off

937
00:44:13,412 --> 00:44:15,442
of two annoying witches at once.

938
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,707
I am

939
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:21,424
such a lucky man.

"Cheonga Arts High School"

941
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:33,966
I got the most similar one from the car.

00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,216
Great.

I had to wait in line for the loo.

Ms. Cheon Seo Jin, to the stage

Stop running. Kids, don't run!

Stop running, kids!

958
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,629
I killed her?

959
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:43,363
I killed Ro Na?

960
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:46,087
What gave you such a misconception?

961
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:50,680
Is it really just a misconception?

962
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:56,245
Does anyone know you better than I do?

Well, in any case...

965
00:46:03,212 --> 00:46:06,355
Bae Ro Na was very useful.

966
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:08,537
As useful as Min Seol A was.

967
00:46:08,629 --> 00:46:10,188
Thanks to those pathetic girls' deaths

at the most opportune times,

969
00:46:11,962 --> 00:46:14,204
I was able to effortlessly swallow up

all of Soo Ryeon and Seo Jin's fortunes.

971

Who was it?

976
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:45,788
What did you people do to that young girl?

977
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:12,204
Welcome to this nightmare.

978
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:14,438
Now, do you see

979
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:16,579
what my dad is really like?

980
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,438
This is why I warned you over and over

981
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:21,037
not to even start this lousy marriage.

982
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:27,037
You should be careful.

get out of here alive.

985
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:36,746
Just like my mum.

986

It keeps ringing in my ear.

987
00:49:13,754 --> 00:49:15,646
It's driving me insane.

Get up!

Mum, when did you come?

996
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:35,897
Can you sing that ringtone you heard?

997
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:37,688
The one you heard by the steps.

998
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:39,772
- What?
- Just what you remember. Come on.

999
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:40,813
Why?

1000
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,870
Just do it!

What is this about?

1004
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,912
What happened?

1005
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,688
That jerk was there.

1006
00:50:57,712 --> 00:51:00,172
I'm sure of it. It's his ringtone.

1007
00:51:06,974 --> 00:51:08,146
You can't enter the 85th floor

1008

without Chairman Joo's permission.

1009
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:12,370
Take her to the penthouse.

1010
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,188
It's okay, Eun Byeol.

1011
00:51:15,212 --> 00:51:16,229
Let go!

1012
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:17,563
I'll walk out on my own. Let go!

1013
00:51:17,587 --> 00:51:19,064
- Mum!
- It's okay, Eun Byeol.

1014
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:21,287
- I said, let go!
- Let me go!

1015
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,730
Let go! I said, let go.

1016
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:28,438
Let go of me!

1017
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:30,162
Let go.

1018
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:34,188
Show up in front of my daughter again,

and I'll kill you all with my own hands.

You have to wake up at 5 a.m.

1021
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:43,270
I guess you won't get much sleep.

1022
00:51:43,295 --> 00:51:45,593
You can still make me some soup, right?

1023
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:01,396
I do hate Ms. Cheon,

1024
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,188
but I can't stand seeing dad all happy.

1025
00:52:03,212 --> 00:52:05,870
If he's happy after killing someone,

1026
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,239
that's simply unfair.

"Auction for 27 Cheonsu District"

"Take a leap towards the next Gangnam!"

1029
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:20,147
"Take a leap towards the next Gangnam!"

1030
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:31,824
She's making it so obvious.

1031
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:41,396
How much cash did you prepare?

1032
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,772
Why should I tell you?

1033
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:47,079
We're all competing against each other.

1034
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:52,162
Do you know who this land belongs to?

1035
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:54,855
Chairman Joo, obviously.

1036
00:52:54,879 --> 00:52:57,396
Soo Ryeon's furniture company was here.

1037
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,646
My gosh.

1038
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,813
You're so out of the loop.

1039
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:05,370
Oh Yoon Hee owns this land.

1040
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:09,912
Yoon Hee?

1041
00:53:10,629 --> 00:53:13,355
How come she never told me?

1042
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:14,730
We're best friends.

1043
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:16,188
When it comes to land and money,

1044
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:17,730
friendship doesn't matter.

1045
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:19,146
Rumour has it

1046
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,438
and she and Yoon Hee are very close,

1047
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:22,605
but I guess they're not.

1048
00:53:22,629 --> 00:53:25,037
I thought they were besties for life.

1049
00:53:26,462 --> 00:53:27,730
Mind your own business!

1050
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:29,146
You two have no friends.

1051
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,162
That's why you stick together.

1052
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:33,438
No, that's not true.

1053
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:35,496
- That's not true.
- Are you jealous?

1054
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:42,953
Mother, how much money do we have?

1055
00:53:44,129 --> 00:53:45,146
This much.

1056
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,563
What? Only 300 million won?

1057
00:53:47,587 --> 00:53:49,496
Add another zero.

1058
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:50,772
Three billion won?

1059
00:53:50,796 --> 00:53:53,355
Hey, you clueless woman.

1060
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:55,146
Why don't you shout it into a bullhorn?

1061
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,646
Is this land really worth that much money?

1062
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,313
Kyu Jin told me it'll eventually be worth

1063
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,855
300 billion won.

1064
00:54:01,879 --> 00:54:02,813
I took out a loan

1065
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:05,120
with my building in Gangnam as collateral.

1066
00:54:06,337 --> 00:54:09,079
Can you try to keep a straight face?

1067
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,772
"Take a leap towards the next Gangnam!"

1068
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:16,313
All the rich speculators in Gangnam

1069
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,146
are flocking here.

1070
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,355
Since Joo Dan Tae raised the stakes,

1071
00:54:20,379 --> 00:54:22,370
it'll be sold at the highest price.

1072
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,646
I wonder how much Joo Dan Tae will bet.

1073
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,120
He'd never lose that land.

1074
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:36,204
Joo Dan Tae, just you wait.

1075
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:38,480
I'll find out everything you did

1076
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:40,788
even if I must strangle you.

1077
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,880
His tie and collar look different.

1078
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,921
He got changed.

1079
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:14,496
But why?

1080
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:30,578
Mr. Do.

1081
00:55:30,603 --> 00:55:32,146
I need you to look for someone.

1082
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,730
Her name is Na Ae Gyo.

1083
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:35,646
She and Joo Dan Tae seem close.

1084
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,730
Find out what their relationship is.

1085
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:37,798
Hurry.

1086
00:55:44,587 --> 00:55:46,396
Due to the overwhelming interest

1087

We'd like to give

1090
00:55:52,837 --> 00:55:55,938
our super VIPs here

1091
00:55:55,962 --> 00:55:59,772
a chance to purchase the property.

1092
00:55:59,796 --> 00:56:02,022
Then let me now begin the auction

1093
00:56:02,046 --> 00:56:04,064
on behalf of the property owner.

1094
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:06,496
We'll start at 10 billion won.

1095
00:56:06,587 --> 00:56:08,146
- 11 billion!
- 11 billion.

1096
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,813
- 12 billion.
- 12 billion.

1097
00:56:09,837 --> 00:56:11,105
13 billion.

1098
00:56:11,129 --> 00:56:13,188
- 15 billion!
- We have 15 billion here.

1099
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:14,855
Hey, come on!

1100
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:17,188
- 20 billion won.
- 20 billion over here.

1101
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:19,730
20.1 billion won.

1102
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:20,730
23 billion.

1103
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:21,855
23 billion won!

1104
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,938
25 billion!

1105
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:23,897
25 billion won here.

1106
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,480
Does Ma Ri have that much money?

1107
00:56:26,504 --> 00:56:28,355
Darn it. 30 billion!

1108
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:29,605
We have 30 billion here.

1109
00:56:29,629 --> 00:56:31,730
Why don't you give up now?

1110
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:33,563
Why should I?

1111
00:56:33,587 --> 00:56:35,396
33 billion won!

1112
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,229
Is that woman out of her mind?

1113
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:39,022
Mother, let's just give up.

1114
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:40,688
It's already over our budget.

1115
00:56:40,712 --> 00:56:43,605
Let's not be greedy, okay?

1116
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:45,980
33 billion won. Anyone else?

1117
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:48,438
Is it being sold for 33 billion won?

1118
00:56:48,462 --> 00:56:51,480
Giving up here is not my personality.

1119
00:56:51,504 --> 00:56:52,730
We can sell it to Chairman Joo

1120
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:54,287
for double the price.

1121
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,204
40 billion.

1122
00:56:57,837 --> 00:56:58,938
40 billion won?

1123
00:56:58,962 --> 00:56:59,938
Honey!

1124
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:02,496
Has he lost his mind?

1125
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,521
Sell it to me.

1126
00:57:04,545 --> 00:57:06,646
I'll pay 40 billion won.

1127
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,064
We have 40 billion here.

1128
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:11,438
Is everyone else giving up?

1129
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:14,355
All right, then. 40 billion won, it is.

1130
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:16,772
The property is now sold--

1131
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:18,454
50 billion.

1132
00:57:20,379 --> 00:57:22,037
50 billion won!

1133
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:28,122
But what about the market price?

1134
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:31,377
The difference is getting too big now!

1135
00:57:31,402 --> 00:57:32,855
I understand the location is amazing,

1136
00:57:32,879 --> 00:57:34,521
but this is ridiculous!

1137
00:57:34,545 --> 00:57:36,271
You'll lose money when you sell it.

1138
00:57:36,295 --> 00:57:37,938
Are you a total amateur?

1139
00:57:37,962 --> 00:57:39,772
I'll be the one losing money,

1140
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:42,162
so just worry about yourselves.

1141
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:44,521
Well?

1142
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,229
If no one else is bidding,

1143
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:47,563
let's end this now.

1144
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:49,271
I have bills to pay.

1145
00:57:49,295 --> 00:57:51,616
Where would I get 50 billion won?

1146
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:53,604
I give up.

1147
00:57:53,629 --> 00:57:55,396

Joo Dan Tae, that scumbag.

1171
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:47,680
I wanted to crush him because I couldn't

1172

stand him boasting about his money.

1173

Doesn't that woman look familiar though?

1175

She has a cold air about her.

1176

This feels very familiar.

Yes.

00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:41,555
Yoon Hee hit the jackpot.

1186
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,221
Starting tomorrow, all the land we own

1187
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:45,430
will shoot up in value.

1188
00:59:45,454 --> 00:59:47,763
Cheonsu District will blow up, big-time.

1189
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:49,779
I guarantee you.

1190
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:56,930
My car's here.

1191
00:59:56,954 --> 00:59:58,654
I have to go.

1192
01:00:05,787 --> 01:00:07,987
You still have something to say?

1193
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:11,154
I keep getting a feeling

1194
01:00:11,704 --> 01:00:14,654
that you're not a bad person.

1195
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,096
But you're obviously crazy about money,

1196
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,404
so you are one of Joo Dan Tae's people.

1197
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,487
I won't hope for anything from you

1198
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:24,179
or try to talk to you again.

1199
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,263
I hope I will never

1200
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:29,055
see you again.

1201
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:31,279
I feel so bad for Soo Ryeon.

1202
01:00:31,787 --> 01:00:33,096
You used her

1203
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,320
until the moment she died.

1204
01:00:36,287 --> 01:00:38,640
That kind woman didn't deserve that.

1205
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:42,388
I hope your guilt towards her haunts you

1206
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:44,407
for the rest of your life.

"Open"

1208
01:01:54,807 --> 01:01:56,096
What is this?

1209
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,903
You said you wanted to see her.

1210
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,779
Come with me.

1211
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,862
Seo Jin, get in.

1212
01:02:36,537 --> 01:02:38,221
What about you? Will you be okay?

1213
01:02:38,245 --> 01:02:40,014
Dad has no idea I know the secret passage,

1214
01:02:40,038 --> 01:02:41,388
so don't worry.

1215
01:02:41,412 --> 01:02:43,638
I'm helping you because of Ms. Oh.

1216
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:45,738
Hey, get in already.

1217
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,654
Hurry!

1218
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:20,696
Why did you want to see me?

1219
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,555
Yoon Hee, save me.

1220
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:27,404
Please, I beg you.

1221
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:28,772
Yoon Hee.

1222
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:30,355
What are you talking about?

1223
01:03:30,379 --> 01:03:32,370
You're making no sense.

1224
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:34,496
The person who killed Ro Na...

1225
01:03:34,704 --> 01:03:36,404
It was Eun Byeol.

1226
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,513
Eun Byeol did it.

1227
01:03:38,537 --> 01:03:40,221
I deserve to be punished

1228
01:03:40,245 --> 01:03:42,112
for what I did to you and Ro Na.

1229
01:03:42,245 --> 01:03:43,862
But you see,

1230
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,680
I think this is a trap.

1231
01:03:45,704 --> 01:03:47,862
Joo Dan Tae was involved.

1232
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:50,237
I need you in order to find out

1233
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,070
who really killed Ro Na.

1234
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,154
Help me.

1235
01:03:55,056 --> 01:03:56,756

It's me.

These are photos of Na Ae Gyo

from the past few days.

1241
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:50,443
She only went out to go to restaurants.

1242
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:56,364
You don't need to monitor her any more.

1243
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,779
Understood, sir.

1244
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:33,820
I feel so bad for Soo Ryeon.

1245
01:05:34,203 --> 01:05:35,471
You used her

1246
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:37,779
until the moment she died.

1247
01:05:38,787 --> 01:05:41,011
That kind woman didn't deserve that.

1248
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:47,165
Thank you

1249
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,446
for remembering me.

1250
01:06:24,203 --> 01:06:25,305
What are you doing?

1251
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:27,154
You're Soo Ryeon.

1252
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:29,132
I know you're Soo Ryeon!

1253
01:06:31,579 --> 01:06:33,654
Don't try to run away.

1254
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:38,154
I'm sorry.

1255
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,820
It took me so long to recognise you.

How beautiful is it

1259
01:07:27,454 --> 01:07:28,638
to admit your defeat?

1260
01:07:28,662 --> 01:07:29,972
Sim Soo Ryeon is dead.

1261
01:07:29,996 --> 01:07:30,972
I couldn't forgive myself

1262
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:32,138
for going to the airport first.

1263
01:07:32,162 --> 01:07:33,555
I will never forgive you.

1264
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:35,763
I can't guarantee Eun Byeol's safety.

1265
01:07:35,787 --> 01:07:37,596
Let me kill him with my own hands.

1266
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,305
Maybe Soo Ryeon knew before she died.

1267
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:40,972
The game's over.

1268

Did Na Ae Gyo deceive Chairman Joo?

1271

I will kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

1272
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:51,073
Na Ae Gyo died last night.
