=Episode 10=

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,780
Hey, old man.

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
Ask them to release Xiaomeng now!

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,800
Xiaomeng?

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,240
Wu Xiaomeng, Secretary Wu.

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
Xiaomeng?

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,360
You see,

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
if someone wants to take my pieces,

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
I have to sacrifice my cannon

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
or my horse.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,880
It's no big deal for me.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
But if I can't bear to lose a single piece,

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,240
then I've already lost.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,560
I don't have time to discuss chess now.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,320
Can you please free Xiaomeng?

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Secretary Wu and Wang Ming
abused their roles,

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,800
embezzling company funds.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,160
It's a hot topic within the company.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,160
If I let her go just for you,

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,880
doesn't that tell people

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,320
that as long as they flatter us,

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,560
they can do whatever they want?

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Just

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,920
get her out yourself.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,320
How you do it

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,720
depends on your ability.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,420
(Magic Bar)

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Mr. Li,

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,120
we're still closed.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,800
How can I help?

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Did Wang Ming and Zhang Chongguang come?

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,800
You and Mr. Zhang,

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,280
I can't afford to offend either of you.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,600
You're not getting any info here.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,040
You know why I'm here.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
I only

38
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,360
run a small business.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,320
Any little disturbance

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,800
eventually reaches me.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Boss Lady,

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,520
let me get this straight.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,080
I came today

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
to check the footage.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,200
It's a lot to ask.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,320
Gonna cost a fortune.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,680
Name your price.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,480
I want you.

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
It's not your body I want.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
It's your status.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
Marry me into the Zhang Family.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,600
Get me legitimate.

53
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Boss Lady,

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,040
you're kidding, right?

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
You won't regret marrying me.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,280
I know all the secrets

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
of every guest at this club.

58
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Don't worry.

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
It's merely a formality.

60
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,760
I won't interfere with your relationship

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
with Wu Xiaomeng or Lu Jinling.

62
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,040
I have everything you want.

63
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,180
What do you say?

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Boss Lady,

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
if that's the case,

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
then I don't need the evidence.

67
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,680
If you walk out that door,

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,440
you'll never

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,120
get what you want.

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,320
Whatever he wants,

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,240
I'll get it for him.

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,600
What would like to drink, President Lu?

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
I'll have someone prepare it.

74
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,200
He's with me.

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,880
Whose side are you on?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,240
Is he your boyfriend?

77
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,840
Sorry, my info's outdated.

78
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Hand it over.

79
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
Or,

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,640
I'll shut you down.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
If we're shut down,

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,200
the bosses won't be happy.

83
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,720
Let them talk to Lu Group.

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
I wanna see

85
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,280
who's got the guts to try that.

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,640
Now,

87
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,200
hand it over.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,480
Alright.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
I will

90
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,720
give it to you.

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
Gotta go.

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,264
(Regular/Smart Playback, Medium Room)
Take this money to Mr. Luo

93
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,430
and tell him,

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
there's more afterward.

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
I know Mr. Luo.

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
He's in charge of the bidding

97
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,080
for New Energy Company.

98
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
He can't save Xiaomeng.

99
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Legal Boy,

100
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,000
you nut.

101
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,760
You're trying to save Wu Xiaomeng,

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
not necessarily clearing her name.

103
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:13,680
Zhang Chongguang targeted her

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,160
because he has nothing to fear.

105
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
Now you hold his weakness.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,920
What are you afraid of?

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Exactly.

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,680
Legal Boy.

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,920
If it were to happen

110
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,400
to me one day,

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,800
would you be this worried?

112
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,000
How could that be?

113
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,920
You are the president of Lu Group.

114
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,440
No one would dare.

115
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
You...

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,000
I am

117
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,160
asking you

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,680
as a woman.

119
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,560
- President Lu.
- Call me Jinling.

120
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,280
Call me Jinling.

121
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,530
I prefer President Lu.

122
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,820
- Calling you Jinling feels weird.
- You...

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,520
Jinling.

124
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,970
Jinling.

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,360
I have to go.

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,640
Just sit here for a bit.

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,480
Take this money to Mr. Luo

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
and tell him,

129
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
there's more afterward.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,920
Name your price.

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,840
I can give you anything you want.

132
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,685
(Regular/Smart Playback, Medium Room)
Take this money to Mr. Luo

133
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
and tell him,

134
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,080
there's more afterward.

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,760
Zhang Chongguang,

136
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,440
do you like

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,080
the gift I got you?

138
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Legal Boy,

139
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
you care a lot about that woman.

140
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,920
Cut it out.

141
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
Release Wu Xiaomeng.

142
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,760
Delete the video.

143
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Also,

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
make sure it doesn't leak.

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Zhang Chongguang,

146
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,800
you're not in a position to bargain.

147
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,240
Let her go.

148
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,840
So,

149
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,880
Secretary Wu was framed?

150
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,040
That Wang Ming

151
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
set her up on purpose

152
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,120
out of a personal grudge.

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Where is Wang Ming?

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,840
Sent to the authorities.

155
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,840
Brother, here.

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
Wangfu.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Did I

158
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
teach him wrong?

159
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Gouwa.

160
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Thank you.

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,040
You don't have to.

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,000
That's the right thing to do.

163
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,960
Xiaomeng,

164
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,860
listen.

165
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
If you're upset,

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
just talk to me anytime.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
Gouwa.

168
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
Actually, I...

169
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,120
Why didn't you pick up?

170
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,320
It was a scam call.

171
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,960
- Let's go.
- Okay.

172
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,120
Hello?

173
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,000
Hi,

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
you have a package.

175
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,800
I don't want anything.

176
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,560
Stop calling me.

177
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,240
Let's go.

178
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Okay.
