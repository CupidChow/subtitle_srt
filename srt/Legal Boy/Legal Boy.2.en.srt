my brother.

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,840
Just today,

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,960
you almost killed him.

8
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Let me out!

Dad,

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,280
now that the third child is back,

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,520
I suggest

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
that the appointment

15
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
of Executive President be postponed.

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Do I have to

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
share my money with that poor guy?

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Why should I?

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
I won't give...

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Not a penny.

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,320
The whole company

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
knows that

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,160
Chongrui is

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
the new President.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,790
that the new Executive President

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,920
is suspected of murder,

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,580
what do you think will happen?

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,280
If it were me,

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
I'd be worried sick.

32

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,960
will be temporarily postponed.

35

Who are you?

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
You're that worker.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Cut the crap.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm asking you,

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
where is Zhang Chongrui?

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
This is my car.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Get out!

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll ask you one last time.

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,040
Where is Zhang Chongrui?

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
He seems to be inside.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Take me to him.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
The Group is now

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,350
torn apart

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,040
over the issue of the succession.

49
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,640
Even if

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,160
that kid is the lost third child,

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
I hope that

for the company's stability,

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,800
don't acknowledge him publicly.

54

I'm sorry.

You're Gouwa, right?

59

Who are you?

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,960
Come with me.

61
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,360
Old man,

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,400
where's Zhang Chongrui?

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
Ask him to come out.

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,080
You've grown so much.

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,090
When you got lost,

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,280
you were only two.

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
Now that you're back,

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,080
this is your home.

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
I grew up without parents

70

I can't reveal your identity
to the public yet.

73

you are my son.

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm not here to be your son.

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Tell me where Zhang Chongrui is!

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,280

78
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,480

the guest has arrived.

81
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
Got it.

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,480
A knight for two bishops,

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,880
and its potential will be heroic.

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
You lost.

- I'm representing Dongcan...
- I'm here to meet Chairman Zhang.

88
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,000
Time is precious.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Let's cut the crap.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Brother, she...

91
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
Let's go.

92
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Hello?

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,200
Bad news, Gouwa.

94

Dashui needs money for surgery today.

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
The company won't pay,

96
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,440
saying it's Mr. Chongguang's idea.

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,280
What should we do?

98
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,990
Think of something quickly.

99
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,200
I've got it.

100
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,240
I'll figure it out.

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
Wait for my message.

Legal Boy.

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
You lost the pawn.

104
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,120
The rules that run the world
are set by the rich,

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
and pawns in chess

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,960
are pieces that can be discarded
at any time.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
I don't care what the rules are.

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,920
What I want is justice.

109
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,880
If you don't want
to play by their rules,

110
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,040
and you want justice,

111
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
then you need leverage.

112
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
And Lu Jinling

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,280
is your leverage.

Don't you know how to play chess?

117

124
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
how's your grandpa's health lately?

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,880
He's doing quite well.

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,120
He enjoys a leisurely life every day

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
and lives carefree.

128

00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm sure

134
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,040
your workload

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,560
will be much lighter.

136

Chairman Zhang,

137
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,640

140
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,240
this...

141
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
Are you kidding me?

142

I'm out of line.

But it seems

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,720
to involve

147
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,960
a murder.

148
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,000
No.
