=Episode 24=

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Brother?

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,600
Don't worry.

5
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,740
I'll give you 3% of the company.

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Chongguang,

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
good boy.

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,440
Brother,

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,240
the children of Zhang Family

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,150
are truly impressive.

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,880
Zhang Wangcai,

12
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,560
instead of staying in the old residence,

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,960
you've been plotting

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,120
for the past two years, huh?

15
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
I regret not dealing with you all

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
completely back then.

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
- Wangfu,
- Mad…

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,400
you've got thinner.

19
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,850
Seems you've been stressed

20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,360
- the past two years.
- Shut up!

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Zhang Wangcai.

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,920
Zhang Wangcai!

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,640
Uncle Wangfu,

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
you've worked hard

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
the last couple of years.

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
Today,

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm taking you back to the old residence.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
Dad.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Mm.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Uncle Wangfu.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Please.

32
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,010
Brother…

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,300
Dad,

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm back.

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
Gouwa,

36
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,260
do I deserve

37
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,280
to be your big brother now?

38
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,150
Brother.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,440
Great.

40
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,830
Brother,

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,960
you stole my spotlight today.

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,840
Brother, you were so amazing.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,960
Gouwa, Chongming,

44
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,160
I have to thank you both.

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Brother,

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
once again,

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
thanks for bringing me home.

48
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,840
Over the years I was away,

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,360
I hope you were doing well.

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Actually, over the years,

51
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,520
Gouwa has changed.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Really?

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,960
But I can tell

54
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,960
he cares more about you.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,320
Join Lu Group

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
and work with me.

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,080
I appreciate all that you've done

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,600
for Lu Group over the years.

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
Alright.

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
That's enough small talk.

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,720
We went from being rivals to friends.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,400
Today, with Gouwa here,

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,080
we formally celebrate Gouwa's return.

64
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,920
Let's raise a toast together.

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,440
- Come on.
- To a bright future.

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

67
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,920
It's an honor to partner with your company.

68
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
It's been a pleasure.

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,880
Don't you want to get married now?

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,720
Focusing on my career seems better.

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's make money together.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,200
We're on the same page.

73
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,400
Aren't you

74
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,440
going to check out

75
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,800
the inauguration today?

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
I don't think so.

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
Let him handle it himself.

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,940
Are you okay with that?

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,880
The doctor told me not to stress.

80
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,730
Oh.

81
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,570
Besides,

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,920
every generation has its blessings.

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,640
Come on, let's play chess.

84
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
Gouwa,

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
you're quite a piano player.

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Xiaomeng once said

87
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,680
she loved piano music.

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,360
So I've been practicing.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Brother,

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
how's business been recently?

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,240
The company's doing well.

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,480
And you? When will you come back to help?

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm not going back.

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,320
I don't want to cause you trouble.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
About time.

96
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,080
I've booked a private room for tonight.

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
Let's head over first.

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,320
Come soon.

99
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,590
- Quick.
- Come on.

100
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,240
Gouwa.
