00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,380
=Legal Boy=

2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,860
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,120
Brother.

4
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,160
I'm going.

5
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:18,360
I used to say you were naive,

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,160
but I didn't expect

7
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,080
the naive one

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,000
would be me.

9
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,480
I won't be around anymore,

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,120
so be careful with Chongrui.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,040
Got it.

12
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,370
Gouwa.

13
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,410
I'm leaving.

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
Can you do me a favor?

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,840
What is it?

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Take care of Chongming for me.

17
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm afraid Chongrui will...

18
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,280
Don't worry.

19
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,450
With me around,

20
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,680
he'll be fine.

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Alright.

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
From now on, this family—

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
Chongming, Dad—

24
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,830
I'm leaving them all to you.

25
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,280
Come on.

26
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Let's go back.

27
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
Chongguang's gone,

28
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,800
but his work

29
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,520
must continue.

30
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,640
Chongrui, Chongming,

31
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,880
do you have any good ideas?

32
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Brother,

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
shouldn't we ask Gouwa?

34
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,360
He's not willing to come.

35
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
Why bother asking him?

36
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,080
True enough.

37
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,200
Brother, here's what I think.

38
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,880
Chongrui has been a key part of Dongcan.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
All the employees

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
- respect him.
- I disagree.

41
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,681
I don't agree to give it to him.

42
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,000
You think you're gonna get it?

43
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,560
Who's in charge of this family,

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,760
you or Dad?

45
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,480
Besides, if I give it to you,

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,600
can you manage it?

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
Enough.

48
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,400
Brother, so...

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
Chongming's business skills

50
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
are not as good as Chongrui's.

51
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,460
(Breaking Even)

52
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,880
How can we avoid the risks?

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
There are three ways.

54
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,230
First,

55
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,880
avoid dealings with unreliable suppliers.

56
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,040
Second,

57
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,880
abandon projects that risk loss.

58
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,240
And third,

59
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
if we run into a ton of problems

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,320
prototyping a new product,

61
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,720
stop the trial immediately.

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,240
Did you remember all that?

63
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Chongming, what now?

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
Help me, please.

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,280
Take your time. Slow down.

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,920
- What's wrong?
- Zhang Chongrui is

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,480
taking over my brother's business.

68
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Well, if someone is doing that,

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
just let him do it.

70
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
Wu Xiaomeng,

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,920
that's easy for you to say.

72
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,560
- I...
- When my brother left,

73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
do you know what Legal Boy promised him?

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,760
He said

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
he'd protect me.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,720
Slow down.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,600
Besides, if my brother knew

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Legal Boy just

79
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
let his company get taken over,

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,440
he'd be furious.

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,920
What does his effort have to do with you?

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
I am his effort.

83
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
How about we meet tomorrow?

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,320
We're still reading these books.

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,160
No way.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,480
If the company gets taken over,

87
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,480
he'll control all of Dongcan.

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
By then, even if you find something,

89
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,880
you won't be able to beat him.

90
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
Alright. I'll follow your lead.

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,560
What should we do?

92
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,920
Get him.

93
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,770
Get him!

94
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,620
Okay.

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Old man.

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Wanna play chess with me again?

97
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
Come sit.

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,840
You took over Chongguang's company

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
because Chongming asked you to, right?

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,360
Chongming is

101
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,480
quite simple-minded.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,000
Not much malice in him.

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,720
So you don't dislike him.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you implying

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
that future business

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840
is all mine now?

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,480
You're familiar with the site,

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
but company operations are different.

109
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,440
Look,

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,000
Chongguang has a company

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,680
that's always losing money.

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,520
If you can achieve

113
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,560
the half-year target in two weeks,

114
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
the project will be yours.

115
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
Wait.

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,040
Why give me a failing company?

117
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
Alright. Forget it.

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,360
Pretend I was never here today.

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,480
I'll leave you to it.

120
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
That brat.

121
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,480
What?

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Not a penny earned this half year.

123
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm doing better than you.

124
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,280
All the business was with Chongguang.

125
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,960
Since you came, he...

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,040
I have to ask.

127
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,400
Are you two real brothers?

128
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,320
Look at him,

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,160
now look at you.

130
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Little Brother.

131
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
Don't worry.

132
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
I'll try my best from now on.

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Do you believe that?

134
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,680
Legal Boy!

135
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
Didn't you say

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,400
you only wanted to work at the site?

137
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
My Lady,

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
why are you here?

139
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
President Lu,

140
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
you're here for...

141
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
I heard

142
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,840
you're trying to straighten out some mess.

143
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm here

144
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
to help you out.

145
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
President Lu,

146
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,840
our business here

147
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
is quite simple,

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,280
so no need to trouble Lu Group.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Legal Boy,

150
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
let's go for a walk.

151
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
We have work to do.

152
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,240
Legal Boy,

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,000
you promised me.

154
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,880
He also promised Zhang Chongming

155
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,760
to complete Chongguang's tasks.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Legal Boy,

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,080
are you listening to Wu Xiaomeng

158
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,640
or me?

159
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,360
Uh...

160
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
Ladies...

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Wu Xiaomeng,

162
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,320
do you like Legal Boy?

163
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,240
It's none of your business.

164
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
Who you like

165
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
is none of my business.

166
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
However,

167
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
if that person is Legal Boy,

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,560
it does concern me.

169
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,680
I never intended to compete with you.

170
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,040
What's mine

171
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,240
is mine.

172
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,360
You just can't take

173
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
what's not yours.

174
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,950
Gouwa.

175
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
Busy now!

176
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,400
A big order's coming in.
