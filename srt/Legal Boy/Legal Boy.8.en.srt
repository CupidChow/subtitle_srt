3
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,160
You're awake.

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,530
Did you forget

5
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,730
what you did to me last night?

6
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,300
What did I do?

7
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
You don't wanna be responsible?

8
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,400
It's not that.

9
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,800
I have my clothes on.

10
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,930
No way.

11
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,900
You did.

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,260
How is that possible?

13
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,170
You definitely did.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,130
My Lady.

15
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,100
Miss Lu.

16
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,500
Well,

17
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,370
madam.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,240
Look.

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,578
If I really did anything to you,

20
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:50,660
you could call the police.

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,660
Do whatever you want.

22
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,930
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,600
I wouldn't.

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
For last night.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,700
Right.

26
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,700
I got an emergency.

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,860
I have to go now.

28
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,130
Or I'll be late.

29
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,600
Gotta go.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
Legal Boy.

31
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,170
Uh,

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,700
this is the contract Fang Tuo gave me.

33
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,740
I can't understand it.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Can you take a look?

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
The contract says

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,130
we have to use his designated supplier.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,100
But this supplier is horrible.

38
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,530
He's clearly setting you up.

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,540
What should we do?

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,930
We can't accept this.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
My men need to start working.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,930
Why are you covering your face?

43
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,170
Toothache?

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
I don't have a toothache.

45
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,860
Then why cover your face?

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,360
Tell me the truth.

47
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,730
I drank too much

48
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,500
last night.

49
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,570
Then,

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,800
Lu Jinling held me still.

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,600
And then…

52
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,930
She kissed me.

53
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,000
Were you happy?

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Happy?

55
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,460
No, no.

56
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,330
I wasn't.

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,260
And then?

58
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,300
Nothing.

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,700
That's it.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,860
Tell me the truth.

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm telling the truth.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,860
Definitely nothing else.

63
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,660
Who is it?

64
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Old man.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,660
This site is off-limits to outsiders.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,900
Who are you?

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,210
Maybe soon,

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
I won't be an outsider anymore.

69
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,970
President Lu.

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,380

President Lu.

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,000
Why are you here?

74
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,330
This young man

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,560
wants to teach me chess.

76
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,960
So I decided

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,600
to invest more as tuition fees.

78
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,770
Sir,

79
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,130
you might not know,

80
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
Mr. Fang's supplier

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,200
is out of my league.

82
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,300
Right?

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
So,

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,740
Mr. Fang,

85
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,740
let's cooperate

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,300
if there's a chance in the future.

87
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,260
Take care.

88
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,860
Just show yourself out.

89
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,740
Mr. Fang.

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,000
What's wrong?

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,060
You tell me.

92
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,160
Wasn't it temporary?

93
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
You'd use my team, right?

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,330
I went to the site today.

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,600
Lu Jue was there.

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,400
He said to cooperate next time.

97
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,100
Isn't that undermining me?

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,300
What?

99
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,970
Legal Boy!

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,330
You dared act on your own,
ignoring the company rules.

101
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,730
I'm in charge of the site now.

102
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,860
Contracts don't matter.

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,860
Without a contract, how do you pay wages?

104
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Lu Group.

105
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Don't you know the old man always
wanted to work with them?

106
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
What now?

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Got a problem with that?

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,900
Legal Boy.

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Just you wait.

110
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,900
Dad,

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,300
you can't let him goofing around.

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,330
Legal Boy's construction team

113
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
doesn't follow the rules at all.

114
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,570
Fang Finance Group

115
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,700
is also one of our site's investors.

116
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,600
Is it worth offending them

117
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:40,700
over such a small matter?

118
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,130
Then,

119
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,860
handle this officially.

120
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,130
You have to earn it.

121
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,936
Start an official bidding.

122
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,170
Legal Boy.

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
Hold on.

124
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,330
Why are you here?

125
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,770
I heard

126
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,130
they'll tender for the construction team.

127
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm here to help you.

128

129
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,060
If I

130
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,130
help you,

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
what can you help me with?

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,800
Miss Lu,

133
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,800
shall we

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,130
make a deal?

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,930
A deal?

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,360
Tell me more.

137
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,736
If you can help me find the culprit,

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,060
I'll give you the entire Zhang Family.

139
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,530
Are you sure

140
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,330
you can get over 50% of Dongcan's shares?

141
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,360
Besides,

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
you'll betray your family.

143
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm not part of the Zhangs.

144
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,330
Once I find the culprit,

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,130
and it's resolved,

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,930
I'll have nothing

147
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,130
to do with them.

148
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,930
You want to find the culprit?

149
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,200
Yes.

150
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,500
Can you help me?

151
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,970
What if

152
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,760
I get you in trouble?

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,400
probably

155
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,900
won't, right?

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
Secretary Wu?

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,260
Why are you here?

158
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,660
I brought you some food.

159
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,900
Thanks.

160
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,460
Next time, let's meet alone.

161
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,400
She just

162
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,860
came over

163
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
to discuss something.

164
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,960
The proposal needs more details.

165
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,130
Come over

166
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,100
once you're done.

167
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,170
I'll get rid

168
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,460
of that mutt sooner or later.

169
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,930
This is their proposal.

170
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Take a look.

171
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,860
Even with Lu Group backing them,

172
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,530
he can't lower the price that much.

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,560
Our quote

174
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,860
is half of theirs.

Chairman Zhang,

178
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,860
aren't you too biased towards your son?

Our quote

180

is half of Legal Boy's

Why did they win the bid in the end?

182
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
Mr. Fang,

183
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,830
we received a report

184
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,060
that your supplier has a shady past.

Fang Tuo's bid was half ours.

Low price

190
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,530
probably means quality issues.

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,660
but the accident rate is high.

198
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,060
And they often redo work.

199
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,860
Who would dare hire such a team?

200
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,030
Quality is crucial in real estate.

201
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,060
Do I need to remind you of that?

202
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,700
Sir,

203
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,200
we owe you for your help this time.

204
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,760
The Kanglan Bay project

205
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,460
is indeed a profitable venture.

206
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,460
I won't take advantage of you.

207
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,460
I heard from Jinling

208
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,000
that you're investigating a case.

209
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,730
Here's some advice for you.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm listening.

211
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,060
A missing person

212
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,530
might be dead.

213
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
And a missing vehicle…

214
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,860
It's totaled!

215
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
That's right.

216
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,400
Sir,

217
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,460
thank you.

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,530
Let's go. Hurry.

219
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,570
Gouwa.

220
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,400
Come here.

221
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,240
Look.

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Xiaomeng,

223
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:55,760
can you grab it for me?

224
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,600
Xiaomeng.

225
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,170
This is it.

226
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,170
Right.

227
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,380
The card.

228
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
Give me a business card.

229
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,460
(Dongcan Group)

230
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,760
Dongcan Group?

231
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,500
Xiaomeng,

232
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,040
let's go.

233
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
Get out of here.
