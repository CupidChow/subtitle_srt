=Episode 4=

3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Dad,

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,360
this red wine has a special flavor.

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,200
It tastes like tobacco

6
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,560
when you drink it.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,960
Brother,

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
it does taste good.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,760
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Legal Boy,

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,360
stand up now!

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,080
Get out.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,720
Did you hear?

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,920
Dad told you to get out.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm telling you to get out.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
Me?

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,840
Gouwa,

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,980
we're like

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,040
friends after a fight.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,520
Here's to you.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,280
Legal Boy,

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,400
isn't this wine a waste for you?

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Get something else.

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,640
In our place, we drink baijiu

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,080
with a prize.

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,960
Otherwise, it's not enjoyable.

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,640
Prize?

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
Okay,

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,280
if you finish this bottle of baijiu,

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll agree to one of your requests.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
Alright.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
If I finish this bottle,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,920
Zhang Chongguang,

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,960
you'll have to admit that you're a loser

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,280
in front of everyone.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
If you can't finish it,

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
get out

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,440
of this room.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Fine.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm done.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Brother.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
You loser.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
If you want to keep your position

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,760
as the heir,

45
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,160
Lu Jinling is the key.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
Don't worry, Uncle.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,800
I won't be as reckless
as Zhang Chongguang.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
They're just girls.

49
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
I know them.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
Lu Jinling.

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,120
Let's work together.

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,320
- As long as we work together...
- I never work

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,920
with losers.

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
Let go.

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,080
Don't be unreasonable.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,440
Say that again.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
She said

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,800
let go.

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,600
Hands off.

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,760
Legal Boy,

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,800
who do you think you are?

62
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
If it weren't for me,

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,500
you'd still be working
at the construction site.

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,840
You should be grateful to me.

65
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
Zhang Chongguang,

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll say it one last time.

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,360
Take your filthy hands off.

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
You Zhang Family are a bunch of losers.

69
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm truly fed up.

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Ouch!

71
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
I saved you.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
Why did you hit me?

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,880
Did I ask for your help?

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
I wanted to take it out

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,720
on that stupid Zhang Chongguang.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,840
Not only did you ruin my fun,

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
you even tore my skirt.

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,280
Then you've beaten

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,400
and scolded me.

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm leaving.

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Hey,

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
stop there.

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,120
What's wrong now?

84
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,040
How dare you

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
leave me here alone?

86
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,320
Brother,

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
is it done?

88
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,720
Lu Jinling is not a woman

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
to be messed with.

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,680
Brother, do you think
Lu Jinling will get involved

91
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,840
with that little migrant worker?

92
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
What happened again?

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,520
We can't go on like this.

94
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I'll go find Gouwa.

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,720
He's in a different position now.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,880
What's going on?

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,470
Didn't they replace
the construction elevator a while ago?

98
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,240
We didn't realize
they were all second-hand

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
and had a higher failure rate.

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
He's the third one to fall and get hurt.

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,520
Dash it.

102
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,760
I'll go find Sun Laoliu.

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,480
Sun Laoliu!

104
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Sun Laoliu,

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm asking you,

106
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
the equipment is outdated,

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,690
why replace it with a second-hand one?

108
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,800
Gouwa,

109
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,560
I can't decide on such a big deal.

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,680
You can't decide?

111
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
Then tell me. Who can make the decision?

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
Gouwa,

113
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,800
it's true
that you're Zhang Family's son.

114
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,760
But this is a different matter.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,960
What happens on the construction site
doesn't depend on what we say.

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,560
Besides, you have no authority here.

117
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,920
- You...
- Legal Boy,

118
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,720
you are not an employee of the Group.

119
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,000
According to the rules,

120
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,380
you have no right to interfere
in anything of the company,

121
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,920
including equipment procurement.

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,760
I don't believe that

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,400
if I don't enter the Dongcan Group,

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
there can be lawless construction sites.

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,080
I want justice for my men!

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Sun Laoliu,

127
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,360
just wait here.

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,040
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,040
Legal Boy and Wu Xiaomeng were here.

130
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,500
(Rebar Processing Shed)

131
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,100
(Protective equipment, no damage)

132
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
This is the elevator

133
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
that broke down.

134
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,840
I can't let my men get hurt again.

135
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,000
Where is Dashui?

136
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Where is Xia Dashui? Come out!

137
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,520
Secretary Wu,

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
wait for me a moment.

139
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,440
Dashui isn't here.

140
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Who are you?

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
I told you, he's not here.

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
What's going on?

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,120
These two are looking for Dashui.

144
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,600
They seem to want a debt.

145
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,040
How much does he owe you?

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
What now?

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,440
Can you pay it for him?

148
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,320
Cut the crap

149
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,400
and tell me the amount.

150
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Save it!

151
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm telling you, this is one...

152
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,310
Ouch!

153
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
Let's talk this over.

154
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Stop!

155
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,760
Boss.

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,700
(Ms. Hong,
Boss of Debt Collection Company)

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,480
Young man, you're quite skilled.

158
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,200
He paid back 170,000

159
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,920
and still owes 150,000 with interest.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
You must be
Dongcan's Third Young Master.

161
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,880
I know a lot about Dongcan.

162
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
As a favor to you,

163
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,320
pay off the debt with interest.

164
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,840
This has nothing to do with Dongcan.

165
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
I'll find a way
to repay Xia Dashui's debt.

166
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,120
I'll take the contract

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,560
with me.

168
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,120
You're quite righteous.

169
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,040
By the way, Legal Boy,

170
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
if you can't stay in Dongcan,

171
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,520
consider coming to my place.

172
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,640
Thanks.

173
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,080
(Legal Boy,)

174
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,440
(we'll meet again.)
