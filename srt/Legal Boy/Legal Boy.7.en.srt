Word came in

3
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
the construction is stopped.

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,000
What?

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,920
Stopped?

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,080
I heard an investor pulled out.

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,400
Let's go.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,040
Old man,

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
answer me.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,480
Why is the project on hold?

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,520
Come on.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,680
Join me for a game of chess.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,280
No. I'm not in the mood.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,315
Your project's on hold.

15
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:10,200
What about my workers?

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,360
Where's Fang Tuo?

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,360
I'll go find him.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,680
You're too reckless.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,720
It might be used by others.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,200
Without knowing your opponent well,

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,200
rushing in is very risky.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,280
Forget it. I'm leaving.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,000
We agreed

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,160
to give me the project.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,600
(Fang Tuo, CEO of Fang Finance Group)
Now you want Kanglan Bay back.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
- I'm worried...
- Don't worry.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
It's just temporary.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,040
If Legal Boy's team can't start working,

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,680
he'll come back to you.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
Then,

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,600
we'll be still in charge.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,800
Alright.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
With your words, I'm relieved.

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm a bit tight on cash recently,

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,640
so I'll just pull out.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
Gouwa, did you ask?

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,160
When can we start working?

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,040
There's hardly any food at home.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,585
We're counting on my salary.

40
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:06,040
We thought with you as the foreman,

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,080
you'd have our backs.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,960
But turns out, you're no better.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
Now we can't even afford a meal.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,880
How can you say that?

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,360
When Legal Boy brought the wine,

46
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:14,520
you didn't drink any less.

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,440
When I'm drunk,

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,280
the worst I do is spout some nonsense.

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,840
But look at Li Gouwa.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
He suddenly got himself

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,880
a rich daddy out of nowhere.

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
We cannot

53
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
compete with that.

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,000
Drink up, Lili.

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,100
(Lili, Club Owner)
Mr. Fang.

56
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
Isn't this

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,960
Mr. Li?

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,640
Mr. Fang,

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,160
there's something

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
I want your help with.

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
What can I do for you?

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
Mr. Fang,

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
please don't

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,520
pull your funding.

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,920
Just do me a favor.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Well, well, well.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,680
The dignified Mr. Li.

68
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,560
Beg me.

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,520
Like, "Mr. Fang,

70
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,800
can you please not pull your funding?"

71
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
Coward.

72
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,160
He backed off.

73
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,170
Mr. Fang,

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm begging you.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,850
Please don't pull your funding.

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
Help me.

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Well done!

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
I heard Mr. Li

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
is a good drinker.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
Not enough.

81
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,360
If you want my help, be sincere.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
If you don't want me to pull out,

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
you must

84
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
finish this.

85
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
Whiskey with beer.

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
This could be deadly.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Mr. Fang,

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
maybe you shouldn't.

89
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,160
Mr. Li

90
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,120
is no ordinary man.

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,920
Mr. Fang,

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
I finished the drink.

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
Will you keep your word?

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,400
Let's sign the contract

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,840
tomorrow at noon.

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
Deal.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,640
No turning back.

98
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Alright.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
I trust you.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,280
It's you?

101
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,230
Just now,

102
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,000
thank you for your help.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
It's nothing.

104
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,960
I've seen such scenes

105
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,160
many times.

106
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,640
I don't know you.

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
Why did you help me?

108
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,400
My name is Lili,

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
the owner of this club.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
Now,

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
you do.

112
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
We'll meet again.

113
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
Legal Boy?

114
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,205
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Lu...

116
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
You've been drinking?

117
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,280
And quite a lot too.

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm not drunk.
