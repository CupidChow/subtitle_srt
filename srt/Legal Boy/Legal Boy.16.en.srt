Come with me

3
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,240
to meet

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
my set-up date.

5
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,720
No way. That's inappropriate.

6
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,090
- Are you going?
- Wait.

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Wait, My Lady,

8
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,100
I...

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll go. I'll go.

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,840
I'll go.

11
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,130
I'll go.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,480
Let me go get changed.

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,360
Is he

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,920
Miss Lu's

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,960
friend?

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,760
Not just a friend.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,680
Boyfriend.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,560
As far as I know,

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,400
Miss Lu seems to be single.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Mr. Li, what do you do for a living?

21
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:32,840
I work at a construction site.

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,760
Well, well, well.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
A blue collar?

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
It must be toilful, right?

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,360
Let me introduce myself.

26
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:40,560
I'm nothing special, but

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,320
high school, college,

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,440
grad school, and PhD

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,920
were all done in the States.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,480
You know Ivy League?

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,480
After graduation,

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,600
I worked in Wall Street as...

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,440
Stop.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Has your grandpa lost his mind?

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,600
Why'd he set you up with this guy?

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,120
Who knows?

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,440
Mr. Li, Miss Lu,

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,840
your behavior is quite rude.

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,880
- Okay?
- Cut it out.

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,920
Say what you came to say.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,080
I'm very busy.

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Miss Lu,

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,160
I came to this date with sincerity.

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
Why bring this loser here?

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,040
I handle millions every moment.

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
Can he even compare to me?

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
Do you know

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
who he is?

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Who is he?

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,840
Who could have more power than my family?

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
- Unless...
- Unless...

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,320
He's the third young master of Dongcan Group,

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Legal Boy.

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,640
The major shareholder
of your so-called company.

55
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,670
Li...

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
- You scared him.
- Li...

57
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,170
Master Li.

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Hold on.

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm not Master Li.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
So boring.

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,960
Let's go have a drink.

62
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,050
Li...

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,280
You can't hold it well. Why drink so much?

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
More booze.

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,560
Don't leave.

66
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,240
Stay over tonight.

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,440
My Lady,

68
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,350
don't be like this.

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Legal Boy,

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
do you

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
like me?

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,600
What about Wu Xiaomeng?

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
Do you like her?

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
I have plans.

75
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm off.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
Bye.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Good night.

78
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,680
Hey, why so many books again?

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,760
You need to finish these first.

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,960
Otherwise, how will you manage Dongcan?

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,120
But there are too many.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,960
I haven't finished the last batch.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,520
Why are there so many again?

84
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,750
You must read them.

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,680
No, let's just pick a few.

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
I'll choose.

87
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,410
No way.

88
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Managing a site is no joke.

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,660
It's too much.

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,390
I'm getting a headache from this.

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,040
You need to finish these.

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,400
Dashui, you can't do that.

93
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,320
Yeah, you can't do it that way.

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
It's inappropriate.

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,080
How can you do that?

96
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,120
What's going on?

97
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,040
This batch has quality issues.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
But Mr. Xia insists we use it.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,960
Who will take responsibility

100
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,240
if something goes wrong?

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,080
Just

102
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,640
return this batch.

103
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
I'll be responsible for any issues.

104
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Get back to work.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,960
Dashui.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Did you order

107
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,720
this batch?

108
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Were you tricked?

109
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,680
How about this?

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,360
Ask me if you're ever unsure.

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
Don't you trust me?

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Dashui,

113
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,880
you...

114
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,680
What are you talking about?

115
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,000
We're like brothers.

116
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm just looking out for you.

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
Fine.

118
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,760
You're the boss, it's your call.

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Dashui. Dashui.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,680
Xia Dashui's sudden appearance

121
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
is quite fishy.

122
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
What's fishy about him?

123
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
He just doesn't get it.

124
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,280
When I first joined the site,

125
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,240
I knew nothing either.

126
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,080
Will you cover for him every time?

127
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Gouwa, I know you're faithful,

128
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,440
but someone's targeting you.

129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Helping him won't work,

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
and you'll put yourself at risk.

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,680
- Do you understand?
- Wu Xiaomeng!

132
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,320
He got his limp saving my life.

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Do you know what that means?

134
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
Xiaomeng...

135
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,280
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
I shouldn't have interfered.

137
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,950
Xiaomeng.

138
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
Hello?

139
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,120
Will the old man really pay this money?

140
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,980
I've bet everything I have on this.

141
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Don't worry.

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,960
He will pay for it.

143
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Contact Fang Tuo.

144
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720
I need to talk to him.

145
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,080
Grandpa,

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,720
are you planning

147
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
to take over FFG?

148
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,840
Such a good project,

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
how can we let others have it?

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
But Grandpa,

151
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,640
have you thought it through?

152
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,440
Such a big acquisition

153
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,120
will affect the group's cash flow.

154
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
If something goes wrong,

155
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,000
wouldn't

156
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,680
Lu Group collapse?

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,200
Fang Finance Group

158
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
indeed has several

159
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
projects that could bring

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,720
substantial profits to Lu Group.

161
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,040
Compared to the profits we'll gain later,

162
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,040
what we invest now

163
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,140
is quite minimal.

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
Liu.

165
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,850
What's wrong?

166
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,920
Dashui, take a look.

167
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,720
These are not right.

168
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,240
How come?

169
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,880
They're disqualified.

170
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
Ridiculous.

171
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:16,520
Think you know better?

172
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,600
No, I need Gouwa to check it.

173
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,510
Liu,

174
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
you're fired.

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,960
- What did you say?
- I said you're fired.

176
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
Get out of here. Now!

177
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,660
Always talking nonsense.

178
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,760
Wait.

179
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,320
They're not qualified.

180
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,710
Mr. Zhang,

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
you're here early.

182
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,120
The dishes aren't ready yet.

183
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,380
Got the money from the supplier?

184
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,450
Yes, I got it.

185
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,040
- That's good.
- Thank you, sir.

186
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,560
I never knew

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
you could make money hand over fist

188
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,680
just by purchasing materials.

189
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,730
No need to thank me.

190
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,080
You truly deserve this.

191
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,560
I must thank you for your guidance.

192
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,880
That's why things went smoothly.

193
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
Here, Mr. Zhang.

194
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,000
Dashui.

195
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
Do you want to be like Legal Boy?

196
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,420
Me?

197
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,280
I don't think I can.

198
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,330
Well,

199
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,850
I don't have a rich dad.

200
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,560
Of course, you can't do it alone.

201
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
But you have me.

202
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,710
Thank you, sir.

203
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,560
I'll toast you with tea.

204
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
Looking forward to your performance.

205
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,960
Alright.

206
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Xiaomeng, what's up?

207
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
Gouwa, something's wrong.

208
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,240
QA found some issues.

209
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,180
What?
