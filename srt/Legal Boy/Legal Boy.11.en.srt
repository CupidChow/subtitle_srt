00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,400
What are you doing?

(Dongcan Group)

5
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,920
Aren't we having a meeting?

6
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,360
Where is everyone?

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,800
Brother,

8
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,080
the video of you offering bribes

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,080
has been spreading.

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,160
Now,

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,200
everyone knows about it.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,080
Mr. Chen,

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,000
you know how much my dad favors me.

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,440
If you help me this time,

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
I will definitely...

16
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:34,632
Mr. Guo,

17
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:35,680
you're a senior in the company.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,160
My dad will surely listen to you.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,920
I'll transfer the usual amount to you.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,160
Legal Boy.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Dad agreed to see me?

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Dad,

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,340
I've learned my lessons.

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,339
(Kanglan International Airlines)
Leave.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Please don't send me away.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
Dad,

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,560
can't he stay?

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Dad,

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
I understand

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,760
that if I'm staying,

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,880
it'll have a bad impact on Dongcan.

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,280
But I really don't want to leave.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,640
Chongguang,

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,560
you are the eldest son of our family.

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,000
Dongcan should have been yours.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,480
But you're too competitive.

37
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,560
It made you lose your sense and judgment.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
You should

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
live well abroad.

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,560
Brother.

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Take care.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm off.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
Hello?

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
Chongrui,

45
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,480
the deal went through.

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
How do you want to celebrate?

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,160
Thanks for your help.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,720
Do you have time later?

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,240
Book a private room for me.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
Alright.

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,160
See you later.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
See you.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Got it.

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll hang up now.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Legal Boy.

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
Legal Boy,

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,280
I lost everything

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,960
because of you.

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
I shouldn't have

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
brought you back.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Zhang Chongguang,

62
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,320
you want to fight, huh?

63
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,660
Hey!

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,880
That's enough.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Calm down now.

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Let's talk it out properly.

67
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,230
Zhang Chongguang,

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll say it one last time.

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,220
I didn't send the video.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
It wasn't you?

71
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,880
First,

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm not like you people,

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,440
saying one thing and doing another.

74
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,020
Second,

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,320
I don't even know where the TV station is,

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
how could I send it?

77
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,310
If it wasn't you,

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,170
who could it be?

79
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,880
I deleted the video when I got Xiaomeng out.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,400
You didn't hurt Xia Dashui,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
why would I come after you?

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,280
You know it's not me?

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
Of course I know.

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Zhang Chongguang,

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
I'm impulsive,

86
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,760
not stupid.

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,840
You just want to use me

88
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,520
to mess with Zhang Chongrui,

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
but I also know

90
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,960
you don't intend to take me down.

91
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Then why did you...

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Who started the fight?

93
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,680
By the way,

94
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,040
I've wanted to ask you something.

95
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,280
How did you know I was at the site?

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,520
Someone sent me a letter.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,360
It had your paternity test inside

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
and your workplace address.

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
Who sent it?

100
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,960
I don't know.

101
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,440
Congratulations, Chongrui.

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
You took down your biggest rival.

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,880
It's all thanks

104
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,640
to you, honey.

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,160
Well,

106
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
let's celebrate our partnership.

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,240
Honey,

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
I can give you money,

109
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,360
status,

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,760
and myself.

111
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,000
I just want status.

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,320
I've heard

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,200
quite a lot of rumors

114
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
about you.

115
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,760
Here's to a successful cooperation.

116
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Cheers.

117
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Chongming,

118
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm leaving tomorrow.

119
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
From now on,

120
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,200
you need to grow up.

121
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,620
Brother,

122
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
I understand.

123
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,520
After I leave,

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,120
take good care

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
of the family

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
and the company.

127
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Sorry about that.
