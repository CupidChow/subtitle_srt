00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,100
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,200
Xiaomeng, what's up?

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,480
Gouwa, something's wrong.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,040
QA found some issues.

6
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,890
What?

7
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,170
Wait for me.

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,280
I'll hang up now. Talk soon.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
Hello?

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,840
Dashui, where are you?

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm at the karaoke bar.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,240
What did you say?

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,600
I'm drinking

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,790
at the karaoke bar.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,240
- Your choice is the best.
- Come on.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,200
Great choice for drinks.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Drink up.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,240
Xia Dashui.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,600
What do you want?

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,650
Xia Dashui!

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,800
You two, get out.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Gouwa?

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,680
- Come here.
- You two, get out.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
Come here.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,200
- Let's drink.
- Get off!

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,640
- What's wrong?
- Answer me.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
Did you change the cement and steel?

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,040
Those suppliers were

29
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,120
- overpriced.
- Overpriced?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Let me ask you:

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,480
Why did you fire Liu?

32
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,810
Well,

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,360
you put me in charge of the site.

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,400
If I don't show them who's boss,

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,640
how will I control things

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,840
- when they act up?
- Xia Dashui,

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
I never thought

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
that one day, you'd change

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
and be like Sun Laoliu.

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,320
I changed?

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,400
I'm not like you.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,680
I've no rich dad.

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,840
If I want to succeed,

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,200
I have to rely on myself.

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,640
Look, now I have money,

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,240
and women like me.

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,930
Even though

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,360
I'm crippled.

49
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,560
Being rich

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,520
is fantastic.

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
It is.

52
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Dashui.

53
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,320
Is money

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,920
- so important to you?
- Yes!

55
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,320
Very important.

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,960
For money,

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,680
I'd risk my life.

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Xia Dashui,

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
if given another chance,

60
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,840
would you still save me?

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Dad,

62
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,470
I checked with the Quality Inspection.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,920
The materials are fine.

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Gouwa,

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
you're experienced.

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,310
How could that happen?

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
Dad,

68
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,120
it's my fault.

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm taking responsibility.

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,040
Can you afford to take it?

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Dad,

72
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,940
I had the workers dismantle and rebuild.

73
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,120
However,

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,120
the delivery might be delayed.

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,240
You're suspended for now.

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,520
Leave your work to Chongrui.

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
Dad.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Mr. Zhang.

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
- Sit.
- Okay.

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,140
Mr. Zhang,

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,470
is it going smoothly?

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,640
- Yes.
- Good.

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Thanks to you.

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,280
It's my honor.

85
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Mr. Zhang.

86
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,300
So,

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,320
about

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,800
the money

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,760
and the shares

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,720
you promised...

91
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,400
When am I going to see that?

92
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,640
I even

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,800
betrayed my friends for you.

94
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,810
Dashui.

95
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm curious about one thing.

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
Why does Legal Boy

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
treat you as a friend?

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,200
You even betray your best friend

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,280
and you dare to negotiate with me?

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
You lied to me.

101
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,980
That's right.

102
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
You liar.

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
Fine.

104
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,000
Very well.

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
Then,

106
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,360
you leave me no choice.

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,600
Mr. Zhang.

108
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,160
I'll reveal

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
what you asked me to do.

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,880
If you mess with me,

111
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,240
you won't have it easy either.

112
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,480
Perfect.

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
You're doomed.

114
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,320
Dashui.

115
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
You won't get away with it.

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
That's good.

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,400
I remember

118
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,640
you got a broken leg, right?

119
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,760
Next time, it'll be your life.

120
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,120
Just kidding.

121
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Come on.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
Have some water.

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
Just kidding.

124
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,100
(Project Management Process)

125
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,220
(Pawn)

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
What are you doing here?

127
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
To laugh at me?

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,880
Dashui.

129
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
What's your plan?

130
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,960
Where would you go?

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
I don't know.

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
But don't worry.

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,920
I'll get out of your sight.

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Buddy,

135
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,600
do you remember?

136
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,120
Six months ago,

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
we worked

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,800
during the day,

139
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
and after work,

140
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,400
we played chess

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
and chat together.

142
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,030
We argued over a few hundred bucks

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,000
with Sun Laoliu,

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
trying to outsmart each other,

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
fighting tooth and nail.

146
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,320
Life was a bit plain,

147
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,520
but that time

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
was the happiest of my life.

149
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,440
Do you remember?

150
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,250
When I

151
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,600
first arrived in this city back then,

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,280
if I hadn't met you,

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,600
I would've starved to death.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,440
That moment, I knew,

155
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,320
you are my friend for life.

156
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't care about what the Zhangs gave me.

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,040
I only care about my buddies.

158
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,400
These are

159
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,280
my savings from the past two years

160
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,240
of working here.

161
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
You have to take it.

162
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,360
It's not for you.

163
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
It's for your boy.

164
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,600
When you see him,

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
make sure to tell him

166
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,000
not to be like us.

167
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
He must be educated.

168
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,250
Alright.

169
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,640
Gotta go.

170
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,200
Please,

171
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,640
take care of yourself.

172
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Gouwa.

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,960
If I'd known they wanted your life,

174
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,160
I wouldn't have taken the money.

175
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Forgive me.

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
Being your friend in this life

177
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,520
is my blessing.

178
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,850
Bye.

179
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,200
This is the last time I'm helping you.

180
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,880
After this,

181
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,960
stop sending me packages.

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Sir, about the acquisition price

183
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,840
of Fang Finance Group,

184
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
I want to discuss it with you.

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,800
As long as you agree,

186
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,280
I'll proceed immediately.

187
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,120
Okay.

188
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,770
Hello?

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
Please help me send a package.

190
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,240
Grandpa,

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,800
the bank has

192
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
approved the loan.

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
But,

194
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,320
are you going to mortgage

195
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
all our assets?

196
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,400
Jinling,

197
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,040
I have sources of information.

198
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Don't worry about it.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
We must

200
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,640
strike

201
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
(Cannon)
and hit it.

202
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,240
But what if it fails?

203
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,040
No worries. It won't.

204
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
Jinling,

205
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,120
I have a guest

206
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,520
coming over.

207
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,040
Please give us some privacy.

208
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,160
President Lu.
