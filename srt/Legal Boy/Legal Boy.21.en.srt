00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,860
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,360
You scared me!

4
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
When did you come?

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,960
Why were you so quiet?

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,520
Where's my stuff?

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,400
Cat got your tongue?

8
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Mr. Zhang

9
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
sent his regards.

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,600
What regards?

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
Liu!

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,000
Fang Tuo,

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,600
tell me.

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,480
Where's the money? Hand it over!

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,720
What money?

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,920
Drop your act.

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
Do you believe I'll hit you?

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,600
I'll get it.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Gosh.

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,440
I knew I couldn't escape.

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
What's wrong?

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,320
Where's my money?

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,960
Fang Tuo, stop pretending.

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm not pretending.

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
Zhang Chongrui.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
It must be Zhang Chongrui.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,179
(Account Balance)
He transferred my money.

28
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:15,040
It must be.

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh my!

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,080
How could you give him the money?

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,400
- I didn't give him the money.
- Fang Tuo.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Call the police.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,710
You can still get it back.

34
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,120
Impossible.

35
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,200
It's been days already.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,520
He got it perfectly composed.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,800
It's probably long gone by now.

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,030
Where can I find him?

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,200
Think hard.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
- Too late. No.
- Just

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
think of his accomplices.

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
Anyone he trusts?

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,200
- Think.
- No one.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
I…

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,320
Yes.

46
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,200
There's someone, but I'm not sure.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Who?

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
A woman.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
Maybe his mistress.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,070
I think she's his accountant.

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
What does she look like?

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
She looks…

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,360
Pretty average.

54
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,370
Wears glasses.

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,160
- That's it.
- Chongming.

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's go.

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
Come with me. Now!

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Who is she?

59
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,080
Get my money back.

60
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
As usual.

61
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,640
Take a cab home yourself.

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
Can't you give me a ride just once?

63
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,000
Just this once.

64
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,100
Come on.

65
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,130
Be good.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,040
Move.

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
Alright. Don't worry.

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
I've taken care of everything.

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Chongrui,

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,520
when will we meet again?

71
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,930
I'm not betraying Chongrui.

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
Did he say to you

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
that he would marry you,

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
and only love you?

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,520
That others are just a game?

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
He said that to everyone.

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,280
That's impossible.

78
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,570
As usual.

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,970
Take a cab home yourself.

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,640
Can't you give me a ride just once?

81
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,000
Just this once.

82
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,040
Chongrui.

83
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,710
Impossible.

84
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,120
Chongrui.

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,120
I'll take you down!

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,400
Chongrui.

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,560
Jinling, you look

88
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,390
great today.

89
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,200
You want it rough?

90
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,920
What's it to you?

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
It was for her.

92
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,520
Girls, get him!

93
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,730
Take that!

94
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,510
Let's go.
