=Episode 5=

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Dashui,

4
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,240
sorry to get you involved.

5
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,840
I swear,

6
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,320
I'll find the person who hurt you.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,480
I asked the guys.

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
There's new equipment at the site.

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Sun Laoliu deducts our salaries monthly.

10
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,160
And the equipment is second-hand.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,280
Where did the money go?

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,080
Someone's in charge
of equipment procurement.

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,760
That person

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,120
is named Zhou Quan.

15
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,460
(Zhou Quan, Equip Procurement Manager)
Zhou Quan,

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,900
trying to fool me
with the second-hand?

17
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,380
Look at these two invoices.

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,580
They are identical.

19
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,060
Were those requested by Sun Laoliu?

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,740
Sun Laoliu?

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,140
Sun Laoliu?

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,740
Are you hiding something?

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,380
Are you afraid of me?

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,780
Answer me,

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,020
why use this kind of equip?

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,100
The higher-ups said,

27
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,380
we must take costs into account.

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,380
Besides, it works, right?

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,260
Does it?

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,260
Mr. Li,

31
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,820
I'm a nobody in the company.

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,220
My words are useless.

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,860
Really. Completely useless.

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,450
I can't make decisions.

35
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,290
Get out.

36
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,500
Hurry up!

37
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,340
Those two are in cahoots.

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,860
You're not gonna get anywhere

39
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,740
digging like that.

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,460
Who is it?

41
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,260
What's going on?

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,460
Someone owes you money again?

43
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,100
Heard you're in trouble recently.

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
Wanna turn the table?

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,540
What do you mean?

46
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,460
I'll help you deal with Zhou Quan.

47
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,980
You help me?

48
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,860
What's in it for you?

49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,620
You impressed me.

50
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,100
Consider it settling a bad debt.

51
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,070
I mentioned before,

52
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,220
I know everything about Dongcan.

53
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,540
Are you implying

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,100
that the enemy of an enemy

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,940
is a friend?

56
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,850
Here.

57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,460
Consider this my investment.

58
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,820
What's this?

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,660
The evidence of Zhou Quan
taking kickbacks over the years.

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,820
It has the supplier accounts

61
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,380
and transfer records in it.

62
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,260
Let's have a drink.

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,260
Uh...

64
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,110
Thank you.

65
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,660
Kinda busy. I have to go.

66
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,900
Such a fool.

67
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,420
Hello.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,380
Mr. Zhou.

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,460
Mr. Zhou,

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,660
that's outrageous.

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,180
If he gets the evidence,

72
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,260
we're doomed.

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,980
Don't panic.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,620
I have a plan.

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,420
Why hasn't Legal Boy shown up?

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,060
Messing with my brother?

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,340
It's time.

78
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,260
Let's go find him.

79
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,770
Legal Boy,

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,620
hand over the stuff right now.

81
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,180
Sun Laoliu,

82
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,060
you're asking for it.

83
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,020
Get out of the car.

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,140
Brothers,

85
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,980
get him!

86
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,380
Sun Laoliu,

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,140
you got guts.

88
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,340
What are you waiting for?

89
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,180
Go get him.

90
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
Stop!

91
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,060
(Hall 4)

92
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
Go.

93
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,230
I've lured them here.

94
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,580
They're yours now.

95
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,460
Go.

96
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
Go.

97
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,220
Go!

98
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,780
Mr. Li.

99
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,180
Where are you going?

100
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,340
Good thing I planned ahead.

101
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,700
I knew Sun Laoliu couldn't be trusted.

102
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,620
Zhou Quan, none of your business.

103
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,500
Stay out of it.

104
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,220
Those who block my path

105
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,740
never have a good ending.

106
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,740
What a loco.

107
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,540
- Ms. Hong.
- Ms. Hong.

108
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,260
You traitors,

109
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,060
secretly tipping off Zhou Quan.

110
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,100
Do you think I've no idea?

111
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,340
You'd better watch it.

112
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,698
- Ms. Hong.
- Ms. Hong.

113
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,100
We owe you big time.

114
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,780
- We're sorry.
- Please forgive us.

115
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,860
We'll serve you loyally.

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,540
Go. Take him away.

117
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,650
Alright.

118
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,100
Thank you.

119
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,300
No problem.

120
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,730
Move.

121
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,780
Go.

122
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,180
Do it.

123
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,660
Mr. Luo,

124
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,540
got the money?

125
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm gonna need you

126
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,020
to keep looking out for me.
