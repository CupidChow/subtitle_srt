00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
=Episode 3=
Dad, I'm back to see you.

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
Dad,

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,680
there is an outsider here?

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,960
Legal Boy,

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,960
what are you doing here?

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,640
Dad, it's him.

8
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,800
He's the one who tried to kill me.

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,160
He wants to kill me!

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,050
You have to stand up for me, Dad.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
I don't even know you.

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
Why would I hurt you?

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
You don't know me?

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,840
But you know this test report, right?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,070
(DNA Test Report, Expert Opinion)

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,320
Now an outsider has seen

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,710
our brothers fighting each other.

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't this a disgrace
to our Zhang Family?

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,460
Dad.

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Dad, you have to stand up for me.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
It seems

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,600
that I've come at a bad time today.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Sorry for disturbing you

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,370
from recognizing

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,250
your long-lost son.

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,320
I'll come another day.

27
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,160
It's quite interesting.

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,760
It's on purpose, right?

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,430
There'll be a reunion banquet
the night after tomorrow.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,680
Wangfu, invite President Lu

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
to attend as well.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
Okay, Brother.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Listen,

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Dongcan Group is the second
largest company in Kanglan,

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
with an annual turnover
of over 10 billion.

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,960
And your father is

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
the biggest head of this Group.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,320
What does this have to do with me?

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,760
The Chairman is currently
selecting a successor.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
There's a lot of infighting
in the company.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
If you come to recognize your father,

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
it's like declaring war on them.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,320
Even if you don't want to,

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
they'll take you as their rival.

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,320
Are you talking about Zhang Chongrui?

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
I mean,

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
don't believe anything anyone says

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,080
in this house,

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
not even a punctuation mark.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Then

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,520
can I trust your words?

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,400
The Chairman asked me
to give you this card.

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,080
What card is this? I don't want it.

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,720
Don't underestimate it.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,560
It represents your identity,

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,830
and it allows you
to know the Zhang Family quickly.

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
You can know what they want

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,760
and what they fear most.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
Know yourself and your enemy,

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
and you'll never lose.

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,360
Why do you keep helping me?

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
Can I buy them all?

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,640
Of course.

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,240
This card can buy the whole mall.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
(If that's true,)

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,560
(Dashui's treatment costs)

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,280
(should be covered, right?)

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,480
Come here, try this one.

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,880
Let me test this card.

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,960
See if it really works.

71
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,740
How does this look?

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Looks great.

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Great?

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,760
Is this

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
what you like?

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,680
By the way,

77
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
I have a gift for you.

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
What is it?

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,040
It's a Bluetooth headset called Airyou.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,840
Is this a headset?

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
How to wear it?

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,000
This headset

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
doesn't pinch my ears.

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
Not only does it not pinch,

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,880
but the sound quality is good.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Alright, go change another set.

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,680
Another set?

88
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm going to arrange for Gouwa
to join the Group.

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,800
Dad,

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
he was a migrant worker last week.

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,920
Why do you want him to join the Group?

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,640
Old man,

93
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
I appreciate it.

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,920
But I'm not going.

95
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
I'll give you some time

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
to think it over.

97
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
I said I wouldn't go.

98
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm leaving now.

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
Just one last step,

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,880
I didn't expect to be bitten by a dog.

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Uncle,

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
have you ever had a dog?

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,920
What do you mean?

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,440
If a dog blocks your way,

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,960
give it a piece of meat
and it will go away.

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
What's your plan?

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,960
I've found the piece of meat.

108
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
Gouwa.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,120
The recording is a forgery.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,400
I can ask Chongguang for proof now.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
He started the rumor

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,040
that I'm a murderer

113
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,280
just because

114
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm Dad's illegitimate son.

115
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,080
He doesn't want me to inherit.

116
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
Gouwa, believe me.

117
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,480
There's no way
I'd kill for those benefits.

118
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
If you also want to find the murderer,

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,280
let me help you.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Finished?

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
Then I'm leaving.

122
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,160
Gouwa!

123
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
The show is about to start.
