=Legal Boy=

2
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,280
Dashui.

3
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,860
=Episode 14=

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
How's it going?

5
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,240
Did you find Xia Dashui?

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Legal Boy,

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
do you trust Xia Dashui?

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
I trust my brother.

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,800
Gouwa,

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,440
if it were someone else,

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,880
you wouldn't be fooled.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,200
But it's Xia Dashui,

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
so it's hard for you to stay objective.

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,080
No, don't.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
No.

16
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,750
No more running.

17
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,480
I won't run.

18
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,840
Don't hit me.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
Who are you?

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,880
What do you want?

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
I'm your buddy's brother.

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,640
Legal Boy?

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,480
What do you want?

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,200
What do I want?

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,600
It's about what you did.

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
We... You...

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,160
Easy. Easy.

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm here

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,040
to help you get back to him.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
But...

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,680
I did something wrong.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,040
Shh.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
As long as you don't tell,

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,160
no one will know.

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
He has

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
the photo of the dealer and I.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
You must listen to me.

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,760
But how?

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,320
(Taxi Occupied)
Are you insane?

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,280
Gouwa.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Gouwa.

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Dashui?

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Dashui.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,920
Dashui.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,520
Where have you been these days?

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,680
I've been looking for you.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm sorry, Gouwa.

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,800
Dashui, don't say that.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm the one who should apologize.

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
If...

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,000
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't be like this.

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
Gouwa,

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
someone asked me for your hair

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,990
to run some test.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
They promised me some money.

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
I was desperate to pay off debts.

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,880
I thought it wasn't a big deal,

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,240
so I agreed.

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
I shouldn't have been greedy.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
- I'm sorry.
- Dashui.

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,500
- I shouldn't have.
- Dashui!

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,650
- Stop it, Dashui.
- I'm so sorry.

63
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,490
Dashui.

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,520
- What's that for?
- I'm such an idiot.

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
- It's alright.
- I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,200
- I'm relieved to see you.
- Forgive me.

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
Just tell Legal Boy

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,760
the three hairs you found on him

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,880
were given to that person,

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,760
and you'll be fine.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
You gave me the envelope,

72
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,840
right?

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,760
Dashui,

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
knowing too much

75
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
won't do you any good.

76
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,960
So, are we friends now?

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Dashui,

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
it's getting cold.

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
Wear more when you go back.

80
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,360
- Forgive me, please.
- It's okay.

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
It's alright.

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,640
Let's go back.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
I'll take you back to the site.

84
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,920
Come on.

85
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,520
I got you.

86
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
Come on, take it slow.

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
Sorry about that, sir.

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
Liu, Gouwa's back.

89
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,560
Gouwa's back.

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Gouwa.

91
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,730
- Dashui.
- Dashui is back too.

92
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,920
- Come on.
- Sit down.

93
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,920
You're finally back.

94
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
We missed you so much.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
Liu,

96
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,800
your watch looks fancy.

97
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
When you were in the hospital,

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
Gouwa led us to start a construction team.

99
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
We're earning much more now.

100
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,080
- Yes.
- You started a construction team?

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
Yeah, thanks to Gouwa.

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Now we're doing great.

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,800
Good for you.

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
Dashui,

105
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
I was thinking,

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,320
since we're all back together,

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
why don't you

108
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
join the construction team?

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,750
- Join us.
- Yeah.

110
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,800
Join us.

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,240
That's right.

112
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,800
But I'm crippled now.

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
Dashui,

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
see you at seven tonight.

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,440
Please welcome Mr. Xia Dashui.

116
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Xia Dashui.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,320
Mr. Xia Dashui.

118
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,190
Mr. Zhang, I...

119
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,680
First time in here?

120
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,680
Has Gouwa

121
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
never brought you here?

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
No.

123
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
He comes here often.

124
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,160
Dashui,

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
it seems

126
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
you and Gouwa

127
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,280
are worlds

128
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
apart now.

129
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,000
Yet you're still faithful

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,280
to your buddy.

131
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,600
Dashui,

132
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,240
he doesn't even bring you here.

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
No way he'll share fortune and beauty

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
with you in the future.

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
He will.

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
Gouwa is a good friend.

137
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,560
I brought him to the site.

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
He won't look down on me.

139
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
Do you believe that?

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,360
Dashui.

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Gouwa started

142
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,320
his own construction team.

143
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
He's the boss.

144
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,320
All his old buddies work for him now.

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
And you're

146
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,160
a guy with a limp.

147
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,040
He thinks you aren't good enough
to work for him.

148
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Dashui,

149
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,760
I think you are talented.

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
You just need an opportunity.

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
You know what?

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
I can offer you that.

153
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Think it over.

154
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,240
I've planned a great show tomorrow night.

155
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,400
Keep it quiet for now.

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,600
Just wait and see.
