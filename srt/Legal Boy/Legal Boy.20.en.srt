=Legal Boy=

2
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Take it.

3
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,880
=Episode 20=

4
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,730
Keep it safe.

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
Jinling,

6
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,160
where to?

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Not your concern.

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,400
Not my concern?

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,720
You're going to see him, right?

10
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,680
Zhang Chongrui, how dare you hit me?

11
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,000
So what?

12
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
Lu Jinling, listen up.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,880
We're engaged.

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,520
Only I can save Lu Group now.

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Let go of me.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
Zhang Chongrui, let me go.

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,560
Jinling.

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Jinling!

19
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,670
What's going on?

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,560
What are you doing?

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
Grandpa, I'm fine.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
What's wrong with you?

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,040
Jinling said she's fine.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,560
Right, Jinling?

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Right.

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,170
I'll just leave.

27
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,020
Get out of here.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Don't forget.

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,650
Leave now.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Jinling,

31
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,320
what's going on?

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,120
Fang Tuo is hiding.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,800
He's colluding with Zhang Chongrui.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,960
They might contact each other.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
We must keep an eye on Zhang

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
if we want to catch Fang Tuo.

37
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,840
Let's stay in touch.

38
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,930
Jinling.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
Don't marry him.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,370
Will you marry me?

41
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,210
I will.

42
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,800
Look closely.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,880
The person I'm marrying

44
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,280
is Zhang Chongrui.

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,240
Have some self-respect.

46
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,260
Do you mean it?

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
Why are you in my room?

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
What do you want?

49
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,470
What else?

50
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,020
What are you doing?

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
Remember,

52
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
you belong to me.

53
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,340
(Fang Tuo)

54
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
Be right back.

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Didn't I tell you not to call me?

56
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,450
Zhang Chongrui,

57
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,320
you promised to send me abroad.

58
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Didn't you say after you got engaged,

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
you'd send me abroad?

60
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,480
We'll have to hold off

61
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,400
on the important stuff for now.

62
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,600
Listen, Zhang Chongrui,

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,440
don't try to play tricks on me.

64
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
In three days,

65
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,920
if you don't arrange my departure,

66
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,400
I can't predict what I'll do.

67
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Alright.

68
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,600
Three days it is.

69
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,560
I'll arrange for you to go abroad.

70
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
You'll be living the good life soon.

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
You better.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm out of food and drinks.

73
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,360
Get someone

74
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,600
to send me more.

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,120
You'll get it tomorrow.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
Tomorrow afternoon,

77
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,100
let's meet at the cafe downstairs.

78
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,980
Xiaomeng,

79
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,090
let's go

80
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,940
get them.

81
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,720
Wait no more.

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
It's been two hours already.

83
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,470
Let's wait a bit longer.

84
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Oh, forget it. I'm leaving.

85
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,640
Hang on. We've been waiting this long.

86
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,600
What's a little longer?

87
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Look, is that him?

88
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,340
(Dongfeng St, Lanbei Dist, Kanglan City)

89
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,730
That's him.

90
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,780
That's him.

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,480
Awesome.

92
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,550
Xiaomeng,

93
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
wait here.

94
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,560
We'll go catch him together.

95
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
Alright. Let's go.

96
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,400
Go.
