00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:49,120
=Episode 6=
Mr. Luo, did you get the money?

3
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,560
I'm gonna need you
to keep looking out for me.

4
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,020
Bro,

5
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,740
I've heard lately,

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,980
Legal Boy is investigating the site.

7
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,300
Maybe we should call a truce.

8
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,820
After all, Legal Boy

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,060
is my brother.

10
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,660
But you're different.

11
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,580
Born out of wedlock.

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,660
Bro,

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,420
aren't you afraid your own brother

14
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,060
will find something on the site?

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,060
Why should I?

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,620
All these years,

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,860
you've found nothing.

18
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,780
Should I fear his search?

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,020
You're right, Bro.

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,060
When did I ever dare to check on you?

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,100
Well,

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,820
you didn't do it.

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,980
What about your men?

24
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,520
Just kidding.

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,380
I was kidding, Bro.

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,460
Gotta go.

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,700
Mr. Li,

28
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,877
if you leave me alone,

29
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,380
I'll make a deal with you.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,580
Let's hear it.

31
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,460
Zhang Chongguang is involved

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,420
in Xia Dashui's injury.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,060
Are you sure?

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,217
Dad, you wanted to see me?

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,460
Old man,

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,220
the flash drive's here.

37
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Do what you need to do.

38
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,420
Dad,

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,340
what's going on?

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,140
You don't know

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,260
what your men are doing?

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,180
The one who wants to kill me

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,380
might be you.

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,060
It's not the weekend.

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,940
No one's here?

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,860
Zhang Chongguang.

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,300
Zhang Chongguang.

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,500
Is this your doing?

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,100
Where are the workers?

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,140
They're dismissed.

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,100
Dismissed?

52
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,500
Sun Laoliu and Zhou Quan are conspiring.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,620
Can we still trust such people?

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,740
The company has terminated the contract

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,860
with Sun Laoliu's team.

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,020
You've helped us by removing this issue.

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,270
On behalf of the company, thank you.

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,340
Do you know the workers are innocent?

59
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,220
Yes, they are.

60
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,300
But the team contracts with the head office.

61
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,140
The head office gets to decide.

62
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,940
Oh, I see.

63
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,140
You used to work at construction sites,

64
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,300
doing hard labor.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,460
Anything that requires some thinking

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,220
isn't your strength.

67
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,660
Old man,

68
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,140
why is Zhang Chongguang overseeing the site?

69
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,980
How could you change workers

70
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,340
as you please?

71
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,220
(Pawn)

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,980
Old man,

73
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,980
you're cheating.

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,740
I just decided

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
pawns can move sideways.

76
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,620
How about that?

77
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,060
Do you want to be a rule-maker
just like me?

78
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,460
Secretary Wu?

79
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,180
Why are you here?

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,100
Remember this pawn?

81
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,820
(Pawn)

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,500
You're trapped in a dead end.

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,140
Wanna break free?

84
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,460
Secretary Wu,

85
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,420
let me be honest with you.

86
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,420
There's one thing I can't figure out.

87
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,380
Tell me,

88
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,660
do the rich

89
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,100
really get to do

90
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,780
whatever they want?

91
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,740
To avoid changing equip,

92
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,300
they kicked my guys out

93
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,780
without any consideration.

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,580
They always pick on us construction workers.

95
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,220
You still don't get the chairman's plan.

96
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,060
When a pawn crosses the river,

97
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
the only way to win is to make sure

98
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,100
he doesn't drown.

99
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,340
Let's not discuss this today.

100
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,140
Since you're here now…

101
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,340
Wait. Why are you here?

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,870
I asked President Lu to come over.

103
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,140
You've worked on sites

104
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,500
and have experience.

105
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,380
Why not start your own construction team?

106
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,580
I've actually thought about it.

107
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,620
But,

108
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,620
we didn't go to school much.

109
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,420
Our education level isn't high.

110
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,300
We know nothing

111
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,780
but construction work.

112
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
How to start it?

113
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,020
Gouwa,

114
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,460
since President Lu said so,

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,340
what are you worried about?

116
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
Now I get it.

117
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,180
I'm calling the guys now.

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,460
Why did you

119
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,300
ask me to help Gouwa?

120
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
It doesn't matter.

121
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,660
The thing is you came.

122
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,740
That means I asked the right person.

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Don't be late

124
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,780
for the meeting tomorrow.

125
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,180
You can all leave now.

126
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,380
Old man,

127
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,660
I want to join Dongcan.

128
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,620
I want to manage

129
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,500
the Kanglan Bay site.

130
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,580
Word came in

131
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,940
the construction is stopped.

132
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,420
What?

133
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,300
Stopped?
