00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
Xiaomeng.

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,000
Back then,

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,600
if I hadn't taken you from the orphanage,

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
you would've

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,680
been bullied by others.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,240
President Lu,

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,280
thank you so much

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,480
for letting me work at Dongcan.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,920
And I'm willing

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,000
to help you with the info.

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,440
This is Dongcan's plan for acquiring FFG.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm giving it to you.

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,720
But,

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
I want to quit

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
after this.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,800
I want to resign from Dongcan.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,080
Is it because of Legal Boy?

20
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,120
That guy's quite something.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,840
Back then,

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
(DNA Test Report)
I told you to drag him in

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,360
to stir up chaos in the Zhang Family.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
But I never thought

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,400
he'd get this far

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,000
and make you and Jinling fight over him.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
Fine.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,200
After this task is done,

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,520
you can quit.

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
However,

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,840
if he knew what you did for him

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,320
was based on my instructions,

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,000
how do you think

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,040
he'd feel?

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,500
(Lu)

36
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,740
(Fang Tuo)

37
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,470
Mr. Lu,

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,560
your actions were swift and precise.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,480
Fang Finance Group is yours now.

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Mr. Fang.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
I really can't bear

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,680
to see FFG

43
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,440
fall apart in your hands.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,720
Take care, Mr. Lu.

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
Alright.

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
As we planned.

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,360
Mr. Lu, aren't you afraid

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,240
of being mocked in the biz?

49
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Chongrui, I'm sorry.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,720
In business,

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
you have to be quick to succeed.

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,280
This was a lesson for you.

53
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,480
Teach me business?

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
Brother,

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
it's time for your meds.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Forget it.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,840
You kept me in the dark
about such a big merger?

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,960
Do you still see me as your brother?

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Brother,

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
don't be upset.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Actually,

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,680
we never intended to acquire FFG.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,560
What do you mean?

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,720
This idea came from Chongrui.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,360
The Lu Group is doomed now.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Just wait for the good news.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
Our Dongcan Group

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,080
has no competitors left.

69
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Here.

70
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,190
Uncle.

71
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Chongrui,

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,440
once this is settled,

73
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
Dongcan will be yours.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Don't say that.

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
If you hadn't found out
Wu Xiaomeng was Lu's snitch,

76
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,840
I wouldn't have known
how to get the words to that old man.

77
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,280
(CEO Flees with Funds)
FFG faces accusations of financial fraud

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
and false reporting,

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
with its asset subsidiary collapsing.

80
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,840
CEO Fang Tuo has fled with funds,

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,280
and his whereabouts are unknown.

82
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Lu Group, which recently acquired FFG,

83
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,440
is also affected,

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,400
with its stock price plummeting.

85
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,830
Xiaomeng.

86
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
Xiaomeng!

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
Have you seen the news?

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
Jinling isn't answering my calls.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
Lu Group must be overwhelmed right now.

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,640
You shouldn't bother her.

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,160
But I want to help her.

92
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
I can't just stand by.

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,160
Do you have a solution now?

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,320
If you want to help her,

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
there are two ways.

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,520
First, find Fang Tuo

97
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
and get the money back.

98
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,160
Second, ask your dad

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
to have Dongcan invest in Lu Group.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,400
Exactly.

101
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,660
That's right.

102
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
Xiaomeng, thank you.

103
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,920
Could you please

104
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
invest

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,040
to save the Lus?

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,240
You've been here for a while.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
You should know

108
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
I don't invest in money pits.

109
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200
Unless,

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,400
you marry Lu Jinling

111
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,000
to unite the Zhangs and Lus.

112
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,320
Seems like I shouldn't have come today.

113
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,560
You're just about profits.

114
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
Marriage can save the Lu Group

115
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,360
and give you Dongcan.

116
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,760
As the company's decision-maker,

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
you should maximize the profits.

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes.

119
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,080
You're absolutely right.

120
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,950
(King)
I truly am nothing.

121
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,040
But I just want to do things the right way

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
and be an honest man.

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,720
So I've figured it out.

124
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
(Chariot, King)

125
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm done

126
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,940
(Chariot, King)

127
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,720
with your game.

128
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Grandpa, don't stress yourself out.

129
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,480
Zhang Chongrui,

130
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,200
you're not welcome here.

131
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,120
Miss Lu,

132
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm here to offer help.

133
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,800
You…

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Jinling,

135
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,270
let him speak.

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
What you need is money.

137
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,080
Once I become Dongcan's heir,

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
I can use all the resources

139
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
to help you.

140
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,640
But on one condition.

141
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,000
It's up to Miss Lu to decide.
