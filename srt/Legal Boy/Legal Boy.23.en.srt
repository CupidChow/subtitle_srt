00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,380
=Legal Boy=

2
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,680
Playing chess?

3
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,610
- Hi.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,920
=Episode 23=

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,960
Who's winning now?

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,440
He lost two games to me.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,720
Guess it's not your night.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,680
Yeah.

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Did you hear?

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,960
The foreman got a batch of cement.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,840
Inferior again.

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,960
Watch it.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,280
Wanna get fired?

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,680
They're just after money.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,320
We are the ones suffering.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,080
That's right.

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,140
(Horse)

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm back.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,960
The time has come.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
We can make our move.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,680
Zhang Wangfu is eyeing a parcel in Jiangbei.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,960
But,

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,240
many are watching it closely.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
I invested through an overseas trust

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,320
in several

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,800
real estate firms in Kanglan.

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,160
They've all become his rivals.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
I have a concern now.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
Go ahead.

30
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,320
Zhang Wangfu lacks funds now,

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
however,

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,320
real estate is just part of his business,

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
and it won't crush him.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,000
Right.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
That's why

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,920
we must corner him completely.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,480
Also,

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,080
we need to find more strategies

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
in other fields.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
The key is

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
to keep him busy.

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,240
Do you have any ideas?

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Sir,

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,720
someone sold the shares this morning.

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
The stock price is dropping sharply.

46
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,280
What?

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Keep buying for me.

48
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,030
Alright.

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
I put it all in there.

50
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,920
Don't mess it up.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
I won't, Ms. Hong.

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,320
Sir, the bank approved the loan.

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,880
Great. Now let's see who dares to compete.

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,800
We got a situation.

55
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,670
What is it?

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Word has it

57
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Lucheng Construction increased their bid.

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
Again?

59
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
We'll raise it, too.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
Raise it!

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,400
Sir.

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,680
What?

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,480
We bid on several projects but failed.

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
How's that possible?

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
Sir, thank you.

66
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,670
No need.

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Your proposal scored the highest.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
It's well-deserved.

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,600
Looking forward to our cooperation.

70
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Take care.

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,600
See you.

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,720
Okay, then.

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,800
Thanks for your help.

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Sure.

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,680
Goodbye.

76
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
Good for you, Legal Boy.

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,360
This is just the beginning.

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
We're just getting started.

79
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Did you get it?

80
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,240
How much did you get it for?

81
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
Three hundred?

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Three times.

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
Triple the price?

84
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,960
That's insane.

85
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,200
Sir, you said whatever it takes…

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,320
Forget it.

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,840
As long as we get that parcel,

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
we can secure the foreign investment.

89
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,280
Our cash flow barely covers next month.

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,400
Sell the properties in the south.

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,640
Someone from the south site is looking for you.

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Who is it?

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,080
Uncle Wangfu, long time no see.

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
Legal Boy?

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,000
What brings you here?

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm working in the south.

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
I heard

98
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,600
that's also your turf.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,640
I came specifically to apologize.

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,400
What do you mean?

101
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
Nothing much.

102
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,600
The site used inferior materials,

103
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,960
and I reported it.

104
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
Thanks for the gifts, everyone.

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,320
Thank you all.

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,640
By the way, here's a news update.

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,080
I'd like to report

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
Dongcan Group is using substandard cement,

109
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,840
and they're building unsafe structures.

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,200
Everyone, here's the evidence.

111
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
Reports indicate

112
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,600
that Dongcan's stock price keeps plummeting,

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,480
hitting an all-time low.

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,080
Why panic?

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,520
Do they think it can defeat me?

116
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,400
Naive. Truly naive.

117
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,320
Don't you trust me?

118
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,720
Through all these years with Dongcan Group,

119
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,720
haven't I solved every problem?

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,400
As long as the overseas Corona Investments

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,320
can fulfill the contract on time.

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,840
Our Dongcan

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
will resolve the crisis.

124
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,640
I am

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
still top-notch in the city.

126
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,041
We've reached the final agreement

127
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,840
with America's Corona Investments.

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
That's great.

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Once they come in,

130
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,280
things will be easier for us.

131
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,840
Check again carefully.

132
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,760
See if there are any materials

133
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,280
that haven't been retrieved.

134
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,140
Mm.

135
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,370
All clear.

136
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,360
Chongguang?

137
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,200
Chongguang, why are you back?

138
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,320
Uncle Wangfu.

139
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,880
Long time no see.

140
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
Long time no see.

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Well,

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,380
what brings you

143
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,640
here today?

144
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,360
I am the China Regional Director
of Corona Group,

145
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,720
Zhang Chongguang.

146
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,120
You can't give up on yourself

147
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,280
when you're abroad.

148
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,680
I'll provide you with funds

149
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
to explore opportunities out there.

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
I hope you can

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,200
start anew

152
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
and stand tall.

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
Dad,

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
I'll be back.

155
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,360
Corona Group?

156
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,920
Chairman Zhang…

157
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,200
Everyone out.

158
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
Uncle Wangfu,

159
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,720
don't be nervous.

160
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm not here to destroy Dongcan.

161
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
Then, what is

162
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,040
your intention?

163
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,600
I will invest in Dongcan,

164
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,320
but not

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,720
if it's in your hands.

166
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,640
During the crisis you caused,
the shareholders

167
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,560
have already sold all their shares to me.

168
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,080
Chongguang,

169
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,670
are you kidding me?

170
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
All their shares?

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Oh my.

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Look at these…

173
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,240
Chongguang,

174
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
that's ruthless.

175
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,280
But don't forget,

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,320
even if you get shares from them,

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
still,

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
you're short of…

179
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,480
Three percent, right?
