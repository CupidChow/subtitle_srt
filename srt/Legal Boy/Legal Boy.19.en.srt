I can use all the resources

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
to help you.

4
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,120
But on one condition.

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,520
It's up to Miss Lu to decide.

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Zhang Chongrui,

7
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,320
in your dreams!

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,440
Fine.

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,560
I've got plenty of time.

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,720
Lousy coffee.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
I'll bring you something nice next time.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
Kid,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,560
you need to make a decision.

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,040
A marriage alliance with the Zhangs

15
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,800
is indeed

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,790
our best choice.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
As for Legal Boy,

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,040
you need to clear the air with him.

19
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
Legal Boy.

20
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,810
Legal Boy,

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,450
I like you.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,960
If you agree now,

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
I can marry you today.

24
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,960
Marriage can save the Lu Group.

25
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,650
Jinling,

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
you know, it's…

27
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,350
I know.

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,440
You rejected me once before,

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,360
but I still want to ask again.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Will you

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,440
marry me?

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,480
But

33
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,720
I just want to do things the right way

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,600
and be an honest man.

35
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,410
Jinling,

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
you know,

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
I told you…

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
I get it.

39
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Gouwa,

40
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,890
you're here.

41
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,770
Gouwa,

42
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,640
I need to confess something.

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,880
What is it?

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,260
I'm Lu Jue's snitch in Dongcan.

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,480
I'm the one who told him

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
everything about you.

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,360
You gave me the video,

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,680
and I gave it straight to Lu Jue.

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
I was involved

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,800
in getting Lu Group into this mess.

51
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,200
I've been deceiving you all along.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,730
- Gouwa, I
- Xiaomeng,

53
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,120
to be frank,

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
after hearing all that,

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
I feel quite conflicted.

56
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,480
But now that I think about it,

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,360
ever since I met you,

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
you've always been helpful.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
You've never hurt me.

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
You know,

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,160
if none of this had happened,

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
I might never have met you.

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
Gouwa,

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
actually, I…

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Xiaomeng,

66
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,560
I have to take this.

67
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,790
A moment.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Gouwa…

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Gouwa,

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
actually, I like you.

71
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
Brother.

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
Why did you call me back?

73
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,640
Nothing much.

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,800
You're exhausted.

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
Zhang Chongrui,

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm warning you, don't mess with me.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,520
Lu Jinling agreed to marry me.

78
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,240
Who's behind this?

79
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
Is it Zhang Wangcai?

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
That's why I need to thank you.

81
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,240
Zhang Chongrui.

82
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,730
That's it.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Well,

84
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,360
excuse me.

85
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,480
Did you hear?

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
Zhang Chongrui and Miss Lu
are getting engaged.

87
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,160
If that's true,

88
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,960
Dongcan Group will
be Kanglan's top construction firm.

89
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,640
If you want to help her, there are two ways.

90
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,160
First, find Fang Tuo

91
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,000
and get the money back.

92
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,960
Have you found Fang Tuo?

93
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Have you found Fang Tuo?

94
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
No, I tried my best.

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,400
Anything?

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,840
I'll let you know.

97
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll think of another way.

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,920
I've got some clues now.

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,840
You're beautiful.

100
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you know how much I like you?

101
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,840
But you've always ignored me.

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,040
You expect that deadbeat to save you?

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Jinling.

104
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,600
Jinling, open the door.

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,200
Jinling.

106
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,760
Jinling, are you okay?

107
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm perfectly fine.

108
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
You should leave.

109
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Jinling, listen to me.

110
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,440
You can't marry him.

111
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,560
He's a jerk,

112
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
you know?

113
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
Jinling,

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,240
what's with you?

115
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,880
If I don't marry him,

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
will you marry me?

117
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,360
Legal Boy,

118
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm not lucky as you.

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
You can do anything you want.

120
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm different.

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,120
I am the President of Lu Group

122
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,040
and Lu Jue's granddaughter.

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,920
I must save the company.

124
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,880
Just leave.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Don't come again.

126
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
Jinling,

127
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
take it.

128
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,520
Keep it safe.
