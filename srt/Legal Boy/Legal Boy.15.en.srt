00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,340
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
You're here.

4
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,160
Why are you here?

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,440
Don't just stand there.

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,480
Come sit.

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Brother, take a seat.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,440
Dashui.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,920
Dashui,

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
sit here.

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,600
Zhang Chongrui?

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,280
Why are you here?

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Well,

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,400
to be honest,

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,160
I used your names

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,320
without asking today

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
just to show

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
my appreciation to Gouwa's friend.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,600
Who do you think you are?

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
Legal Boy,

21
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,950
let's go.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,680
Gouwa.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Look.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,920
I think your brother means well.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,080
Let's just dine here.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
- Dashui.
- It's not that.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,280
You're different now.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
Every man

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
needs a watch.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,560
My bad.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,360
I forgot to get you a gift.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,640
Well...

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Take this.

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,860
Liu,

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,720
your watch

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,120
looks fancy.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,680
Mr. Zhang, it's...

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,600
Here, be my guest.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,720
Dashui.

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,560
Don't take it.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Thank you.

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,720
Much pricier than Liu's, right?

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,320
You shouldn't take it.

44
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,440
- Give it back.
- Gouwa.

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,440
Do you know what he...

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
Your brother seems sincere.

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
Why not give him a chance

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,280
and have a meal with him?

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
Sorry.

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,480
I want to sit next to Legal Boy.

51
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
Dashui,

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,320
it's okay. Sit here.

53
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll sit over there.

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Dashui,

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Jinling means

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
Dashui is our guest of honor.

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Please.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,160
The head seat.

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,670
Breaking news:

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,880
Fang Finance Group's in cash flow crisis

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
due to mismanagement.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,960
Fang Tuo came to you

63
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040
and wanted you to acquire his company?

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Yes.

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
I came to see you

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
right after he left.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
Mr. Lu,

68
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,960
if the Zhang and Lu families

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
unite through marriage

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,000
and jointly acquire FFG,

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,590
we'll control all

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
commercial real estate projects

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,680
in Kanglan City.

74
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,040
We?

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Isn't it a bit early

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
to say that?

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,400
If you don't trust me,

78
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,640
I can prove myself to you.

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
What do you mean?

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll marry Miss Lu

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
and work in your family.

82
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,240
If you don't trust me,

83
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,480
I can hand Dongcan over to you.

84
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
You should go.

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,480
Grandpa,

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,840
why was that weasel here?

88
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
Jinling,

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm getting old.

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,880
Lu Group will

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
be yours sooner or later.

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Grandpa,

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
what did that weasel say to you?

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,840
A marriage alliance with the Zhangs

95
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,400
is indeed

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,360
our best choice.

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
As for Legal Boy,

98
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,680
you need to clear the air

99
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,160
and get

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,280
a reply from him soon.

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Did you set up Fang Tuo's account?

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
Chongrui,

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm worried.

104
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
Worried about what?

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
I...

106
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,200
Love,

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,680
you've helped me so many times.

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
This is the last time.

109
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
Just help me finish this.

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
Then we can get away together.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
Really?

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,040
Yes.

113
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
You're not lying again, are you?

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
Of course not.

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Gouwa.

116
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,640
Dashui, come here.

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
Have a seat.

118
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
I was just about

119
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,560
to look for you.

120
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,600
I...

121
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
I need to talk to you.

122
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
I have something to tell you first.

123
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Dashui,

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
I have

125
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,200
found you a job.

126
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
It's a warehouse position.

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
Considering your leg issue,

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,080
I mentioned it to Liu,

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
and he agreed.

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,640
Yes, Dashui.

131
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
The warehouse job is easy,

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,460
and the pay is high.

133
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,560
- Yes.
- It's a good job.

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,160
That's not what I meant.

135
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
Liu.

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
Alright.

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Dashui, I'm off.

138
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
I'll leave you to it.

139
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,600
What's going on?

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
You know what?

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
I can offer you that.

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
I want to manage the site.

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,280
Do you trust Xia Dashui

144
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,680
to manage the site?

145
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
Legal Boy.

146
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,510
I need to talk to you.

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,600
My Lady.

148
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,200
What's up? Say it.

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Sit down.

150
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,110
What's going on?

151
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
Tell me.

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,400
Come with me

153
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,440
to meet

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,080
my set-up date.
