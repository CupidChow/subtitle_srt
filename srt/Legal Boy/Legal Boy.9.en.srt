3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,900
Xiaomeng.

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,058
- How is it?
- I checked at the head office.

5
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:55,113
It's Wang Ming's vehicle.

6
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,400
He's in the Audit Division.

7
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,860
We've been watching for a while.

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,300
It seems

9
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,780
Wang Ming's been

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
working overtime back then.

11
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,760
The timing matches up too.

12
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,170
Yeah.

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,340
Do you think…

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,640
You…

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,500
Do you think there's another

16
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,360
Wang Ming in Audit Division?

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,000
We don't know yet.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,160
Let's keep watching.

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,330
Okay.

20
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,300
(West Office Area, Dongcan Group)

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,730
Hey,

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,900
Xiaomeng.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,330
What did you just call me?

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,700
Secretary Wu.

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,940
Well,

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,100
it feels

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,930
weird calling you Secretary

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,860
all the time.

29
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,200
I guess it's fine for you

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,660
to call me Xiaomeng.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
So,

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,330
I'll call you that from now on.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Got it.

34
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,770
- What?
- Look.

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,660
(1st Floor Lobby, West Office)
Wang Ming is fishy.

36
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,960
Though he was working overtime,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,160
he left for about 40 minutes.

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,200
It didn't make colleagues suspicious,

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,300
but it was enough for many things.

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,900
(West Office Entrance)
So,

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,560
where did he possibly go?

42
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,170
Brother,

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,570
for this

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,200
New Energy Company's project,

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,730
both Chongguang and Chongrui

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,460
have passed the preliminary review.

47
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,060
This project

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,260
is very likely

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,960
to shape

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,660
Dongcan's future

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,930
and decide

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,500
who'll be the heir.

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Wang Ming.

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,000
Who are you?

55
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,400
Got something to ask you.

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,970
Wang Ming,

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,930
at 7 PM on March 13th,

58
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,770
where were you?

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,300
I was working overtime.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,300
Still working at 7 PM?

61
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,400
You're so dedicated.

62
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,500
That day,

63
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,860
our whole team was working on

64
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,646
on the bid proposal
for New Energy Company.

65
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,200
They can all vouch for it.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,260
Alright.

67
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,600
That's it.

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,400
You can leave now.

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Wait.

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,660
No more questions?

71
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,800
Do you trust him?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,530
Hell, no.

73
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,900
We saw him leaving.

74
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,100
Maybe other tricks.

75
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,860
You're smart now.

76
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,460
Of course I am.

77
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,360
My teacher told me,

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,300
don't believe anything anyone says

79
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
in this house,

80
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,500
not even a punctuation mark.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,300
Zhang Chongming manages
all company vehicles.

82
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,900
His dashcam might have footage of Wang Ming.

83
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,160
That's a great idea.

84
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,700
Why did you bring me here?

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,900
Zhang Chongming,

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
answer me.

87
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
Where do you keep

88
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
your dashcam video?

89
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,496
Say "Big Brother,"

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,526
and I'll give you.

91
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,058
Have I not taught you a lesson lately?

92
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,522
Do you want me to delete it?

93
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,981
Aren't you a bit too old for this?

94
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,300
Big Brother.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,700
Good boy.

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,860
Wang Ming didn't go to the site that day.

97
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,460
Then who hit you?

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
Could it be someone else?

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,260
If it wasn't Wang Ming,

100
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,530
someone must've used his account.

101
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,560
This is

102
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,160
what we do next.

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,460
Wu Xiaomeng approaches Wang Ming's desk

104
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,100
and sends him away on an errand.

105
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,500
(West Office Area, Dongcan Group)
I sneak into his office

106
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,100
and access his computer.

107
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,970
Turns out,

108
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,960
during his 40-minute absence,

109
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,360
someone used his computer
to request a vehicle.

110
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,260
(West Office Area, Dongcan Group)

111
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,500
(Confirm deletion? Yes)

112
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,540
(Review, No video)

113
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,560
The results are in.

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,140
Chongguang,

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,060
congratulations, you won the bid.

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
Well done.

117
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,800
You made a contribution

118
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,560
to our company.

119
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,130
Chongrui.

120
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,100
As a member of Dongcan,

121
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,600
you should be happy for us.

122
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,200
Congratulations,

123
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,170
Brother.

124
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,170
Big Brother.

125
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,480
What for?

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Come on.

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Can't I just come to see you?

128
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
Big Brother,

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,460
you're the future of Dongcan.

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,160
You can't fall now.

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,760
I came here today

132
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,340
to offer

133
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,060
my assistance.

134
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,000
What do you mean?

135
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
I just

136
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,160
want to remind you

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,300
to be cautious now.

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,340
(West Office Area, Dongcan Group)

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
Sir,

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm sorry

141
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,260
to get you threatened.

142
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,400
What's the point of saying this now?

143
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,700
Sir, I owe you my career.

144
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,060
It was my mistake.

145
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,260
I'll take responsibility.

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,140
Besides,

147
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
I found a scapegoat for you.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Wu Xiaomeng,

149
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,500
you're suspected of embezzling funds
with Wang Ming from Audit.

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,930
Please cooperate.

151
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,170
No way.

152
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,360
You must be joking.

153
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,900
How could she embezzle funds?

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,260
That is a false accusation.

155
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,160
Do you understand?

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Gouwa,

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
don't worry.

158
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,730
I'll be fine.

159
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,570
No, he…

160
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
Zhang Chongguang,

161
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,570
did you do it?

162
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,444
I've no idea what you're talking about.

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
It was clearly you.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,300
But you blamed Xiaomeng.

165
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,730
Xiaomeng?

166
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,960
I had nothing to do

167
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,700
with her evil doing.

168
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,370
Legal Boy,

169
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm warning you,

170
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,800
don't do this again and again.

171
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,930
If you dare to act now,

172
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,800
I'll call the police on you.

173
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,140
Just you wait.

174
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,160
Xiaomeng,

175
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,160
are you okay?

176
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,200
Were you waiting for me?

177
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,660
Xiaomeng, listen.

178
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,500
Please don't worry.

179
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
I'll go find my old man.

180
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,900
He will definitely help.

181
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Don't worry.

182
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,260
The company won't frame me.

183
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,370
Take it easy.

184
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,600
Ms. Wu, please cooperate with us.
