Thank you, honored guests.

As the newly appointed
Executive President of Dongcan Group,

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,200
I would first like to thank
the Chairman of Dongcan,

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,280
my father,

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Mr. Zhang Wangcai.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,780
I'll definitely live up
to everyone's expectations

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,800
and strive to usher
in a new era for Dongcan.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,120
- Great!
- Good!

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Great!

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,440
Who are you?

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,120
I'm Legal Boy.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,000
I heard

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,440
it was you who tried to kill me?

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,420
(One day earlier)

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,680
Are you sure about this?

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
No other options.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,800
Then I'll take a small risk.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
Check.

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,280
Yes.

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Another round.

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,520
- Wait, bathroom first.
- Come on.

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,480
Let's take a break.

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,200
Let's go, Dashui.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Come with me.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
Alright.

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,400
Are you crazy?

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Forget it.

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,090
Don't move!

57
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,360
Forget it.

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,320
No, Dashui, he's doing it on purpose.

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,520
You're a migrant worker

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
with no money and no partner.

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Would he hit you on purpose?

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
He did it on purpose.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,160
He came right at us!

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,480
You're overthinking it.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,600
You're not a rich kid.

66
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,740
Finally got paid, right?

67
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
That's true.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Laoliu.

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Laoliu,

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
this isn't right.

71
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,200
(Sun Laoliu, Foreman of Kanglan Bay)
Why am I 100 short again?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,950
You brat, don't be so shameless.

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,200
Who do you think you are?

74
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,060
Sun Laoliu.

75
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,900
Sun Laoliu!

76
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,320
Gouwa.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
Stay calm.

78
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,000
Laoliu, don't be mad.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,840
Don't be angry.

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
We're here to make a living,

81
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,480
so try to avoid trouble.

82
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,800
- Dashui, you...
- Hey!

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,120
Don't be impulsive.

84
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,150
Alright.

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
They often deduct our wages.

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
Can you stand it?

87
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,200
He's the foreman now.

88
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Just bear with it.

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Listen to me,

90
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,600
don't be so impulsive.

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,450
Don't be stubborn.

92
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,370
No, I can't stand it.

93
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
Dashui.

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Dashui!

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
Dashui, are you okay?

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Wake up, Dashui.

97
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,260
Dashui!

98
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,100
Dashui.

99
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,240
Don't scare me, Dashui.

100
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,400
Why stand there? Call an ambulance!

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,960
Hurry! Call for help!

102
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
- What's going on?
- Dashui.

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,120
Don't you have to work?

104
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Sun Laoliu!

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
Call an ambulance, quick!

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,320
Call an ambulance!

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
Why call an ambulance?

108
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,360
If there's an accident,

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,560
we'll all be out of work.

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,760
What are you waiting for? Move him!

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
Hurry up.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
Let's see who dares to move him!

113
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,080
Who dares?

114
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
- Who dares?
- Arrest him.

115
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Don't move him.

116
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Quick, call an ambulance.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Sun Laoliu!

118
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
Take him outside.

119
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
Let me go.

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,560
Let me go!

121
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,280
Mr. Zhang.

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Come sit in my office.

123
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,260
Dashui.

124
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
Dashui!

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
Hurry and serve Mr. Zhang...

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Dashui.

127
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Dashui!

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
Dashui, wake up!

129
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,480
Send him to the best hospital.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,920
Our Dongcan

131
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,680
will pay for it.

132
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,800
Mr. Zhang,

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
thank you.

134
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
I've handled everything.

135
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,480
You're Legal Boy, right?

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,400
How do you know my name?

137
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,280
Not only do I know your name,

138
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,360
but I also know that
today wasn't an accident.

139
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't understand what you mean.

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
If Xia Dashui hadn't saved you,

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,840
you'd be the one

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,240
in the hospital today.

143
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,200
The man who wanted to harm you

144
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
is Zhang Chongrui.

145
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
Zhang... Zhang Chongrui?

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Who is Zhang Chongrui?

147
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,440
Why would he want to hurt me?

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,520
Because you have something he doesn't.

149
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,680
What is it?

150
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,440
Identity.

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
If Legal Boy doesn't die,

152
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,680
he'll be my obstacle.

153
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Come with me.

154
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
Where to?

155
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,040
To meet the man

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,320
who wants to harm you.

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
I heard

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,440
it was you who tried to kill me?

159
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,150
Wait!

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
It's...

161
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
a misunderstanding.

162
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,840
Let me go.

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Let me go!

164
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
I said let me go!

165
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,450
Stop it, all of you.

166
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,270
He's also one of the heirs of the Group,

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,060
my father's biological son,

168
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,160
my brother.
