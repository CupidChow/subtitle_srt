=Episode 13=

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,040
Chongming.

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
Chongming.

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,920
Didn't you say two o'clock?

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,400
That's right.

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,780
It's almost four now.

8
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,660
(Life-saving Client)

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,380
Hello?

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,080
What's going on?

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
The order

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
was canceled.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Hold on.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Let me toast to both of you.

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,720
It's been a pleasure.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,620
Gouwa.

17
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,470
Mm.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
We might have lost.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
It's all my fault.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,800
I didn't learn well from Chongguang.

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,320
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here now.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,360
Don't say stuff like that again.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
We still have time, right?

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,000
Gouwa.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
What do you mean?

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
I forced you to help me.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
What's that about?

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,080
I promised Chongguang

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,040
I'd protect you.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
To be honest,

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,480
I never wanted any of this.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,160
I've never been one

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,440
to fight for things, even as a kid.

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,760
Whenever it got competitive,

36
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
I'd always back down.

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,680
My big brother always saved some for me.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,920
But ever since that person came,

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
Chongguang has

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
been fiercely competing with him.

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
I just don't get it,

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
isn't life

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
about being happy?

44
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,720
Isn't it nice

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
to enjoy life

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,480
and take it easy?

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
Chongming.

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,760
Don't say things like that

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
to others outside.

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
Why not?

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,440
You might get punched.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,760
Brothers,

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
it's been several days now.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
I heard your

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,360
investment still hit some issues.

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
Had you told me earlier,

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
we could've solved it together.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,040
Zhang Chongrui,

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
did you steal my client?

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,040
Dad.

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,960
Enough, you two.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
Brother,

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
you mean,

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,920
Chongrui's taking over Chongguang's business?

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,320
Hold on.

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
Our Lu Group

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
just placed a big order

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
with Chongming's company.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,560
- Thank...
- I'm not here to help you.

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm here

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,920
because

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
of Wu Xiaomeng.

73
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
President Lu,

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,240
help Legal Boy, please.

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,240
Whether we're rivals or not,

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
neither of us

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
wants him to lose, right?

78
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
Hello?

79
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,120
What's up?

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
Dashui's awake?

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Alright. I'll be right there.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
I have to go.

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Thank you.

84
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,440
Before you go to the hospital,

85
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
you need to see this.

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
Chongrui,

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,760
Legal Boy is a lucky son of a gun.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Always gets the better of you.

89
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
Uncle,

90
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,400
when did you get superstitious?

91
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,220
You heard it too.

92
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,300
Xia Dashui is awake.

93
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,340
Gouwa.

94
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
You're here.

95
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,740
Dashui.

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,700
Can you tell me

97
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,900
what the hell is going on?

98
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,980
(Dongfeng St, Lanbei Dist, Kanglan City)

99
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,220
It's...

100
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,140
I've thought about it all night.

101
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,780
I know you would never hurt me.

102
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,940
I'm not

103
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,260
feeling well today.

104
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,020
I'll explain another day.

105
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,180
You have to trust me.

106
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,860
Brother, the ancestor worship is near.

107
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,300
Chongguang can't make it this year.

108
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,380
Why not let Chongrui go with us?

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
He can go.

110
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,260
However,

111
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,580
rules still need to be followed.

112
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,780
Of course.

113
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
By the way,

114
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,660
Gouwa has been back for a while.

115
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,780
Take him along this time.

116
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,540
I'm afraid he's...

117
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,100
(Blessings Pavilion)

118
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,940
Old man,

119
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,540
I heard you were looking for me.

120
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,260
Join me for a game of chess.

121
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,620
I've been looking for you all these years.

122
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,940
From the second you crushed
Chongrui's ceremony,

123
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,100
I knew you were my boy.

124
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,940
Why bring this up today?

125
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,020
You got lost at Zhang's Old Residence.

126
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,300
The Old Residence?

127
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,940
I plan to take you back there.

128
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,220
Firstly,

129
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,540
to thank our ancestors for reuniting us.

130
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Secondly,

131
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,940
you can offer incense to the ancestors

132
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,860
and tell them,

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,820
you're back.

134
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,180
First bow to pray for blessings.

135
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,820
Second bow to pay respects.

136
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,940
Third bow to wish for prosperity.

137
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,900
Offer incense.

138
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,620
(Spirit Tablet of Zhang Xianda)

139
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,300
(Ancestors, please guide me)

140
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,020
(to find the real culprit soon.)

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,780
(Also, thank you)

142
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,740
(for bringing my buddy back.)

143
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,980
Kowtow.

144
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,820
Again.

145
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,370
Again.

146
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,220
Ceremony completed.

147
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,780
What are you doing?

148
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,620
I just came in to have a look.

149
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,980
You've been with us for a while.

150
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,220
Don't you know this place is off-limits?

151
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,220
Dad,

152
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm your son, too.

153
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,100
Why can't I come in here

154
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,820
and light a stick of incense?

155
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,820
Because

156
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,340
of your identity!

157
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,740
Is that reason enough?

158
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,100
Why?

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,700
Why am I not as good as them?

160
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,220
Why can't I light a stick of incense?

161
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,540
Why can't I measure up to them?

162
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,580
What's missing in me?

163
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,980
(Spirit Tablet of Zhang Xianda)

164
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,380
Hello?

165
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,860
Liu.

166
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,940
Xiaomeng,

167
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,620
remember the one who wanted to kill me?

168
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,460
I think

169
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,020
he's coming for me again.

170
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,500
Legal Boy,

171
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,720
don't do anything reckless.
