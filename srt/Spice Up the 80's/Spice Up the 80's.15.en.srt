1
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,759
That shouldn't be.

2
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,119
Normally, the company's goods should have arrived by now.

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,640
It's already dark.

4
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,920
Why haven't the goods arrived yet?

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,359
Boss Lin,

6
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,679
we're waiting for your goods.

7
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,200
And you are?

8
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,159
Stop waiting.

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,000
Your goods

10
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,760
were hijacked by someone.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,480
Was it you?

12
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,760
Someone else took your goods.

13
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,799
If my Brother Wu hadn't stepped in,

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
and helped out,

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,760
your goods would have been lost by now.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,879
Wang Xiaowu...

17
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,879
Then this help probably wasn't from the Bai Sect, right?

18
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,599
I'm just a messenger.

19
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,480
For the details,

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,799
you'll have to talk to him.

21
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,640
Let's go.

22
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:30,719
Wait.

23
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,760
Our goods are in their hands, there's nothing we can do.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,200
Don't worry.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,319
There won't be any problems.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,560
Just wait for me in the shop.

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,879
Brother Wu.

28
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:55,799
Brother Wu.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaking of which,

30
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,080
it's been a while since we last met.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
I really have to thank you this time, Wu.

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,199
If it weren't for you,

33
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,680
this batch of goods

34
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,319
would definitely have been lost.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Back then, the two of us

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
almost became family.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Seeing that my sister was in trouble,

38
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,439
how could I,

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,080
not help you out?

40
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:25,919
Right?

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,560
You're right.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
Family doesn't stand on ceremony.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,719
Wu,

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
about these goods,

45
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,159
can I take them now?

46
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,360
Between us siblings,

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
anything can be discussed.

48
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,680
But to help you get this batch,

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,919
these guys went through a lot.

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
I was in such a rush,

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,639
I completely forgot about that.

52
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,879
Just name a price.

53
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,879
I definitely

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,599
can't let the guys

55
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,960
work for nothing.

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,080
That's straightforward.

57
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
Then I won't be polite.

58
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,439
Three thousand yuan.

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Just a token amount.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,680
Wu,

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,599
I came in a hurry,

62
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,120
and honestly didn't bring that much cash.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,199
No problem.

64
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,680
I trust your character.

65
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,719
I still believe in you.

66
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,159
Just leave a fingerprint.

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,599
You can take both the people and the goods.

68
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,319
Take them all with you.

69
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,479
You know, our fate is really something.

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,680
We just can't seem to escape that IOU.

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,000
If you're going to be like this,

72
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,719
don't even think about leaving this room today.

73
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,639
Within one hour,

74
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,039
even if you have to turn all of Meijiang upside down,

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
you must find out where Wang Xiaowu took Lin Xiaoxiao.

76
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,159
Yes.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,719
Check all the restaurants,

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,520
mahjong parlors,

79
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,000
and any other places they might go.

80
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,759
And Wang Xiaowu's brother,

81
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,319
bring him to me.

82
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,599
Brother Liang,

83
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,360
we found it.

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
This is Wang Xiaowu and his group's warehouse.

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,639
They're usually here.

86
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,759
President Lin,

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
I watched him grow up.

88
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,360
Wang Xiaowu.

89
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,639
Where's Lin Xiaoxiao?

90
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:16,959
Brother.

91
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,399
If she gets hurt even a little,

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
none of you will get away with it.

93
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,360
I'll take you out first.

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,240
Try and see what happens.

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,079
Touch my brother, I dare you.

96
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,040
Give me back my brother.

97
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Give him to me.

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,839
I'm right here.

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Give Lin Xiaoxiao back to me.

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm here.

101
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,600
Why is it so lively here?

102
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm telling you, I'm discussing a partnership with President Wu.

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,959
From now on, you can't call him Wang Xiaowu.

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,639
You have to call him President Wu.

105
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,279
Come home with me.

106
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,560
We can still have another drink with him.

107
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,000
We can do it now.

108
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,959
No need to rush off.

109
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,600
President Liang.

110
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,360
From now on, we're all on the same side.

111
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,879
Please take care of us.

112
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,040
Brother Wu.

113
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,079
Don't forget to call me when it's time for the contract.

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
For the stamp.

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Of course, definitely.

116
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,279
Alright.

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Aren't you going to explain this to me?

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
Explain?

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Wang Xiaowu stole your goods.

120
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,680
Why is he working in transportation with you again?

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,519
Let's say I'm giving you the money today.

122
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,759
You brothers can split it among yourselves.

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
How much will you have left after that?

124
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,839
Brother Xiao Wu,

125
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,319
If you trust me,

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,759
I can show you a way.

127
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,199
Why not give it a try?

128
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,839
What way could you possibly show me?

129
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,839
I know.

130
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
You guys used to do transport work too, right?

131
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,600
How much do you make from one trip?

132
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,319
Just...

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,639
Just a hundred or so yuan.

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,879
You talk too much.

135
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,279
If you work for a month,

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
At most, you only make a hundred or so yuan.

137
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,360
Ask him.

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
How much did he make in a month?

139
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,279
How much?

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
How much is it?

141
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,959
If I work for a month,

142
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,600
I can earn over five hundred.

143
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,959
If it’s the busy season,

144
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,560
maybe I can make even more.

145
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,360
How much?

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,959
Once my clothing store opens,

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
as long as you’re willing to handle the deliveries for me,

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,759
and ensure the safety of my goods,

149
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,000
I can offer you a long-term, stable income.

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
Just for this one payment of three thousand,

151
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,199
you’re giving up a steady source of income.

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,160
Isn’t that a bit shortsighted?

153
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,839
A single clothing store

154
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,199
with so many brothers to feed—

155
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,319
can you really support everyone?

156
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,199
Brother Wu,

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,480
that’s not how you should calculate it.

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,920
My partner is a major supplier in Guangzhou.

159
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,560
You can use my connections

160
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,839
to open up the transportation channels in Guangzhou.

161
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,800
The orders you’ll get in the future

162
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,439
won’t just be limited to Meijiang.

163
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
Instead, like him,

164
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
you’ll be centered in Guangzhou,

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,959
shipping goods continuously all over the country.

166
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,199
Transporting goods.

167
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:39,959
Brother,

168
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,160
if this works out,

169
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,000
we’ll finally have a legitimate business to run.

170
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,240
As long as you agree now,

171
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,839
by the next time we meet,

172
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,120
I’ll have to call you Boss Wu.

173
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,879
What did you call me?

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,839
Boss Wu.

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,839
You really do have a way with things.

176
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,199
You actually managed to turn an enemy into a partner.

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,959
I underestimated you.

178
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,000
Boss Lin.

179
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,399
Didn't I already say that?

180
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,120
Even without you,

181
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
I can still do just fine.

182
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,519
Really?

183
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,480
Isn't that so?

184
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,399
I'm sure.

185
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,079
I'm sure.

186
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,680
It's nothing.

187
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,000
She just drank too much.

188
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,639
I have to go to Yangcheng tomorrow.

189
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,360
I'll have to trouble you these days.

190
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,480
Take care of everything.

191
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,919
Don't worry, it's fine.

192
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,559
Yue'er.

193
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,440
The weather is really nice.

194
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,399
Yeah, it is, sis.

195
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,279
Grand opening sale! Everyone is welcome to come and support us.

196
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,120
Hang the brighter colors more toward the front.

197
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,120
The last time I saw you was at the banquet.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
You were still Deputy Manager Lin.

199
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,399
Looks like life in Yangcheng hasn't been easy.

200
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,440
Cousin.

201
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:26,960
Keep tidying up.

202
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,600
Lin Xiaoyan.

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,399
We've already split the family, so just call me by my name.

204
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,320
I don't want to be involved with your family anymore.

205
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,759
I'm afraid of being struck by lightning.

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Seems like you haven't learned anything in Yangcheng.

207
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,799
Still as sharp-tongued as ever.

208
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,960
As expected of a college student.

209
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,919
You did pretty well in college too.

210
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,799
You really know how to benefit yourself at others' expense.

211
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,039
You've mastered it well.

212
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,600
If you put it that way,

213
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,720
then I really don't understand.

214
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,799
My parents wanted to start a business.

215
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,919
I specifically took leave from school to come back and help.

216
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,960
It was just a coincidence

217
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,600
that we opened on the same street as you.

218
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,679
How about

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,799
you come visit our shop?

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,399
Sure.

221
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,559
Please, take your pick.

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,600
This outfit

223
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,519
would look great on you.

224
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,480
It really makes you look fair-skinned.

225
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,720
Go further inside.

226
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,600
Pick something from inside.

227
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,600
Lin Xiaoxiao.

228
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,159
You bring bad luck.

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,600
What ill wind blew you in here?

230
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,559
Mom.

231
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,039
If you can't talk nicely, go greet the customers.

232
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,360
Lin Xiaoyan,

233
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,320
Just browsing.

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,480
You opened this shop,

235
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,120
It's one thing that your clothes are just like mine,

236
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,720
but even your layout,

237
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,240
the furniture hasn't changed at all.

238
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,960
You really didn't use your brain at all.

239
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,840
Little sister,

240
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,519
There's a lot to learn in the clothing business.

241
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,919
Let me give you some advice.

242
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
You should be careful.

243
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,240
Don't buy at high prices and get tricked.

244
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,440
Even your big sister feels sorry for you.

245
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,440
Then I'll just

246
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
buy high and sell low.

247
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,360
Just consider it

248
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,480
as grabbing market share.

249
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,000
Isn't that great?

250
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm just afraid

251
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,279
you won't get the market,

252
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,039
and end up losing everything yourself.

253
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,639
Let me give you another piece of advice.

254
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,679
Just like in a family,

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
you don't need two college students.

256
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,279
On one street,

257
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,759
there's no room for two clothing stores.

258
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
There's no room for two

259
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,879
clothing stores that compete maliciously.

260
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Since it's competition,

261
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,360
isn't it survival of the fittest,

262
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,399
and the weak get eliminated?

263
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,080
Besides, I have Tang Ke backing me up.

264
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,240
If you dare go against me,

265
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,279
he'll crush you

266
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,879
easier than crushing an ant.

267
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,799
Why do you think

268
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Tang Ke couldn't do anything to me in Yangcheng,

269
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
but when I come back to Meijiang,

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,480
I'd get bitten by a dog?
