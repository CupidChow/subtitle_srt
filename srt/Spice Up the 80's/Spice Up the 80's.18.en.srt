1
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,479
Lin Xiaoxiao

2
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,560
Why are you here?

3
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm here for an interview today.

4
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,159
Why can't I be here?

5
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:50,960
You're here for the interview too?

6
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,439
The clothing store business failed.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,320
So I'm out looking for a job.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,240
Then it seems like you're in the wrong place.

9
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,719
A big company like this

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,799
is out of your league.

11
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,920
What makes you think it's out of my league?

12
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,280
Because I'm a college graduate.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,319
And you?

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,159
You're just a small egg vendor.

15
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,239
That's a gap you'll never be able to cross.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,439
What makes you think a degree means everything?

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,120
Because I was recommended by Yangcheng University.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,519
Someone with no knowledge, no degree, and no background

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Why would they want you?

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
And what makes you think you can be on the same level as me?

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,159
I suggest you just go home.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,879
Otherwise, when you fail the interview,

23
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,560
you'll just embarrass yourself.

24
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,840
Good luck with your interview.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,760
Number thirty-eight.

26
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,519
Thank you for your hard work.

27
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,920
Lin Xiaoyan is not only outstanding academically,

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,079
but also excels in dealing with people.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,920
Alright.

30
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,680
The interview will begin.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
Hello everyone, I am Lin—

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,519
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,680
This student here—

34
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,799
My interview isn't over yet.

35
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,159
You're here.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,879
President Lin.

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,960
President Lin.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,039
This is our company's general manager, Lin Xiaoxiao.

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,319
President Lin came in person to observe your interview.

40
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,479
You could say

41
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,000
that you are highly valued.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,120
What is it?

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,439
Don't you recognize me?

44
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,120
Didn't you ask me before

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,479
why I was here?

46
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,479
I'll answer you again.

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,759
Because there's an interview today.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
You founded this company.

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,280
What else could it be?

50
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,159
First question

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,599
Lin Xiaoyan

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,479
What do you think made Tingting Yuli

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,560
grow from a small clothing store

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,159
in just two short years

55
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,199
into a clothing trading company’s

56
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,000
This...

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't answer that.

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Second question

59
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,599
I saw on your resume

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
that you once ran a clothing store.

61
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,759
So, as a startup,

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,120
how do you stand out

63
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,000
in a highly competitive market?

64
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,240
I...

65
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,800
I can't answer that either.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,800
Last question

67
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,960
Please answer me with your knowledge and perspective.

68
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,719
Why would a small-town vendor like me

69
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,759
be sitting here

70
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,639
interviewing a university student from Yangcheng University?

71
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,599
You...

72
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,240
Instead of just serving tea and water here,

73
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,719
you should spend more time preparing.

74
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,199
Before the interview,

75
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,599
you didn’t even do the most basic company research.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Is this what Yangcheng University teaches you?

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,520
Your internship performance is directly linked to your graduation results.

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,919
How you perform during your internship

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,360
will be part of your overall graduation evaluation.

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,680
President Lin

81
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,759
I know I still have many shortcomings.

82
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,759
But I hope you can give me this opportunity.

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,519
I will work hard.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,319
And I won’t let the company down for treating me well.

85
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,199
For the sake of Yangcheng University,

86
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,879
I can let you stay.

87
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,000
But I hope you can work diligently.

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
Don’t always be in a rush for quick success.

89
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
You've been working hard, busy bee.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,199
You're here.

91
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,600
I've really been so busy lately, it's been dizzying.

92
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
But when I think about how well the company has done these past two years,

93
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,720
I feel like all the hard work has been worth it.

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,079
Looks like I have good taste in choosing a partner.

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
Why do you always have to take credit for all the good things?

96
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,839
Let me talk to you about something serious.

97
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,000
How's the matter with Siyang Garment Factory going?

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,439
As expected, it's an open bidding.

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,959
The factory's reserve price

100
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,959
is just as we anticipated.

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,759
I've also secured the bank loan on my end.

102
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,839
As long as we can successfully acquire Siyang Garment Factory,

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,040
our production capacity and orders will increase significantly.

104
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,120
I heard

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,959
Lin Xiaoyan came to your company.

106
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,560
You sure get information quickly.

107
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,480
Why do you care about her?

108
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,839
Even though you two are sisters,

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,360
I still need to remind you

110
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Tang Ke is also determined to get Siyang Garment Factory.

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
The two of them have been getting pretty close lately.

112
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,600
If I had known earlier that Lin Xiaoxiao

113
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,920
was the boss of that company,

114
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,879
I would never have gone to intern there.

115
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,240
You didn't see how arrogant she was.

116
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,560
She kept mocking me the whole time.

117
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,879
That brat,

118
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,399
who does she think she is?

119
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,199
Brother Tang,

120
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,199
what should I do?

121
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Actually, I think

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
you going to Lin Xiaoxiao's place

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
is pretty good.

124
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,560
Brother Tang,

125
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,319
what do you mean by that?

126
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm your woman, you know.

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,240
Are you really going to let her bully me?

128
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,120
This Lin Xiaoxiao,

129
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,480
she's been developing way too fast lately.

130
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,759
She's almost on the same level as me now.

131
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
You know Siyang Garment Factory, right?

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
They've started the bidding process.

133
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm planning to buy it as a factory.

134
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,360
But it turns out she's after it too.

135
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,519
So tell me,

136
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,439
if I knew her minimum bid in advance,

137
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,040
wouldn't that be a big advantage for us?

138
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,920
So,

139
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,839
you mean

140
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,120
you want me to be a spy?

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,319
I love how clever you are.

142
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,720
Then everything I do

143
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
is all for you.

144
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,279
You'd better treat me well.

145
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,560
I will treat you well.

146
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,759
Morning.

147
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,839
Good morning.

148
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,360
Morning.

149
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,199
Good morning.

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,879
Good morning.

151
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,519
You're here.

152
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,079
Here, sis, have some water.

153
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,079
Thank you.

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:26,959
Bro.

155
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,600
Have some water, bro.

156
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,079
Thank you.

157
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,480
Sis.

158
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll leave it here for you.

159
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,560
Thank you.

160
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,319
Bro.

161
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,279
Meeting materials.

162
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,920
Sis, meeting materials.

163
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,639
Bye.

164
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,160
Bye.

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Bye, sis.

166
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,120
Bye.

167
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,199
Bye.

168
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,199
Yue'er.

169
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,199
These past few days, Lin Xiaoyan

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,439
How has she been performing at the company?

171
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,360
She

172
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,959
has been working quite hard.

173
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,079
She doesn't talk much.

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,639
The colleagues at the company

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,759
seem to recognize her efforts.

176
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:03,800
Bye.

177
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:06,959
Bye, bro.

178
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:09,839
Director Lin.

179
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,759
You've changed a lot since you joined the company.

180
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,160
You're very different from how you used to be.

181
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,519
This work experience

182
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
is related to my school grades.

183
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,399
So I'll work really hard.

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,000
I won't slack off.

185
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,079
I also hope you can be lenient, Director Lin.

186
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,240
Director Lin.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,560
The bidding documents for Siyang Garment Factory are ready.

188
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,439
Please take a look.

189
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,159
I'll step out now, Director Lin.

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,679
This way, please.

191
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:58,639
Director Lin.

192
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,200
Miss Lin.

193
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:05,799
Director Zhang.

194
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,639
Hello, hello.

195
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,159
Hello.

196
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,480
Let's sit here and talk in detail.

197
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,919
Thank you for coming all this way yourself.

198
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,440
It's no problem.

199
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,120
I think everything is pretty good.

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,320
Just some details of the cooperation need to be sorted out.

201
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,120
Okay.

202
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:24,720
Alright.

203
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,120
I'll confirm with you then.

204
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,679
Sorry, Director Lin.

205
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
Why don't you take it off? I'll help you clean it.

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,279
Sorry about that.

207
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,000
It's fine, it's fine.

208
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's head over first.

209
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,879
I'll be quick.

210
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
That's good enough, I'm in a hurry.

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Director Lin, it'll be ready soon.

212
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,919
The stain has been cleaned.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,759
It's just still a bit damp.

214
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,559
Why don't you put it on first?

215
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,600
It'll dry quickly in the breeze.

216
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
Director Lin, you dropped your keys.
