1
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,159
Here we are.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,640
Old man.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,560
Old man.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,200
You're back.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,920
Old man.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,439
Who are you?

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,320
Why did you bring an outsider back?

8
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,079
Liang Keqing.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,000
From Yangcheng.

10
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,159
This is my friend.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Since he's your friend,

12
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,520
why don't you pour him a cup of tea?

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,000
Alright.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,640
You two go ahead and talk.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,879
Liang Keqing

16
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,760
Your Liang Group

17
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,560
wants to work with me,

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,959
at least show some sincerity.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,079
But you just sent a young kid like you.

20
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,599
Can you really make decisions?

21
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,159
As long as you're willing to work with me,

22
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,760
I promise

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,879
that during our cooperation,

24
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,480
there will be no limit on your research funding.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,439
And

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,719
according to the research progress,

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,599
you'll receive annual bonuses.

28
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,200
If there's anything you're dissatisfied with during our cooperation,

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,239
you can terminate the contract at any time.

30
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,200
I won't make things difficult for you.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,359
That's all.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,959
A couple of days ago, Liang Guang came to see me.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
The terms he offered

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,159
were much better than yours.

35
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,840
But you didn't work with him either.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Did you?

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,239
That proves what you care about isn't the terms.

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,000
Besides,

39
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,680
I understand you better than he does.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,719
Do you even know the basic principles of an engine?

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,640
Do you know the basic components of a crank and connecting rod?

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,480
A couple of days ago, Liang Guang came to see me.

43
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,359
At least he brought two experts with him.

44
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,159
What about you?

45
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,760
You don't even know the most basic knowledge in this field.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,960
And you still shamelessly claim

47
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,199
that you understand me.

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
But I know

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,319
that you were seriously ill when you were sent to the countryside.

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,039
It was Lin Xiaoxiao's family who saved your life.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
After her parents passed away,

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,560
you've been taking care of her.

53
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,759
You treat her like your own child.

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,439
Whether or not you want to work with me,

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
she is still my friend.

57
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,080
However,

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,719
Lin Xiaoxiao is going to Yangcheng.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
That place is full of all kinds of people.

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
If no one helps her out,

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,039
I can't guarantee that no one will cause her trouble.

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,479
I'm warning you, kid.

63
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,759
If you have a problem, come at me.

64
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,919
Don't make things difficult for Lin Xiaoxiao.

65
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,759
Old man,

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,319
I took some of your good green tea.

67
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,560
Don't feel bad about it.

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,039
What's going on? Why is it so awkward?

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,520
Nothing.

70
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,120
Uncle Fang was telling me stories about your childhood.

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,080
It seems

72
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,439
he treats you like his own daughter.

73
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,719
Isn't that right, Uncle Fang?

74
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,039
Yes.

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,240
If anyone dares to bully you,

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,719
I'll fight them with everything I've got.

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,439
It's getting late.

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll head back now.

79
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
Aren't you going to have some tea before you go?

80
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:06,879
No, that's alright.

81
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,840
Uncle Fang,

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
I'll come see you again tomorrow.

83
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,120
I hope I can get a satisfactory answer.

84
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,439
I'm leaving.

85
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,000
Come again another day, then.

86
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:19,879
Let's go, let's go.

87
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,199
Come on, get on the bus and buy your ticket.

88
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,280
Come on, let me see your ticket.

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,520
Come on.

90
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,240
Here's your ticket.

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
Move to the back, there are seats in the back.

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,840
Squeeze further back.

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,199
Don't crowd at the front.

94
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Move to the back, keep moving.

95
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,479
Those inside, move back as well.

96
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,560
Miss, where are you going?

97
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
Have an apple.

98
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,199
Thank you, but I don't want one.

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Have one, try it.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,439
Miss.

101
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,120
Are you by yourself?

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,719
Aren't you done yet?

103
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,360
What are you doing?

104
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,719
Can't you see the young lady doesn't want to talk to you?

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,800
Come here, miss.

106
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,280
Sit next to me.

107
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,039
Thank you.

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,639
It's okay.

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,000
Go away.

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Stay away from us.

111
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,560
Miss.

112
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,319
Just sit tight.

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,599
Don't worry.

114
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,319
What kind of person is that, really?

115
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,120
Mr. Fang

116
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Let's go.

117
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,720
Liang Keqing

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,759
I don't care what methods you use.

119
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,560
But you're the first person Xiaoxiao has brought to meet me.

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,920
So I hope you know your place.

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,199
Don't let her have any other expectations of you.

122
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,439
Mr. Fang, please rest assured.

123
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,439
My goal this time is to bring you safely back to Yangcheng.

124
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,639
Other than that,

125
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,319
I have no intentions toward Lin Xiaoxiao.

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,680
As long as you work for our Liang family in peace,

127
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,720
I guarantee

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
Lin Xiaoxiao's safety in Yangcheng.

129
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,240
You'd better keep your word.

130
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Otherwise,

131
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,720
your Liang family

132
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,120
won't get anything of research value from me.

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Come on, come on, everyone sit here and take a break.

134
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,480
Miss,

135
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Are you fetching water?

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,319
What do you want?

137
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,639
It's not safe to be out here alone.

138
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,480
Stay away from me.

139
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,199
Let me protect you.

140
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,160
Stay away from me.

141
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,639
Ouch, that's scalding!

142
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,439
Catch the pervert!

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,079
Catch the pervert!

144
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
What happened? Is something wrong?

145
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,480
Catch the pervert!

146
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,680
Over there!

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,240
Miss, are you alright?

148
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,879
I'm fine.

149
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,879
There was just a human trafficker.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,959
But I scalded him with hot water.

151
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,800
He probably ran away.

152
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,600
As long as you're okay.

153
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,800
You're a young woman,

154
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,519
you must be careful when you're out.

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,040
Yes.

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,959
You're heading to Yangcheng, right?

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,560
That's right.

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,439
The bus to Yangcheng has already left.

159
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I haven't gotten on the bus yet, wait for me!

160
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,639
Miss,

161
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,959
Miss,

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,959
Come over here.

163
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,199
Look, I brought all your luggage down.

164
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
That's great!

165
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,639
Thank you, ma'am.

166
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,959
It's all thanks to you.

167
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,720
No need to be so polite.

168
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,519
It's not easy for a young woman like you to travel alone.

169
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,319
You must be starving, have a pancake.

170
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,199
Thank you, ma'am.

171
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,639
You have it, I'm not hungry.

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,079
Oh, by the way,

173
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,920
Are you also going to Yangcheng to visit family?

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
I'm just going to have a look.

175
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,600
And maybe look for some opportunities.

176
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,360
See if I can do a little business.

177
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,160
I see.

178
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,399
Oh, right.

179
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
My brother-in-law will come pick me up later.

180
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,839
If it really doesn't work out,

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,879
you can ride with us when we leave.

182
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,519
Really?

183
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,519
It won't trouble you, will it?

184
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,800
Not at all.

185
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,879
You're also going to Yangcheng.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,480
That's right.

187
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,720
Then why didn't you get on the bus earlier?

188
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,399
And even helped me bring my luggage down?

189
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,839
Miss, listen to what you're saying.

190
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm just worried that someone bad might take your luggage.

191
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm helping you keep it safe.

192
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,920
It's fine, I won't trouble you anymore.

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,199
I'll wait a bit longer.

194
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,279
There should be another long-distance bus coming soon.

195
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,680
Look at the time.

196
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,560
It's almost dark.

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,839
There won't be any more buses in this remote area.

198
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,279
Miss, it's okay.

199
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,319
Let's go together.

200
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,399
It's alright, ma'am, don't worry about it.

201
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,319
Don't touch me.

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,839
Look.

203
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,240
Your brother-in-law's car is here, it's here.

204
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,680
Don't touch me.

205
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,839
It's very convenient.

206
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,399
Oh, just go.

207
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:48,720
What are you doing?

208
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,319
Let go of me.

209
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,000
Help!

210
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,560
Move.

211
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,240
Help!

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,839
Get in the car.

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,800
Behave yourself.

214
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,199
Go, go, go.

215
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,560
Drive.

216
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,040
That girl just now was taken by human traffickers.

217
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,519
You two, go report it to the police, hurry!

218
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:04,680
Mr. Fang.

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,480
This way, please.

220
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,319
Mr. Fang, please come inside.

221
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,160
President Liang.

222
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Please, no need to see me off.

223
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,439
Keqing.

224
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,759
You've had a hard journey.

225
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,639
You invited Professor Fang here.

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,839
That was a great contribution to our company.

227
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
I must thank you on behalf of the company.

228
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,080
If you want anything, just say it.

229
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,919
Working for the company

230
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
is what I should do.

231
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:38,879
But, Second Uncle,

232
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,879
in what capacity are you thanking me on behalf of the company?

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't forget,

234
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,960
the "Liang" in Liang Guang

235
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,919
is my father's "Liang."

236
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,320
What do you mean by that?

237
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,519
Don't move.

238
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
Alright, alright, that's enough.

239
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,279
We're all family.

240
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,360
No need to argue.

241
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,480
Chairman Liang has worked hard for so many years.

242
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,480
He'll have to retire sooner or later.

243
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,240
In the end,

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,720
won't we still have to rely on your second uncle?

245
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,039
Even if Chairman Liang retires,

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,279
who it will be then

247
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,039
isn't certain.

248
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,080
What are you talking about?

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,519
Sorry, Second Uncle.

250
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,960
The younger ones don't know the rules.

251
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,120
Move aside.

252
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,159
Something happened.

253
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,919
People at the station said

254
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,200
Lin Xiaoxiao got off halfway.

255
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
They said she ran into human traffickers.

256
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,279
Were you all captured and brought here too?

257
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:10,960
That's right.

258
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:11,799
Watch them.

259
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
You, go take a look.

260
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,679
Come on, your turn.

261
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,840
Keep going, keep going.

262
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,480
Come on, keep it up.

263
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:17,960
Sit down, sit down.

264
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,080
Stop struggling.

265
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,360
You can't escape.

266
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,480
So we just have to wait here to be sold off to the mountains?

267
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,279
Being sold is actually the better outcome.

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,799
What about those who can't be sold?

269
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:34,840
What are you arguing about?

270
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,639
Everyone, behave yourselves.

271
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,000
Especially you.
