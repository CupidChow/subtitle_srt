1
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:47,759
I, Yue Jingzhe

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,479
today

3
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,560
am going to propose to the girl I love, Zhong Xin,

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,719
today.

5
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,799
Zhong Xin

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,079
Will you marry me?

7
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,200
What are you looking at?

8
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,359
We're all just people.

9
00:00:59,439 --> 00:00:59,960
Don't be like this.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,520
No.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,159
A Zhe

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,799
Get up first.

13
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,880
I'll get up if you put it on.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,439
Stop messing around, get up first.

15
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,439
I'll get up if you put it on.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I told you to get up, so get up.

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,159
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
What are you all looking at? Move along.

19
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:13,879
Move along, move along, move along.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,439
Let's disperse.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,519
Why are you angry?

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
Is it because of the sense of ceremony?

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,239
Then I'll come up with a new one for you.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,920
And I'll make you cry your eyes out.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,959
Can you say yes first?

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,439
Please?

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,719
A Zhe

28
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,159
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,040
I know you really like me.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
I do like you.

31
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,079
But liking is just liking.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,439
Marriage is marriage.

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,359
But if you like someone,

34
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,439
isn't it to marry her?

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,319
And spend your whole life together?

36
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,840
I've already decided to go abroad.

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,040
Next month.

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,079
I'm leaving next month.

39
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:42,840
That's fine.

40
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,000
I can wait until you come back.

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,920
I'll get you a bigger diamond ring.

42
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,480
Once I leave, I'm not coming back.

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,879
You know.

44
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:58,760
You know too.

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,920
So all of you knew?

46
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,799
So I'm the only fool here, is that it?

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,319
Do you want it?

48
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,800
You don't want it.

49
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,280
If you don't want it, I will.

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,240
No, no, no.

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,639
A Zhe, A Zhe, A Zhe!

52
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,919
Spit it out, A Zhe!

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Hurry, spit it out!

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,599
Go after him, quickly!

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,680
A Zhe!

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,319
A Zhe!

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,080
Sis.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,560
Let's go, let's go.

59
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,479
Stop buying, stop buying.

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,879
Go, get out.

61
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,919
No business today.

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:40,759
Hurry up and leave.

63
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,240
Go.

64
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,080
Get out.

65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,599
Where did you all come from?

66
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,280
So annoying.

67
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,479
Get out of here right now!

68
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,039
Get out.

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,879
What are you doing?

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,360
Why are you getting physical?

71
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,280
Lin Sufen, right?

72
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,719
That's me, your auntie.

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
Let me tell you all something.

74
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,680
I've seen plenty of thugs like you.

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,840
Get out of here now.

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,840
Or else...

77
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,080
I'll call for help.

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Take a good look.

79
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,639
Your daughter borrowed money in your name.

80
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm here to collect the debt.

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,439
Lin Xiaoxiao

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,879
Have you thought about the transfer?

83
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:15,680
Come out.

84
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,560
Auntie.

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,280
Xiaoxiao had something to do and went out.

86
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,280
She told me.

87
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,960
You can just sign the contract with me.

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,639
This is such a big matter.

89
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,199
Can a little girl like you make the decision?

90
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,080
Auntie.

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,479
You can't say that.

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,879
I am indeed young.

93
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
But since I’m here,

94
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,400
it means Xiaoxiao trusts me, right?

95
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,479
That Lin Xiaoxiao, such a brat.

96
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,280
She’d rather trust outsiders

97
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,360
and not even

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,719
give her own aunt a hand.

99
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,159
When you took advantage of her,

100
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,719
did you ever think she was your own niece?

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Watch your mouth.

102
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,680
About this contract—

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,319
No.

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
My shop is so big,

105
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,759
and you’re only giving me this little transfer fee?

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,919
Sign it if you want.

107
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,400
No, no, no.

108
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,319
Don’t be like that, I’m just asking you.

109
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,919
Sis, you’re here.

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,759
Lin Sufen signed the contract without saying a word.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,639
Yeah, the contract is right here.

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,360
She was so quick to sign for a business that doesn’t make money.

113
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,399
That’s not like Lin Sufen at all.

114
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,000
Who are you people?

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,800
How did you get in?

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Who are you?

117
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,759
Why do you care who I am?

118
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,199
Cut the nonsense.

119
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,480
Move, move, move.

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,399
We’re not leaving until we clear this up today.

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
No one is leaving.

122
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,879
You think you can bully us because you have more people?

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,120
Fine.

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Take a good look.

125
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,800
Lin Sufen owes me money.

126
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,639
She mortgaged this shop to me.

127
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,199
It’s written in the agreement.

128
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,079
It’s all clearly written in black and white.

129
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
This is indeed Lin Sufen’s handwriting.

130
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,639
She mortgaged the shop to you.

131
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,399
But we have a transfer contract.

132
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,879
We were all deceived.

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,959
You say she borrowed money, but did she really?

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,040
I had no idea about this.

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
Who knows where you got

136
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,439
this worthless IOU from?

137
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,519
Are you here to scam me?

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:32,959
Fine.

139
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,639
I’ll go to Yangcheng right now.

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,199
And find Lin Xiaoyan.

141
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,680
Don’t go.

142
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,279
Lin Xiaoyan

143
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,439
She’s just a student.

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
She doesn’t have any money.

145
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,720
If she has no money, she still has people, doesn’t she?

146
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,319
Let your daughter keep my guys company for a few days.

147
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,360
Then the debt will be paid.

148
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,920
I’ll pay, I’ll pay.

149
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,839
I’ll pay.

150
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,600
As long as you

151
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,639
don’t go after my daughter,

152
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,439
I’ll pay even if I have to sell everything I own.

153
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,120
Alright.

154
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,839
I’ll give you three more days.

155
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,319
If you can’t pay in three days,

156
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,279
don’t blame me for what happens next.

157
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,879
That Lin Sufen is such a wretched woman.

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,519
She actually dared to sell the same shop to two people.

159
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,279
Boss Wang,

160
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,639
we're all just doing business here.

161
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,519
There's no need to get upset over Lin Sufen.

162
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,199
Harmony brings wealth, after all.

163
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,279
How about this:

164
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,959
Give us three days.

165
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,240
We'll find Lin Sufen.

166
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,680
You get your money,

167
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,800
and I get my shop.

168
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,680
How does that sound?

169
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,079
Another three days?

170
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,920
You said it.

171
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,680
Three days.

172
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,519
Three days.

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,360
Just three days.

174
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,519
I'll go check the old Lin family house.

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,279
Brother Xiao Wu,

176
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,279
you have a lot of connections.

177
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,959
Send some people to ask around the streets.

178
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,439
See if anyone has seen Lin Sufen.

179
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:03,839
Alright.

180
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,439
Let's go.

181
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,120
Yue'er,

182
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,079
don't just stand around.

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
Go check all the inns and guesthouses.

184
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,360
Who knows if she's hiding in one of them.

185
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:09,800
Okay.

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,480
What are you doing?

187
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,600
I've been really busy.

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,519
I haven't seen you lately.

189
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:33,839
Alright.

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,879
Let's head back to the dorm first.

191
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,360
Sure.

192
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,240
You guys go ahead.

193
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,240
Mom.

194
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,600
Why are you here?

195
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,319
I'm at school, studying.

196
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,360
You need to use your brain.

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,399
You should eat more eggs, okay?

198
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,199
When you're growing,

199
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
you also need to eat more vegetables.

200
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,319
Don't skip them.

201
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Yan'er.

202
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,240
This is all money.

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,959
Mom got it from that brat Lin Xiaoxiao.

204
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,199
It's all for you.

205
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,560
Why are you spacing out?

206
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,399
Hurry, take it.

207
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Mom.

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,480
The fact that you're wanted for fraud

209
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,680
has spread everywhere.

210
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
How do you still dare to come see me?

211
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
I don't care whether it's a scam or not.

212
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
All I know is I got the money.

213
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,279
It has to be sent to my daughter.

214
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,319
Now there's money.

215
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Only then can my daughter go to school with peace of mind, right?

216
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,919
She'll have a bright future.

217
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
And find a good family to marry into.

218
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Hurry, take it.

219
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,080
Mom.

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,039
Don't worry.

221
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,799
I definitely won't let you down.

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,279
When I graduate,

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
I'll make sure to take good care of you.

224
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,320
Our Yan'er

225
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,600
is the most filial.

226
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,039
Good child.

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,200
Mom, you sit here for a bit.

228
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm going to the restroom.

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,320
Okay.

230
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,360
Then go quickly, go on.

231
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,440
Don't leave.

232
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,159
Wait for me to come back.

233
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,679
I won't leave.

234
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,840
I'll wait for you.

235
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,440
Lin Sufen.

236
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:26,559
That's you, right?

237
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
You are suspected of commercial fraud.

238
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
Please come with us to assist in the investigation.

239
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,000
Take her away.

240
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,399
Get in the car.

241
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:53,759
Let's go.

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,360
Go inside.

243
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Xiaoyan,

244
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,799
your performance in the trade courses you majored in these past two years

245
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,639
has been outstanding.

246
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,200
So the school has decided

247
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
to recommend you to

248
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,000
intern at a garment trading company.

249
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,000
This is to

250
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,840
prepare you for entering society

251
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,759
and lay a solid foundation for your future.

252
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,840
Thank you, Director.

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,080
But this company

254
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,240
has very high requirements.

255
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,799
You must go through a round

256
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
of strict interviews.

257
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,000
Also,

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,200
your internship performance

259
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,879
will be directly linked to your graduation results.

260
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,759
How you perform during the internship

261
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
will become

262
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,240
part of your comprehensive graduation evaluation.

263
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,039
So

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
you must give it your all.

265
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,320
Don't worry, Director.

266
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,000
I definitely won't let the school down.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Excuse me, hello.

268
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,879
I'm Lin Xiaoyan, recommended by Yangcheng University.

269
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm here for the interview.

270
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,159
I'm here for the interview.

271
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,480
Students from Yangcheng University really are different.

272
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,080
We've already heard about your excellent grades.

273
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,399
Come,

274
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,320
I'll take you upstairs.

275
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,919
Thank you.

276
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,440
Lin Xiaoxiao?

277
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,440
What are you doing here?
