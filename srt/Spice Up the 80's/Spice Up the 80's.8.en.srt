1
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
This way, Mr. Liang.

2
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,479
Young Master Liang.

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,799
What brings you here?

4
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,439
Call someone.

5
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,280
Young Master Liang.

6
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,039
We haven't heard from you in months.

7
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,280
I was really worried something might have happened to you.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,159
Even Mr. Tang, as a senior, hasn't left yet.

9
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,120
As a junior,

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,239
how could I dare to leave early?

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,799
I just love how he talks.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,840
Let me introduce you.

13
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,560
This is called the Yangcheng Economic and Technological Cooperation Conference.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,519
Such a formal occasion

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,159
isn't really suitable for young masters like you.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,079
But you came too, didn't you?

17
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,359
We're not the same.

18
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,560
The organizers were too enthusiastic.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,159
They insisted I accept some kind of

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,519
What?

21
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,159
Annual

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,879
Best Enterprise Award.

23
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,280
It wouldn't be right not to come.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,159
Is that so?

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,280
Then congratulations.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,239
Today's entrepreneur conference

27
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,519
is attended by all the heavyweights.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,319
Our upstream suppliers in Tianhe,

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,359
downstream malls,

30
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,239
and the heads of distribution and channels will all be here.

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,799
As long as you can help me win over those few key people,

32
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,439
I can help you.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,359
How am I supposed to win them over?

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,640
How well can you hold your liquor?

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
I used to work in a restaurant.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,599
Half a jin.

37
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,400
Half a jin?

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Anyone who says half a jin can actually drink a whole jin.

39
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:06,920
Let's go.

40
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,840
We can't reach an agreement.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
This price won't work.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Forget it, forget it.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,039
What do you think about this batch of goods?

44
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,039
We still need to take another look.

45
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,479
Zhong Xin.

46
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:27,759
Mr. Tang

47
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,240
Long time no see.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,560
I'm Zhong Xin, I do clothing wholesale in Tianhe.

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,520
You don't remember me?

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,960
It's been a while.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,599
It's been a while.

52
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,759
Let me introduce you.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,639
This is

54
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,840
our company's deputy general manager,

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,479
Lin Xiaoxiao.

56
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
She's admired you for a long time.

57
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,639
She's always wanted to meet you.

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:45,919
Hello.

59
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,639
Hello, Mr. Tang.

60
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,280
It's nice to meet you, please take care of me.

61
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,319
I've heard a lot about you.

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,599
I've heard about you for a long time.

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
You're the trendsetter of the Yangcheng clothing market.

64
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,000
In the future,

65
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,240
we'll definitely learn from you.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,159
No problem.

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,960
Besides,

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,280
both of you are beautiful ladies.

69
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,120
Come by anytime.

70
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,159
Please, have a seat.

71
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,199
Mr. Tang, you really know how to talk.

72
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,520
Come, come, come.

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,680
Have a seat.

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Distinguished guests,

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,039
It is an honor to invite you all to this conference.

76
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,479
The purpose of this conference is to enhance

77
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
economic exchange and technological cooperation between different regions.

78
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,599
I wish this grand event a complete success.

79
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,080
Mr. Tang,

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,680
Mr. Zhao,

81
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,639
Let me toast to you.

82
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,360
Let me toast to you.

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
I've heard from Sister Xin for a long time

84
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,439
that not only is your business impressive,

85
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,199
but you can also really hold your liquor.

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,879
I must learn from you.

87
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,960
We just agreed,

88
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,759
ten thousand cotton jackets.

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,159
You can only send them to me.

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,919
My distributors

91
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,159
are all eagerly waiting.

92
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,240
Don't worry.

93
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
This batch of goods

94
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,919
was actually reserved especially for you.

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,919
Guangzhou is such a big city,

96
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,159
we have to

97
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,280
look after our own people.

98
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,400
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

99
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,360
That's the situation.

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:53,879
A toast to you.

101
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,439
Come on.

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:54,800
A toast to you.

103
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,479
Let's drink together.

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,759
Come, let's drink together.

105
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,759
Come, come, come.

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,439
Take care of our little sister.

107
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,039
Alright.

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,400
Thank you, Mr. Tang. A toast to you.

109
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:02,759
Bottoms up!

110
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Cheers!

111
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,759
Mr. Tang

112
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,199
Come, come, come.

113
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,560
Sorry about that.

114
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,360
Come on.

115
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
Sorry for being late, everyone.

116
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,120
Come on.

117
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
Let me give everyone a grand introduction.

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,079
This is the top student from Yangcheng.

119
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,480
She is also the student representative for this event.

120
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,959
Lin Xiaoyan

121
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,959
Nice to meet you all.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Please, have a seat.

123
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,240
Let's sit and chat.

124
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,120
Lin Xiaoxiao

125
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:35,959
Lin Xiaoyan

126
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,879
You two

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Could it be that you are

128
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,399
sisters?

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
I didn't expect to see you here.

130
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,199
Little sister

131
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,759
It's really been a long time.

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,439
Long time no see.

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,959
On such a wonderful day

134
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,040
it's rare for the two sisters to meet in Yangcheng.

135
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,439
I propose

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,839
that we all

137
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,240
raise a glass to these two beautiful ladies.

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,519
But there's something everyone might not know.

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,040
This glass of wine

140
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,639
should be toasted

141
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,480
only to my little sister Xiaoxiao.

142
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,839
How should I put this?

143
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040
My little sister,

144
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,480
just got married recently.

145
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,279
We all have to share in the happiness, right?

146
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:09,920
What?

147
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,879
You're already married?

148
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
I really couldn't tell.

149
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,319
Congratulations!

150
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,319
Where's your husband?

151
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,360
At such an important occasion,

152
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,079
why didn't he come with you?

153
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,720
You sisters have plenty of time to catch up.

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,879
Come on, let me raise a glass.

155
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,120
This glass is for my sister.

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,160
Wishing her a happy marriage and an early child. Cheers!

157
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,920
To my sister!

158
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,000
Happy wedding!

159
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,680
Boss Tang,

160
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,680
please don't mind,

161
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,839
I can't drink this glass.

162
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm not married.

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,959
Then how come I heard

164
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,199
the Wang family already sent you a few hundred yuan as a bride price?

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
They already transferred it to you.

166
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,560
That bride price money,

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,759
I didn't accept it either.

168
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,680
Really?

169
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,120
That's really not easy.

170
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
Our hometown is in the mountains,

171
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,399
if you want to make something of yourself,

172
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
there's only one way.

173
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,879
That's getting into college.

174
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,319
But my sister,

175
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,759
didn't even get into college.

176
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,199
She started a business in Yangcheng.

177
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,480
It seems that behind all this,

178
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,879
she must have put in a lot

179
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
of unseen effort.

180
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,600
My sister is right.

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,480
I really did put in a lot of effort to come to Yangcheng.

182
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
I made a lot of efforts that no one knows about.

183
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,959
My parents passed away when I was very young.

184
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,319
I had to make a living while studying.

185
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,000
All so that one day

186
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,199
I could attend Yangcheng University with pride.

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,759
But my own aunt

188
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,360
for just eight hundred yuan

189
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
on the day of my college entrance exam

190
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,000
arranged a marriage for me

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,480
with a man I didn't even know.

192
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,319
Everyone,

193
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
do you think I should go through with this marriage?

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
Arranged marriage...

195
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,040
People in the countryside still do this nowadays?

196
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,639
Well...

197
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,319
I don't know.

198
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,279
If you ask me,

199
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
that aunt of hers

200
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,120
isn't a good person either.

201
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,680
So,

202
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
all the bride price

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,399
was kept by your aunt?

204
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

205
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Eight hundred yuan.

206
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,120
In just three months,

207
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,000
where was I supposed to earn that money?

208
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,639
I hadn't even gone to college.

209
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,199
I could only find a job at a restaurant.

210
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,079
I worked as a waitress.

211
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,600
Later, I became a supervisor.

212
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,000
I sold juice for a while.

213
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,800
It wasn't easy, but I finally got into the clothing business.

214
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,439
Honestly, I'm actually quite grateful to my aunt.

215
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,519
If it weren't for my aunt,

216
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
I wouldn't have been able to see my sister in Yangcheng.

217
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:12,759
Right?

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,360
When would I ever have the chance

219
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,920
to sit at the same table with all you distinguished business leaders?

220
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,519
You are all veterans of the industry.

221
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,120
Your stories of success must be more impressive than the last.

222
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,279
My own little story

223
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,079
is only worth telling because you’re being polite.

224
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,240
So I’ll go ahead and share it.

225
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,360
Let’s just enjoy it for fun.

226
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,120
You

227
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,959
Over these years,

228
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,240
the policies have been favorable,

229
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,879
and more and more people are doing business.

230
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
It’s just getting more and more crowded.

231
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,199
For President Lin, as a woman to get this far,

232
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,040
it’s truly not easy.

233
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,439
Let me make my position clear here,

234
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,959
as long as I’m in Tianhe,

235
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,560
there will always be a place for you and Zhong Xin.

236
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:48,839
Come,

237
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,800
Thank you, President Tang.

238
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,199
To all the heroes here,

239
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
we’ll do our best.

240
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,959
Let’s drink!

241
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,319
Cheers!

242
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,279
Bottoms up!

243
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,480
No leaving any behind!

244
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,040
Alright.

245
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:01,959
Please, sit.

246
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,519
Next,

247
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,160
let’s warmly welcome our special guest tonight,

248
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,639
an outstanding entrepreneur from Yangcheng,

249
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,199
a leader in the industry,

250
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,399
Liang Keqing.

251
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,560
President Liang, please come to the stage.

252
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,319
Alright.

253
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,879
Mr. Liang

254
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,720
First of all

255
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,439
Thank you to the organizers for the invitation

256
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,839
and thank you all for coming

257
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,919
The development of our country

258
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,679
would not be possible without the contributions of everyone here

259
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,559
I also hope that in the coming year

260
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,759
I, Liang Keqing

261
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,039
can work together with each of you present

262
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,279
Mr. Liang

263
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,519
I heard that the Liang Group

264
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,320
will soon make new moves in self-developed engines

265
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,240
and take new actions

266
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,360
Could you share a bit about that with us?

267
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,840
Sorry

268
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,039
I can't disclose that

269
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,480
It's said that Liang Group has acquired several machinery factories in succession

270
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,080
Is this to lay out a plan for the high-precision machinery industry?

271
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,000
That's a business secret

272
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm not at liberty to say

273
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,639
Then, regarding the Liang Group's development in the coming years

274
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,399
could you talk to us about that?

275
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,279
Let's move to the next question

276
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,759
Thank you, Mr. Liang, for answering our questions

277
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,159
It was truly enlightening

278
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,559
Next, we will move on to

279
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
the much-anticipated dance segment

280
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
I wonder

281
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,399
Mr. Liang

282
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,519
if I might have the honor

283
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,159
of being your partner for the opening dance

284
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,759
Miss Lin Xiaoxiao

285
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,559
Would I have the honor tonight

286
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,720
to invite you for a dance?

287
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,679
This dress really suits you.

288
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,799
I didn't expect that.

289
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,200
Mr. Liang is quite thoughtful.

290
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,919
He even prepared all the jewelry for you.

291
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,080
To receive such favor from Mr. Liang,

292
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,000
you're the first one.

293
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,279
I heard that

294
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,679
those socialites who attend the banquets,

295
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,600
Mr. Liang doesn't even glance at them.

296
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't talk about this outside.

297
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,320
Do you understand?

298
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

299
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
A country girl wants to become a phoenix.

300
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
What a foolish dream.
