1
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,159
Second Brother

2
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,439
It's already come to this point.

3
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,640
Why don't you say something?

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,920
Now Lin Xiaoxiao

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
has signed contracts worth tens of millions with foreigners.

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,280
Our report about financial embezzlement

7
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,719
has fallen apart on its own.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,840
That investment from Liang Keqing

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,079
is definitely going to make a profit.

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,000
The more Lin Xiaoxiao earns,

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,240
the higher the return on investment for our Liang Group.

12
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,759
It's a good thing to make money.

13
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,520
What's there to panic about?

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,880
But Liang Keqing has come back.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,039
Doesn't that mean all our efforts were for nothing?

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,120
So what if he's back?

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,680
The company's money is in my hands.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,319
All the senior management have sided with me.

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,640
If he obediently calls me Second Uncle,

20
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,840
for the sake of the eldest brother,

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,519
I can still give him a way out.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,239
But if he doesn't know what's good for him,

23
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,079
just as he got out,

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,480
I can send him right back in.

25
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,480
Elders,

26
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,799
President Liang has returned.

27
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,359
He has a few words to say to you.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Please.

29
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:36,799
Everyone,

30
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:37,840
please have a seat first.

31
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,079
All the elders of the family are here.

32
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,680
Why hasn't Liang Keqing shown up yet?

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,879
Second Uncle

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
My chair

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Are you still comfortable sitting in it?

36
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,359
Your chair

37
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,599
Second Uncle already threw it out for you.

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,079
This one now

39
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,959
is what Second Uncle worked his whole life for

40
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,400
to get.

41
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,519
It's fine if it's gone.

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,479
After all, the old must go for the new to come.

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
If a company has too many old things

44
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,360
it really does affect its development.

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
You called us brothers over here

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,639
for what?

47
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,919
Just say it straight.

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,199
With just this little money

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,879
you want to buy my shares?

50
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,319
Do you think I, Liang Guang, am a beggar?

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
I learned this from you, after all.

52
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,840
As long as you sign the contract

53
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,159
the year-end bonus

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,039
I won't short you a single cent.

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Liang Keqing

56
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,520
I really underestimated you.

57
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,759
You want to go up against me, huh?

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
If you have the guts, kick me out of the company.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,680
Second Uncle

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Calm down.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,159
I've prepared a gift for you all.

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,039
The contents are quite interesting.

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,159
Maybe you'll like it.

64
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,479
Uncle Shao

65
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,400
I-I'm here.

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
I'm listening.

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
Director Liang

68
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,840
Please, go ahead.

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
The materials you prepared last month were put into storage.

70
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,280
These days,

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,719
the quality inspection department will be coming to review.

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,159
I've thought it over.

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,479
I decided not to submit these materials.

74
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you think that's appropriate?

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,840
Yes, that's appropriate.

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,599
But...

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,039
As for company matters,

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,120
I'll do whatever you say.

79
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,599
I'll follow your instructions completely.

80
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,639
Uncle Zheng

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm here.

82
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,800
Although using your position

83
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,000
to take kickbacks isn't anything new,

84
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
you've taken too much.

85
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,520
But I understand you.

86
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,919
After all, your grandson is going abroad to study.

87
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,159
It's natural to want to save more money.

88
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,319
Uncle San

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,199
Don't worry.

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,199
This is a mistake every man makes.

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,319
I understand.

92
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,560
Uncle Er

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
There are some things I won't explain to you one by one.

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,120
Whether it's prison food or New Year's dinner,

95
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,920
that's your choice.

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,439
You...

97
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,399
Does it really take that long to get from the detention center to the shop?

98
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,560
Does it really take that long?

99
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,639
Why did it take so long to get here?

100
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
My legs are swollen from standing so long.

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
I went home and took a shower.

102
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,959
I changed my clothes.

103
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,360
I also took care of those old men’s issues while I was at it.

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,600
Can you not carry such a heavy burden?

105
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,879
Not anymore.

106
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,560
Just a little.

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,079
I heard that for my sake,

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
you almost mortgaged the company.

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,160
Does it hurt?

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,800
It does.

111
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you regret it?

112
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:24,959
I don’t.

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,800
Let’s go.

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,879
I have a gift for you.

115
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,720
A gift for me?

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Didn’t this shop close down a long time ago?

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,439
How is it open again?

118
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,879
I bought it.

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,800
This shop

120
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,519
is where we had our first date.

121
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,959
I even restored it to how it used to look.

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,800
What do you think?

123
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,079
Do you like it?

124
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,600
Mr. Liang, are you making too much money these days?

125
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,480
Is it burning a hole in your pocket?

126
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,639
Why did you buy it?

127
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,879
Two years ago, right at that spot,

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,279
I waited for you all alone.

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,279
Everyone else was in pairs.

130
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,279
Do you remember?

131
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
It’s New Year’s Eve—three dishes aren’t enough, right?

132
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
No need to save money for me.

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,439
Let’s eat as much as we want.

134
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,160
Except for these three dishes,

135
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,199
I want everything else.

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,519
What is it?

137
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,800
Mr. Lin,

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,639
do you still need to pay the bill?

139
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
Is it even my turn to pay anymore?

140
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,600
To me,

141
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,279
this place has a special meaning.

142
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,639
It witnessed our love.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,680
So,

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,920
Mr. Lin,

145
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,439
will you spend New Year's Eve with me again next year?

146
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
Not just next year,

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,959
but every year from now on.

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,160
What's wrong?

149
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,639
Can't you stay with me a little longer?

150
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,399
Lin Xiaoxiao,

151
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,560
is even working with foreigners now.

152
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,600
If I don't come up with something soon,

153
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
in this Yangcheng,

154
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,040
I won't be able to stay here anymore.

155
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,120
Tang Ke

156
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,480
Let's get married.

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
It's New Year's Eve today, after all.

158
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,759
I want to go back with you too.

159
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
To meet your parents.

160
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,680
Isn't the way we are now good enough?

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,319
But I want you to marry me openly and honorably.

162
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,160
I want people to see me in the future

163
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,600
and call me Mrs. Tang.

164
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,040
Alright.

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,959
Mrs. Tang.

166
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,480
This matter

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,519
let's talk about it later.

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Tang Ke.

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
Are you crazy?

170
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,279
I provide for your food, clothes, and spending.

171
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,439
That's enough, isn't it?

172
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,800
If you dare to leave today,

173
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,399
do you believe

174
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,199
do you believe I'll just bring some random guy back?

175
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,000
Go ahead.

176
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,240
It's not like you haven't done it before.

177
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
Director Wu,

178
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,360
Manager Liu,

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,240
You haven't hooked up with enough of them?

180
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,040
You jerk!

181
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,079
Didn't I do all this for you?

182
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
You did that for me?

183
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
You did it for money.

184
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,720
Why don't you take a good look at yourself?

185
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,919
You're just someone any man can have.

186
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,200
Trash.

187
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,320
So you're just going to trample on my feelings like this?

188
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,679
Then neither of us should live.

189
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,440
Do you believe I'll expose all your dirty secrets tomorrow?

190
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
Let's die together.

191
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,480
Screw you!

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Someone, come here.

193
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,080
Mr. Tang.

194
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,519
Take care of it thoroughly.

195
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,159
Yes.

196
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,279
Gentlemen,

197
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,720
you are all prominent figures in the Guangzhou fashion industry.

198
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,679
If we let Lin Xiaoxiao get the upper hand,

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,799
our reputation

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,759
would be ruined.

201
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
There's nothing we can do.

202
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,320
She's already doing business with foreigners.

203
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,919
We're out of options too.

204
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,240
Even a hero needs help.

205
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
A fence needs three stakes for support.

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,879
As long as we work together,

207
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
we can make Lin Xiaoxiao

208
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,399
shut down her business.

209
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
To be honest with you all,

210
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,639
I already have

211
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,639
Lin Xiaoxiao's production samples in my hands.

212
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,519
With these samples,

213
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
copying them

214
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,399
won't be hard, right?

215
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,799
As long as we have the samples,

216
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,919
I can make them look even more authentic than the originals.

217
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,399
The only worry is

218
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,879
if we use their "Double Hook" brand without permission,

219
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,159
we might get sued.

220
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,679
Then let's register a new trademark.

221
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
Theirs is called "Double Hook,"

222
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,799
I'll call ours "Two Hooks."

223
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,039
As long as the style and logo are the same,

224
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,759
and we launch it to the market first,

225
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:06,840
gentlemen,

226
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,360
who can tell which is real and which is fake?

227
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,000
Who can really say for sure?

228
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,840
Go ahead, tell me.

229
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
All these years living abroad,

230
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,440
how have you been?

231
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,919
Other than not getting used to the food,

232
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
everything else has been fine.

233
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,480
How about you?

234
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,799
Me?

235
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,559
Same as always.

236
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
There's something

237
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,039
I've always been curious about.

238
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,919
I've always wanted to ask you.

239
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,720
Go ahead.

240
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,279
It's about

241
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,519
that ring.

242
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Did you really swallow it?
