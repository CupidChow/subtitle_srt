1
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,119
All shares of Liang Group under my name

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,880
as well as the positions of Chairman and President

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,240
shall be inherited by my only son

4
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,359
Liang Keqing.

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
The above is Mr. Liang's will before his passing.

6
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,280
The full reading is now complete.

7
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:50,439
Thank you for your hard work.

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,159
Keqing,

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,079
logically speaking,

10
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,560
our eldest brother has handed the group over to you.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,840
I should assist you according to his wishes.

12
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,400
But after all,

13
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,079
for so many years,

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,040
you've never been involved in the company's business.

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Things here are very complicated.

16
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:11,920
Second Uncle,

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,560
we're all family here.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,480
Just say what you want to say.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,879
The Liang Group's legacy

20
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,560
was built through the hard work of us brothers.

21
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,239
I really can't trust handing it over to

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,400
an inexperienced young man.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,719
Sign this contract.

24
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,040
The shares your father left you,

25
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,280
I'm willing to buy them all back.

26
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,319
This muddy water

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,879
is best for you not to wade into.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,920
As for

29
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,760
the year-end bonus you deserve,

30
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,359
you won't miss out on it.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,920
This is for your own good,

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,040
and for the good of Liang Group.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,359
I respect you

34
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,719
and call you Second Uncle,

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
but don't take advantage of your seniority.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,159
It seems this old face of your Second Uncle

37
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,159
really can't compare to

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,120
Lin Xiaoxiao, to whom you gave nineteen million.

39
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,079
Let's go.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,080
By the way,

41
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,000
that company of your little lover

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,800
even if it gets this money,

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,879
still

44
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,439
will be running at a loss.

45
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,439
Since it's an investment,

46
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,759
there are both risks and rewards.

47
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,280
You don't need to worry about it.

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,639
A Zhe,

49
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,199
see your second uncle out.

50
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,439
Since I've already said this much as your second uncle,

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
and you still insist on doing things your way,

52
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,719
then let's see

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
which one of us

54
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,280
will have the last laugh.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,919
Ms. Lin Xiaoxiao

56
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,319
When Liang Group initiated a financial audit,

57
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,080
they discovered that the group president, Liang Keqing,

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
was suspected of embezzlement.

59
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,240
Without following the proper contract procedures,

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,240
he made a large investment in your company.

61
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,039
Please cooperate with our investigation.

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,319
Mr. Liang,

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,680
why did you invest in Tingting Yuli Trading Company?

64
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,520
First,

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,199
I am very optimistic about the prospects of Tingting Yuli Trading Company.

66
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,080
Second,

67
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,639
I also obtained my father's

68
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,759
the former chairman of Liang Group, consent.

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,080
I believe

70
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,199
this is a very reasonable business decision.

71
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,000
There is nothing wrong with it.

72
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,800
Ms. Lin,

73
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,800
can you tell us

74
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,479
why you accepted Mr. Liang Keqing's help?

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,039
First, I want to clarify

76
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,360
that Tingting Yuli exchanged 30% of its shares

77
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,360
for this investment from Liang Group.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
This is a normal business partnership.

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,759
He is not helping me.

80
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,680
What is your relationship with Ms. Lin?

81
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
We are business partners.

82
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,319
In our personal lives,

83
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,599
we are a couple.

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,520
We do have a personal relationship.

85
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,840
But this relationship

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,439
has not affected our business dealings.

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,759
Ms. Lin,

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
thank you very much for your cooperation.

89
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,960
Once you sign your name here,

90
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,759
you may leave.

91
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,960
When can Liang Keqing leave?

92
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,360
His situation is more serious.

93
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,199
He needs to continue cooperating with our investigation.

94
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,759
Thank you.

95
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,199
Based on the current number of orders the company holds

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,079
there's still a gap compared to the investment Mr. Liang made back then

97
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,319
of over ten million yuan

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
Unless the company can, within a month

99
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,800
make up for this shortfall

100
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,399
only then can Mr. Liang's investment

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,759
be classified as a sound investment

102
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,959
One month

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,000
How could we possibly get that many orders in such a short time?

104
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,160
Then we have to take the initiative

105
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,759
Within a month

106
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,360
whether it's through personal favors or social connections

107
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,279
do whatever it takes to bring in those orders

108
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,240
Yes

109
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Let's go

110
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:13,800
Hello

111
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,480
Okay

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,759
Alright, alright

113
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,839
Hello

114
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,759
Hello

115
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,199
Mr. Huang

116
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,399
Please consider it

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:25,839
No, that's not it

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,720
Previously, we

119
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,120
had a pleasant cooperation

120
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
It was a pleasure working together

121
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,519
Alright, it's fine, no problem

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,959
Let's keep in touch

123
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,240
Xiaoyue

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
Sorry to trouble you, but please go to the bank tomorrow morning.

125
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,959
Take all our clothing chain stores and factories,

126
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
as well as all the houses and cars under my name,

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
and have them all appraised for collateral.

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,279
Sis,

129
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,920
if you mortgage everything,

130
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,879
all your hard work these past two years will be for nothing.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
At worst, we’ll just start over.

132
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,079
Back then, the two of us

133
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,160
started with a tiny shop that had nothing,

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
and made it to where we are today, didn’t we?

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,959
Go on.

136
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,480
The market across the street sells them for fifteen cents each.

137
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,399
I’ll sell them for fourteen cents.

138
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
A small business is still a business.

139
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,879
If it’s business, I need a three percent profit.

140
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,199
Sorry to interrupt everyone’s enjoyment.

141
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,920
Please have a taste.

142
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,199
So what if I bumped into you?

143
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,000
Move aside.

144
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
Let’s talk outside.

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Boss Huo,

146
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,480
are you here to do business or to act like a thug?

147
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,920
Doing business with me,

148
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,920
you’re still too inexperienced.

149
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,800
Let go.

150
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,959
We just can’t let her open.

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,240
Alright, Lin Xiaoxiao,

152
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,680
just wait, I’ll scratch your face.

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
How dare you mess with me.

154
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,560
Don't worry.

155
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,319
I'm back.

156
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,279
Among international sports brands,

157
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
Double Hook is considered the absolute leader.

158
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
Recently,

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,480
they just made a major strategic decision.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
They successfully signed basketball star Mike

161
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,840
as their brand ambassador.

162
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,240
They plan to leverage Mike's influence

163
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,279
to fully expand their global business.

164
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,320
Especially our domestic market,

165
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
which is their main focus for evaluation.

166
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,600
Norris is the founder of Double Hook.

167
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,159
He is also Mr. Knight's special executive assistant.

168
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,879
He is also the head of this inspection team.

169
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,840
It wasn't easy for me to get him to agree

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,679
to meet you first.

171
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,879
Miss Lin

172
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,519
Regarding your situation

173
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,000
Zhong Xin has told me everything

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
In just two short years

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,720
you went from being the owner of a small clothing store

176
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,720
to owning dozens of chain stores

177
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,799
and becoming an entrepreneur with a large clothing factory

178
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,960
Such achievements

179
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,360
truly impress me

180
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,559
Thank you very much for your recognition

181
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,440
But I also know

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,519
that there are several companies in Yangcheng

183
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,879
that are even stronger competitors than yours

184
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,559
So, Miss Lin, I’d like to ask

185
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,799
what makes you think

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,159
I would be willing to work with you

187
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
Mr. Norris

188
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,279
There’s an old saying in China

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,639
It goes

190
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,919
"Don’t laugh at others for wearing tattered clothes"

191
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,399
"Ten years on the east bank, ten years on the west bank"

192
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,759
It means

193
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,159
a person’s fate can change with time and effort

194
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,720
Maybe I can’t match my competitors right now

195
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,559
but I’m still young enough

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
and I still have plenty of time

197
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,279
So, do you want to choose

198
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,080
a partner who will be even more outstanding in the future

199
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,159
or choose

200
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,159
someone who is destined to be defeated by me

201
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:16,960
Miss Lin

202
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,840
I must admit, what you said makes a lot of sense

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,159
At least from what I know

204
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,879
there really isn’t any competitor in Yangcheng

205
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,559
with more potential than your company

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
Congratulations, Miss Lin

207
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,440
on becoming a partner of our Shuanggou Company

208
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,480
Looking forward to working together
