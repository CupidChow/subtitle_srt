1
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,719
Since this is a competition,

2
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,960
isn't it survival of the fittest,

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and elimination of the weak?

4
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,679
Besides, I have Tang Ke backing me up.

5
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,840
If you dare go against me,

6
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,960
he'll crush you

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,560
easier than crushing an ant.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,399
Why would you think

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
that even in Yangcheng, Tang Ke can't do anything to me,

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,200
but when I return to Meijiang,

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,240
I'd get bitten by a dog?

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,119
Stop right there!

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,159
Who are you calling a dog?

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,799
Sister,

15
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,799
if you want some advice, let me give you a word too:

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,879
Don't try to bargain with a tiger for its skin.

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,879
Otherwise, you might end up following the wrong master,

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,439
unable to even get a bone to gnaw on,

19
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,799
and end up in a mess.

20
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:16,840
Yue'er

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
Take down the grand opening sale sign at the entrance

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,560
and put it away.

23
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,319
Sis,

24
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,120
are we not opening for business?

25
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:21,439
We are,

26
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,319
but we're opening in a different way.

27
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,480
Boss Lin,

28
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,239
you wanted to see me?

29
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,760
I want to ask you for a favor.

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,560
In a couple of days, there will be a shipment

31
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,439
coming from Yangcheng.

32
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,719
I want you to help me transport it to the warehouse.

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,719
Then spread the word about it.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,480
Spread the word?

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,079
Wouldn't Lin Sufen find out then?

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,799
I'm afraid she won't find out.

37
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:43,760
This is bad!

38
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,400
Something's wrong!

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Something big has happened!

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Li Youqing,

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,519
we're businesspeople now.

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,159
Stop being so jumpy all the time.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,079
It's not presentable.

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
You're making the Lin family lose face.

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,000
No, listen to me—

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,799
I just overheard someone over there say

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,879
that Lin Xiaoxiao

48
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:58,840
is about to

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,680
have a shipment sent from Yangcheng.

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,719
And they said

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
on the market,

52
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,040
it's the newest model ever,

53
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,200
never seen before.

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,239
What does the newest model look like?

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
How would I know?

56
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,039
So what if it's the latest model?

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
When she opened her store,

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,560
we had already forced a batch of goods on her.

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,319
As long as she can't sell this batch,

60
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,479
once her cash flow breaks,

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
she'll have no way out.

62
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,280
My daughter is right.

63
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
What is there to be afraid of?

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,560
Daughter,

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,680
then how can we make sure she can't sell this batch?

66
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,479
make sure she can't sell it?

67
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,240
Mom,

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
just leave this to me.

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,840
Anyway, I promise you,

70
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,080
after today,

71
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,319
ours will be the only clothing store on this street.

72
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:44,719
Dad,

73
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,759
next,

74
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,199
I'll need you to make a trip.

75
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,919
Put out the fire!

76
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,759
There's a fire!

77
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,159
Fire!

78
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,319
Mr. Zhong's goods should be on the way.

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,560
Go get ready.

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,479
I've got things covered here.

81
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,520
Xiaoxiao

82
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,680
Sister

83
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,759
The trick of stocking up the night before opening

84
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,879
Only you could come up with that

85
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,879
Even Tang Ke

86
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,639
wouldn't be able to

87
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,719
find the same goods right away

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,919
That's great

89
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,800
You even brought a sculpture, Sister

90
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,719
I was planning to come by myself

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,639
But Zhong Xin insisted

92
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,360
that when it comes to your matters

93
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,039
she has to personally escort the delivery

94
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,879
She said she wants to back you up

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,560
Here

96
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,199
The visa has been approved

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,479
All the specific matters in the shop

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,719
have already been discussed with you

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,319
So from now on

100
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,879
I'll leave my shop in your hands

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,439
Sister

102
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,759
Do you really have to leave?

103
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
What about A Zhe?

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
Let's not talk about him for now

105
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,599
The opening tomorrow is more important

106
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,879
There's still a lot to do tonight

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
It's already this late

108
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,719
and still nothing's happening

109
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,639
That Lin Xiaoxiao girl

110
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,360
is probably doomed

111
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,840
If you ask me

112
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,160
my daughter is still the best

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
She just needs to think for a second

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
and she'll come up with a plan

115
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,399
and that girl will have to close her shop

116
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,920
The shop next door is opening

117
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,959
There are discounts if you come in

118
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Discounts available

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,199
Dear friends and family,

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,399
dear friends,

121
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,399
dear neighbors,

122
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,240
I sincerely thank you all

123
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,120
for coming today.

124
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,680
I announce

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,439
Xiaoxiao Clothing Store

126
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,959
is officially open for business!

127
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,879
Alright.

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,879
Today is the

129
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,920
grand opening of Xiaoxiao Clothing Store.

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,000
To celebrate our opening,

131
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,720
everything in the store is 20% off.

132
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Everyone is welcome to shop.

133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,319
Please try on as much as you like.

134
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,000
Come on in.

135
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:22,959
Welcome, everyone!

136
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,319
Alright, alright, alright.

137
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,000
Please wrap this one up for you as well.

138
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,600
Okay, okay, okay.

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Let me take a look at this one.

140
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
Dad, what are you doing?

141
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,120
Didn't you say you already burned it?

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,040
I did burn it.

143
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
That shouldn't be the case.

144
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,079
Li Youqing

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
Are you not scared anymore?

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
You set the fire, got scared, and ran off.

147
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,360
You don't even know if it actually caught fire.

148
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,240
How can you say that?

149
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,759
I saw it burning with my own eyes.

150
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,360
Then how did it reopen after being burned?

151
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,839
Exactly.

152
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,480
Who is Li Youqing?

153
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,759
I am, I am.

154
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:05,800
Officer

155
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:06,959
What's this about?

156
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,600
What's going on?

157
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,199
You are suspected of arson.

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,319
Please come with us.

159
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,439
Please cooperate.

160
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,720
Why are you putting handcuffs on him?

161
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,519
Officer, you can't just arrest people without reason.

162
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,639
Do you have any evidence?

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,199
If you don't have evidence,

164
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,040
would we be here to take him?

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,639
Take him away.

166
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,639
Didn't he just set a fire?

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Besides,

168
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,199
the fire he set

169
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,839
was in his own niece's warehouse.

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,240
Mom,

171
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:25,920
you police officers

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,759
meddle in everything,

173
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,399
but do you really have to interfere in our family matters too?

174
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,040
That's right.

175
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,519
Shut up.

176
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,680
If you keep pestering like this

177
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,480
and obstruct law enforcement,

178
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,399
according to the law,

179
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,680
I have the right to detain you as well.

180
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,399
I...

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,360
Step aside.

182
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,160
Let's go.

183
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,040
Youqing,

184
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,839
you can't arrest me!

185
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,040
You can't arrest me!

186
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,399
Let's go.

187
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,959
Lin Xiaoxiao

188
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,079
You little brat

189
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Mom

190
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,560
Mom

191
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,120
Leave me alone

192
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:49,959
Let me go find her

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,120
She's right here

194
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,879
Lin Xiaoxiao

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,279
Get up

196
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,480
Get up

197
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
Where's Lin Xiaoxiao?

198
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,120
Well, Lin Xiaoxiao

199
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,399
Talk properly here

200
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,399
Don't get physical

201
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,160
That's so rude

202
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,920
Lin Sufen

203
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,759
This is the first day of my new store's opening

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,199
You just have to make a scene, don't you?

205
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,839
You really want me to, in front of everyone

206
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,560
reveal all the things you and Li Youqing have done

207
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,319
and expose them?

208
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,040
Mom

209
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,920
There are too many of them, let's just drop it

210
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,480
Everyone's here, huh?

211
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,560
Let me tell you all something.

212
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,279
This Lin Xiaoxiao,

213
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,040
she's so ungrateful.

214
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,600
Now that she's got money,

215
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,319
she thinks she can do whatever she wants.

216
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,040
She even called the police to her house.

217
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,040
She got her uncle taken to the police station.

218
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,959
Lin Sufen,

219
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,199
you really want to make a scene, huh?

220
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,079
Fine.

221
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,480
Then let's talk about it.

222
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,680
Let everyone judge for themselves.

223
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
You all know about the fire a couple of days ago, right?

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Yeah, we know.

225
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
My husband and I even helped put out the fire.

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
That was Lin Sufen,

227
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
her whole family started that fire.

228
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,439
They did it to burn down my warehouse.

229
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
So that my shop

230
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,279
couldn't keep running.

231
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,120
That's just too wicked.

232
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,839
Yeah.

233
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,879
How can people be so heartless?

234
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,800
Seriously.

235
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,920
That's just too much.

236
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,639
Isn't it just a few old clothes that got burned?

237
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
At worst, we can just pay you some money for it.

238
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you really have to call the police over this?

239
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,480
They even took your uncle away.

240
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Listen to that, just listen.

241
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,160
This old woman...

242
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,639
You actually set fire to someone else's warehouse.

243
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,800
And you still think you're in the right?

244
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,680
Exactly.

245
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
People like you, the police should deal with.

246
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,040
You'll get what's coming to you one day.

247
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,839
What does this have to do with you?

248
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,920
Stop talking, Mom.

249
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,199
Aren't you embarrassed enough already?

250
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,879
Lin Xiaoyan.

251
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,959
Your mom is uneducated.

252
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
But didn't you go to college?

253
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,160
Arson is a crime.

254
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,079
You'd get at least three to five years in prison.

255
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Didn't you tell her that?

256
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,879
Three to five years.

257
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
What are you all thinking?

258
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,519
Three to five years, you know.

259
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,799
It wasn't me.

260
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,279
I told him to handle it himself.

261
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,720
I didn't tell him to set the fire.

262
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,600
It wasn't me.

263
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,519
You got your own father sent to jail.

264
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,600
People like you...

265
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,639
And you call yourself a college student.

266
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,000
Pah!

267
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,360
And you still come here to make trouble.

268
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,279
These mother and daughter...

269
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,600
Each is more shameless than the other.

270
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,840
Truly shameless.

271
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,879
Xiaoxiao,

272
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,559
about this matter,

273
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,200
your uncle isn't very educated.

274
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,639
Don't take it to heart.

275
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,559
Can we leave now?

276
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,480
Please, have some mercy.

277
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,720
Talk to the police for us.

278
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Ask them to let your uncle out.

279
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,720
Please leave.

280
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,159
After all, we're family.

281
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,919
I'm begging you, as your aunt.

282
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
It's not up to me.

283
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,840
Please leave.

284
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm begging you.

285
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,440
Mom.

286
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,240
Let's go.

287
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,279
Go, go, go. Let's leave.

288
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm begging you.

289
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,720
Xiaoxiao.

290
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,799
I'm begging you.

291
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,960
Yanyan,

292
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,480
if you really leave,

293
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,159
what will Mom do all by herself?

294
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,639
Mom,

295
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,559
don’t worry.

296
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,480
I’ll go back to Yangcheng

297
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,480
and find Tang Ke right away.

298
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,279
He’s a big boss.

299
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
He’ll definitely have a way to save Dad.

300
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,759
Okay.

301
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,039
Then what about the clothing store business?

302
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,639
You’re still here to take care of it.

303
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,919
I only took a few days off from school.

304
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,240
If I don’t go back soon,

305
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
they might really punish me.

306
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,080
That’s right.

307
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,679
Your schoolwork is important.

308
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,480
You can’t fall behind.

309
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,399
When you see Tang Ke,

310
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,799
talk to him properly.

311
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,879
Be sure to find a way to get your dad out.

312
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,039
Mom,

313
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,759
don’t worry.

314
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,840
I’ll definitely make him help save Dad.

315
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Then be careful.

316
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:51,559
Okay.

317
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,399
Heavens, please bless us.

318
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,480
You two are already holding hands so soon.

319
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,559
Not hiding it from anyone anymore.

320
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,279
Our pace

321
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
isn’t as fast as you and A Zhe.

322
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,759
Sis,

323
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,320
have you told A Zhe about your situation?

324
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,399
I really don’t know how to bring it up to him.

325
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,000
That’s why I asked you two to come.

326
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:22,799
Help me talk to him.

327
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,679
Actually, A Zhe...

328
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
A Zhe

329
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,799
You're dressed pretty...

330
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,720
festively.

331
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,879
What do you know?

332
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Red

333
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,840
represents passion.

334
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,240
White represents

335
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,039
purity.

336
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,840
And the rose in my hand

337
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
stands for pure love.

338
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,480
I, Yue Jingzhe,

339
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,279
today,

340
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,039
am going to propose to the girl I love,

341
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,639
Zhong Xin,

342
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,879
and ask her to marry me.
