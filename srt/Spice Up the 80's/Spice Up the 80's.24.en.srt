1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
What do you mean by that?

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,159
Come on.

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Say that again, let me hear it.

4
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,799
I think Old Shen is right.

5
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,000
This whole thing was your idea to begin with.

6
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,079
You were the one who pushed everyone to do it together.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,280
Now that something's gone wrong,

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,560
you can't just blame all of us, can you?

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,479
Li,

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,479
you couldn't handle it yourself, so now you're blaming me?

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,119
Tang,

12
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,439
if that's all the vision you have,

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,439
then do it yourself.

14
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,240
I don't care anymore.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,240
Anyway, I'm done with this, I'm not serving you anymore.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Sorry, Mr. Tang.

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,600
I have something to deal with at home.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,439
I'll take my leave.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,319
Get out.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,920
If you don't want to do this, then get out.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,599
Boss Tang,

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,879
you're being too narrow-minded.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,439
Actually, a few days ago,

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,640
A Zhe already brought her back.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,359
She just refused to talk to us.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,640
Until today,

27
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,840
she asked

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,040
to meet with you.

29
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,799
Now that I've ended up like this,

30
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,560
are you really happy about it?

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,799
Really pleased?

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,039
I do resent you all.

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
But seeing you like this now,

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
I don't feel happy at all.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
After all, you once gave me a home.

36
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,120
Even if that home wasn't very warm.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,719
If you came here to comfort me,

38
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,520
there's really no need.

39
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,000
I, Lin Xiaoyan, am not so down and out

40
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,080
that I need your pity.

41
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,599
Actually, you helped me when we were kids too.

42
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,000
I remember back then in the yard,

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,120
three or four boys were chasing and hitting me.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,000
They were holding brooms.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,000
They said I was a child without a mother.

46
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,120
You were the one who chased them away for me.

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,719
You said this was our family's yard.

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,560
And Auntie,

49
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,319
she always refused to give me food.

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,159
You would sneak into the kitchen

51
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,639
and steal some buns for me.

52
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,000
Even though those buns were cold,

53
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,000
at least I didn't starve.

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,439
You told me

55
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,120
that you would protect me from then on.

56
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,520
Yeah.

57
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,280
I still remember when we were little,

58
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,120
you would always follow right behind me,

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,599
crying and shouting,

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
"Thank you, sister!"

61
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,520
But what's the point of saying all this now?

62
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,280
Our relationship can't go back to how it was.

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,159
But you're still young.

64
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,439
Are you really going to let Tang Ke ruin your whole life like this?

65
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,599
Are you really willing to accept that?

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Even if I'm not, what can I do?

67
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,479
Didn't you also risk everything for Liang Keqing?

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
You threw yourself in without hesitation and bet everything.

69
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,520
It's just that you won your bet.

70
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,240
And I lost mine.

71
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,599
It's still not too late for everything.

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
But if Tang Ke were still around,

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,599
he definitely wouldn't let you off.

74
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,400
I've already obtained the evidence.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
As long as you're willing to testify in court,

76
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,400
I can guarantee

77
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,639
he'll spend the rest of his life in prison.

78
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:14,840
Sis,

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,959
you're still young.

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,399
It won't take long.

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
You can start over again.

82
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:52,800
Mr. Tang,

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,920
you're involved in an attempted murder case

84
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,560
and an illegal bidding bribery case.

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,759
Please cooperate with our investigation.

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,000
What's going on here?

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,680
Brother Le,

88
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,560
What happened?

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,319
Here's the situation.

90
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,600
You know our production

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,519
is pretty tough to shoot.

92
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,839
But the actress is rather delicate.

93
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,439
She raised her price from the start.

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
Now she can't take it and just quit.

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,279
What about Brother Le? Isn't he toughing it out too?

96
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,000
Where's Director Liang?

97
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Let Director Liang handle it.

98
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,160
After Director Liang found out the actress quit,

99
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,319
he was furious.

100
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,040
He took A Zhe

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,680
to talk to the actress about breach of contract.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,199
Why talk about breach of contract now?

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,839
The important thing is to finish filming.

104
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,120
With Director Liang's personality,

105
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,399
you know better than I do.

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,879
If it really doesn't work, let's replace them.

107
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,839
Th-this...

108
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,120
In such a short time,

109
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,279
it's hard to find someone.

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,160
Why is it hard to find someone for this?

111
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:47,800
Mr. Lin.

112
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,160
Brother Le.

113
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,240
Why don't you do it?

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
With your looks,

115
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,199
let's give it a try.

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,839
Brother Le, I really can't.

117
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,120
I've never acted before.

118
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,839
I think Brother Le's suggestion is good.

119
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,240
Otherwise, the whole crew

120
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,319
can't just keep waiting here.

121
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,360
Makeup.

122
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,680
Coming!

123
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I really can't, I...

124
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,639
This...

125
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,839
This is really embarrassing.

126
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,160
Just standing in front of the camera,

127
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,360
I don't even know what to do with my hands and feet.

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,879
It's fine.

129
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,439
Come on.

130
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,160
Director, is it okay now?

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,399
Let's go, get ready.

132
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,959
Okay, stand properly.

133
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:20,759
OK.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,439
Come on.

135
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,199
Episode 24, Scene 1, Take 1.

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,839
Three, two, one.

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
Action.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,240
First bow to heaven and earth.

139
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,240
Bow.

140
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,079
Second bow to the parents.

141
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,800
Bow.

142
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,120
Alright.

143
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,040
The couple bows to each other.

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,519
Bow.

145
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,560
The wedding ceremony is complete.

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,000
Lift the bride's veil.

147
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,480
Lin Xiaoxiao

148
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,519
Before I met you

149
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,399
I didn't believe I could fall in love with someone

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
Maybe I would have a business marriage

151
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,079
But I would never find love

152
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,639
Until I met you

153
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,439
That day

154
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,439
You were like that runaway jeep

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,519
Crashing straight into my heart

156
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,319
He

157
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Is the one I love

158
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,480
You are both stubborn and brave

159
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,959
And strong and wild

160
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,879
Like a little chili pepper

161
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,079
You make my heart

162
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
Burn with passion

163
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,800
We've been through so much together

164
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,160
We faced hardships side by side

165
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
Even willing to sacrifice everything for each other

166
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,439
Help!

167
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,840
Meeting you was unexpected

168
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,200
But falling in love with you

169
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
Was destined to happen

170
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,279
But I owe you one thing

171
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,639
Lin Xiaoxiao

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,039
Will you marry me?

173
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:24,720
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

174
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,200
Why are you still so old-fashioned?

175
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:35,159
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

176
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,679
I will

177
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,679
Okay

178
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,799
Okay

179
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:16,720
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
