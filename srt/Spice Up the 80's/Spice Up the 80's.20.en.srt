1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,039
Is your person in charge Lin Xiaoxiao?

2
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:39,520
Yes.

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,479
But Ms. Lin is busy at the moment.

4
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,560
You can talk to me.

5
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,880
I can't coordinate with you.

6
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,920
Are you the person in charge, Lin Xiaoxiao?

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,560
Yes.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,280
Tax inspector.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,799
We received a report.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,920
It says your company is involved in tax evasion.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,640
We need to conduct an audit of your company now.

12
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,640
We will review your accounts.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,759
Tax evasion?

14
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,920
Our company has always followed the rules.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,679
We pay taxes properly.

16
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,719
How could we possibly evade taxes?

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,479
Who reported us?

18
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,119
That has nothing to do with you.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,159
Our job

20
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,879
is to investigate your company's tax matters

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,280
to see if there are any irregularities.

22
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,000
Yue'er.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,359
Take them to the finance office.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:08,799
Okay.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,519
This way.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,200
Director Wu.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,079
Director Wu.

28
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,719
I know things are complicated right now.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
But the tax bureau's investigation results aren't out yet.

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,560
We would never evade taxes.

31
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,400
That's right.

32
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,799
The investigation results aren't even out yet.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
Who can prove that your company

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,719
didn't evade taxes?

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,719
Siyang Garment Factory

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,959
would never cooperate with a company

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,840
suspected of tax evasion.

38
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,200
Director

39
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,000
The market competition is so fierce right now.

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,040
It's very likely that we've been

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,159
framed by someone else.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Besides,

43
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,799
after the bidding results were announced,

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,159
we signed a lot of orders.

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,799
If the factory doesn't take them now,

46
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,239
this—

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,519
we really can't afford such a loss.

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,959
That's your own problem.

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,799
Who told you to sign so many orders before completing the procedures?

50
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,280
Go back and think about it yourself.

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,159
Director

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
I won't see you out.

53
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,120
Let's go.

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,400
We received a report

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,520
alleging that your company is involved in tax evasion.

56
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,400
We need to conduct an audit of your company's accounts now.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Mr. Lin

58
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,560
Without a factory,

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,759
we won't be able to fulfill the orders on time.

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
We won't even be able to afford the penalty fees for breach of contract.

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
Siyang Garment Factory

62
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,479
will never cooperate with a company

63
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,479
suspected of tax evasion.

64
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,039
Who told you to sign so many orders before completing the procedures?

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,039
Go back and think about it yourself.

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Sis, you're back.

67
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,159
Mr. Lin

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
Why are you all standing outside?

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,800
Sister-in-law

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Long time no see

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,680
I've been quite busy lately

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
What are you doing here?

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,199
Louis

74
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,639
Today at 10:30 a.m.

75
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,879
People from the tax bureau

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,439
on the grounds of tax evasion

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,639
came to Tingting Yuli Garment Trading Co., Ltd.

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,360
to conduct a tax inspection

79
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
And at the same time

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,439
Siyang Garment Factory and Tang Group

81
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,080
signed a factory purchase agreement

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,560
As expected, it was Tang Ke behind this

83
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,560
Right now, the most important thing isn't dealing with Tang Ke

84
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,919
but finding a new factory

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,599
Amy

86
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,879
After a day of investigation and selection,

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,800
we finally decided

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,919
that the one we can put into use immediately is

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
the factory building of Xinhui Glass Factory in the Wafang New District.

90
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,599
This factory building

91
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,360
is not only larger

92
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,039
but also in a pretty good location.

93
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,319
It can be completely converted into our garment production factory.

94
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,039
So your plan is

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,199
since we can't acquire Siyang Garment Factory,

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,599
we'll just start our own operation.

97
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,639
Build our own factory.

98
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,280
But

99
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,439
Sister-in-law, you don't need to worry.

100
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,039
Brother Liang has already thought it through for you in advance.

101
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,680
Although the factory building is settled,

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,039
since this is a glass factory,

103
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
if we want to build our own factory,

104
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,400
we still need to bring in a lot of garment production equipment.

105
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,879
So at the first opportunity,

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,879
we contacted manufacturers of garment equipment.

107
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,439
This way,

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,439
both the factory and the equipment

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,319
can be taken care of.

110
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,079
But the cost...

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,519
Frank.

112
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,079
According to estimates

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
the overall approximate costs are as follows.

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
The purchase cost for the Xinhui Glass Factory is ten million.

115
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,639
Equipment purchase costs are eight million.

116
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,959
Transportation and installation are one million.

117
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,879
Raw material procurement, administration, and legal affairs

118
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,680
various service fees, and operating working capital

119
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,439
total eleven million.

120
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,360
The total cost is approximately

121
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,120
thirty million.

122
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,079
But our current bank loan

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,160
plus the client's initial payment

124
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,920
adds up to only twenty million.

125
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,639
As for the remaining funds

126
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:49,920
Lin Xiaoxiao

127
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,000
do you agree with my plan?

128
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,000
I agree.

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,680
But what about the funding?

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,319
Since you agreed

131
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,680
leave the funding to me.

132
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,720
Wait for my good news.

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,560
Dad

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,319
are you sure you want to do all this for that woman from the countryside?

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,439
Are you really going to go this far?

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,560
This time

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
I also want to prove to you

138
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,519
that I can take responsibility

139
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
and lead the company

140
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,000
and Lin Xiaoxiao

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,920
even further.

142
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,600
After my evaluation,

143
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,839
this project

144
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,399
will be a major breakthrough for the company to explore a new field.

145
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,959
This business proposal

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,959
You kid

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,639
finally asked me for help for once.

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,079
Dad

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,360
Father and son shouldn't talk about work as soon as they meet.

150
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,160
Since you've chosen Lin Xiaoxiao,

151
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,800
then you have to prove it to me.

152
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,800
You two not only have to fight side by side in your careers,

153
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,600
but also in life

154
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
you must take good care of her and support her.

155
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,680
I understand.

156
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,519
I used to smoke cigarettes.

157
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,000
The doctor told me it would harm my lungs.

158
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
So I switched to cigars.

159
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,839
Then the doctor told me again,

160
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,839
smoking cigars would damage my throat.

161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,879
Life has its own fate.

162
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,120
You can't worry about everything.

163
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,079
Back then, when I led A Guang and the others,

164
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,000
when we first arrived in Yangcheng,

165
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,839
this whole area was just gravel pits.

166
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,480
It was all thanks to sheer determination

167
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,000
that we built the Liang Group step by step.

168
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,279
Keqing,

169
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
the path Liang Group took before

170
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,680
was paved by your father.

171
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,720
How to walk the road ahead

172
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,519
will ultimately depend on you.

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
Times are changing.

174
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,199
It's time for me to rest.

175
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,199
Boss Huo

176
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,639
Thank you for coming to support us.

177
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,839
Chairman Lin

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
Congratulations on the opening of your new factory.

179
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,519
May wealth flow in abundantly.

180
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,120
Boss Huo

181
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
Your business keeps getting bigger.

182
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,000
Xiaoxiao

183
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,519
Boss Huang

184
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,919
The new shop is opening.

185
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm here to support you, sis.

186
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,240
Thank you, brother.

187
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,000
Sister Hong

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Congratulations!

189
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,399
It's been a long time since we last met.

190
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,799
Your business has grown so much.

191
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,440
You still remember my little restaurant.

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Back then, it was thanks to your support.

193
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,960
Right, Boss Huang?

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,919
My very first pot of gold.

195
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,639
It's what I should have done.

196
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,399
Of course.

197
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,639
Well then,

198
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,840
let's go over for the ribbon-cutting.

199
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,279
Alright.

200
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's go, let's go.

201
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,039
Boss Huang

202
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
Long time no see.

203
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,360
Hey, Xiaoxiao.

204
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,159
Why are you just standing there?

205
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,799
It's time for the ribbon-cutting.

206
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,840
It's such a happy occasion.

207
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,639
Come on.

208
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,879
Sorry, everyone.

209
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
I should have arrived earlier.

210
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,879
But a tractor was blocking the road.

211
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,240
So I was late.

212
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:02,639
Big brother.

213
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,639
Big Brother,

214
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,759
I'm sorry I'm late.

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,080
You don't have to worry about things from now on.

216
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm here.

217
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,879
Let's begin.

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,159
Since everyone is here,

219
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,480
I'll read the will now.

220
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,960
I, Liang Kun,

221
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,039
confirm that I am of sound mind

222
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,080
and hereby make this will.

223
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,000
Regarding my personal assets,

224
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,159
I make the following allocations:

225
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,960

231
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,639
