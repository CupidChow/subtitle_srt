1
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
If someone

2
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,799
suffers hardship and injustice in life

3
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,399
and doesn't want to beg for mercy

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,600
the most direct way is to fight back

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,479
you never know who will win or lose

6
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,600
Your hand is injured

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,119
It's nothing

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
My name is Lin Xiaoxiao

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,600
Liang Keqing

10
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,680
Oh my

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,200
You left the duck out again

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,519
You never take care of things

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,959
Damao, Ermao, come here

14
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,599
What are you doing here

15
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,280
I just stopped by to check on you, is that not okay

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,480
Look at how down you look

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,719
You failed the exam, didn't you

18
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,840
I didn't even take the exam

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,439
So that's how it is

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,159
That Lin family

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,319
there really isn't a good person among them

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Hey, Lao Fang

23
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,799
If you're going to insult them, don't drag me into it

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,840
You

25
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,959
You're not much better yourself

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,159
After splitting the family

27
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,680
all you do is come here to freeload

28
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,840
If word gets out

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,719
people will laugh their heads off

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Return all the gift money

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Make a clean break, cut all ties

32
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,199
That's what it means to split the family

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,719
Eight hundred yuan

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,639
isn't a small amount

35
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,639
Can you pay it back

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
Go where there are more people

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,759
Where there are people

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,960
there's money

39
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,479
The course of the times changes in an instant.

40
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,719
If you fall behind, the market will eliminate you.

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,080
When a strong wind blows,

42
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,560
some ride the wind and leap forward,

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
while others fall and can't get up.

44
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,080
I have too much unwillingness to accept defeat.

45
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,800
Too many pursuits and desires.

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,159
Just waiting for the wind to come.

47
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,080
Starting work at Yunding Grand Hotel

48
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,759
was my first step forward.

49
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,240
Here,

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,680
I have to serve hundreds or even thousands of guests every day.

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,960
Guests come from all directions, north and south.

52
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,879
In the time it takes to have a meal,

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,039
the closeness of relationships,

54
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,360
likes, dislikes, and character,

55
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,599
all become clear at a glance.

56
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,479
Who is putting on an act,

57
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,719
and who is truly capable,

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,439
are revealed in casual conversation.

59
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,479
At the beginning, both host and guests are usually happy.

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,000
At a banquet, the seats of honor and the lesser seats,

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,319
all sorts of people, each with their own way to survive.

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
They all have to look for new directions to grow.

63
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,560
Until the moment the banquet ends,

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,960
no one dares to say they'll be the last one laughing.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,439
The cycle is too long, and the bank won't give loans.

66
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
Real estate must be the next big opportunity.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Be careful.

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm trying to grasp the pulse of economic development in these times.

69
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,879
I know

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,319
that only by finding the right path

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,039
can I take the next step.

72
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,599
Hey, bro,

73
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,319
why don't we just go to Lin Xiaoxiao directly

74
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,879
and ask her to introduce us to Professor Fang?

75
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,800
Wouldn't that work?

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
Why take such a roundabout way?

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
Fang Mu came to Meijiang as a sent-down youth in 1975.

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
And the person who took him in was Lin Xiaoxiao's father.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,039
If we bring this up to her,

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,639
she might not be willing to help.

81
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,719
It could even backfire.

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,680
Tell me,

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,520
why did Lin Xiaoxiao choose to work as a waitress at this hotel?

84
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,439
This is the biggest hotel in Meijiang.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
The pay must be good.

86
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
From what I know about her,

87
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,639
she's not someone who only cares about the present.

88
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,039
What are you thinking?

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,079
She wants to move forward.

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,519
So let's give her a hand.

91
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,600
Sister Hong,

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,759
are you looking for me?

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Mr. Huang from Huayuan

94
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,160
is hosting an important guest tonight in V08.

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,759
He specifically requested you to serve.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Hurry up and get ready, dress up nicely.

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
He asked for me?

98
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,600
You have twenty minutes.

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,480
Okay.

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,360
Hello, Mr. Huang.

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:44,959
Hello.

102
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,160
Please.

103
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,240
You came down in person.

104
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,600
Sir, please come inside.

105
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,160
Please, come inside.

106
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,519
Gentlemen, please take your seats.

107
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,560
This private room is really impressive.

108
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:04,759
Take a look.

109
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,360
The waitresses here are much prettier.

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,079
Mr. Huang, please have a seat.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,439
Me?

112
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,800
Today, I'm just here to accompany everyone.

113
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,759
Who's the main guest today?

114
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,959
Mr. Liang from Liang Group.

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,839
Mr. Huang.

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,040
We're old acquaintances.

117
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,800
No need to be so formal.

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,519
Come on.

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,000
Please.

120
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,800
Here, Mr. Huang.

121
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,480
No, no, no.

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,279
Please, you take the main seat.

123
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,639
You're too polite, please sit.

124
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,000
Gentlemen, please sit.

125
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,839
Everyone, have a seat.

126
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Sit, sit, sit.

127
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,079
Xiaoxiao, go get the wine.

128
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Let me raise a glass first.

129
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,480
First, let's welcome Mr. Liang to Meijiang.

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,800
And thank you all.

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Tonight, let's eat and drink well.

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,040
We won't leave until we're drunk.

133
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,519
How about it?

134
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:57,839
Alright!

135
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,959
Cheers!

136
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:00,959
Bottoms up!

137
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,360
Our Young Master Liang,

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,720
rarely makes public appearances.

139
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,560
As for their Liang Group,

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,279
in Yangcheng,

141
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,439
it's one of the top companies.

142
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,839
Things like

143
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
logistics and transportation,

144
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,240
and infrastructure as well,

145
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,879
are all handled by Liang Group.

146
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,519
Come, come, come.

147
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,279
Lately,

148
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,279
I've run into some small business troubles.

149
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,639
The people who used to buy from me,

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,199
the number of them has dropped sharply.

151
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,399
You see,

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,959
if I can't sell this fruit, it'll just rot.

153
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,839
It pains me.

154
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,319
It's okay.

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,519
Mr. Liang, do you think you could come up with a solution?

156
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
Help me sell this fruit.

157
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,959
As for the profit,

158
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,319
just name your price, really.

159
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,319
Mr. Huang, you see,

160
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,560
the position I hold at Liang Group

161
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,120
has nothing to do with fruit.

162
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,079
It's fine.

163
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,600
Your father,

164
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,720
doesn't his business cover all kinds of industries?

165
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,560
So,

166
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,720
could you help me find a way out?

167
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,480
Sister Hong

168
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,000
Mr. Huang has had too much to drink.

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,079
Xiaoxiao

170
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,480
Quick, take Mr. Huang to the restroom.

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,120
No.

172
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

173
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,319
I'm telling you, I haven't had too much to drink.

174
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,639
Slow down.

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,160
Mr. Huang

176
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,000
This way, please.

177
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,120
I really haven't had too much, Mr. Liang.

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,720
Let's go, let's go.

179
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,600
Mr. Huang

180
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,279
Mr. Huang

181
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,480
I have a way to get rid of your unsold fruit in a short time.

182
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,839
You?

183
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,480
As long as you let me

184
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,399
take the goods first and pay later,

185
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
I can guarantee that within a month

186
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,279
I'll pay you back with interest.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,759
This is at least ten tons of goods.

188
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,800
Can you handle that much?

189
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,759
Do you have any other options?

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
I can guarantee your profit

191
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,279
will be more than what you make with Mr. Liang.

192
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,199
Sister Hong, we're leaving.

193
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,360
This way, please.

194
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,040
Come on.

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,079
Mr. Liang

196
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,079
Goodbye.

197
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,240
Take care.

198
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,800
Miss

199
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,720
As long as we can make this work,

200
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,079
I definitely won't treat you badly.

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,680
Mr. Huang

202
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll be waiting for your good news.

203
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,040
It seems this meal

204
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,279
was quite fruitful.

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
Boss Huang doesn't know me.

206
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,199
You were the one who recommended me, right?

207
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,800
I just provided you with the platform.

208
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,399
You were the one who seized the opportunity.

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,480
Overall, you did well.

210
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,639
This man is really strange.

211
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,039
If you're not working as a waiter,

212
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,799
are you planning

213
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,879
to sell fruit?

214
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
What do you know, old man?

215
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,240
This is my first time doing business.

216
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,679
Whether it works out or not

217
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,879
all depends on you.

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,039
Depends on me?

219
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,440
Is your method really effective?

220
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,159
They're just giving you a batch of goods to test the waters.

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
If you don't meet their expectations,

222
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,600
all your efforts will be for nothing.

223
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,200
At Yunding, a fruit platter costs two yuan per serving.

224
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,639
For the same price, if you go out and turn left for 300 meters,

225
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,399
you can buy a whole basket at the farmers' market.

226
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,480
What does that tell you?

227
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,759
It means

228
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,240
if you want to make more profit,

229
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,399
you have to

230
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,759
Do what?

231
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,879
You have to squeeze out

232
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,879
all the commercial value from the product itself.

233
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,279
That's right.

234
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,399
Fruit is everywhere.

235
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
The market is saturated.

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,399
People all like what's fresh.

237
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
Even though it's exactly the same thing,

238
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,559
But if you change the packaging and the way you present it,

239
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,080
the effect is completely different.

240
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,360
Of course.

241
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,399
No matter how good the product is,

242
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,679
you still need a place to sell it.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Sorry to interrupt everyone.

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
I've already reached a deal with Sister Hong.

245
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,840
As long as she helps me promote this drink,

246
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,399
I'll give her ten percent of the profits as commission.

247
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,000
Riding the momentum,

248
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm not worried about sales at all.

249
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,120
Welcome, welcome.

250
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,480
Would you like a private room or the main hall?

251
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,519
This way, please.

252
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,759
So, how's it going?

253
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,799
Have you saved up enough money yet?

254
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,759
Only two hundred yuan so far.

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,799
Still six hundred short.

256
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,159
How are you still that far off?

257
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,679
How are you running this business?

258
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
For every half kilo of fruit you sell now,

259
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,960
after deducting costs and the restaurant's share,

260
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,840
I only make ten cents profit.

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,559
If I sell a ton, that's just a hundred yuan.

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,480
At the current sales rate,

263
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,759
to pay back Wang Xiaowu,

264
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,279
I'll need at least three months.

265
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,559
And as for the customers,

266
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,039
they're just after something new.

267
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,840
Their spending power will only get weaker.

268
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
So, how long until you can pay back the money?

269
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
How much longer do you need?

270
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,840
One week.

271
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,720
One week?

272
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,600
How about this—

273
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,360
You pack your things

274
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,399
and just run away.

275
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,480
Of course I can't do that.

276
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,879
Just thinking about their smug faces

277
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,279
makes me sick.
