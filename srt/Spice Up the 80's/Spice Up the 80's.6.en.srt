1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,600
Stop struggling.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,840
You can't escape.

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
So we just have to wait here to be sold off to the mountains?

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,759
Being sold is already considered lucky.

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,280
What about those who can't be sold?

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,399
What are you arguing about?

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Everyone, behave yourselves.

8
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,640
Especially you.

9
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,479
Big brother.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,640
I feel itchy.

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,719
Where does it itch?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let me scratch it for you.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,519
I think it's on my back.

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,120
Your back, huh?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,599
Brother is here.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Here, little sister?

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,159
Or

18
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,400
here?

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,879
A little lower.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,319
A little lower.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,359
Alright, alright.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,959
So it's here.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,319
Big brother.

24
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,879
Can we talk about something?

25
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,359
Can you let me out?

26
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,439
If you let me out, I'll do whatever you want.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,200
Trying to run?

28
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,959
Don't even think about it.

29
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,560
But whatever I want to do

30
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,159
doesn't need your permission.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,359
Come out.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,120
It'd be a shame to sell such a pretty girl.

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,719
Guess I'll have a taste myself today.

34
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,319
Get the key.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,319
Hurry.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,280
Hurry.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,759
Someone help!

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,479
Go.

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,120
Go take a look.

40
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,479
Go.

41
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,199
Go.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,639
Get the key, quick!

43
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:22,800
Hurry!

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,479
Faster!

45
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,719
Run!

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,800
Still trying to run?

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,319
Let me go!

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll kill you!

49
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,159
Run!

50
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,479
Let me go!

51
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,080
Try running again.

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
I dare you to run.

53
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,000
Hurry, help me untie the rope.

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,759
What's going on?

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
Sis, they ran away.

56
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:20,960
Go after them!

57
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:21,919
Hurry, chase them!

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Go, go!

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,479
Chase them!

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,719
Don't run!

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,319
This way!

62
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,840
Stop!

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,680
Don't run!

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:29,800
This way!

65
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,159
Stop!

66
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,479
This way!

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,919
Hurry, chase them!

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,479
Come back!

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,719
Stop!

70
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,280
Hurry!

71
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,719
Stop!

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,439
Don't run!

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,159
Hurry, hurry!

74
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,479
Go!

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,159
Faster!

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,360
Go after them!

77
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:41,879
Faster!

78
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,360
Stop running!

79
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't run!

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Come back here!

81
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,479
Over here!

82
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,039
Hurry!

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,919
Over here!

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,759
You go first.

85
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,280
They're over here!

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Hurry, chase them!

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,120
Chase them!

88
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,120
They're over there!

89
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,360
Catch her!

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,400
Stop running!

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Stop right there!

92
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,240
May I give you a ride now?

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,279
Professor Fang

94
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,639
Next,

95
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,680
Liang Guang will

96
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,680
fully cooperate with you

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
so that your expertise

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
can be put to good use.

99
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,720
Why did you bring me to such a nice house?

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,360
I can't afford the rent here.

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,839
Don't move.

102
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,759
These days,

103
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,600
do you have any plans?

104
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,360
Tomorrow, I have an appointment with someone from my hometown.

105
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,839
I'm planning to check out his shop.

106
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,600
If you don't have anything to do these days,

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,399
do more joint rotations and stretches.

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,639
Once you're healed,

109
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,480
I'll take you there.

110
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,199
It's nothing, just a minor injury.

111
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,519
Also,

112
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,120
before you recover,

113
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,079
just stay here.

114
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,439
Don't think you can control everything about me just because you saved me.

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
What are you doing?

116
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,680
With the way you are now,

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
what I want to do

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,439
is none of your business.

119
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,160
During this time,

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,639
just stay here and recover.

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,759
Three meals a day

122
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,839
will all be arranged for you.

123
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,800
That's not necessary.

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,680
Don't worry.

125
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,240
It's free.

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,079
You should've said so earlier.

127
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Now I'm relieved.

128
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,959
I have a dinner to attend later.

129
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,560
If you get bored,

130
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,879
there's a TV in the living room.

131
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,279
You can take a bath in the bathroom.

132
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,839
Hot water is on the left, cold water is on the right.

133
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,199
I've prepared new towels and toothbrushes.

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:10,959
And also,

135
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,000
Are you sure you don't want me to take you there?

136
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,040
My fellow townsfolk have already arranged everything for me, I don't need your help.

137
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,920
Don't worry.

138
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,959
Twelve o'clock noon.

139
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,000
Yulan Western Restaurant.

140
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll be waiting for your good news.

141
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,160
Take care and stay safe.

142
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,519
Alright.

143
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,439
Excuse me.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,519
Is Mr. Xu Jianfeng, the boss, here?

145
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
And you are?

146
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,399
I'm Lin Xiaoxiao.

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,319
Sister Li Yan introduced me, I'm from Meijiang.

148
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,519
So it's you.

149
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
You finally made it.

150
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,679
I've been waiting for you for quite a while.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,559
Boss Xu.

152
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,120
Um...

153
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
I brought you some local specialties from Meijiang.

154
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,519
You didn't have to bring anything, just coming is enough.

155
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,679
Please don't mind.

156
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh, by the way,

157
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,279
this

158
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
These are all my own shops.

159
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,080
Feel free to look around, make yourself at home.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Thank you, Boss Xu.

161
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,440
You're welcome, you're welcome.

162
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,279
Go ahead and take a look.

163
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,720
I'll go have a look then.

164
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
If you ask me,

165
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,639
Xiaolin, you really are cut out for this business.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,679
Just look at the goods you picked out.

167
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,200
They're all top-notch in our line of work.

168
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,000
Boss Xu,

169
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,519
your goods are still the best.

170
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm sure once this batch gets to Meijiang,

171
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,279
it'll sell really well.

172
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,440
Don't worry.

173
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,879
As soon as the payment comes in,

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,559
I'll pay you the remaining balance right away.

175
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,840
No rush.

176
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,559
About your situation,

177
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,480
Yan'er already told me everything.

178
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,600
In principle,

179
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,559
I don't usually take small orders.

180
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,039
Right.

181
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,320
But since we're from the same hometown,

182
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,679
when people from the same place are away from home,

183
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,759
we should help each other out.

184
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,320
Right?

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Here's to a good partnership.

186
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,519
To a good partnership.

187
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,080
Go ahead and pick through these goods.

188
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,960
I'll go now, bro.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,799
I'll pour you a cup of tea.

190
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,279
Alright, bro.

191
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,080
You go ahead and get busy.

192
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,039
I'll tidy up here.

193
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Okay.

194
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,360
Call me if you need anything.

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,799
Alright.

196
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,679
Remember to do it properly.

197
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,080
Who is she?

198
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,480
Miss,

199
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,679
I've made my choice.

200
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,240
Are you here to buy goods too?

201
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,879
Why would I be buying goods?

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This shop is mine.

203
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,759
Isn't this shop owned by Boss Xu?

204
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,840
My surname is Xu.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
There is no Boss Xu here.

206
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,799
Boss Xu.

207
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,000
Then who is Xu Jianfeng?

208
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,440
Xu Jianfeng used to

209
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,759
be good at business.

210
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,919
But ever since he got addicted to gambling,

211
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
he's been drowning in debt.

212
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,519
He started cheating and scamming people.

213
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,000
Miss,

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
just take this as a lesson.

215
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Losing money can ward off worse luck.

216
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,120
Try to look on the bright side.

217
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,159
I'm not the one who needs to learn a lesson.

218
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,840
He's the one who should learn a lesson.
