1
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,640
Don't go out and talk nonsense.

2
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,359
Do you understand?

3
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:43,960
Yes.

4
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,880
A country girl wants to become a phoenix.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,399
That's just wishful thinking.

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,479
Lin Xiaoyan.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,759
You also came from the countryside.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,759
I don't think being a country girl is shameful.

9
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm not like you.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,120
There can only be one phoenix in our family.

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,280
And that's me.

12
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:07,799
Lin Xiaoyan.

13
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,239
If you're so capable, then pay me back the money.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,120
The money you used to study in Yangcheng.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,239
It was my bride price money.

16
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,480
Close the door.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Lin Xiaoxiao.

18
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:29,959
Where is Lin Xiaoxiao?

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Don't move.

20
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,000
Lin Xiaoyan.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,120
Let go of me.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
What are you two standing there for?

23
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,400
Hurry up and pull them apart.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Lin Xiaoxiao.

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,599
Let's see which of us dies first.

26
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,239
Watch me ruin your face.

27
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,000
Let go of me.

28
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,640
Xiaoxiao, run!

29
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,239
Zhong Xin.

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,159
Get out of my way!

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Zhong Xin.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,640
Open the door.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,359
Hurry, go!

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,519
Go quickly!

35
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,879
Open the door.

36
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,240
Zhong Xin.

37
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,080
I've long heard that your waltz is excellent, Mr. Liang.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,479
May I have the honor,

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,479
of sharing a dance with you?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
If I remember correctly,

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,879
I just turned you down.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm just trying my luck again.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,599
I believe every lady here

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
wouldn't want to miss such a rare opportunity.

45
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,120
It seems I wasn't clear enough.

46
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,879
I'm not interested in you.

47
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,759
I just don't understand

48
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,199
In terms of figure,

49
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
looks, and education,

50
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,439
how am I inferior to that country girl?

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,159
She talks less than you.

52
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,680
Fine.

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Then let me finish this last drink with you.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,280
Miss Zhang,

55
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,680
have you ever thought

56
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,879
that having many admirers

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
might not be because you're charming,

58
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,199
but because your standards are low?

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
Instead of pestering me here,

60
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,719
why not hurry and find yourself a dance partner?

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
The ball is about to start.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,039
Mr. Liang,

63
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,080
let's wait and see.

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,560
I...

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,919
I don't know how.

66
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,639
I'll teach you.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,479
Relax.

68
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:14,960
Go

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,480
One

70
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,680
Two

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,040
Three

72
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:19,959
Four

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,399
Five

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,360
Six

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,639
Seven

76
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,560
Eight

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,000
Spin

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
You're pretty good at this.

79
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,879
Looks like you've danced with others quite a bit.

80
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,160
You learn really fast too.

81
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,639
That's only because the teacher is good.

82
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,040
Lin Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

83
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,920
Lin Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

84
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,000
Lin Xiaoxiao.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,319
Lin Xiaoxiao.

86
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,079
What's wrong?

87
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,839
I'm so hot.

88
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,000
Your hand is so hot.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Lin Xiaoxiao.

90
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,399
Lin Xiaoxiao.

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
What's wrong with you?

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,839
Stop looking.

93
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,120
Xiaoxiao was fine before.

94
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,800
She only became like this after drinking that wine just now.

95
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,079
There must be something wrong with that wine.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,000
Come on.

97
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:08,800
This way.

98
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,240
Lin Xiaoxiao

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Lin Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,519
Lin Xiaoxiao

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,720
Lin Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

102
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,800
This medicine is pretty strong.

103
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,800
Liang Keqing, who never gets close to women,

104
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,319
why is he putting so much effort into a country woman?

105
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,879
Brother Tang, you have to stand up for me.

106
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,560
Xiaoyan, what's wrong? Who dared to bully you?

107
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,519
It's all that bastard Lin Xiaoxiao's fault.

108
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,639
She bullies me just because she got close to Liang Keqing.

109
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,920
Brother Tang, you have to get revenge for me.

110
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,360
Not only did she steal my spotlight,

111
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,720
she even dares to bully my people.

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,519
Liang Keqing.

113
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,320
You're awake.

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,480
Are you feeling better?

115
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm fine.

116
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,519
You didn't sleep?

117
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,360
How could I sleep with you here?

118
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,039
We...

119
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
Did we do anything last night?

120
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
You drank too much last night.

121
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,440
I brought you back.

122
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,399
Your snoring was so loud.

123
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,360
I mean, nothing happened between us, right?

124
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,600
What do you think could have happened?

125
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,240
I mean, if something really did happen,

126
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,720
I can take responsibility.

127
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
What kind of person do you think I am?

128
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
I never take what's just handed to me.

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,279
Mine...

130
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,240
Oh, right.

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
You danced well last night.

132
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,519
I'm really impressed.

133
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
Zhong Xin, sis.

134
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,440
The princess of last night's party is here.

135
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,600
How are you?

136
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
Did you have fun dancing with Mr. Liang?

137
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,399
Don't mention it.

138
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,240
Sis.

139
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,159
But are you okay? You didn't get hurt, did you?

140
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,039
You drank so much last night, too.

141
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,080
Dealing with those drunks was nothing for me.

142
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I handled them easily.

143
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
Thanks to you for helping me deal with those guys.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
So...

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
Our cooperation...
