1
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,719
Go back and tell your boss

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,799
Miss Lin doesn't have time today

3
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,000
Miss Lin, why don't you come with us

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,280
so we don't have to make things difficult

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Who are you threatening?

6
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,320
Let him use whatever dirty tricks he has

7
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,079
But if he wants to bully my sister

8
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,240
that's not going to happen

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,799
I'll go with you

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,759
Xiaoxiao

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,640
Don't worry, sis

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,240
As long as we're in Guangzhou doing business in fashion

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
we can't avoid Tang Ke

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,240
We'll have to meet sooner or later

15
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,719
I'll be back soon

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,400
Please

17
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,319
Mr. Liang

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
I still have some questions about the details of our cooperation

19
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,959
Why don't we have a meal together

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,959
and talk over dinner

21
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,120
I still have something later

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm leaving Guangzhou tonight

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,319
The details of our cooperation

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,480
must be finalized tonight

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,599
I hope

26
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,480
Mr. Liang, you'll do me the honor

27
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,560
Boss Lin

28
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,680
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
Come, let me introduce you.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,519
This is

31
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,040
Boss Li, who handles transportation.

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,680
And this is

33
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,200
Boss Shen, who deals in fabrics.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,079
And this one here—

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,120
No need to introduce.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,920
We've met before.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,959
Boss Tang

38
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:57,920
Just say what's on your mind.

39
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,840
The reason we invited you this time

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,480
is to discuss

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,719
a possible collaboration.

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,920
You're joking.

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,079
How could I possibly be qualified to work with you?

44
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,560
I really admire you.

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,439
So young, and all on your own,

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,719
making your way in Guangzhou,

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,800
and building up a clothing company in such a short time.

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,719
Truly impressive.

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,520
I have to thank you, Boss Tang.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Without your support,

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
we couldn't have come this far.

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,919
Let's not mention the past.

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
That was just a misunderstanding.

54
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,120
From now on,

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
just say the word, Miss Lin.

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,520
Principal and interest,

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,159
fabrics,

58
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:29,960
and transportation—

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,159
I'll take care of it all personally.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,599
What are the terms?

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,199
Isn't it all about the terms?

62
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,759
It's just business.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
The most important thing is making money.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,039
If your down jackets work with me,

65
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,960
they'll definitely sell even better than now.

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,800
As long as you leave Liang Keqing,

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,719
we have a deal right away.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Mr. Tang, you misunderstood.

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,319
Mr. Liang and I are not working together.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,039
Miss Lin,

71
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,919
everyone here knows

72
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,520
that you managed to get the down jacket business

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,360
because of

74
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,159
Mr. Liang's connections.

75
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,759
Since you think that way, Mr. Tang,

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
you should know even better

77
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,599
that I won't go against my principles.

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,159
What about Liang Keqing?

79
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,319
I don't know.

80
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,560
Is he as principled as you?

81
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,680
Mr. Tang,

82
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,039
there's no type of woman I can't have.

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,479
Would I really go for a girl from the countryside?

84
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,520
It seems, Miss Lin,

85
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,280
you still don't really understand Liang Keqing.

86
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Mr. Liang really has a special fondness for this place.

87
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
He even arranges his meals here.

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,919
Time is also a kind of cost.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,960
So I arrange eating, sleeping, and working

90
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,039
all in my own place.

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,159
Mr. Liang is indeed decisive and puts efficiency first.

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,759
Someone like you,

93
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,879
who puts all their energy into work,

94
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,039
is really rare.

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,599
Being able to work with Mr. Hang

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,919
is also my honor.

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,759
Actually, I hope

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,639
our relationship

99
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,960
won't be just about business.

100
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,080
Mr. Hang

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
I have an important meeting this afternoon.

102
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,520
Please enjoy your meal.

103
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,280
Excuse me.

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,399
Sorry about that.

105
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,800
The restaurant is really busy today.

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I hope you didn't wait too long.

107
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:37,959
It's fine.

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,360
I just got here too.

109
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,519
What would you like to eat?

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,399
Anything is fine.

111
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,839
I've kept you waiting for so long.

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
I said I'd treat you to this meal.

113
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,680
No way.

114
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm the one who invited you today.

115
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,279
How can I let you pay?

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,399
It's the thought that counts.

117
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,920
It doesn't matter who pays.

118
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,839
I, Liang Keqing, would never let a girl pay.

119
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,879
Why can't a girl pay?

120
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,120
Waiter.

121
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:58,920
Menu.

122
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,839
Lettuce with oyster sauce.

123
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,839
Sweet and sour pork with pineapple.

124
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,720
Poached chicken.

125
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,920
Yes, sir.

126
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,439
It's New Year's Eve—three dishes aren't enough, right?

127
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,959
No need to save money for me.

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,879
Order as much as you want.

129
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:21,800
Alright.

130
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,199
Except for these three, skip them.

131
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,079
We'll take everything else.

132
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,279
Sir, all the dishes are here.

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,920
Liang Keqing.

134
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,360
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Weren't you the one who said you'd pay?

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,639
It's the last meal of the year.

137
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,839
Let's eat well.

138
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:51,839
And drink well.

139
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Eat and drink to our hearts' content.

140
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,399
A toast to you.

141
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,639
Thank you for all your help during this time.

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,120
No matter what the future holds,

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,199
at least we met.

144
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Then let me toast to you as well.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
May the new year

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,839
bring us more and more happiness.

147
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,080
Mr. Tang

148
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,559
Use your brain and think about it.

149
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,440
Is there any kind of woman I, Liang Keqing, can't have?

150
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,440
Why would I be interested in a girl from the countryside?

151
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,279
If dancing one dance could make her my woman,

152
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,919
then I, Liang Keqing,

153
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
wouldn't that mean I'm just desperate?

154
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,960
I only got close to her to get to know Fang Mu.

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,679
Now that the contract is signed,

156
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,600
she's of no use to me anymore.

157
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,440
Xiaoxiao

158
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,679
the girl you introduced before,

159
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,519
she's a good person.

160
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,639
She works efficiently too.

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,240
One day,

162
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,879
she'll be as outstanding as you.

163
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
The reason Xiaoxiao is where she is today

164
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,000
is because Sister Hong helped her back then.

165
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,120
Yueyue

166
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,399
Look who's here.

167
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,480
Xiaoxiao, you're here!

168
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:25,840
Yue'er

169
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,679
Long time no see.

170
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,799
You two catch up for a bit.

171
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,120
I have something to do, so I'll get going.

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,879
Sis

173
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,120
How have you been lately?

174
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,120
I've been pretty good.

175
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,480
I'm back this time because I want to open a clothing store.

176
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,639
I need someone to help out.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
I've already talked to Sister Hong.

178
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
It's just up to you if you want to come.

179
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,519
Lend a hand.

180
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,480
Sis

181
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,919
Wherever you are, that's where I'll be.

182
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,559
Then I'll be counting on you from now on.

183
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,360
Okay.

184
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,159
Not bad.

185
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,320
Although it's a bit messy right now,

186
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,120
the space is actually quite large.

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
The layout is also nice and square, just right.

188
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,080
We can partition a small fitting room over there.

189
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,720
How about putting a counter here?

190
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,039
Sounds good.

191
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,200
And this side can be all display shelves.

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,960
We can fill up the middle too.

193
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,679
I think on that wall grid over there,

194
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,600
That little brat...

195
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,399
She must have someone backing her up.

196
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,679
Otherwise, how could she open such a big shop?

197
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,799
Yue'er, be careful.

198
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,919
There are nails up there.

199
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,240
How about you take out this trash later?

200
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,480
And then bring me a bucket of water.

201
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,919
Okay.

202
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,080
Who gave you permission to open a shop here?

203
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,720
Did you check with our Third Master?
