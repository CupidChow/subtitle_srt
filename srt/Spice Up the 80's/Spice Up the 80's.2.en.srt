1
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,799
Congratulations, congratulations!

2
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,399
Congratulations.

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,560
Screw you.

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,119
Don't move, don't move.

5
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,679
What are you doing?

6
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,359
Xiao Wu, Xiao Wu.

7
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,479
What's going on?

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,840
Calm down.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,679
Listen to your aunt, let me explain.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,239
This is a misunderstanding.

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,359
Hurry up and say it.

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,120
Xiao Wu.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,640
This girl has always been immature.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
But your aunt and I have always supported you.

15
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,680
That's right, don't be angry.

16
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,680
You brat, hurry up and explain what happened.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,799
Fine, I'll say it.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,680
First of all,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,480
I don't know this stupid brother of yours.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,400
I don't agree to this marriage either.

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,239
No, no.

22
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,239
Secondly,

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,120
He

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,640
is my lover.

25
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,280
Everything that should have happened and shouldn't have happened between us

26
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,840
has already happened.

27
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:28,959
No, no!

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,640
Shut up!

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,079
You may not care about your reputation, but I do.

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,400
You haven't even gotten married yet,

31
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,640
and you've already had an affair with another man.

32
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,000
You really have no shame.

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,560
You're so fickle and shameless.

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,519
How can you say that about me?

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,760
Let go of me!

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
You're a disgrace to the family.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,159
You've completely ruined the Lin family's reputation.

38
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,560
You little brat, you're going to be the death of me!

39
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,159
Xiao Wu, don't be angry.

40
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,120
She was examined last night.

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
She's still pure.

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,239
She's still a virgin.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,920
Otherwise,

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,000
the Wang family's money

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,079
I won't take a single cent.

46
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:54,879
That's right.

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,359
Really.

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
Lin Sufen.

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,079
Without my knowledge

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,519
and without my consent,

51
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,480
you secretly signed the marriage contract for me.

52
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
You even drugged me and made me unconscious.

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,040
How is this any different from human trafficking?

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
Don't talk nonsense.

55
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,799
Lin Xiaoxiao.

56
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,319
Ever since your parents died,

57
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,080
I took you in.

58
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,240
I fed you, clothed you, and even sent you to school.

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,159
No matter how you put it today,

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,199
this is still the Lin family marrying off a daughter.

61
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,719
That's right, the Lin family is marrying off a daughter.

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Enough, enough.

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,520
Since everything's been said,

64
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,879
then marry my brother

65
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,719
and have the wedding ceremony right now.

66
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,000
Whether she's pure or not,

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
we'll know tonight.

68
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,800
Yes, yes, yes.

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Have the ceremony, have the ceremony.

70
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,240
What did you say?

71
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,240
Let her go.

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,280
The ceremony!

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,439
Let go of me.

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,599
Let go.

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,319
Let go

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,960
First, bow to Heaven and Earth

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,439
Okay

78
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,360
Okay

79
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,439
Second, bow to the parents

80
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,560
Did you not eat today?

81
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I can't even hold you down

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,800
Let go

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,319
Let go of me

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
Let me go

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,919
Third bow

86
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,000
What era is this? Still arranging marriages?

87
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,240
Kid, mind your own business

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,599
They're hitting people

89
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,520
Let go of me

90
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,400
Grab her

91
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,400
Don't let her get away

92
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't come any closer

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,039
Don't let her get away

94
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,439
Hurry, catch her for me

95
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,400
Don't run

96
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,280
Don't move

97
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,479
Catch her

98
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,680
Hurry up

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
Youqing, hurry, hurry!

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Catch her quickly

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,879
Catch them quickly

102
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,160
Go

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,519
Don't let them get away

104
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,480
Don't run

105
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,199
Step back

106
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,600
Move aside

107
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,720
Come down

108
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,720
Everyone, stay back

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,839
Everyone, stop

110
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,560
What a disgrace

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,480
Sorry about today, Mr. Liang

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
Sorry to make you laugh

113
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Do you see me laughing?

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
What kind of background does this Liang guy have?

115
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Judging by his demeanor and skills,

116
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,839
he doesn't seem like an ordinary person.

117
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,800
Yeah.

118
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,800
Looks like this girl really landed herself a good catch.

119
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,560
You never know.

120
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,720
She's really lucky.

121
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,480
The village has announced it so many times.

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
Arranged marriages are strictly forbidden.

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,519
Arranged marriages are strictly forbidden.

124
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
But look at you all.

125
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,360
You still dare to break the rules.

126
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,639
Uncle San,

127
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,360
it's not like we're unreasonable people.

128
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,319
If this marriage isn't legitimate,

129
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,240
we can call it off.

130
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,240
But we've already paid the bride price.

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
And we've prepared everything that needs to be prepared.

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,199
There should at least be an explanation.

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,959
Exactly, that's right.

134
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,959
There should be an explanation.

135
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,519
How much did they take from you?

136
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,600
Eight hundred.

137
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
So in your eyes, that's all I'm worth?

138
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,279
Xiaoxiao

139
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
Your aunt and uncle are doing this for your own good.

140
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
You're still young and don't understand things.

141
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,399
In our whole area,

142
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,519
we've chosen a good family for you to marry into.

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,560
It's better than letting that outsider named Liang

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
trick you and take you away by force.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,120
If something bad really happens,

146
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,879
it could ruin your whole future.

147
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,360
Then we

148
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,160
would never be able to face your late parents.

149
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,759
How could my parents ever marry me off to

150
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,000
someone I've never even met?

151
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,519
Stop making a scene here.

152
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,759
Marriage

153
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,439
should be about mutual consent.

154
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,079
In our Lin Family Village,

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,040
we can't let these outdated ideas take over.

156
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
How much did you take from them?

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Return it right away.

158
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,199
Return it.

159
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,399
Third Great-Uncle

160
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,279
How can we just return the money like that?

161
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
In our whole area,

162
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,600
who doesn't accept a bride price when marrying off their daughter?

163
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,360
Exactly.

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,560
This stubborn girl

165
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,639
I raised her with so much hardship.

166
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,879
Is it wrong for us to accept the Wang family's bride price?

167
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,360
Lin Xiaoxiao

168
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,720
We treated you like our own daughter,

169
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,560
who would have thought

170
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,399
this is how you repay us?

171
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,759
Just watch, today I’ll break your legs, I’m telling you.

172
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,160
Lin Sufen

173
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,000
Still trying to play tricks?

174
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,439
Hurry up and return the money.

175
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,720
Third Great-Uncle

176
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,199
I don’t have any money left.

177
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,680
But all of Yanyan’s tuition and accommodation fees were money too.

178
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,360
Now you want us to pay it back,

179
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,439
isn’t that just

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
forcing the two of us to die?

181
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:51,920
Fine then.

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,240
If you can’t pay the money back,

183
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,240
then use this house as collateral.

184
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,040
The house?

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
No, no!

186
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Xiaoxiao,

187
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,319
you heard everything, right?

188
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,199
Even if it’s just for your sister’s sake,

189
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,839
she’s the first from our Lin Family Village

190
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,560
to go to college.

191
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,360
Oh, Xiaoxiao,

192
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,959
your aunt is begging you.

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,639
Lin Sufen

194
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,000
I can pay back the bride price for you.

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,759
But I have one condition.

196
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,199
What condition?

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Separate the family.

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
The principal and interest must be clear.

199
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
Pay back the money as agreed.

200
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,519
And our marriage arrangement will be settled.

201
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,360
Alright.

202
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,399
You have three months.

203
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,240
Let’s go.

204
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,679
I also ask Third Great-Uncle to be a witness.

205
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,639
Starting today,

206
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,519
I will move out of the Lin family’s old house.

207
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
From now on,

208
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,759
I will have nothing more to do with the Lin family.

209
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,600
You left this in the car.

210
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,279
Thank you.

211
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,919
This was yours to begin with.

212
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,360
Just returning it to its rightful owner.

213
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,399
I mean thank you for what happened today.

214
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
If someone

215
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
suffers hardship and injustice in life

216
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
and doesn’t want to beg for mercy,

217
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,399
the most direct way is to fight back.

218
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,279
You never know who will win or lose.

219
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,399
Your hand is injured.

220
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,919
It’s nothing.

221
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
My name is Lin Xiaoxiao.

222
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,399
Liang Keqing.
