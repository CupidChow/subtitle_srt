1
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,719
Boss Xu

2
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,920
So what's Xu Jianfeng's background?

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,359
Xu Jianfeng used to

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,679
be pretty good at business.

5
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,840
But ever since he got hooked on gambling,

6
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,000
he's racked up a mountain of debt.

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,439
Then he started scamming people.

8
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:50,920
Miss,

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,920
just take this as a lesson.

10
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,759
Losing money can ward off bigger troubles.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,039
Try to look on the bright side.

12
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,079
I'm not the one who needs to learn a lesson.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,520
He's the one who should learn.

14
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,719
Young master,

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,280
Father,

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,799
Didn't you say whoever brings in Professor Fang gets the project?

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,439
So why did you give it straight to Second Uncle?

18
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,760
Leave us for now.

19
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,280
I heard you left early for a woman.

20
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,200
You left ahead of time.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,560
Do you realize

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,680
that woman

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,959
is a key contact between me and Professor Fang?

24
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,239
If anything happens to her,

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,519
Professor Fang won't work with our Liang family at all.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,120
You're not focusing on what's most important.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
Instead, you're caught up in trivial matters.

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
Whether it's for business or personal reasons, you know best.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,680
Father,

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,760
Is it that, in your eyes, nothing matters except the company's interests?

31
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,120
Everything else is just a side issue?

32
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,400
Including me?

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
I know you feel resentful.

34
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,560
But you have to bear it.

35
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,760
You're only tough on the surface, but lack depth.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,640
If you stay like this,

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,519
how can you compete with others?

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,840
Father,

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,640
That's all.

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,879
You may go now.

41
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,400
Mr. Liang

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,080
A young lady just left you a message.

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,080
She said you don't need to wait for her.

44
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,479
She has some things to take care of.

45
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,199
Once she's finished handling things in the next few days,

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
she'll give you a call.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,439
It's morning.

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,039
If you want to sleep, go home and sleep.

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,680
Time to clean up.

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,680
Everyone, get up.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,560
My back...

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,319
Old Zhang

53
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,199
That's it for today.

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's meet another day.

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
Alright, alright, alright.

56
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:54,759
Okay.

57
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,599
We fellow townsmen should help each other when we're away from home.

58
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,439
Right?

59
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,360
Pleasure working with you.

60
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,240
Stop!

61
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,319
Stop!

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,919
Stop!

63
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,000
Stop running!

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,759
Stop!

65
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,039
Go ahead, run!

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,680
Let's see where you can run to.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,439
If you chase me, how can I not run?

68
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,879
Who are you?

69
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,159
Do I know you?

70
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,080
Watch.

71
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,840
Where did you get it?

72
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,840
I won it playing cards.

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,879
Do you know Xu Jianfeng?

74
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,720
He's inside.

75
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,199
Don't say I brought you here.

76
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,160
Draw from the wall.

77
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,839
Play, play, play.

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,040
Again.

79
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,000
How much are you betting?

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,439
I don't believe it.

81
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,720
Sixty thousand.

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,160
I win.

83
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,480
I win too.

84
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,079
Double win.

85
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,879
One discard, three wins.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,759
My specialty.

87
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,920
No.

88
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,319
Boss Xu, your luck is pretty good.

89
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,680
Give me back my money.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,199
Who are you?

91
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,079
I don't know you.

92
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:05,959
Eight circles.

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,639
Pung.

94
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,240
Five bamboos.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,680
Tch.

96
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,519
What are you clicking your tongue for?

97
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,079
Can you stop being so sarcastic?

98
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,720
Get lost.

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,800
Then give me back my money.

100
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,560
If you don't pay me back, I'll stay here.

101
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,519
Let's see who can stand it.

102
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,519
I don't have any money.

103
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,639
I've got plenty of time anyway.

104
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,040
With your card skills,

105
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
even if you cheat and win more money,

106
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,279
you'll lose it all.

107
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,079
There's not a single five-ten-thousand tile on this table.

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
Why are you in such a hurry?

109
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,519
Play the two-ten-thousand tile.

110
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,000
Both players next to you want ten-thousand tiles.

111
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,199
Why are you collecting ten-thousand tiles?

112
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,040
Go for bamboo tiles.

113
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,800
Throw away all the ten-thousand tiles.

114
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:51,920
Wow.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,360
Eight bamboo.

116
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,519
Pung.

117
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,920
Four-ten-thousand.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,279
You say your luck is bad again.

119
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,959
But you still don't use your brain.

120
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,040
You don't even check what tiles the players next to you have played.

121
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,399
All you do is discard tiles.

122
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,040
Nine bamboo.

123
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:07,600
Kong.

124
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,439
What do we do now?

125
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,279
How about you let someone else play?

126
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,240
Get up, get up.

127
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,079
Time to switch players.

128
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Okay.

129
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,240
Five-ten-thousand.

130
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,160
Stop.

131
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:25,759
Kong.

132
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,120
Four-ten-thousand.

133
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,319
Three circles.

134
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,319
Self-drawn, pure one suit.

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,120
Three players with kongs.

136
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
Pay up, pay up.

137
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you thinking about?

138
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,839
Save one for me.

139
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,319
This money isn't nearly enough.

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Come on, let's keep playing.

141
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Alright, alright, let's continue.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,040
Shuffle the tiles.

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,560
Come on, come on.

144
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,199
I win.

145
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,079
Not a single point missing.

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Please accept this with a smile.

147
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,600
I didn't see that coming.

148
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,480
Your card skills are way better than those old mahjong players.

149
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,240
Where did you learn that?

150
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,920
I've been looking for you these past two days.

151
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,839
I told you, Meijiang produces talented people.

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,680
Impressive.

153
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,920
We're even now.

154
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,959
The money between us is settled.

155
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,600
But about you lying to me,

156
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,560
we're not even on that.

157
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Xu Jianfeng.

158
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Stop.

159
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,160
Don't go.

160
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:13,920
Stop.

161
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,319
Lin Xiaoxiao, you bastard!

162
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:17,879
Don't move.

163
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,680
You set me up.

164
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,879
I'm going to kill you.

165
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,399
All the files are ready.

166
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,040
They're ready.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,319
Lin Xiaoxiao.

168
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,560
Lin Xiaoxiao.

169
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:28,839
Lin Xiaoxiao.

170
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,959
Wake up.

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,120
Lin Xiaoxiao.

172
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,600
You really don't care about your life.

173
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,559
You dared to go to a place like that alone.

174
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,799
Why are you here?

175
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,159
You ended up in the police station just for debt collecting.

176
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
You really are something.

177
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
The police said they won't press charges this time.

178
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
But don't do it again.

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,480
Did Liang Keqing send you?

180
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,440
Don't worry about that for now.

181
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,200
Let's go, let's go.

182
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,320
Miss Zhong.

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,639
Tell that bastard Xu Jianfeng for me,

184
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,320
if he can't pay back the money,

185
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,799
he can rot in jail.

186
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,919
How am I supposed to stay calm?

187
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,679
Go back and wait for news.

188
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,879
We'll let you know as soon as there's any progress.

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,480
I heard you caught that scammer.

190
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,120
How should I address you?

191
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,679
My name is Yue Jingzhe.

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,919
If you want to be closer, you can call me A Zhe.

193
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,399
Did anyone ask you?

194
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,120
My name is Lin Xiaoxiao.

195
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,840
Hello, my name is Zhong Xin.

196
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,559
This...

197
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,360
is my business card.

198
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,279
Love at first sight.

199
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,039
Gentle and warm.

200
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,399
Nice name.

201
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Kid,

202
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,919
I want to talk to Lin Xiaoxiao for a bit, can you be quiet?

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,080
I heard you got scammed while buying goods.

204
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,679
I also happen to be in the clothing business.

205
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,519
If you're free tomorrow, you can come check out my shop.

206
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,080
Thank you.

207
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,720
I'll definitely go.

208
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:17,960
Hey, beautiful,

209
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,399
Do you need a ride?

210
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,000
Get lost.

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,480
The people over on Xianghe Road are complicated.

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,919
They all do shady business.

213
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,320
If you really want to do business,

214
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,399
you should come to Tianhe Market.

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,000
They have a full range of styles and plenty of stock.

216
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,799
The supply channels are legitimate too.

217
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,639
At least, no one would dare scam you there.

218
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,639
Feel free to look around.

219
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
Here at my place,

220
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,440
the first floor is for sample displays,

221
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,159
the second floor is for offices and meetings,

222
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,919
and the third floor is for pattern design.

223
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,000
So, what do you think? See anything you like?

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,240
Sis,

225
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
your place is really high-end.

226
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,440
All your clothes are so fashionable.

227
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,200
I've never seen anything like this in Meijiang.

228
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,440
If I take any of these back to Meijiang, they'll sell like crazy.

229
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,720
Of course!

230
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,919
You've got a great eye.

231
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,279
Well, you know who I am.

232
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,440
That's right, sis.

233
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,559
I don't have much capital on hand.

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,600
You know my situation.

235
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
Can you let me

236
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,840
take the goods first and pay later?

237
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,559
I won't let you lose out.

238
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
I'll sign a sales contract with you.

239
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,799
I'll even give you a bit more interest.

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,399
That works.

241
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,519
But

242
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,200
you have to agree to one condition.

243
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:24,919
Go ahead.

244
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,080
What condition?

245
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,919
Take her to change clothes.

246
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,240
Change clothes?
