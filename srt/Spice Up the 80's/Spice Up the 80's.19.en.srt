1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,319
You have no idea how dangerous it just was.

2
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
When Liu Yue came in,

3
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,280
my heart almost jumped out of my chest from fear.

4
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,040
If they had found out,

5
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,439
they would definitely have told the school.

6
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,879
Then I would have been expelled.

7
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,519
Tang,

8
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,640
I really gave up everything for you.

9
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,799
Twelve million.

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,840
So why aren't you praising me already?

11
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,840
Lin Xiaoyan,

12
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm very satisfied with your performance.

13
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,640
Very satisfied.

14
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,799
You fell for Lin Xiaoxiao's trick.

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,000
So Lin Xiaoyan really did sneak a look, right?

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
How could someone like her

17
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,680
work so diligently for me?

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,000
I knew she must have another motive.

19
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,560
When you told me that in the past two years

20
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,000
she's been very close to Tang Ke,

21
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,200
I knew her goal

22
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,200
must be related to Tang Ke.

23
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,000
And my biggest competition with Tang Ke recently

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,480
is the bidding for Siyang Garment Factory.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,359
So I made a fake

26
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,760
twelve-million-yuan bidding contract

27
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,519
to test Lin Xiaoyan.

28
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,760
She really took the bait.

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,319
But I did take out a loan from the bank.

30
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,879
Fifteen million.

31
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,919
Fifteen million.

32
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:14,639
That's right.

33
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,400
Business is like a battlefield.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,759
I have to keep track of my opponent's every move.

35
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,439
I asked a friend at the bank and found out

36
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,319
that Lin Xiaoxiao just went to the bank

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
and took out a loan of fifteen million.

38
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,759
So this fifteen million

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,759
is the real price she bid at the auction.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
But on her investment proposal

41
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,719
why did she write twelve million?

42
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,039
She did that to make sure

43
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,120
that with fifteen million

44
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,719
she could win the bid for Suyang Garment Factory.

45
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,680
It was a smokescreen.

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,080
She was trying to trick us.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,400
What do you mean?

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,719
As far as I know,

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,680
even though Lin Xiaoxiao is growing rapidly,

50
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,759
her cash flow

51
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,840
isn't sufficient.

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,400
Without affecting her cash flow,

53
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,360
winning the bid for Suyang Garment Factory smoothly

54
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,240
fifteen million is the most cost-effective.

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,759
The only problem left is

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,000
how to win the bid at this price.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,599
To win Suyang Garment Factory.

58
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,199
But even if it was a smokescreen,

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
how did she know I would go?

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,599
I'm watching her,

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
and she's watching me too.

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
It's very likely

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,479
she already knows about our relationship.

64
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,520
And things were so tense between you two before,

65
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,240
there's no way she wouldn't be on guard against you.

66
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,520
So,

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,879
you calculated from the start that I would be exposed.

68
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,479
Your biggest role was to be exposed.

69
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,439
When Tang Ke sees this document

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
he'll definitely think I'm going to

71
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,400
offer twelve million

72
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,599
to acquire Suyang Garment Factory.

73
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,520
In reality,

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,599
Lin Xiaoxiao wants to use

75
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,800
fifteen million

76
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,039
to acquire Suyang Garment Factory.

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,080
With his personality,

78
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,719
he'll only bid a little more than us,

79
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,360
just enough to win the auction

80
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,439
and still control the costs.

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,840
But it won't be just a bit more than twelve million,

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,879
it'll be a bit more than fifteen million.

83
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,039
Just a little more.

84
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,479
Suyang Garment Factory—

85
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,759
I am determined to get it.

86
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,599
Aren't you from Tingting Yuli Company,

87
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,439
President Lin and President Liang?

88
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,240
Are you here to just make up the numbers too?

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,439
Thanks.

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,479
So confident.

91
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,280
My mom has told me since I was little,

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,280
confidence

93
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,479
is a necessary condition for success.

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,080
Let's wait and see.

95
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:01,919
Sure.

96
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
I'll treat you to a meal then.

97
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,039
President Liang,

98
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:04,960
please do me the honor.

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,879
No problem.

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Ladies first.

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Go.

102
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,199
Let's go.

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,439
Hello, representatives.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Welcome to the Siyang Garment Factory bidding conference.

105
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Now, let's invite the bid opener.

106
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,360
to announce the bidding results.

107
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,319
I am the bid opener.

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,040
Wang Guoqiang.

109
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,759
I am the bid supervisor, Chen Hong.

110
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,639
This bidding process is fair and impartial.

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
This time, Changfeng Trading Group Co., Ltd.

112
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,800
has a bid amount of

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,079
ten million RMB.

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
This time, Henghui Garments Co., Ltd.

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,560
has a bid amount of

116
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
eleven million RMB.

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,439
This time, Tang Group

118
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,720
has a bid amount of

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,399
sixteen million RMB.

120
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,279
This time, Tingting Yuli Garment Trading Co., Ltd.

121
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,319
has a bid amount of

122
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,439
seventeen million RMB.

123
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,480
Seventeen million.

124
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,040
In this bidding,

125
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,639
Tingting Yuli Garment Trading Co., Ltd.

126
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,319
offered the highest bid.

127
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,920
Congratulations to Tingting Yuli.

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,000
Congratulations.

129
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,920
This bidding conference is now concluded.

130
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,120
Congratulations.

131
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,079
Congratulations.

132
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,680
The details of future cooperation

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,839
will be discussed with you as soon as possible.

134
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Alright.

135
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,439
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:32,839
Thank you.

137
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,040
How did you know?

138
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,920
I offered sixteen million.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,480
Mr. Tang,

140
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,480
Thank you for coming all this way just to compete.

141
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,959
Based on the current development of the company

142
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,000
and the actual valuation of Siyang Garment Factory,

143
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,000
the lowest price I can accept is seventeen million.

144
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,319
To prevent Tang Ke from bidding higher than this price,

145
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,040
I had to use that strategy.

146
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,120
Do you think Tang Ke can see through our strategy?

147
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,480
He has strong connections in Yangcheng.

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,519
No matter which bank we take a loan from,

149
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,279
he can still find out the amount we borrowed,

150
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,120
which is fifteen million.

151
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,000
So,

152
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,920
twelve million

153
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,199
was just a part of my plan.

154
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,000
If he doesn't see through this strategy,

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,759
he'll bid thirteen million.

156
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,560
If he realizes it's our strategy,

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,399
he'll conclude

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
our bottom line is fifteen million.

159
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,879
As long as he doesn't go above seventeen million,

160
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,120
I can win this bid for sure.

161
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
You dare to play tricks on me?

162
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,079
Lin Xiaoyan,

163
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,480
if it weren't for you,

164
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,000
I wouldn't have been able to win the bidding so smoothly.

165
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,240
Don't worry.

166
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,199
Your excellent performance here

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,079
will be truthfully reported to your school.

168
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,680
Boss Tang,

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,079
I hope we can have more healthy competition in the future

170
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
and fewer underhanded tactics.

171
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,480
Lin Xiaoxiao,

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
there's still a long road ahead.

173
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,319
We'll see.

174
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,399
We're leaving, Mr. Tang.

175
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,759
Mr. Lin

176
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,439
You secured the Suyang Garment Factory.

177
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,120
I was the first to come and sign a contract with you.

178
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
Thank you for your support, Mr. Zhang.

179
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,759
Once you review the contract,

180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
we'll immediately start production.

181
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,879
Then it's settled.

182
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,000
Looking forward to our cooperation.

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,519
Likewise.

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,439
Mr. Tang

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,199
Director Wu

186
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,079
It's an honor to have you here.

187
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm truly honored that you could come.

188
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,079
Please, have a seat.

189
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,319
Having you here for a meal

190
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,399
is a great honor for me.

191
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,000
Mr. Tang

192
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,160
We're all friends here.

193
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,759
Feel free to speak openly.

194
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,120
Director Wu, you're a straightforward person.

195
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
Then I'll get straight to the point.

196
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,199
I invited you here today

197
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,240
to talk about the Suyang Garment Factory.

198
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,199
You see,

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,439
the Suyang Garment Factory

200
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,279
has already been sold to Tingting Yuli.

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,279
There's really nothing left to discuss, is there?

202
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,480
Director Wu

203
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,079
the Suyang Garment Factory

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,199
is a key part of our Tang Group's

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,839
future development strategy.

206
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,160
If it falls into someone else's hands,

207
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,680
it will have a huge impact

208
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,800
on our Tang Group.

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,920
Well,

210
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,040
the Suyang Garment Factory was sold at the bidding conference

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,519
in front of everyone.

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,160
Tingting Yuli bought it.

213
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,600
The bidding results have already been made public.

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,279
It's not something I can change.

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,920
President Tang

216
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,639
Come, come, come

217
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:14,800
This is

218
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,199
my executive assistant

219
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Lin Xiaoyan

220
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,920
Hello, Director Wu

221
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Hello, hello

222
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,079
This

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,399
is tea personally selected for you by President Tang

224
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,519
It has a rich and mellow taste

225
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,480
with a sweet and lingering aftertaste

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,439
Please take your time to enjoy it

227
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
There are also two boxes for you to take with you when you leave

228
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,559
President Tang, you really

229
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,360
Only in this way

230
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,600
can it match your status and position

231
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Come, Xiaoyan, have a seat

232
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:45,960
Director

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,759
Director

234
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,559
Xiaoyan is very capable at work

235
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,480
Not only is she obedient

236
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,799
she's also very competent

237
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,519
Is that so?

238
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,559
Director

239
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
If you could help me

240
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,519
with the matter of Siyang Garment Factory

241
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,600
Xiaoyan

242
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,600
today

243
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
personally brought the tea

244
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,799
to deliver it to the Director

245
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,759
This is also a small token of my appreciation

246
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,279
President Tang

247
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,519
A toast to President Tang

248
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,840
Come, come, come

249
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,039
You jerk.

250
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,360
I got expelled from school because of you.

251
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,799
What do you take me for?

252
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,919
Have you ever been sincere with me, even a little?

253
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,480
Yanyan.

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,759
I know this isn't fair to you.

255
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,279
You know that, yet you still made me be with other men.

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,679
Do you even have a heart, Tang Ke?

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
Do you want Lin Xiaoxiao to walk all over us?

258
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
But I truly love you.

259
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,320
Have you ever truly cared about me, Tang Ke?

260
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,039
Have you ever truly cared about me?

261
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,799
Are you even human, Tang Ke?

262
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Aren't you done yet?

263
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,360
Who do you think you are?

264
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,440
Do you want to go back to Linjia Village and be a country girl again?

265
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,799
Is there anything you're wearing that I didn't buy for you?

266
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
Without me, Tang Ke,

267
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,360
you're nothing.

268
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,519
Yanyan.

269
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm sorry.

271
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm sorry.

272
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,360
Yanyan, Yanyan.

273
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,240
I really have no other choice.

274
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,679
Help me, this is the last time.

275
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,440
I promise you.

276
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,799
Once this is over,

277
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,279
I'll marry you right away.

278
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,679
I want everyone in Yangcheng to know

279
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,120
that you, Yanyan,

280
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,159
are my one and only true love.

281
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,679
Yanyan, believe me, this really is the last time.

282
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Trust me one more time.
