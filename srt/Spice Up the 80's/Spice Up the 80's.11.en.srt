1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,479
How about it?

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,320
Can we talk business properly now?

3
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,280
From the very beginning,

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,039
you never intended to make cotton jackets.

5
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,159
You want me to fall out with those factory owners in the north of the city,

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,600
completely burn all bridges with them?

7
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,719
Boss Huo,

8
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,280
we're at the turning point of a market transformation.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
Whoever seizes the opportunity first

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,719
will be in an unbeatable position.

11
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,879
These three hundred men of yours

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,319
have followed you for quite some time, right?

13
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,200
You should let them have better prospects.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,760
You really were hiding your true strength.

15
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,359
I really underestimated you.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
Since you could get this "Little King Yama" to back you up,

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,159
I admit defeat.

18
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,000
Little King Yama.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,840
Mr. Liang shares

20
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,920
a common enemy with us in terms of interests.

21
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,319
Alright.

22
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,640
I, Old Huo,

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,040
will play along with you this time.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Once again, I wish for our

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,760
happy cooperation.

26
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,640
How did it go?

27
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,560
Did the contract signing go smoothly?

28
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,079
With you stepping in,

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,040
who would dare make it difficult?

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,239
Of course.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
This is Yangcheng, after all.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,319
Even without that batch of down feathers,

33
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,199
believe it or not,

34
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,080
I can still make Old Huo

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,960
work hard for you.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,840
Yes.

37
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,759
You're the best.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
Little King Yama.

39
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,599
That was my childhood nickname.

40
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,240
Don't call me that.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,919
Okay, Mr. Liang.

42
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,080
Thank you so much this time.

43
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm lucky to have you.

44
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,840
Happy to help.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,520
Mr. Lin.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,759
What are you laughing at?

47
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,240
I just thought of something.

48
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:50,400
Even though we've only known each other for three months,

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
but at my angriest,

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,919
most embarrassed,

51
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,479
and most humiliating moments,

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
you were always there.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,719
If you put it that way,

54
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,639
in your life,

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
there are also the happiest,

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,240
most joyful,

57
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,080
and most satisfying three moments.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,840
Why not try for those too?

59
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,800
Maybe you should work for them.

60
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,120
Okay.

61
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,800
Oh.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
Everyone,

63
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,360
let's get to work!

64
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,280
Remember,

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,840
the stitching on the down jackets must be up to standard.

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,960
The seam density has to be sufficient.

67
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,319
Otherwise, the down will leak.

68
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,479
Each team leader

69
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,960
must make sure the tasks are clearly assigned.

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,599
Whether we can have a good New Year

71
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,680
depends on this.

72
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,520
Xiaoxiao,

73
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,280
I have confidence

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,520
that after this winter,

75
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,759
we'll definitely be able to stand up again.

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,519
Boss Zhao

77
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,879
Boss Zhang

78
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,399
Director Zhong

79
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
This down jacket is definitely much lighter.

80
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,639
Right?

81
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,800
There are many more styles.

82
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,240
A Zhe

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
Bring over the other styles.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,519
Okay.

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,480
I told you, they have a good eye.

86
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,120
Alright, no problem.

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,879
Looking forward to working together.

88
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,519
Hello?

89
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,839
That might have to wait until after the New Year.

90
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,319
Yeah, everything sold out so quickly.

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
If I’d known, I would have ordered twenty thousand pieces.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
There are other styles here too.

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,120
Alright, alright, let’s get in touch after the New Year.

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,800
This year, down jackets unexpectedly became a trend.

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Everyone in Yangcheng

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,759
takes pride in wearing a down jacket

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,680
and feels proud.

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,519
These down jackets come in various colors.

99
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,639
They’re comfortable to wear.

100
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,240
And very warm.

101
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,759
We hope everyone will support us.

102
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,720
Come and buy more.

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
Come on, cheers!

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,319
Let me tell you all,

105
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,720
our team

106
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,439
can be called

107
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,000
invincible.

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,600
Brains,

109
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,720
connections,

110
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,959
and efficiency.

111
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,439
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

112
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,120
Come on, come on.

113
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,720
Fill them all up.

114
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,439
Wait a second.

115
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,680
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

116
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,279
I made such a big contribution.

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,959
And you just brushed it off with one sentence.

118
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,639
The idea was Xiaoxiao's.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,839
I provided the goods.

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
The raw materials were supplied by Mr. Liang.

121
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,120
It's fine.

122
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,399
What did you contribute?

123
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,959
Let's not talk about anything else for now.

124
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,680
You were just supposed to watch the workers move the goods.

125
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,600
But look at you.

126
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,680
A single cigarette almost burned all the goods.

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
They worked hard all day.

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
I just gave them a cigarette.

129
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,160
What's wrong with that?

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,439
Smoking is strictly forbidden in the warehouse.

131
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,160
Don't you even have that much sense of safety?

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,120
I did it for our business too.

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,480
To help the workers be more efficient, okay?

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,319
Enough, A Zhe.

135
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,439
Little brother.

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,199
You're just making things worse.

137
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:18,959
A Zhe

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm just causing trouble.

139
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:19,879
A Zhe

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,439
If it weren't for Xiao Xiao

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,120
and my brother,

142
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,879
A Zhe, wake up.

143
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,399
Who wants to be your free labor?

144
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,240
Alright, alright, A Zhe, stop talking.

145
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,680
Zhong Xin

146
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,000
Let me tell you,

147
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,199
I

148
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,560
won't serve you anymore.

149
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,040
A Zhe

150
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,879
Enough, A Zhe.

151
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,279
A Zhe

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,079
A Zhe

153
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,759
You've had too much to drink, too much.

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,839
Let him go, let him go.

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
Who are you giving that attitude to?

156
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,759
A Zhe

157
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,199
Zhong Xin

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,319
I'm telling you,

159
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm not serving you anymore.

160
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,519
A Zhe

161
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,399
A Zhe, that's enough.

162
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,879
You're acting like a little kid.

163
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Are you still a man?

164
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,040
Sis

165
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
What did you say?

166
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,360
I said,

167
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,480
you're not acting like a man.

168
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,920
Do I look like a man now?

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,839
You're so tough.

170
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Do you dare come with me?

171
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,639
Sis, slow down.

172
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,959
That's enough.

173
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,199
You, Liang.

174
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,279
Are you a dog or something?

175
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
You stick your nose into everything.

176
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,600
You—

177
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
Watch your mouth, Tang.

178
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,959
Who gave you the guts?

179
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,800
Do you know whose turf this is?

180
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,839
A-Zhe.

181
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,800
Mr. Tang.

182
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
Coffee or tea?

183
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
This one.

184
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,200
Liang.

185
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,039
Do you think just because you protect Lin Xiaoxiao,

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
I won’t dare touch her?

187
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,120
Here in Yangcheng,

188
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,159
whoever cuts off my money,

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,720
I’ll make her life a living hell, believe it?

190
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,759
You’re using her to threaten me?

191
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,639
Everyone in Yangcheng knows she’s your woman.

192
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,399
You think you can protect her for now,

193
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,600
but can you protect her forever?

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,759
Mr. Tang.

195
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,159
Use your brain for once.

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
Is there any woman I, Liang Keqing, can’t have?

197
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,159
Why would I go for a girl from the countryside?

198
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
If just one dance could make her mine,

199
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
then I, Liang Keqing,

200
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,200
wouldn’t I be desperate and undiscerning?

201
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,039
And another thing—

202
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,679
I got close to her

203
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,200
just to meet Fang Mu.

204
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,320
Now that the deal is done,

205
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,519
she’s of no use to me.

206
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,600
Nonsense.

207
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,639
If she’s worthless to you,

208
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,600
why are you helping her against me?

209
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,559
I’m helping her

210
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,200
just because I can’t stand you.

211
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,759
A-Zhe.

212
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,600
See him out.

213
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,679
This coffee is too sour.

214
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,000
What kind of quality is this?

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,879
Sis,

216
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,639
That night,

217
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
you and A Zhe—

218
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,799
how did things go?

219
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Why does a kid want to know so much?

220
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,360
Hurry up,

221
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,200
try this one on too.

222
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, I’m not changing anymore.

223
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
I’ve already tried on more than ten outfits.

224
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
Is it really necessary?

225
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,440
I think it looks pretty good.

226
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,519
As someone with experience, I have to tell you,

227
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,720
whether clothes look good or not

228
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,720
depends on what the person looking at you thinks.

229
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
Besides, today is such an important day.

230
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,039
Liang Keqing and I are just friends, there’s no need.

231
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,000
Just friends, huh?

232
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,039
Just friends invite you to New Year’s Eve dinner?

233
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
We’re not like you and A Zhe.

234
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,759
Well then,

235
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,679
go change again.

236
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,919
So,

237
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,519
tell me

238
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,600
some details.

239
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,600
Alright.

240
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,200
Can I tell you while I change?

241
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,679
If you're talking about Liang Keqing,

242
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,600
he's outstanding in every way.

243
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,600
You really need to seize this opportunity.

244
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,519
What opportunity am I supposed to seize?

245
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,679
You—

246
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,799
No, Liang Keqing doesn't like me.

247
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,080
Do you really think your sister is blind?

248
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
He really doesn't like me.

249
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,080
Look how happy you are.

250
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,840
Look how pleased you look.

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
No, I'm not.

252
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,559
Miss Lin.

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,039
Our boss would like to discuss something with you.

254
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,279
We hope you'll do us the honor.

255
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
And you are...?

256
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,039
I'm with Tang Ke.

257
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Go back and tell your boss

258
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,039
Miss Lin doesn't have time today.

259
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,039
Miss Lin, perhaps you should come with us.

260
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,279
It'll save us all some trouble.

261
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,360
Who are you threatening?

262
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,600
Tell him to use whatever dirty tricks he has.

263
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,279
But if he wants to bully my sister,

264
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,279
that's not going to happen.

265
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll go with you.
