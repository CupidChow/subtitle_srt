1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,079
Dealing with those useless drunks is nothing for me.

2
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,000
I can handle them easily.

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,479
Thanks to you for helping me take care of those guys.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
So,

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,840
about our partnership—

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,640
I, Zhong Xin, always keep my word.

7
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,240
You can pick any clothes you like from the shop.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,479
But most of these clothes are almost out of season.

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,000
If you're not in a hurry,

10
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,359
you can wait for my next batch of winter jackets.

11
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,159
Either way, I'll give them to you at the original price.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,560
That works too.

13
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,799
Go ahead and pick for now.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,280
Hello? What's wrong?

15
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,439
What?

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,439
Wait, no—

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,799
How can you just quit all of a sudden?

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,760
Explain yourself.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,000
Otherwise, all of you better get back here.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,760
I, Zhong Xin, have always treated you well, haven't I?

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,760
But look at you now.

22
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,480
You pick the busiest time to abandon me.

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,920
Have you no conscience at all?

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,480
So you don't want your wages anymore, is that it?

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,640
Hello?

26
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:24,719
Hello?

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,640
Hello?

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,239
Did something happen?

29
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,200
I don't know which bastard

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,760
offered triple the salary

31
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,439
and poached all my shop assistants.

32
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,040
Just wait till I find out who it is—I’ll tear them apart.

33
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,159
They paid three times the salary?

34
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,920
That's quite a move.

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,120
The main thing is, I still have a truckload of goods at the factory waiting to be loaded.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,159
What am I supposed to do now?

37
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,239
Isn't there still me?

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,079
I can do it.

39
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,959
What are you doing? What are you doing?

40
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,159
Who told you to take the goods?

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,760
Hurry up and unload everything.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,680
Why are you just standing there?

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,319
Unload it.

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,719
Don't unload yet, don't unload yet.

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,560
Mr. Zhao.

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
Didn't we agree on this?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,879
We were supposed to get the goods today.

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,759
Don't unload yet.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,400
Mr. Zhong.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,159
Here's the situation.

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,879
Our factory's cash flow

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
has run into some problems.

53
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,199
It's stated here

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
that starting today

55
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,879
full payment is required to pick up goods.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
There's nothing I can do about it.

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,759
Brother Zhao,

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,960
we're old friends, it's not like I won't pay.

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
The clients are all waiting for their deliveries.

60
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,639
Can't you make an exception?

61
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,360
About that...

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,879
I really can't make an exception.

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,280
If you're in a hurry,

64
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,599
you can try another supplier first.

65
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Mr. Zhao.

66
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,719
Is it Tang Ke?

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Did Tang Ke tell you to do this?

68
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,120
Mr. Zhong.

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,319
I still have things to take care of inside.

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,360
You two,

71
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,400
I won't see you out.

72
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,960
Hurry up and unload it for me.

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,599
Zhao—

74
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,919
Which bastard did this?

75
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,479
Who was it?

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,719
Sneaking around like that.

77
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,360
Come out here right now!

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Are you even a man?

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,479
Sis,

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,599
don’t get angry yet.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,919
Let’s clean this up first.

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,520
I think this Tang Ke

83
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,639
isn’t as simple as he seems.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
Now the upstream suppliers refuse to deliver goods.

85
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
And the downstream merchants

86
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,680
are watching the delivery deadline get closer and closer.

87
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,400
If we can’t deliver on time within a month,

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,599
we’ll be facing huge compensation payments.

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,479
I don’t know what’s gotten into Tang Ke.

90
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,039
He turns on people faster than flipping a page.

91
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,599
I just don’t believe it.

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,240
That Tang Ke can control everything by himself.

93
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,639
That all the garment factories in Yangcheng have to listen to him.

94
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,039
The two biggest garment markets, Tianhe and Tianshui,

95
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,919
are both run by the Tang family.

96
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,400
Anyone who’s made it in the business

97
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,800
wouldn’t dare disrespect him.

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,759
Unless it’s

99
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,280
Unless

100
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,599
Boss Huo from Nancheng.

101
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,439
He’s always been in the business of high-quality knockoffs.

102
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,639
He’s never caught Tang Ke’s attention.

103
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,560
Since he’s in the knockoff business,

104
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,159
he must have a mature production line.

105
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,199
He can ramp up production capacity.

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
His production capacity can meet demand.

107
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,199
If we work with him,

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,919
our order of ten thousand pieces would be taken care of.

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,479
Sis,

110
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,240
Xiaoxiao,

111
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,240
when it comes down to it,

112
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,280
this matter

113
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,319
is just my bad luck, Zhong Xin.

114
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,479
I acknowledge your friend.

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,199
But you really don't need to get yourself involved too.

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
You run a clothing business in Yangcheng.

117
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,960
Of all people, you can't afford to offend Tang Ke.

118
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,759
I think, in this case, Tang Ke

119
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,039
might not be targeting just you.

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
Besides,

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
didn't you say I'm the company's deputy general manager?

122
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
Of course I have to stick with the company through thick and thin.

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,360
Right?

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,120
We still have some time.

125
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,279
Go and reassure those business partners.

126
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,680
As for Boss Huo from Nancheng,

127
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,839
I'll find a way to handle him.

128
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:27,839
Xiaoxiao,

129
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,519
that Boss Huo doesn't even take Tang Ke seriously.

130
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,560
You need to be careful.

131
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,439
Don't worry.

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,519
I've already looked into everything.

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,000
This time, Tang Ke

134
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,480
is definitely out to get her.

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,639
Boss

136
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,639
This young lady is here to see you.

137
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,279
Miss

138
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,519
How should I address you?

139
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,240
Lin Xiaoxiao

140
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,600
Here's my business card.

141
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,000
Have you eaten?

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,879
How about

143
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,160
we talk over a meal?

144
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,279
Boss Huo

145
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,519
I've already eaten.

146
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,240
Thank you.

147
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,879
We run a clothing wholesale business.

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm here to see you

149
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
because I want to place an order for ten thousand cotton jackets

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,199
before the fifteenth of next month.

151
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:39,920
What is it,

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,839
the factories in the north of the city

153
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,959
aren't supplying you?

154
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,639
Those factories in the north

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
have too many rules.

156
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,079
We're in a hurry for this batch.

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
The time it takes to go through their procedures

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,879
is definitely too long.

159
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,959
Right?

160
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,680
He won't let those lackeys work with you.

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,279
As expected, nothing escapes Boss Huo's eyes.

162
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,600
But I heard

163
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,800
Boss Huo originally made his fortune in the north of the city.

164
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,120
So why is he now running a counterfeit business in the south of the city?

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,720
Could it also be because of Tang Ke?

166
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,439
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

167
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,839
Boss Huo's business is so big,

168
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,839
he surely understands this simple logic.

169
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,160
I can work with you.

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,399
But you have to cover the material costs up front.

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,079
Once the funds come back,

172
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
I'll take an extra ten percent as profit.

173
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,360
That will be my interest.

174
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,519
If that's acceptable,

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,680
let's sign the contract now.

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
I want to see samples in three days.

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Sis,

178
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,480
what are you doing?

179
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,600
We've already asked around.

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
That jerk Tang Ke

181
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,560
is using all his resources now.

182
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
He's just waiting to see you fail.

183
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,199
What does this have to do with you?

184
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:56,839
You're meddling.

185
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,439
He's coming after me.

186
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,040
What do you mean?

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,439
It must have been at the ball that day.

188
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,439
He thinks you're the boss's woman.

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
But he can't do anything to the boss.

190
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,160
So

191
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,160
he can only go after you.

192
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,079
It's not all of you

193
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,319
who've lost your minds.

194
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,480
And you, too.

195
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,279
About the ball

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,519
What did you say to them?

197
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,319
That's not important.

198
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,879
What's important is

199
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,959
You just need to know

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,879
He came for me.

201
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,439
I can't just stand by and do nothing about this.

202
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,319
Sis,

203
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,399
Are you really willing

204
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,519
to let Tang Ke walk all over you?

205
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
Of course I'm not.

206
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,959
It's taken so much effort for the business to finally improve.

207
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,879
We can't go back to Meijiang empty-handed.

208
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,160
Call the guys.

209
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,120
What are you doing?

210
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,839
I want him to know

211
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,160
who really calls the shots in Yangcheng.

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Since he wants a fight,

213
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,319
I, Liang Keqing,

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,319
will fight him to the end.

215
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,360
Liang Keqing,

216
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,879
you're almost thirty years old.

217
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,040
Can you stop being so childish?

218
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,800
Everyone, calm down.

219
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,360
I have a way.

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,160
You're talking about Boss Huo, right?

221
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,439
You do business with him.

222
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,759
That's like asking a tiger for its skin.

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
Let's keep business matters in the realm of business.

224
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,519
As long as you promise

225
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,040
to get me a batch of raw materials within seven days,

226
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,920
then I can promise you

227
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,680
that we'll beat him fair and square this time.

228
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,680
Boss Huo,

229
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,399
the workers haven't all gone home early for the New Year, have they?

230
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,480
We agreed that after the samples,

231
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,439
we'd start production ahead of schedule.

232
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,600
Where is everyone in the factory?

233
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not that we're not rushing the work.

234
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,600
It's because your custom standards for the cotton jackets are too high.

235
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,639
The workers have been working day and night.

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,279
A few of the weaker ones

237
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,039
have ended up in the hospital.

238
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,559
It's that serious?

239
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,480
Which hospital?

240
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,840
I need to go see them.

241
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,799
No need to trouble yourself with that.

242
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,679
Don't worry.

243
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,840
I've already taken care of it.

244
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,720
Isn't it all for this matter?

245
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
The schedule got delayed.

246
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080
The workers

247
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,120
are upset again.

248
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm just worried for you.

249
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,399
Worried for me?

250
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,279
How could I not be?

251
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,200
There are over ten thousand orders left and only a little more than twenty days.

252
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,240
You can also expedite it.

253
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,559
The expedited fee

254
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,240
will be calculated at 80% of the contract price

255
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,879
and added to the original contract.

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
Mr. Huo,

257
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,519
I didn't expect you to be so particular about contracts.

258
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,720
Then you should know

259
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,279
that in our contract

260
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,559
the project duration and amount are clearly specified.

261
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,200
Raising the price now

262
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,120
isn't really appropriate, is it?

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,679
Then you can also unilaterally break the contract.

264
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
According to the contract,

265
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,159
you'll need to pay

266
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,480
five times the fee as compensation.

267
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,840
There's no such clause in our contract.

268
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,759
Well, here it is now.

269
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,600
I have three hundred mouths to feed at my factory.

270
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,799
I have to make sure they're fed.

271
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,679
Mr. Huo,

272
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,159
are you doing business or just being a thug?

273
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,519
Doing business with me

274
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,879
you're still a bit too inexperienced.

275
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,080
Are you sure?

276
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,440
Enough talk, sign it.

277
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,480
Let go of me.

278
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,120
Let go of me.

279
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,840
What's going on?

280
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,720
Open your eyes and take a good look.

281
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,519
What are you doing?

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,559
Mr. Huo,

283
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,559
sorry to keep you waiting.

284
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Down

285
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,039
The loft and warmth of down

286
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,799
are clearly superior to cotton jackets.

287
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,399
Plus, the new process will shorten production time.

288
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,879
If we want to beat Tang Ke in this winter's market,

289
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,399
we have to win with an unexpected strategy.

290
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Then how do you know

291
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,799
Boss Huo will definitely help you?

292
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,159
There are no permanent enemies,

293
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,399
only permanent interests.

294
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:37,480
This...

295
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,159
This...

296
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,200
So?

297
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
Can we talk business properly now?

298
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
From the very beginning,

299
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,240
you never planned to make cotton jackets.

300
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,440
Are you trying to make me

301
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,080
completely fall out with those factory owners in the north of the city

302
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
for good?
