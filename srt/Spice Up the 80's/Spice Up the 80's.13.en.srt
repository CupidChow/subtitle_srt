1
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,240
Yue'er, watch your hands.

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,119
There are nails on that.

3
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,560
Then, later, go throw out this trash.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,039
And bring me a bucket of water.

5
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:48,719
Okay.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,520
Who gave you permission to open a shop here?

7
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,200
Did you check with our Third Master first?

8
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,119
Third Master.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,159
This is the woman who sells eggs.

10
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,599
So you're the Third Master?

11
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,799
You're not welcome here.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,359
Get out.

13
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,280
What are you going to do?

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,319
Let go.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,359
What, you're not selling eggs anymore?

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,159
What are you planning to do with this shop?

17
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,000
Let go.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,120
What could a woman’s shop possibly sell?

19
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,840
Probably a hair-washing parlor.

20
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,159
You little punk, stop talking nonsense.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,959
What a coincidence.

22
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,719
Third Master.

23
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,000
That’s exactly my thing.

24
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:23,879
Let go.

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,959
If you keep this up, I’ll call for help.

26
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,439
Go ahead, call.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,599
Shout louder.

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,319
Let everyone outside hear too.

29
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,799
Let’s see who ends up more embarrassed.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,519
Help! Help!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
Let me go!

32
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,079
You’re pretty bold, aren’t you?

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,120
Sister Xiaoxiao!

34
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,200
Xiaoxiao!

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Yue’er, call the police!

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,840
Sister Xiaoxiao!

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
Let’s see what you can do.

38
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:43,840
You—

39
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,079
Let me go!

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,040
Behave yourself.

41
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,000
Don’t touch me!

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,719
Stop right there.

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,640
Catch the hooligan!

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,159
Stop!

45
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,599
Catch him!

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,280
Stop!

47
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:02,920
Catch them!

48
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,280
Catch the hooligan!

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,519
You, stop right there!

50
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,799
Did you bully that girl?

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,840
What are you looking at?

52
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
Never seen a couple flirting before?

53
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,319
Who’s your couple?

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,960
Shameless.

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,639
These two scoundrels are bullying the girl.

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,400
You old fool, don’t talk nonsense.

57
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,000
Those two run a hair salon.

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,159
That’s not a proper business then.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,639
I paid for their services.

60
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,360
Exactly.

61
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,719
How many times have I told you?

62
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,479
I run a clothing store, not a hair salon.

63
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,719
You’ve only ever seen hair salons.

64
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,680
You think everything is a hair salon.

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Others might not know what’s going on.

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,960
But you and I know exactly what she’s up to.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,639
Lin Sufen.

68
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,759
Why are you everywhere?

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
Everyone knows who she is, right?

70
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,800
Lin Xiaoxiao.

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,039
She's my real brother's daughter.

72
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
This girl has a tough fate.

73
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,680
Since she was little,

74
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,879
she brought bad luck to her parents and they died.

75
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,039
I was the one who raised her.

76
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,439
Now she's grown up,

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,280
and turned out to be quite pretty.

78
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,319
After coming back, she became rich.

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,199
Just like that,

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,479
she turned her back on everyone.

81
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,919
She's just an ingrate.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,039
No conscience at all.

83
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,319
Lin Sufen, can you stop slandering me?

84
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,479
Aren't you ashamed in front of all these fellow villagers?

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,599
Can you just leave me alone?

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
How am I slandering you?

87
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,719
Everyone knows, right?

88
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,240
Not long ago,

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,599
she was just a girl selling eggs.

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
She hasn't been in the city for long.

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,039
All of a sudden,

92
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,759
she turned into a wealthy little boss.

93
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,400
Exactly.

94
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,080
Tell me,

95
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,120
how could a young girl

96
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,120
make so much money?

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,719
I rely on my own abilities.

98
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh, give me a break.

99
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,400
You just rely on flirting.

100
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,280
That's right.

101
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,400
Exactly.

102
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,840
Trying to act all high and mighty again.

103
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
Still pretending to be so virtuous.

104
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,639
Who are you talking about?

105
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
Who do you mean?

106
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,240
What, did I hit a nerve?

107
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,400
Who are you talking about?

108
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
She was the one who seduced me.

109
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,319
We used to be together.

110
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,960
Now that she has money, she acts like she doesn't know me.

111
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,560
I'll beat you to death!

112
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,479
Keep talking nonsense.

113
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,159
Explain yourself!

114
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Getting angry, huh?

115
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,199
Are you mad now?

116
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Everyone heard that, right?

117
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
Everyone heard that, right?

118
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,479
If she opens that shop on our street,

119
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,599
who knows what will happen to the atmosphere here.

120
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,199
It could change for the worse.

121
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,560
Don't you all agree?

122
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,919
Lin Sufen.

123
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,560
Stop lying through your teeth.

124
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,960
That's not what happened at all.

125
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,719
I'm running a legitimate clothing business.

126
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
What nonsense are you spouting?

127
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,879
Go, go, go.

128
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,600
Come back here!

129
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,240
Don't leave!

130
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
Explain yourself!

131
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,439
Stop right there!

132
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,160
You have no conscience.

133
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,720
Shameless!

134
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,839
You can tell at a glance you're no good.

135
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,160
I never want to see you again.

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,279
Get out of this village!

137
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,199
All my paperwork is complete now.

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,360
Your market management office

139
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,720
What right do you have to shut down my shop?

140
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,839
Comrade,

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
If you have time to argue with me here,

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,079
you might as well think about your own conduct.

143
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,360
My conduct?

144
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,040
It's outsiders who are spreading rumors and slandering me.

145
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,160
Why should I have to bear the losses myself?

146
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,439
We can't be sure if it's really slander.

147
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,639
But as long as there are public complaints,

148
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,399
we have to consider the public's feelings.

149
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,639
Can you be reasonable?

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,079
Unless you can prove

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,519
that you've been framed.

152
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
The ones spreading rumors about me now

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
are three thugs.

154
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,639
How am I supposed to find those three thugs?

155
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,480
What does that have to do with us?

156
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,000
Hello?

157
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,839
Hello?

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Who is this?

159
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,040
Lin Xiaoxiao.

160
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:49,959
What do you want this time?

161
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,720
Sorry.

162
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,759
We shouldn't have spread rumors and slandered you.

163
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
Please be generous and forgive us.

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,160
Sorry.

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,920
Sorry.

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Sorry.

167
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,279
Miss Lin,

168
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,079
your business license has been approved.

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,120
Ms. Lin,

170
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,639
we will immediately

171
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,360
lift the restrictions on your shop.

172
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,639
Xiaoping,

173
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,000
the purpose of our market management office

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
is to solve problems for merchants.

175
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,000
How can we close someone's shop

176
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,399
just because of some unfounded rumors?

177
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:15,959
Miss Lin,

178
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,800
as long as I'm here,

179
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,759
I will make sure your shop

180
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,879
opens smoothly.

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,319
Hurry, go inside.

182
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,480
Coming, coming.

183
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,079
Slow down, slow down.

184
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,639
Yes, just move it inside, move it in.

185
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,240
Be careful.

186
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,439
Sister Xiaoxiao,

187
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,519
who is the mysterious person helping us with the paperwork and renovations?

188
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,360
Is it your friend?

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,319
I don't know.

190
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
No one told me.

191
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,439
We really should thank them in person.

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Otherwise, how could we have

193
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,519
finished all the procedures so quickly?

194
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:40,920
Mr. Liang

195
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,279
You seem pretty free.

196
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,399
I'll go wash an apple for you.

197
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,680
What are you doing in Meijiang?

198
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,839
There's something

199
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,639
I want to explain clearly to you.

200
00:07:59,639 --> 00:07:59,959
Alright.

201
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,879
I'll give you one minute.

202
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,600
The timer starts now.

203
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,160
What do you mean?

204
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,000
Fifty seconds.

205
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
I listened to that recording.

206
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,279
Those things I said

207
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,079
were said on purpose for Tang Ke to hear.

208
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,040
I didn't want my involvement

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,800
to make him target you.

210
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:17,639
That's why I...

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Forty seconds.

212
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,399
I admit

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,800
when I first approached you,

214
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,360
it was to get to know Fang Mu.

215
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
But I never used you.

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,600
And also,

217
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,440
Fang Mu came to Yangcheng

218
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,679
because of you.

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,039
That's why I...

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,519
Thirty seconds.

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,879
I was wrong.

222
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,080
At first,

223
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
I thought I could handle everything easily.

224
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,200
Until you left Yangcheng without a word that time,

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,879
I realized how arrogant I was.

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,480
Ten seconds.

227
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,279
You underestimated how much you mean to me.

228
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,120
I don't want our relationship

229
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,639
to just end like this.

230
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
Then in your heart, Mr. Liang,

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,480
what exactly is our relationship?

232
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,200
Xiaoxiao

233
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,600
I

234
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,240
I

235
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Time's up

236
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,440
Move aside

237
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,039
It's broken.

238
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,639
Find some time to fix it.

239
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,679
Sis,

240
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,919
Did you have a fight with your brother-in-law?

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,879
What brother-in-law?

242
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,159
He's just an ordinary friend.

243
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,879
I'm not stupid.

244
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,960
All the men working in our shop these days

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,799
weren't they all arranged by your brother-in-law?

246
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,679
Who asked him to do that?

247
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
I really can't stand this Liang Keqing.

248
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,200
Why does he assume I, Lin Xiaoxiao, need his charity?

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:04,840
Does he think

250
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,960
I couldn't get my business license without him?

251
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,360
Of course I could.

252
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
Without him,

253
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
I couldn't catch those little thugs?

254
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,480
Of course I could.

255
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,279
This guy,

256
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,559
with all his "help,"

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,720
all our previous efforts have gone to waste.

258
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,279
Soon those gossipy women will say

259
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,679
that Lin Xiaoxiao

260
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,000
doesn't have any ability at all,

261
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,240
and only relies on Liang Keqing to get ahead.

262
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,039
Yeah.

263
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,320
Everything we've achieved

264
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,759
was earned through our own hard work.

265
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,399
We can't let people talk behind our backs.

266
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,519
That Liang guy

267
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,519
is just making things worse.

268
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,039
He's way too self-righteous.

269
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,759
You see things clearly.

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Sis,

271
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,919
if he dares to bother you again,

272
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,080
I'll kick him out.

273
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,799
Alright, alright.

274
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,480
Why are you getting so worked up?

275
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,759
I'll make him go back to Yangcheng.

276
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,200
Enough.
