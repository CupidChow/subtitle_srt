1
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,759
You still see things more clearly.

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,600
Sis,

3
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,920
If he dares to bother you again,

4
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,079
I'll kick him out.

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,799
Alright, alright.

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,600
Why do you get angry so easily?

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,799
I'll make him go back to Yangcheng.

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,240
Enough.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,840
I still have something to do.

10
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,880
I need to go to the freight station to handle some paperwork.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Hurry up and tidy up the shelves.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,880
As soon as Zhong Xin's goods arrive,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,159
we'll quickly sort and organize them.

14
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,280
Stop worrying about me so much.

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:00,880
Sis,

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,719
Are you sure you don't want me to teach him a lesson for you?

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Teach who a lesson?

18
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,439
A whole minute!

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,079
Bro,

20
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,200
You didn't say a single useful word in that whole minute.

21
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,239
What exactly does she want to hear?

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,560
Aren't you usually pretty impressive?

23
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,040
Why do you mess up at the crucial moment?

24
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,200
Lin Xiaoxiao wants to hear you confess your feelings.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,799
You mean say something romantic, right?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,480
Bro,

27
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,200
It's true.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,599
Girls all like to hear this kind of thing.

29
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,799
So,

30
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,480
how should I say it?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,159
When my cousin confessed to his wife, he said,

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,359
"You are the moon in my heart,"

33
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,640
"always shining,"

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,519
"on my heart."

35
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:36,879
Got it!

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,680
You are the dumpling,

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,640
and I am the soup.

38
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,840
Steaming hot,

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,560
good times.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,599
You are the green meadow in my heart,

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,159
where flowers bloom,

42
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,079
all for your beauty.

43
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,560
You are the sunshine in my life,

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,640
always lighting the way ahead for me.

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,359
This one is really good.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,079
Brother Liang

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,120
So in your heart,

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,040
what kind of person is Lin Xiaoxiao really?

49
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,039
She

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,400
is like a little chili pepper.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
So spicy that happiness floats up—let's go with that.

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,080
Come on, come on, I’ve got a pen.

53
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,520
No matter how long it is, we can write it.

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,319
Give me your hand.

55
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,120
Write one.

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,960
Are you reliable?

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,759
Totally reliable.

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,680
Come on, do one.

59
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,960
Come on, write one for me.

60
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,719
So spicy that happiness floats up.

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,159
You brat.

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,039
You, stand right there.

63
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,560
You brat.

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
You...

65
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,599
Don’t think just because you have someone backing you now

66
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,400
that you can do whatever you want.

67
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,759
What do you want?

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
What do we want?

69
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,919
We want to scratch up your face.

70
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,599
Let’s see how you’ll show your face in public then.

71
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,240
Get her!

72
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,319
Catch her for me!

73
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,080
Catch her!

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Grab her, quick!

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,719
Chase her!

76
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,520
Don’t run!

77
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,280
Stop right there, you brat!

78
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:15,879
Hurry!

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,639
Faster!

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,039
Don’t run!

81
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,120
Catch her!

82
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,000
Stop running, you brat!

83
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Let’s see you try to run!

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,719
You fell down by yourself.

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,039
You can't blame us.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,319
Should we report this to the police?

87
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,199
Let's not let anyone die.

88
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,759
Report my ass.

89
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,560
Look at how scared you are.

90
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,680
She fell down on her own.

91
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,599
What does it have to do with us?

92
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,520
That's true.

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,199
We didn't see anything.

94
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:46,840
Right.

95
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,319
Let's go.

96
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,240
Go home.

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,159
Let's go back.

98
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,520
Let's go.

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,479
The freight station is already closed.

100
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,919
Why hasn't Sister Xiaoxiao come back yet?

101
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,280
The freight station is so remote.

102
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,919
I hope nothing happened to Sister Xiaoxiao.

103
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:06,759
No.

104
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,479
I have to go look for Sister Xiaoxiao.

105
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,759
Sis.

106
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,039
Lin Xiaoxiao.

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,479
Miss Lin.

108
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,159
Lin Xiaoxiao.

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Miss Lin.

110
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,160
Lin Xiaoxiao, where are you?

111
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,879
Sister-in-law, where are you?

112
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,680
Lin Xiaoxiao.

113
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,680
Sister-in-law.

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Where are you?

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,839
Miss Lin, can you hear me?

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,680
A Zhe.

117
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:28,959
You go look over there.

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,480
Okay.

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
Miss Lin.

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,720
Miss Lin.

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,319
Lin Xiaoxiao.

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Lin Xiaoxiao, did you hear me?

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
Lin Xiaoxiao.

124
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,680
Lin Xiaoxiao

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
Lin Xiaoxiao

126
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm here

127
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,759
I'm here

128
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,800
I

129
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,040
I'm here

130
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,759
Lin Xiaoxiao

131
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,279
Lin Xiaoxiao

132
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,360
Are you hurt anywhere?

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
My leg doesn't feel right

134
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll take you to the hospital

135
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,319
You said today

136
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,920
I underestimated my place in your heart

137
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,759
What do you mean?

138
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,160
In my heart

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
you're like a little chili pepper

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
so spicy that happiness floats up

141
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,120
What kind of words are those?

142
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,360
That's so cheesy

143
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,879
Lin Xiaoxiao

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,199
I like you

145
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,279
I like your courage and decisiveness

146
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,319
and

147
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,120
your sincere innocence

148
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,279
Before

149
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,839
I didn't listen to your feelings

150
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,759
That was my fault

151
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm truly sorry to you

152
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,319
From now on

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I will listen carefully

154
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,319
to every decision you make

155
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,319
and

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
cherish every bit of our feelings

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,519
What exactly do you want to say to me?

158
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
I just want you to know

159
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
I want to be with

160
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,959
I want to be with you

161
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,160
Liang Keqing

162
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,480
Liang Keqing

163
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,959
What's wrong with you?

164
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
It hurts so much.

165
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,639
You were bitten by a snake.

166
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,279
When did that happen?

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,439
I don't remember.

168
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,199
It looks like you were bitten by a bamboo pit viper.

169
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,920
I'll help you squeeze out the venom.

170
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,279
It might hurt a bit, bear with it.

171
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,959
Are you kidding me?

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm a grown man.

173
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,240
Ouch.

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,319
Be gentle.

175
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,240
Liang Keqing

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,639
Liang Keqing

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,160
Don't fall asleep, Liang Keqing.

178
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,319
Don't scare me.

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,199
Liang Keqing

180
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
Don't be noisy.

181
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,519
I'm not dead yet.

182
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,439
Will you talk to me?

183
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
If I ask you questions, will you answer me?

184
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
Do you like black or white?

185
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
White.

186
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,319
Do you like sunny days or rainy days?

187
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Lin Xiaoxiao

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,160
If you keep asking these boring questions,

189
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,319
I'm really going to fall asleep.

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,759
Then tell me

191
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,519
something I don't know, okay?

192
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,759
Tell me about something that happened when you were a child.

193
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,360
You...

194
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,639
Tell me about your parents.

195
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,399
Your parents.

196
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay?

197
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,800
My mom left me when I was very young.

198
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,639
I don't have much impression of her.

199
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,879
My dad wanted me to become like him.

200
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,000
He wanted a

201
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,040
person like him,

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,839
far-sighted,

203
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,560
decisive and ruthless.

204
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,160
I will always remember the way they looked at me.

205
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,439
No matter what I did,

206
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,680
they always looked at me that way.

207
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,279
So,

208
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
I had to swim farther than others,

209
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,079
run faster,

210
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
just so they would notice me.

211
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,800
Liang Keqing

212
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,079
Don't fall asleep, Liang Keqing.

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
Liang Keqing, don't scare me.

214
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,799
Don't fall asleep.

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
Liang Keqing

216
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't scare me, Liang Keqing.

217
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,840
Are you cold?

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,600
Wake up.

219
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,120
Is anyone there?

220
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,960
Help!

221
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,559
Is anyone there? Help!

222
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
Don't scare me.

223
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,279
Is anyone there?

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
Is anyone there?

225
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,080
Hurry!

226
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,919
Over here!

227
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,639
Hurry!

228
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,600
Big brother is over here!

229
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,519
Found them!

230
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,639
Brother!

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,519
Sister-in-law!

232
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,600
Over there, hurry!

233
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Sister-in-law!

234
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,799
Big brother!

235
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,080
President Liang

236
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,960
Alright, sorry to trouble you.

237
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
When you go, please take good care of Xiaoxiao for me.

238
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Okay.

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,600
Leave it to me, don't worry.

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,960
Take it easy on the road.

241
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,519
I'm begging you.

242
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,480
Don't bury it.

243
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm begging you all.

244
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,639
Please don't bury it.

245
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,240
Don't bury it.

246
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,120
Come on.

247
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,639
Say something.

248
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,840
What happened?

249
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,440
You tell us.

250
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
This has nothing to do with us.

251
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,679
Really, it has nothing to do with us at all.

252
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,200
It has nothing to do with you, she fell down by herself.

253
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,120
Yes, yes, that's right.

254
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,799
She accidentally fell down by herself.

255
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
She just fell down by herself.

256
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,399
She just fell down by herself.

257
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,799
Bury it.

258
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,320
No, no, no.

259
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,000
Stop, stop, stop.

260
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,919
Listen to me.

261
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,279
Listen to him.

262
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
We just

263
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,600
just wanted to scare her a little.

264
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
We didn't expect her to lose control of the bike.

265
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,480
She just fell off.

266
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,759
We know we were wrong.

267
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,879
We won't dare do it again.

268
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,399
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,960
It's all his fault.

270
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,360
It has nothing to do with me.

271
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,399
You woman,

272
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
weren't you chasing from behind too?

273
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,000
I was chasing from behind, but I was chasing you.

274
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,159
You told me to block her from the front.

275
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,360
You ran ahead on your own.

276
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,200
You were the one who made her fall.

277
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,919
What does that have to do with me?

278
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,679
Now you're blaming me for everything.

279
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,039
I told you not to chase her.

280
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,600
Enough.

281
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,480
This time I'm just giving you a lesson.

282
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,279
Next time, it won't be this easy.

283
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,320
Let's go.

284
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:51,879
Don't go!

285
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,440
Hey, little brother,

286
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,480
if you leave, how are we supposed to get out?

287
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,799
My hands are buried in here.

288
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,039
Let us out.

289
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,879
Let us—

290
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,279
Let us out, please.

291
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,200
Aren't you good at talking?

292
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,279
Dig yourselves out.

293
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

294
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,279
Help me.

295
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,159
Help me, get me out!

296
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,360
Dig!

297
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,279
And you were just complaining about me.
