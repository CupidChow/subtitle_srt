1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,640
At that time, people had just experienced the great wave of reform and opening up.

2
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,119
Everyone harbored a longing for change in their hearts.

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,159
And I,

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,359
also hoped to change my fate through studying.

5
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:48,799
Alright.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,039
But I didn't expect

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,280
that trying to carve out my own path

8
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,320
would be so difficult.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,240
The market across the street sells for fifteen cents each, I sell for fourteen.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Miss,

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,159
your price isn't much lower than the market's.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,479
How are you selling so well?

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,479
Sir,

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,959
I'm one cent cheaper than the market across the street.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,040
You can call your neighbors over.

16
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,040
For every ten I sell,

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,159
I'll give you one for free.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,519
You get both a favor and a bargain, right?

19
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,799
That's right.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,040
Ten, okay.

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,879
Young lady, you're quite good at business.

22
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,239
No wonder it's so crowded here.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Sir,

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
You're too kind.

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,480
These ones, right?

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,799
I'm just running a small business to make a living.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,120
A small business is still a business.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,920
Twenty.

29
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,000
If it's business, you have to give me a little profit.

30
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,959
What are you doing?

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,840
Everyone, move aside.

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Didn't you hear me? Spread out!

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,519
Break it up, break it up.

34
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,599
I'm telling you, this is Third Master's turf.

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,400
If you want to set up a stall here, you have to pay a management fee.

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
I've never heard of any management fee.

37
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm warning you, if you don't pay today,

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,519
I'll make you get out of Meijiang.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,959
Pay up.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,159
I'm warning you all too.

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,439
Pretending to be officials and collecting management fees

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,840
is illegal. If you're caught, you'll go to jail.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,319
On this street, I'm the law.

44
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,319
Let go! Bro, what's wrong with you?

45
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,439
Bro, let go of me!

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,959
Officer, catch the thug!

47
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,319
Chase them!

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,199
Get out of the way!

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,560
Xiaoxiao, we're almost out of eggs today.

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,319
After your college entrance exam, remember to bring me a batch.

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,199
Okay, Uncle Liu.

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Stop!

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,960
Stop!

54
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,000
Move aside!

55
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,439
Chase!

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,759
Chase!

57
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,240
You, stop right there!

58
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,080
You, cut her off from the back!

59
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,960
What are you doing?

60
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:47,960
Chase!

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,360
Stop!

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,439
Stop! Stop!

63
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,719
Get down!

64
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,280
Open the door!

65
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,120
Sorry.

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,159
Who told you to get in the car?

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,319
Get out.

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,759
This...

70
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,199
How do I get out? How do I open this door?

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Get out of the car.

72
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,919
Sorry.

73
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,120
Who was that girl? She seemed kind of clueless.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Doesn't matter. Get in the car.

75
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,399
Did you find Mr. Fang's address?

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,600
Not yet.

77
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,839
I need some more time.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Hurry up.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
If we come back empty-handed this time,

80
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,120
we won't be able to explain to the old man.

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,720
Bro.

82
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,759
Should we call a few more guys?

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,920
It's easier with more people.

84
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,480
No need.

85
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,720
That would draw too much attention.

86
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,079
It's not good if the old guys in the group find out.

87
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,959
Whose bag is this?

88
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,959
That girl is still a student.

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,839
She has the college entrance exam tomorrow.

90
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,519
And she's still so careless.

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,079
Maybe we should return the bag to her.

92
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Stop talking and drive.

93
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:01,920
Bro.

94
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,360
Looks like this little matter

95
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,040
is something we really have to handle.

96
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,439
What are the odds something like this would happen?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,959
Xiaoxiao

98
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,759
Why are you only just getting back?

99
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Aunt, what are you doing?

100
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,360
Eating dinner.

101
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,120
I've already eaten.

102
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,959
I'll go back to my room and keep studying.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,279
What are you doing?

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
Lin Xiaoxiao, come sit down and eat.

105
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,839
Auntie has been too strict with you these past years.

106
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,519
You resent us, don't you?

107
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,240
I know your parents died young.

108
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,639
Your uncle and I aren't very capable.

109
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,560
There are so many mouths to feed in this family.

110
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,079
We really have no choice.

111
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,399
Aunt.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
If you have something to say, just say it.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,519
No need to beat around the bush with me.

114
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,560
Listen to yourself.

115
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,959
Is it wrong for an aunt to make a nice meal for her own child?

116
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,560
Tomorrow is your big college entrance exam day.

117
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,319
They say fish soup is good for the brain.

118
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,639
Drink it while it's hot.

119
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,879
I don't want it.

120
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,160
Be good.

121
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,879
Drink it while it's still hot.

122
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,079
I'm going back to my room.

123
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,639
What are you doing? Let go of me!

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,160
Let go! I won't drink it.

125
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,959
You think getting into college means you can get away from me?

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Hurry up and drink the fish soup.

127
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,759
You jinx who brought misfortune to your parents.

128
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,199
I've raised you for ten years.

129
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,279
Today is the day you repay me and show your gratitude.

130
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,519
Drink it.

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,639
Drink.

132
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,519
Drink it.

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,079
Let me go!

134
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,240
Let go of me!

135
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,319
Stop smoking and get to work.

136
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Yes, yes, put the table over there.

137
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,920
Hurry up!

138
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,240
Set this up properly for me.

139
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,360
That's strange.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,240
Isn't today her college entrance exam?

141
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,360
Why is she getting married?

142
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,519
Who watches a bride more closely than a prisoner at a wedding?

143
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,079
Something's definitely wrong.

144
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,839
I'll go take a look. You go get help.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,559
Hey.

146
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,399
Hey.

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,679
Hey.

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,639
Wake up.

149
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,440
Hey.

150
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,559
You've given enough, hurry inside.

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,679
Wake up.

152
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,440
Wake up.

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,919
Wake up.

154
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Why is it you?

155
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,879
They're right inside.

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,879
Shh.

157
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,919
Can you still run?

158
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
I'm not really sure either.

159
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,240
They're inside.

160
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Come on, open the door.

161
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
The bride is too shy to come out.

162
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,559
Guys, come here.

163
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,639
Break it down for me.

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,639
Come on, break it down.

165
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,240
Weren't you pretty good at running last time?

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
Now you can't run anymore.

167
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Break it down.

168
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
One, two, break it down!

169
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,720
Almost there.

170
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
Come on, come on.

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,879
Put some strength into it, guys.

172
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,799
Break it down.

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,679
Come on, put in more effort.

174
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
One, two, go!

175
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,080
Bride! Bride!

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,720
Oh no.

177
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,159
They ran away.

178
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:08,919
What?

179
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,039
Hurry, go after them!

180
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,960
Go, go, go!
