1
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,200
Miss,

2
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,359
you're really something.

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,479
In less than half a month, you've helped me sell half my fruit.

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,719
Impressive.

5
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,880
We've only just started this business.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,799
So, do you have any other good ideas?

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Tell me quickly.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
Boss, think about it.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,799
Every year, Huayuan has so much unsold fruit.

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,280
It's not because no one wants to buy it.

11
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,600
It's because the market is saturated and competition is fierce.

12
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,760
If you could have my core technology,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,519
this would be a steady, long-term business for you.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
No, miss, you...

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,079
You're talking in circles.

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,120
You've got me all confused.

17
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,239
I don't understand what you're saying.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,319
Boss Huang, what I mean is,

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,040
I can sell you this equipment

20
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,879
and the blueprints for it

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,680
as a package deal.

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,000
Miss,

23
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,239
you know my situation best, right?

24
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,560
If you agree to two hundred yuan,

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,519
can I help you out?

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,519
I’ll definitely help you.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,319
Brother,

28
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,760
it really has to be six hundred yuan.

29
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,879
That's the lowest.

30
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,519
About the money,

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,879
it's not just up to me.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,280
Let me discuss it with finance, okay?

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:43,879
Brother,

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,120
trust me, trust me.

35
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,640
I knew this girl

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,760
didn't have what it takes.

37
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,159
Money isn't important.

38
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,400
As long as she's here, that's enough.

39
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,359
Let's go.

40
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,200
Let's go.

41
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:03,920
Let's go.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,159
Lin Xiaoxiao, come out.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Lin Xiaoxiao, you brat, come out!

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,240
Lin Xiaoxiao!

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,759
What do you want?

46
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,800
Get out, or I'll call security.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,560
Why are you shouting?

48
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,360
Your employee owes money and won't pay it back.

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,039
She owes money and won't pay.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,919
Wang Xiaowu, this isn't Linjia Village.

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,199
Why are you yelling here?

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,719
No wonder.

53
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,800
All you think about is splitting up the family.

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,560
So this is where you're showing off.

55
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,560
Lin Sufen.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,680
Lin Xiaoxiao.

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,319
Do you know what day it is today?

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,759
I remember.

59
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,560
Today isn't over yet.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,080
I'll pay you back before today ends.

61
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,319
How much can a waitress like you even make?

62
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:42,919
Exactly.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,280
You're just trying to stall, aren't you?

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,719
Everyone, take a look.

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,039
This is the IOU she wrote for me.

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
She broke off the engagement on her own.

67
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,360
She owes our Wang family 800 yuan.

68
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,120
Come, everyone, take a look.

69
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,840
Eight hundred?

70
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,639
What's going on here?

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
I'm telling you, this is compensation for breaking off the engagement.

72
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:55,960
Let's talk outside.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Move aside.

74
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,960
Let's go outside.

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,879
Stay out of this.

76
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,240
Wang Xiaowu, this is our personal business.

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
Don't embarrass yourself in public, okay?

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,599
You all have to judge this fairly for me.

79
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,680
I raised this girl since she was little.

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,599
But what about her?

81
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,360
All she thinks about is marrying rich and taking shortcuts.

82
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,840
Let me tell you,

83
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,080
A pheasant will always be a pheasant.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,159
She'll never become a golden phoenix.

85
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
You're a divorced woman, second-hand goods.

86
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,800
And you still want a rich man to marry you?

87
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,159
Pah!

88
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,439
If you owe money, you should pay it back. That's only right.

89
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,800
If you owe money, you should pay it back. That's only right.

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,199
Such a big hotel,

91
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,400
and you hire a debtor as a waitress.

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Who would dare come here to eat in the future?

93
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,039
I'm telling you all,

94
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,159
she said it herself,

95
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,120
if she can't pay back the money, the marriage will go on as planned.

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,159
Lin Sufen.

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
I've already separated from your family.

98
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
What does my marriage have to do with you?

99
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,919
How can you say it has nothing to do with us?

100
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,280
Why can't I control you anymore?

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
Look at you.

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,240
What are you wearing?

103
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
All flashy and colorful.

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,319
You look like a streetwalker.

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,960
You're really disgracing our Lin family.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,639
Don't touch me.

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
So what if I touch you?

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,280
Don't touch me.

109
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,680
Such a disgrace.

110
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,680
Enough, take her away.

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm touching you, so what?

112
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,719
Don't touch me.

113
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,879
So what if I touch you?

114
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,199
What are you doing?

115
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,079
Everyone, stop!

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,480
Try moving again and see what happens.

117
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,399
It's broken, it's broken, it's broken!

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,519
Are you okay?

119
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,120
Are you alright, Wu?

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,319
Not every girl is as dirty as you say.

121
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,360
What's wrong with being a waitress?

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,800
Every penny she earns now is honest, from her own hard work.

123
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,639
What right do you have to slander her?

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,279
Move again, I dare you.

125
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,639
If you owe money, you should pay it back. That's only right.

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,399
Pay your debts.

127
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,079
If you don't pay today,

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,879
we're not leaving.

129
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,480
We're not leaving.

130
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Not leaving.

131
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,480
That's right.

132
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,800
We're not leaving.

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
What's going on?

134
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,160
So many people.

135
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,639
Is there a fight?

136
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,959
Miss Lin, sorry about this.

137
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,399
We were delayed on the way.

138
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,160
Wang Xiaowu

139
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,639
I think what you just said was wrong.

140
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,920
I put on makeup and dress up

141
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,639
not for men to see.

142
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,680
And I work, not to find a rich man.

143
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,759
I can give you this money.

144
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,000
But you have to apologize for what you just said to me.

145
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,800
Apologize to me.

146
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,240
Apologize.

147
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,079
Apologize.

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,519
Apologize. You must apologize.

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,279
Why are you just standing there?

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,199
Apologize.

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,399
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,959
I shouldn't have said that just now.

153
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,279
I apologize to you.

154
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,199
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,720
Give me the IOU.

156
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,199
After today, we're even.

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,279
I didn't expect Boss Huang to make a decision so quickly.

158
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,600
Did you help out?

159
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,480
I just took your product to Boss Jin.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,519
And he

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
just happens to be in the fruit business.

162
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Miss Lin

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,079
Being smart alone isn't enough to do business.

164
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,360
I've learned that.

165
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Are you free tonight?

166
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,920
At seven, I'll take you somewhere.

167
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,279
Where are you taking me?

168
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
So this is what you meant by watching a movie?

169
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,319
The equipment is a bit simple,

170
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,959
but take a deep breath.

171
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,439
Isn't the air especially fresh?

172
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,519
Look ahead.

173
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,639
Isn't the view especially wide?

174
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,480
And it's completely free.

175
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,319
You...

176
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,160
Why did you come to Meijiang?

177
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,120
To find someone.

178
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,079
Find someone?

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,680
Yeah.

180
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,600
A man or a woman?

181
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
A man.

182
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,279
An old professor.

183
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,879
I have something very important.

184
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,920
I must find him.

185
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,279
What will you do after you find him?

186
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,519
Take him back to Yangcheng with me.

187
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,439
Then I'm one step ahead of you.

188
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,079
You're going to Yangcheng too?

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,160
Tomorrow morning.

190
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,759
That's right.

191
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,160
With your intelligence and talent,

192
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,879
how could you be content just being a waiter?

193
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,480
I just didn't expect you to act so soon.

194
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
Actually, I've wanted to go for a long time.

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I just couldn't because I hadn't paid off my debts.

196
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,720
Now it's finally my turn to show what I can do.

197
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you laughing at?

198
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,919
Nothing.

199
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,480
Projectors are really amazing things.

200
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,000
Such a small device

201
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,480
can project such beautiful images.

202
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,639
And tell such romantic stories.

203
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,159
Actually, it's not that complicated.

204
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,559
It just uses a light source

205
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
to illuminate the images on the film

206
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,600
and then, through an optical system,

207
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,759
projects them onto the screen.

208
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,320
What's wrong with you?

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,080
Such a romantic thing

210
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,000
sounds so boring when you say it.

211
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,840
You can even make a juicer,

212
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,159
so you must understand such simple mechanical principles.

213
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,399
How could it be me?

214
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,799
I don't have that kind of skill.

215
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,519
That was my old man.

216
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,840
Old man?

217
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,159
Lao Fang.

218
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,519
He was my father's good friend.

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,240
I've been staying at his place ever since my family split up.
