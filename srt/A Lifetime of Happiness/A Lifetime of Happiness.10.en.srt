00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,920
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,640
Tong Sheng, I've finally found you.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
How have you been?

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,760
I looked everywhere for you.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,320
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,520
Tong Sheng, I've missed you so much.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,680
I knew something was off
with that person at home.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm sure he's not you.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,720
That's why I checked
the hospital's CCTV footage...

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,200
and found out we got
the wrong person that day.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
So...

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
Jin Da Xi and I are twins.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,000
Actually, we're all
from the Tong family.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,840
It's a long story.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,560
Although your surnames are Tong,

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
you're actually adopted like me.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Adopted?

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Yes.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,880
When Dad first started his business,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
it was chaotic.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
One of you got lost...

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,680
and was adopted
by a kind-hearted man.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,160
That was Jin Da Xi.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,000
But that's not important.

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
What's important is that...

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,800
the Tong family's true heir
is Tong An now.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Tong An?

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
Tong Sheng, you must have
lost your memories...

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,320
and don't remember
these things much.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,600
Since Dad had Tong An,

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,240
his attitude towards us changed.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
Later on, we became pawns.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,720
Everything we're doing...

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,920
is to pave the way for Tong An.

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,880
So when I met you again this time,

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,200
I wasn't in a hurry
to bring you home.

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,680
Because I'm very worried.

38
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm worried that Dad will use you.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,920
So I came up with a way...

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
to get you out of here
through a high salary offer.

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
But I didn't expect...

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,800
that you're not Jin Da Xi.
You're my brother.

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Tong Sheng.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
Come home with me.

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Actually, Tong Sheng,

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,320
it's also good
that you've been replaced.

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
At least you're out of misery.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,640
Do I get to decide
whether to go back or not?

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Yes.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
But Tong Sheng, as you know too,

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,600
we're both stepchildren.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Over the years,

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,880
Dad has done a lot of shady deals
in his business.

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,840
Eventually, Dad will surely
set up a trap...

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
for us to be the scapegoats.

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,840
It won't be the first time...

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,760
an old-timer like dad
does these things.

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm not going back for now.

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,520
Since Jin Da Xi is
part of the Tong family,

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,120
and he worked hard outside
for so many years,

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
let him experience
the rich life too.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,120
I still have amnesia now.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
I can't help much
if I go back either.

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,160
Let me regain my memories
and find out the truth first.

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
Good thinking, Tong Sheng.

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
Do you have Ms. Yan's number?

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,400
Hello, Yan Yan? I'm Tong Sheng.

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,720
I need your help with something.

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Don't be mad anymore.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Even if he's your brother,
he has the right to love freely.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,440
Or just go home and scold him.

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,040
How can a little brother date
without telling his sister, right?

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
You're leaving, Da Huan?

74
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,640
Get some rest. See you tomorrow.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,440
Are you crazy?

76
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Da Huan, you're back.

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Come here.

78
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,640
Da Xi and I have finished cooking.

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
What are you doing?

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,240
Yan Yan wants to apologize to you.

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
She hasn't met you before.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
She didn't know you're my sister,

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,400
so she spoke rudely to you.

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,560
She insists on cooking dinner
for you today...

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
to apologize.

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
There's no need.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,040
Don't act this way. Have some.

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Here.

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
That's right, my sister.
She's doing this for you.

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Why are you calling me
your sister today?

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,240
You are my sister.

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Come on.

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Let's eat together.

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
This chicken wing is delicious.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Is that so?

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
That's not right.
We forgot Da Huan...

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,080
Da Huan, try this spicy chicken.
It's really good.

98
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
You're so thoughtful.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm full.

100
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,880
Da Huan, you didn't eat anything.

101
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Thank you for today.

102
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,880
I've helped you as much as I can.

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
You promised me this.

104
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,920
Tell me about your twin brother.

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,040
The Tong Sheng you met...

106
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
is indeed fake.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,320
He's Jin Da Huan's brother,
Jin Da Xi.

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,240
I think he doesn't dare
to see you...

109
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
because he's afraid of facing you.

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
We all have vanity.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
But there could be other reasons.

112
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,000
However, you still have
to consider...

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
whether you can accept
that Da Xi lied to you...

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,560
and his real family situation.

115
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Of course I'm angry
that he lied to me.

116
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,480
But I don't care
what his identity is.

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,839
Think about it carefully.

118
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Don't play tough too much.

119
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,760
I can only think of a way to help
after you've thought things through.

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Does your sister dislike me?

121
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,760
Don't be silly. Why would she?

122
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,520
Why exactly am I so mad?

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,160
Come in, it's not locked.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,720
What's wrong? Are you mad?

125
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Tell me.

126
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,600
Why did you hide
your relationship...

127
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
with Ms. Yan from me?

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
We're just friends.

129
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,760
Friends?

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,200
What kind of friends
treat each other like this?

131
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,240
I think you are just a ladies man.

132
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
Are you jealous?

133
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

134
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
How could I be jealous?

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
You're so angry.

136
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't believe you don't like me.

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Da Huan.

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,160
I want to explain things to you.

139
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Hello, Yu Chen.

140
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,640
Why are you calling me
all of a sudden?

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm downstairs.

142
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,920
Come down.

143
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Okay, I'll be right down.

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Long time no see.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,920
Yu Chen, you rarely come back
to the country.

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,760
What big case are you
working on this time?

147
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,320
It's not a big case.

148
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,080
From now on,

149
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,840
it won't be so hard for us
to see each other anymore.

150
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Why?

151
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,560
Mr. Chang of Xuebao Group hired me.

152
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm mainly responsible for Wanqi's
investment in Xuebao.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
- What a coincidence.
- Yes.

154
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,240
So it won't be so hard for us
to meet in the future.

155
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
And logically speaking,

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
you're even my client.

157
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Here.

158
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,880
Let's toast
to our beautiful Da Huan...

159
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,800
taking good care of me
in the future.

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,600
No, Yu Chen.

161
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,559
I just joined the company.

162
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
In our company's Legal Department,

163
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,800
I still have a long way to go
before dealing with the core issues.

164
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,920
Based on my recent research,

165
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,719
your company's Legal Department
staff is no good.

166
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
You're different.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,560
And you have to believe in yourself.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,279
I'll make it clear
to them this time.

169
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,440
You'll be my counterpart.

170
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,000
No, Yu Chen.

171
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,280
That's not appropriate.

172
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,760
Are you still our school's
Pretty Little Dragon?

173
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I believe in you.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,760
You should believe in yourself too.

175
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Here.

176
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
Let's drink
to our upcoming collaboration.

177
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,320
Okay, bottoms up for me.

178
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,880
This is more like you.

179
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,800
Yes, I've been craving
this place's food for a long time.

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Try this.
