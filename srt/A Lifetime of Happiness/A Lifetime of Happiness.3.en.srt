00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,440
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,359
Da Huan, Mr. Qi asked you
to make some coffee for everyone.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
Okay.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,640
Can you guys do it?

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,480
We still don't know
what the problem is.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,680
Great. We've been working
on this project for three years.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,280
We're just going
to hand it to someone else.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Is that it?

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
I don't care.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,120
Give me an answer tomorrow.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
Otherwise, get lost.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
- Hurry up and find it.
- Hurry up.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,240
- Take a look at this.
- What's going on?

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,399
Maybe there's a problem...

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,519
with the patent technology.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,720
Yesterday, I already...

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Be quiet.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,440
Da Huan, what did you just say?

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,000
Go on. Speak up.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Mr. Qi,

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,719
what if we collect...

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,080
the patent parts...

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,960
of these contracts...

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
and compare and analyze them?

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,200
Wouldn't that be more efficient?

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
You know about this?

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
I studied law.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,639
My thesis research was...

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,280
on technology intellectual property.

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,360
Why don't you take the data...

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
and study it at home?

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,920
Mr. Qi, I don't think
that's appropriate.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Why not? It's perfect.

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
Mr. Gao,
go through all the data later,

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
organize it,
and give Da Huan a copy.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Okay.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Da Huan,

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
tomorrow.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
It's all up to you.

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,600
Why are you back so early?

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
I had a last-minute job
at the office.

42
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm working from home.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
I have something
to discuss with you.

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,280
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm busy. Don't bother me.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,160
I won't be done
by tomorrow at this rate.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
What are you working on?

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,800
I told the company...

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,240
that I'll find the loophole
in the two documents.

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,719
But who knew that both documents...

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,760
were all in French?

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
It'll take me a week
to translate them.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
Aren't you the receptionist?

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
Why are you doing this?

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,000
This is the biggest opportunity
I've had in years.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,240
Don't bother me right now.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,360
"Technology Patent Transfer".

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
This is in French.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,000
How can you read it?

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Look at this.

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,600
"Invention brevetée".

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
It means a patent has been filed.

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,600
But here, it was
simply translated as...

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
"technology patent".

65
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
No way.

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Did the car crash
give him a gift for languages?

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Let me see.

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,160
There should be an attachment
in this document that explains it.

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Give me that.

70
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Here it is.

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,520
Between these two documents,

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,399
regarding the process
of applying for the patent...

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
and the sequence of operations,

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,960
the descriptions are different.

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,639
The specific situation...

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,320
depends on the patent treaty
in France.

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Why are you looking at me?

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
How do you know this?

79
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,560
I don't know.
I just suddenly knew it.

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,600
That's great.

81
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,320
You're my godsent savior.

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm counting on you tonight.

83
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,879
It's all in French.

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,920
It's all technical jargon.

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
The translation software can't
translate it accurately.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
I'll do some research with you.

87
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Amazing.

88
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Of course.

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,760
You play really well.

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,680
Mr. Tong, I see you've recovered.

91
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,320
It's time to go on a blind date
with Ms. Yan tomorrow.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,400
- You're going on a blind date?
- It's not me. It's you.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,319
Chang Ming, let's not
call each other Mr. Tong.

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
We're at home after all.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
It's been over a decade.

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Why are you still so formal?

97
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,800
Hold on. What did you just say?

98
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Me? Blind date?

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,359
Chang Ming, explain it to him.

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
Tong Sheng has forgotten.

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,640
Tong Sheng, it was Dad
who arranged this marriage.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,760
Dad has been urging us
from overseas.

103
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,160
You've been putting it off
for months.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Then you got into a car accident.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
If you still refuse,
the Yan family will be displeased.

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,240
After all, Ms. Yan...

107
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,720
is Mr. Yan's precious daughter.

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
That's right, Tong Sheng.
You should go.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm afraid when our old man
comes back from abroad,

110
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,400
we won't have any freedom anymore.

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
This is too sudden.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
You guys keep playing.
I'll get back to work.

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Hey.

114
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,560
Show me...

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,200
the hospital's surveillance footage
from the day of Mr. Tong's accident.

116
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Yan.

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Is this how you're going
to meet Mr. Tong?

118
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
It's so ugly.

119
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
You're just a kid. What do you know?

120
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
I never wanted
to go on the blind date.

121
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
Blind date?

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
That's so tacky.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,320
Is this really
the fate of our family?

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,799
Don't act like an adult.

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
It's not cute at all.

126
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Besides, if he can
accept me like this...

127
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,320
that's true love.

128
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,920
Yan, I think he's here.

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'll get going.

130
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Ms. Yan.

131
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Hello, that's me.

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Have a seat.

133
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,280
What would you like to order?

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,880
I'll have this set.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,480
- Okay.
- What about you, sir?

136
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,439
- Steak.
- How well done?

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Medium-well plus.

138
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Just a moment.

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,559
I've never seen anyone
order a steak medium well plus.

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Is that weird?

141
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,520
Shouldn't it be
the standard options?

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,879
Medium or medium well?

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
I like to order it cooked
a little past medium well.

144
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,600
It looks like you're different
from the rumors.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What rumors?

146
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
They say you're cold-hearted.

147
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,080
I didn't expect you
to be so easygoing.

148
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
Did I mistake you for someone else?

149
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
No.

150
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
- What?
- Wipe off your lipstick first.

151
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,800
Do you think I'm ugly
the first time you see me?

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm not wiping it off.

153
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,440
Lipstick is made of dead bugs.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm sorry!

155
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
Just now...

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
I don't remember anything.

157
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,120
I don't remember anything either.

158
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,280
Ms. Yan, I'll get going then.

159
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,640
What's wrong? What's the matter?

160
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
Shouldn't you give me a ride?

161
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,520
I don't even know where you live.

162
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Okay.

163
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,160
You can go without me.

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
I...

165
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
What's so hard about that?

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,560
Yan, he's so childish.

167
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
There you go. See?

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Da Xi.

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Da Xi?

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,960
I have good news for you.

171
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Da Xi?

172
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
Are you home?

173
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Da Huan.

174
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
Congratulations on solving
the contract crisis.

175
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
You've been specially transferred
to the Legal Department.

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
How did you know?

177
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
I believed you could do it.

178
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Wait.

179
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
How much did you pay for this?

180
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
Don't worry, it's on me.

181
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,640
I really didn't expect it.

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,039
Mr. Qi actually promoted me...

183
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,760
to the Legal Department...

184
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,480
in front of the whole office.

185
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Do you know?

186
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,999
I'm the only one
in the whole company...

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,600
who got this kind of treatment.

188
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
How does it feel?

189
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,720
It feels so good.

190
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,039
You have no idea.

191
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,600
Those people
in the Legal Department...

192
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,480
used to order me around every day.

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,840
Every time I read a book
on law at the front desk,

194
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,240
they would just laugh at me.

195
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
You should have
seen their expressions...

196
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,920
when Mr. Qi
announced the news today.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,560
But I still have to thank you.

198
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,679
If it weren't for you,

199
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,280
I wouldn't be doing so well.

200
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
I'm glad you're happy.

201
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,720
I also don't want to see you...

202
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,280
get up early every day
to do a job you don't like.

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,800
You even have
to do odd jobs at night.

204
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
Why are you looking at me?

205
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,560
You...

206
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Sit here.

207
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,360
Why do I feel
like you're different from before?

208
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
What?

209
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,319
When I see you, I blush.

210
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,000
My heart races.

211
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,880
Do you want to try it?
