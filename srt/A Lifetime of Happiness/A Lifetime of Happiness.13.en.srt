00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,400
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
What era is this?

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,120
Da Huan should have
the right to choose.

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,760
Yu Chen?

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,560
How could Yu Chen be a bad person?

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,360
Da Huan, are you happy
being with me?

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,080
What if she's longing to marry me?

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,760
Tong Sheng, you haven't been
yourself lately.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,719
Tong Sheng, have you heard...

10
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,920
about the merger and acquisition
of our group?

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
I don't know
what Chang Ming is thinking.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,560
He's willing to give up
the pricing power.

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
What?

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,840
I remember what you said about
the company's original purpose.

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,479
It is to provide the public...

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,520
with affordable
and high-quality products.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
The products should be
cost-effective.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
But looking at how this is going,

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,160
the group is going
to change strategies.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,120
Do you also think there's
something wrong with this contract?

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
I can't explain it either.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,120
But something doesn't feel right.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
I can't put my finger on it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Have you seen the contract?

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
No, I haven't.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,120
Besides, Chang Ming won't show it
to me.

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
I see.

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I'll think of a way.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,960
Okay, Tong Sheng.
I'll get going then.

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,560
I just came to see you
before I go out.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,280
Jin Da Xi, let's switch identities
tonight.

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
What are you doing?

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm working overtime.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
It's so complicated.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Xuebao Group?

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
Yes. It's the merger
and acquisition.

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't know why I'm so anxious.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
The contract has been signed.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm still here researching.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
The contract has been filled out?

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599
We'll sign it at the press
conference tomorrow.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,360
All the legal procedures are done.

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
Then what are you worried about?

44
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
I found a problem.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
What is it?

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,360
Look at these contracts.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
Look at this subcontractor.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,840
Is there something
wrong with this company?

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,920
I looked into this company.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,239
I found out that this company...

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,920
doesn't actually exist.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
But it received investments...

53
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:15,400
from Xuebao and Wanqi
at the same time.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
You went to investigate?

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
On your own?

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,720
Yes, of course.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,280
I see.

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Chang Ming.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,240
I didn't think you'd go this far.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
What?

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
So,

62
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:35,520
this company might
just be a shell company.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,920
They exist just to make money
from companies getting listed.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,000
They take advantage
of the merger and acquisition...

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
and make money
when the stock price rises.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,560
Then they'll announce
their bankruptcy.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Stop it.

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
What's wrong?

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Did you forget
what happened to our family?

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
Did you forget our dad...

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
No.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
I have to stop this from happening.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
If you do that,

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
you can never return
to Wanqi Group.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I know.

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,560
But I have to do it.

77
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
I've made up my mind.

78
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
But...

79
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,920
The press conference is tomorrow.

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I have an idea.

81
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,760
Esteemed leaders and guests,

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,679
the signing ceremony
of Xuebao Group...

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,800
has officially begun.

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,760
Thank you for coming
to the signing ceremony.

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,439
Let's welcome the acting
president of Xuebao Group,

86
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
Mr. Chang Ming, to say a few words.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,800
First of all,
thank you all for coming today.

88
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,920
Working with Wanqi Group...

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720
is an important boost
for Xuebao Group.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,080
From now on, our group
will undergo a transformation.

91
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
We promise...

92
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,480
to bring better quality products...

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,160
with consumer interest in mind.

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Let's move on to the interview.

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,560
We just received a tip-off.

96
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
It states that the purpose
of this merger and acquisition...

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,160
is to create a market effect.

98
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,520
It does not benefit
the two companies...

99
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,279
but rather, a third-party
company called Qimingxing.

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,680
What's going on?

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
The document also includes...
evidence of the relevant contract.

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Is this all true?

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,520
Does Qimingxing really exist?

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,999
Or is it just a shell company...

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,519
that makes money from
your companies getting listed...

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
like the document says?

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
It's a twin contract.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
I can't believe it.

109
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,280
I'll go in with you.

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
It's okay.

111
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
Trust me. I can handle it.

112
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,999
Please don't be affected...

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,320
by this irrelevant information.

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,280
Please screen these rumors
carefully. They are without proof.

115
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I have proof.

116
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm a lawyer from Wanqi Group's
Legal Department.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,960
The contract in my hand
can prove it all.

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
As you can see,
on page 24 of the contract,

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,960
this is the result of my
investigation on Qimingxing Company.

120
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,439
Qimingxing Company...

121
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,959
is a shell company...

122
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
that doesn't produce anything.

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
The contract you see here...

124
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,680
is just an external contract.

125
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
What I have in my hand...

126
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,000
is the real, internal contract.

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Give me a moment.

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I looked into it.

129
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
You have been in charge
of the contract.

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
I knew that that day,

131
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,840
you were on your way
to submit the final contract.

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,679
So I pretended to run into you...

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
and had dinner with you.

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,920
I've sent the contents
to your phones.

135
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,440
You can check it now.

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,200
- It's a twin contract.
- That's right.

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
Why does she have
the internal contract?

138
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry, everyone.
This is an internal problem.

139
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,520
I'll take care of it later.

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Miss.

141
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,719
Are you sure
the contract you have...

142
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
is valid?

143
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,280
It's obviously a fake contract...

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,480
that was fabricated
to slander the Group.

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,840
Everyone, look carefully
at the final signature and stamp.

146
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
They're all fake.

147
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
I already knew what you were doing.

148
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,480
And I know how you do things.

149
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Miss.

150
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,400
If I remember correctly,

151
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
you're just a receptionist, right?

152
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,999
- She's not an employee?
- She's just a receptionist?

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She's just a receptionist.

154
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,639
You seduced...

155
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Mr. Qi of Wanqi Group.

156
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,039
That's why you had the chance
to join the Legal Department.

157
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Why is she like this?

158
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,160
That's nonsense.

159
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Everything you did...

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
- was to frame the group!
- That's right.

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't expect to have a black
sheep like you in our company.

162
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Go to the HR Department
and get your final salary now.

163
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,160
Here, take a picture of this.

164
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
This is the woman
who seduced my husband.

165
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,399
Yes, that's right.

166
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,560
She seduced me first.

167
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
Yes, she seduced me first.

168
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
I can't believe you did this...

169
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,520
just to get revenge.

170
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
What kind of person are you?

171
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,960
Is this the kind of person you like?

172
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't do this.

173
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Why not?

174
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Because you're my brother.

175
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
What if I'm not?
