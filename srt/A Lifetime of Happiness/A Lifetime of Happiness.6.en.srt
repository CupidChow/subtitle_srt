00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,920
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,120
Mr. Qi, are you all right?

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,480
Why do you look so tired,
as if you didn't sleep at all?

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
Because I really didn't sleep.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,279
Why didn't you sleep?

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,360
Cut the crap and spit it out.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,240
Well, the chairman is here.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,040
What?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,080
Mom, why are you here?

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,920
Don't you have anything to tell me?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,120
What? Nothing.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,480
Everything is fine.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,840
I heard you've been coming
to the office early lately.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,800
No wonder your dark circles
are swollen like that.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,040
I've been monitoring
attendance lately,

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,120
so I figured
I should set an example...

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,160
and come in on time, right?"

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,920
If only you could put
the same effort into blind dates.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,919
I've introduced
so many girls to you...

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,000
and you didn't like any of them.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,319
It has been so many years.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,200
I don't know
if you've ever dated anyone.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,520
You should at least
bring one home for me to meet.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,960
Come on, Mom.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,040
Have you looked at the people
you've been introducing me to?

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,639
How could you say that?

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,120
Last time, it was Mr. Wu's daughter.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,840
And the time before that,
it was Mr. Zhao's daughter.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
They watched you grow up.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,680
Their daughters
are such fine girls...

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,080
and you're still being picky.

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,160
Mom, don't worry.

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,400
I'll find someone you're happy with.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,800
That means there's someone you like.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Whose daughter is she?

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,800
You don't need to worry about it.

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
You have to think carefully.

38
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
This isn't just about you.

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,320
All right.

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,760
Trust me.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
You'll be satisfied.

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
You never fail to surprise me.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
What's wrong?

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,360
I didn't expect you to bring me...

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
to a place like this.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,120
Isn't it nice?

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Their skewers are amazing.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Try this.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,720
Will I get diarrhea if I eat this?

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
It doesn't seem very clean.

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,760
Is it because
the tables look worn out,

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,120
the place is a bit shabby,

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
and it's right by the busy street...

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,800
that you think...

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,520
it's not clean?

56
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Not exactly.

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,360
Do you want to hear a story?

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Sure.

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,400
There was once
a brother and a sister.

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,720
Their parents passed away
when the brother was young,

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
leaving only the sister
to support the family.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
To send her brother to university,

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
she tried every possible way
to make money.

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,160
But the more anxious
she was to earn,

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
the more easily she was cheated.

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,520
In the end, she lost everything.

67
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
She even got into debt.

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,760
Exhausted,
she collapsed from overwork.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Her brother had no choice
but to quit school...

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,920
and wander around looking
for ways to earn a living.

71
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,880
Every night,

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
he could only afford to buy
the leftover cabbage at the market.

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,560
Later, he met a kindhearted boss.

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,800
It's him.

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
Once he learned
about the siblings' situation,

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,280
he provided them
with meals every day.

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,240
He even told the brother,

78
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,160
"I don't know how it is elsewhere,"

79
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,480
"but here,
you can eat with peace of mind."

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,680
It's exactly
what you're eating right now.

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,600
That's why...

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,320
you can't judge a restaurant
by its appearance.

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
It's the same with people.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
I didn't know
you could be so philosophical.

85
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,720
And what happened
to that pair of siblings?

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
They ended up doing quite well.

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
Talking about this
kind of makes me feel homesick.

88
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
Homesick?

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Didn't you just leave home?

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Forget it.

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
I can't seem to read you anymore.

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
What kind of person are you?

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm certainly
not the same type as you.

94
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,880
Really?

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,520
How are you different?

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
You wouldn't understand.

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
You wouldn't want
to know my other side.

98
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,920
Don't be so certain.

99
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,720
Why don't you
let me experience it today?

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Forget it. You wouldn't want to.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,760
Why are you so sure about that?

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,200
Why don't you eat the skewer first?

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
Isn't it delicious?

104
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,039
It's surprisingly good.

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,160
See? You didn't believe me.

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,520
I was wrong.

107
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,680
As punishment,

108
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,520
you'll have to take me out
for more fun after this.

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,080
Is this a punishment?

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,040
Who's actually paying
the price here, you or me?

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,440
So are you taking me or not?

112
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
Yes, of course.

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,559
I'll make sure you eat
to your heart's content today.

114
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
Come on.

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,520
If that's all,
then let's call it decided.

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,720
Okay, Mr. Qi.

117
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,440
I'll take my leave now.

118
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,600
Da Huan, are you free tonight?

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,879
What's the matter, Mr. Qi?

120
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,479
Is there still something
you need me to handle?

121
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,520
No.

122
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,319
I know a really good restaurant.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,440
Let's go together.

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,200
I have a lot to do tonight.

125
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,960
Maybe I shouldn't go.

126
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,759
You can deal with it tomorrow.

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,800
There's no rush.

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,640
Who is that? He's so handsome.

129
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,280
Who are you looking for?

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm looking for Mr. Qi.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
A cup of coffee for me, please.

132
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
What are you doing here?

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,840
I'm bored at home.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,280
- He's so handsome.
- Here's your coffee.

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
- Da Xi.
- He's so handsome.

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,799
You look familiar.

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
- You are...
- The one on the tricycle.

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
Yes, that's me.

139
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,640
So you're Jin Da Huan's
boyfriend, right?

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,159
Yes.

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,320
No.

142
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
He's my younger brother.

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,920
My younger brother, Jin Da Xi.

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,480
- I see.
- Younger brother?

145
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,480
But why is he
wearing Mr. Qi's clothes?

146
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm staying at his house now.

147
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
He's staying at my house.

148
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
No, wait.

149
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,720
What are you thinking?

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,400
He's a French tutor I hired.

151
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,720
He's giving me
private lessons at my house.

152
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
Do you get it now?

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I see.

154
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,640
You all have too much time
on your hands, don't you?

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
Not enough work to keep you busy?

156
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,399
Do you even want
to get off work on time?

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

158
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
You're so fierce.

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
Am I?

160
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,200
By the way, what were you
talking about just now?

161
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,160
Mr. Qi asked me if I wanted
to have dinner with him.

162
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
Sure, let's go together.

163
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,720
Wait.

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,279
What does this have to do with you?

165
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm your 24-hour personal tutor.

166
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Of course, I have to do my job.

167
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
So?

168
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,280
How are you adjusting to
staying at Mr. Qi's place?

169
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,080
It feels strangely familiar.

170
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,200
I must've lived in a house
like that before.

171
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
You're thinking too much.

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Work hard and earn well.

173
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,559
Maybe someday,

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
you'll be living
in a house like that.

175
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
Get in the car.

176
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,440
Come on. Get in.

177
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,840
What exactly do you want?

178
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,120
Nothing. Let's go.

179
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,399
That's enough.

180
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Don't push it.

181
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
They're together.

182
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,560
Look.

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,440
What are you looking at?

184
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,480
Let's go. Aren't you hungry?

185
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
What do you think?
Does it look good?

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,360
Jin Da Huan,
what are you thinking about?

187
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,679
Why aren't you wearing anything?

188
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm your brother.
What's there to be afraid of?

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,360
No, I don't want you
to catch a cold.

190
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
This dress suits you. It's pretty.

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,359
Lately, I've been having
these scattered memories...

192
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,480
popping up in my head.

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Maybe in a few days,
my memory will come back.

194
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
What if I'm not really
your brother...

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,640
but a rich man?

196
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,680
That's enough. I think
you really did get knocked silly.

197
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
You've been acting strange lately.

198
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,240
Stop imagining things.

199
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,160
If I really were a wealthy heir,

200
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
then I'd marry you.

201
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,879
What nonsense are you talking about?

202
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I'm hanging up.

203
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,960
I haven't seen him for a long time.

204
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
That brat.

205
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
I wonder what he's doing
at home every day.

206
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,360
Mr. Qi.

207
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,120
- Mr. Qi, are you home?
- Wen Han.

208
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Wen Han.

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Wen Han.

210
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Wen Han.

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
What did you tell my mom?

212
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
The truth.

213
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,680
How...

214
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,079
How long has this been going on?

215
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
It just started.

216
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
But Mr. Qi seems to really like me.

217
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,600
He asked me to move in
with him right away.

218
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
Does that mean...

219
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,479
Qi Wen Han, my unfilial son,

220
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
- approached you?
- Yes.

221
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,480
At first, I turned him down.

222
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,600
I didn't think it was a good idea.

223
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,199
But he was too enthusiastic.

224
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,239
He was persistent.

225
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
It was like
he couldn't wait any longer.

226
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,640
Is that the truth?

227
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,360
Sort of.

228
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,280
But your mom
doesn't seem to like me.

229
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,600
She wants me to move out today.

230
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,320
I'm telling you in advance.

231
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
You still have to pay me.

232
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
No. Why do I still have to pay you?

233
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,360
You asked me to write
the additional clause,

234
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,640
so I added this clause.

235
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,560
If any uncontrollable factors...

236
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
cause the service to be terminated,

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,200
Party A shall pay Party B
the full amount of wages.

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,399
(If any uncontrollable factors
cause the service to be terminated,)

239
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
(Party A shall pay Party B
the full amount of wages.)

240
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,120
You win.

241
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,120
Mom.

242
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,400
- Mom.
- You unfilial son.

243
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,519
Let me explain.
Mom, I have my reasons.

244
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,999
Mom, I have my reasons.

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,199
Listen to me first.

246
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,719
Mom, calm down.

247
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I have my reasons.

248
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,080
Calm down, Mom.

249
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,640
It's not what you think, Mom.
