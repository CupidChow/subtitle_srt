00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,920
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
I didn't think
you'd still come to me.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,920
All right, stop pretending.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
I already know who you are.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,440
No way.
I got found out this quickly.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
How did she find out?

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,320
Every day you pretend
to be some proper young master.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
Aren't you tired?

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,920
I... I...

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Aha! I caught you, didn't I?

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
All right.

12
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,640
Introduce yourself properly again.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,880
I didn't expect you to find out.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
Actually, I didn't want to.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,040
When I woke up,
I found myself in this mansion...

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,280
with so many luxury cars.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,040
So you've lost yourself?

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,960
Yes, who wouldn't?

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
All right.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,999
Actually, I'm...

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,280
You're a playboy.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Right?

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
You're just pretending...

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,880
because of your identity.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
So that's what this is about.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,880
Darn, I almost let it slip.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
That's right.

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,320
Seriously, you got me.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
All right, I get it.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,680
Today, let's stop pretending.

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's go out and have fun.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Where do you usually go?

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Take me with you.

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Sure.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,280
I'll take you out
for some fun today.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Let's go.

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,600
The balance is running low.
Please remind him to top up.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
After all that,

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,240
you brought me to a place like this?

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Aren't you childish?

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,800
I knew you wouldn't like it.

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,760
Where did you think I'd take you?

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,279
I thought it would be
something like motorcycles,

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
rock climbing, or bungee jumping.

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Then you've come
to the wrong person.

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
It's not too late
to change your mind.

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
Why don't guys...

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
just play video games at home?

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
You don't get it, do you?

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,280
This is the atmosphere we want.

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,040
What do you say?
Let's play one round.

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
Let's do it. I'm not afraid.

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,200
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Check A and call out.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You go A, I'll go B.

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
Got it.

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Darn it!

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
Check B and call out now.

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,200
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,959
- B site!
- I didn't know...

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
- Guys, come to B!
- you were such a good shot.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
- Losing B!
- You're just too noob.

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
I need backup! Quick!

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Boss!
- Not bad.
- Come quickly!

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,320
What kind of aim and rhythm is that?

66
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,039
Guys, go! Enemies at B!

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,080
Hurry up!

68
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
Why are you so good?

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
You're just too noob.

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,520
How about another round?

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,759
So it was you two
chasing us around...

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,800
and attacking in-game earlier?

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,919
Sir, it's just a game.

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,080
It's normal to get emotional.

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,480
What's wrong? Are you a sore loser?

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
This girl's pretty good.

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,840
You play games every day.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,680
Why not play
something different with us?

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,960
Let's...

80
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Sir.

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
I hope you...

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,200
can be the bigger person
and let this go.

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,080
Don't hold it against us.

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Get lost!

85
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Go! Hurry!

86
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:37,760
- Go after them!
- Move!

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Quick!

88
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Where are they?

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Where are they?

90
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Split up and find them!

91
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Okay.

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
Do you think they're gone?

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I think so.

94
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,720
What a bunch of losers.

95
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Let's go.

96
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Okay.

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Let's go.

98
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
- You...
- You first.

99
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
You go first.

100
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,640
- Then I'll go first.
- Okay.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Let's go.

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
Da Huan, let's go home.

103
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Da Huan.

104
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
Even if I'm totally broke,

105
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,280
will you still love me?

106
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
Once I get on your tricycle,

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm yours.

108
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Actually,

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,519
my real identity is...

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,920
the heir of Xuebao Group.

111
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Tong Sheng.

112
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Da Huan.

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Mr. Qi.

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Are you all right?

115
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Well...

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Get lost.

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,359
Mr. Qi. I just want to remind you.

118
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,320
We're meeting
with the French client next month.

119
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,839
Here's some information
on French private tutors...

120
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,440
I picked out for you.

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
Would you like to take a look?

122
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm a genius indeed.

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,680
So this is the situation.

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,319
See if you're interested...

125
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,000
in being my French tutor.

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
How do you know I can speak French?

127
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Your sister told me.

128
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
But I have one condition.

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
What is it?

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Move into my place.

131
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,680
That's the condition.
Will you do it or not?

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I refuse.

133
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
No.

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,280
I've already talked it over
with your sister.

135
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,840
- She agreed.
- She's her. I'm me.

136
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
How about this?

137
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
Feel free to fill out
this month's salary...

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
and any requests.

139
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Are you sure?

140
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Fill it out.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll do it then.

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,600
Hurry up.

143
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
(Employment Contract)

144
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,360
(Party A: Wanqi Department Store
Party B: Jin Da Xi)

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
How much? 500,000?

146
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Forget it if you can't.

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,560
In one month,

148
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,760
I'll win your sister over.

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay, deal.

150
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,200
Wait, you have so much luggage.

151
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,839
Are you moving...

152
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,000
or are you on the run?

153
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
This feels strangely familiar.

154
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,280
It's like I'm meant
to live in a house like this.

155
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
Are you just going to sit there
and watch?

156
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,720
Come and give me a hand.

157
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
What kind of person is this?

158
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,080
Don't touch my stuff.

159
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,440
Do you usually drink
this kind of wine?

160
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
There's nothing I like.

161
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,440
What's wrong with this wine?
I'm reluctant to let you drink it.

162
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
What kind of taste is this?

163
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
What a waste of money.

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,040
When are you
going to clean this room?

165
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
I want this big room.

166
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,640
No. Your room is the guest room,
across the hall.

167
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
This is my room.

168
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm not used to living
in a small room.

169
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I like living in a big room.

170
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,360
Don't you think
you're going too far?

171
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
- Can't I?
- You...

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Forget it if you can't.
No.

173
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
Fine.

174
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Stay here.
I'll leave.

175
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Wait.

176
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,200
- What now?
- Change the bedsheet.

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,960
Okay, I'll do it.

178
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,480
Why do I feel
like something's wrong?

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Mr. Qi.

180
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,280
Mr. Qi.

181
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
What now?

182
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Mr. Qi.

183
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,559
I'm coming.

184
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,640
- Mr. Qi.
- What now?

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm almost out of wine.

186
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
I'll get it for you.

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
The air conditioner is a bit hot.

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
It's not hot.

189
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
I'll have another plate
of sweet melon.

190
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Cut it into smaller pieces.

191
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Okay.

192
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
By the way,

193
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,240
I want to take a bath.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Get it ready for me.

195
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,000
The water temperature
should be around 36°C.

196
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I don't like it too hot.

197
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Okay.

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Is he messing with me?

199
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,880
It's ready. You can take a bath now.

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Wait.

201
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Scrub my back.

202
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Pick it up.

203
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,520
Come here. Scrub my back.
