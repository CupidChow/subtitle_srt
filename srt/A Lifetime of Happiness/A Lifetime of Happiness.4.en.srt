00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,920
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,960
I blush when I see you.

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,080
My heart beats faster.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
Then do you want to try?

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh my gosh,
what did I even dream about?

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,520
It's so scary!

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Wait.

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,480
This can't be real, can it?

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,680
Da Huan,
he'll be your brother from now on.

10
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,680
But he's not my brother.
I don't have a brother.

11
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Although he wasn't
your brother before,

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,120
he will be from now on.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,080
From now on, we're family.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,200
You have to treat him like family.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Take good care of him.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Okay?

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Do you want to have breakfast?

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Let's eat together.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Last night,

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,160
nothing happened between us, right?

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Everything happened.

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
What?

23
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
The things you thought of...

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
and the ones you didn't,

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
all of it happened.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
No way.

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
That's impossible.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,960
It must be my imagination.

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,080
What's going on?

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
Could it be...

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,680
that I made the first move?

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,600
Do you want to try?

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,640
No. I'm your brother.

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
That's impossible.

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
I'd never make the first move.

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I'd never make the first move.

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Could it be...

38
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Do you want to try?

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
No.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
What are you doing?

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,720
Mr. Qi, why are you here?

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm here to pick you up.

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,680
Da Huan, this is for you.

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Take it.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
This is your brother, right?

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
You forgot your bag.

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Thank you.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,840
Mr. Qi, let's go.

49
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
Bye-bye, buddy.

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Hello.

51
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:14,960
Mr. Chang, we have a problem.

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
I'm not sure why,
but Mr. Qi came to see Tong Sheng.

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,640
Qi Wen Han, what are you up to?

54
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
You secretly went to see Tong Sheng.

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Are you trying to double-cross me?

56
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,840
Seriously, you're so annoying.

57
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Fine.

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,520
I'll be straight with you.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm done playing.

60
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
What do you mean?

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
What do I mean?

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,799
Isn't it just investing?

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,960
I don't want in anymore, okay?

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm not interested
in your family drama at all.

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
I don't want to get involved either.

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Don't forget.

67
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,120
You were involved
in the car accident too.

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
You can't back out
just because you want to.

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,840
You're the one
who caused the car accident.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm just someone who knows about it.

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,000
And what is this?

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
Are you threatening me?

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
Who do you think you are?

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,640
And you say I'm involved?

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
Do you have proof?

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
You're funny.

77
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Darn it!

78
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,200
What's wrong with you, newcomer?

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
How could you even get
the printed version wrong?

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
(Bid Proposal)

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,359
It's correct.

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
This is the copy
you gave me yesterday.

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
What do you mean?

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,160
Are you saying I sent the wrong one?

85
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,240
Let me check again.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Come here.

87
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,520
What are you doing?
Don't you know who she is?

88
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Who?

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mr. Qi was the one
who drove her here this morning.

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Who do you think she is?

91
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,320
I'll just print a new copy myself.

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,160
- I won't trouble you.
- I...

94
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Da Huan, this is for you.

95
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Take it.

96
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,039
Dude.

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,200
Come on, dude.

98
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,800
What are you doing?
Go make fishcakes.

99
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
I don't know how.

100
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,040
Looks like the crash
really knocked him silly.

101
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
It's okay. I'll do it later.

102
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,440
But you have
to promise me one thing.

103
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
What is it?

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
Do you still remember
my silly eldest son?

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,760
The one who's about
the same age as your sister.

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,680
My wife and I have been
thinking about it lately.

107
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,640
Do you want to consider
setting your sister up with...

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
Think about it.

109
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
My son may look like a fool,

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,640
but he's the ultimate good guy.

111
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,680
Your sister won't lose out
if she's with him.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
I've already said so much.

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
See if you're...

114
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,879
Da Xi, what are you doing?

115
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,840
The answer's no.
She has a boyfriend.

116
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,279
No. She doesn't.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,879
She didn't have one
when I asked her a few days ago.

118
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,800
She does. From now on, she does.

119
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay. I won't ask anymore.

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,159
I think he didn't just
get knocked silly,

121
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,640
he got knocked crazy too.

122
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Da Huan, you're off work?

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,200
Get in. I'll take you home.

124
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Look.

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,199
- This girl is really something.
- Yes.

126
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
She's latched onto Mr. Qi.

127
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,120
Da Huan, let's go home.

128
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,080
Can't believe you made it here
in that beat-up car.

129
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Da Huan, get in my car.
I'll take you home.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Look.

131
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,079
She's really something.

132
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Yes.

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Come on, let's go home.

134
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,360
What... What's going on?

135
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Try it.

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
What is this?

137
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,400
Everyone at the headquarters
is dressed nicely.

138
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,440
You're in the Legal Department now,

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
so you can't keep dressing
like a receptionist.

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
It feels like something is missing.

141
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,280
What do you think? Is it nice?

142
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
How much is it?

143
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,320
It's over 30,000.
It really suits you.

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
It's over 30,000?

145
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
Jin Da Xi, are you crazy?

146
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Go and return it.

147
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
It's just money.

148
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
I can make it back.

149
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I have a way.

150
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,040
What could you possibly do?

151
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,520
If I say I have a way, then I do.

152
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm looking for Tong Sheng.

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
This way, please.

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
I didn't think
you'd still come to see me.

155
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
All right, stop pretending.

156
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,400
I already know who you are.
