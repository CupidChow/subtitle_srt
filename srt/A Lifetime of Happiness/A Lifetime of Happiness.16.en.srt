Here you go.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,679
What's this?

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,720
You're so slow.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,120
It's my sister's dating list.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,840
Dating list?

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
(Walked a long distance
with me on his back)

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,479
Everything my sister
wants to do is written here.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,240
Think of it as a cheat sheet
to win her over, got it?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,280
(Cook together...)

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
Ten things I absolutely have to do
with my boyfriend...

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,400
when I'm in a relationship.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,240
Number one.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
Go grocery shopping together
and cook at home.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,599
Come home early tonight.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,960
I bought ingredients.
Let's cook at home together.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
I'm home.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
What are you doing?

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm cooking.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,840
That's not how you cut vegetables.

22
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,920
Cooking?

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,920
I didn't know you could do that.

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
Number two.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Watch a horror movie together.

26
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,120
(Horror movie)

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,360
A horror movie?

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
Didn't my sister scare you enough?

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,120
Also, bake a cake together.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,240
(Go watch the sea together)

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Walk through the park hand in hand.

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Wear matching couple outfits.

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560

36
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
Today is the last day.

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Are you confident?

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,279
My sister has been
in a good mood lately.

39
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,840
Don't worry.
He has me as his strategist.

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
I hope everything goes well tonight.

41
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,680
All right.
I've done everything I can.

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,160
The rest is up to you.

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
I believe you can do it.

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Okay, enough talking.

45
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,240
Today is my last day
working at the fish market.

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,439
I have to go back
and wrap things up.

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I'll go with you.

48
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,480
What for?

49
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,920
I promised I'd help you out.

50
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,279
Even on the last day,
I've got to be on duty.

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Let's go.

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll pick you up after work.

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
See you tonight.

54
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,760
What's the date today?

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
A month has passed.

56
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,880
The thought that I won't be
your boyfriend after tomorrow...

57
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
kind of makes me sad.

58
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,640
How do you know you won't be?

59
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,640
I've thought about it.

60
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,440
I guess you really don't like me,

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,640
but I still kept pushing.

62
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Thank you for putting up
with me all this time,

63
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,000
for taking care of my moods,

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,440
and for pretending to be happy.

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
I wasn't pretending.
I really was happy.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,640
I realized that...

67
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,840
I actually love being around you.

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,960
I've decided not to return you.

69
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I was lying.

70
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
That's what I thought too.

71
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,440
I never intended to stop here.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
There's still
one more thing on the list.

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
What is it?

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't think I don't know
you stole my notebook.

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,240
How did you know
I didn't finish the list?

76
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
Close your eyes.

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,720
Come on.

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Three.

79
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Two.

80
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
One.

81
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,840
The last item on the dating list.

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Watch a romantic fireworks show,

83
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
confess our feelings,

84
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,040
and kiss beneath the sparks.

85
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
Can you give me back
my notebook now?

86
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,240
We've already done everything.
What do you still need it for?

87
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,200
I might have more things
I want to add to it later.

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
There's no need.

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,320
From now on,

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
we'll complete it one by one.

91
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,680
- You said it.
- I said it.

92
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Hello, Yan Yan.

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,439
Da Huan,
something has happened to Da Xi!

94
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
Turn on the news now.

95
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
What?

96
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,840
What's going on?

97
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,400
It's Chang Ming's men.

98
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
What?

99
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,960
They mistook Da Xi for you...

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
and lured him out.

101
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,200
This is the last time.

102
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
Don't come here with me again.

103
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,120
What do you mean?

104
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,400
What if I just insist on
coming with you?

105
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,000
I mean, don't come here again.

106
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,800
Where should we go then?

107
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,560
Maybe a park,

108
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
a street food stall,

109
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
an internet café,
or even an amusement park.

110
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,040
But you still have
to pay me 10,000 yuan a day.

111
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,239
You're unbelievable.

112
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
I was just kidding.

113
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,960
Hello, Mr. Tong?

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,080
I have an important document
that needs to be handed over to you.

115
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,600
Can you pick it up tonight?

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
Sure. Where?

117
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,919
I think I took the wrong phone.

118
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Who is it?

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,880
I don't know.

120
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,200
But it seems like he has
something urgent for my brother.

121
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
Tonight is really important
for your brother.

122
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,840
He definitely won't be free.

123
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,880
Why don't we go get it for him?

124
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,720
Okay.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
When we got there,

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,320
we were surrounded
by a group of people.

127
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,040
To protect me,
Da Xi told me to run...

128
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,920
and they went after him by car.

129
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
Da Xi drove
all the way to the bridge,

130
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,840
but then a truck came out of nowhere
and rammed his car into the water.

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,559
Where is he now?

132
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,640
They're still searching,

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
but the current in that stretch
of the river is really strong.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's hard to say...

135
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,000
if he'll be found.

136
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Da Huan.

137
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Da Huan.

138
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,760
Da Xi.

139
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Da Xi.

140
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,000
Da Xi!

141
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Da Huan.

142
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
Are you all right?

143
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Where's Da Xi? Did they find him?

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,040
No.

145
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
No way.

146
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
Da Xi might have...

147
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
gone home.

148
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,160
That's right.

149
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,600
He didn't bring his phone with him,
so he couldn't contact us.

150
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,160
That must be it.

151
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Da Xi.

152
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I'll go with you.

153
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,440
No, don't follow me.
