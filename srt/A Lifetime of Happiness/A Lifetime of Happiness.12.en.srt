00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,640
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,599
Weren't you quite brave that day?

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,640
You fought back.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,400
This is different.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,680
Look, it's so cruel.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
Hurry up.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,400
Are you trying to kill me?

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
I don't know how to do this!

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
Let me teach you.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,160
You have to pay tuition for this.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
So there are things
you're afraid of too.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,040
What are you doing?
Are you flirting here?

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,440
Hurry up. Crazy people.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,760
Why don't I do it?

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Okay.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,800
You're really weird.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,840
Logically speaking,
you're part of the Tong family now.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
But you're still delivering fish.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,239
Have you thought about going back...

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,840
to the Tong family
to be the young master again?

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,800
I'd be lying if I say
I haven't thought about it.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
But I'm used to being free.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
The people there...

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,200
are too scary. It doesn't suit me.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Right.

26
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,520
If I were you,
I'd make the same choice.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,240
I'm free-spirited
and want to be uninhibited.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't know how lucky you are.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,880
What if I'm not lucky at all?

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,600
I guess we won't know that.

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
What's wrong?

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,840
You want me to take
the initiative for this?

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,400
Why did you suddenly
ask me out today?

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,760
Is it about work?

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,559
Is work the only way...

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
you and I can see each other?

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Da Huan.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
Don't stress yourself out.

39
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,200
I'll take care of the merger.

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll give you a solid foothold
in the Legal Department.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,080
Thank you, Yu Chen.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,480
There are indeed many things
I don't yet understand.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't be too nervous.

44
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you remember...

45
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,600
our club's social gathering?

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
You were forced to sing three songs.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Did you know?

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,760
The guys were going
crazy over you...

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,960
and discussing you
behind your back.

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
That's when I noticed you.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,200
Don't bring that up.

52
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,880
It was so awkward.

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,799
I remember after the performance,

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
I lost a necklace.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I know about that.

56
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,200
You were looking for it backstage
and asked me about it.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh, right.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
You helped me look for it
for a long time.

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,360
But I didn't manage to find it
in the end.

60
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,680
Out with the old, in with the new.

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,520
Speaking of which,

62
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,120
I haven't been back
to the school in a long time.

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,080
Me too.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,200
Let's go today then.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,799
Okay, I'll go to the restroom first.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
We'll go when I'm back.

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,640
This necklace must be expensive.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Da Huan never accepts
such expensive things.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,280
It's you.

71
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
What's wrong?

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,039
Can't I give her a present?

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Sure, but I'm accepting it
on behalf of my sister.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
After all, Da Huan and I are family.

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
You're such a busybody.

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
You don't have to be polite with me.

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
I'll just say one thing.

78
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,680
Stay away from Jin Da Huan.

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
What era are we in now?

80
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,880
Da Huan should have
the right to choose.

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,280
If you really love her,

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
you should respect
how she really feels.

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,280
What if she's longing to marry me?

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,400
I don't care what she thinks.

85
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,920
I hope you don't stoop too low.

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,240
Respect her.

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Let's go.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,560
What's wrong?

89
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,120
You don't look well.

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm fine. Your brother was here.

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
Well? You've had a long day.

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
This is nothing.

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,880
Okay, I'll transfer it to you later.

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Let's continue tomorrow.

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Again?

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Are you crazy?

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm willing to.

98
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Jin Da Xi.

99
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,280
Hand it over.

100
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,000
Hand what over?

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Are you going to keep pretending?

102
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
What are you talking about?

103
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,079
Why did you take the thing...

104
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
that Yu Cheng gave me?

105
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,679
Yes, I told you not to do that.

106
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Where did you put it?
Give it to her.

107
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,960
Did you leave it in the shop?

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Let's go get it now.

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Da Huan, the situation
is a bit unusual.

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
Let me apologize to you first.

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,360
I'll explain it to you another day.

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Let's go.

113
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Da Huan, we'll get it back
for you right away.

114
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
What era are we in?

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,960
Da Huan should have
the right to choose.

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
Tong Sheng, what are you looking at?

117
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,320
- Nothing.
- Tong Sheng, are you in love?

118
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
Am I going to have a sister-in-law?

119
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,920
The choice is up
to the other person.

120
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,240
Is it Ms. Yan?

121
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,040
I can come and go freely now.

122
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
You don't have to visit me
every day.

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,080
It's okay. I just like
to bring you food.

124
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Thank you.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,400
I'll leave it here. I'll get going.

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,879
Your department store
has been busy...

127
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,360
with the merger and acquisition
of Xuebao Group, right?

128
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,440
Yes, and we've been working
overtime every night.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,920
But luckily,
we're in the final stage.

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
Once it is over,
we'll be one family.

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Give me a moment.

132
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,200
The coffee here...

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,120
tastes exactly like the one
we had at school.

134
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,680
I remember you loved their coffee.

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
You still remember that?

136
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Da Huan.

137
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
Are you happy being with me?

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm quite happy.

139
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Then...

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
Then can you accept my gift?
