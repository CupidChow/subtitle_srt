00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,920
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,080
Tong Sheng, what exactly
have you been doing lately?

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
It's such an important contract.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,000
How could you leave such a big
loophole for people to exploit?

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,640
Are you stupid?

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,360
Dad, don't be angry.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,080
Tong Sheng is still recovering.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't blame him.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,280
If you haven't recovered,
don't go anywhere.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,640
Rest at home.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
Leave the company
to Chang Ming for now.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,040
All right. That's all.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,360
So this is what you want to do.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,560
How is my family matter
any of your business?

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
You've gone too far.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
You're taking advantage.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Good morning, Da Huan.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Have you had breakfast?

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Mr. Qi.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,240
The company is so busy lately.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,840
You didn't have to come.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
It's on the way.
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,080
Mr. Qi, I don't think
it's appropriate.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,720
There's a rumor going around
in the company lately...

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,480
- that you and I...
- What's inappropriate with this?

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Get in the car. Let's go.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
There's no need.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
I'll give you a ride.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,080
Wait, how are you going to do that?

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
With your crappy tricycle?
It's not like
she hasn't ridden in it.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
It's none of your business.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,079
Wait, can that compare
to this car of mine?

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,120
Why are you here?

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm asking why you're here.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Me?

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
I know.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,800
This is the hidden side
of you, right?

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Pretending to be poor
and dating an older girl.

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,520
Who are you? What do you mean?

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
You're really heartless.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
You said you'd pretend not to know
me, and you're doing that.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,519
Why did you forcefully
break up with me?

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,120
You can tell me
if you don't have feelings for me.

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I'd back off.

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Wait.

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,920
What do you mean by that?

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Who exactly are you?

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,320
Ma'am, I didn't ask you.

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
Who are you calling ma'am?

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Is there anyone else here?

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Who is she?
I don't know her.

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Did you hear that?
He doesn't know you.

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,559
Ma'am, I don't care
about your business.

54
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
I don't want to know either.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,799
But he has
to make things clear to me today.

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,960
Don't keep saying that.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
What's your relationship with him?

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
Who are you to question
my younger brother?

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Your younger brother?

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,319
So he likes older women like you?

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,520
Watch your mouth.

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,880
I want to comment about you.
What can you do about it?

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Look at the bags under your eyes.

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,600
Isn't it obvious?

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,599
Look at you.

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
At a young age, you have
deeper laugh lines than I do,

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,000
and you're one to talk.

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
I really don't know
what he sees in you.

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,000
You're crazy.

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Do you know her?

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
I don't.

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Go and stop the fight.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,839
Wait, how can I stop the fight
if you don't even know her?

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Go.

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
That's enough, Da Huan.

76
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,920
It's getting late.
We're going to be late for work.

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Let's go.

78
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,520
Well, we'll get going.

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,400
But you two have a good talk.

80
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,920
It's better to make things clear.

81
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,160
It's better to be clear.

82
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,480
Stop talking nonsense with them.
Get in the car.

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Okay.

84
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Tong Sheng, can we have a good talk?

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
What did you call me?

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Mr. Chang.

87
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Yan Yan met Mr. Tong.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
I got it.

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,920
You're really heartless.

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,560
You said you'd pretend not to know
me, and you're doing that.

92
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,120
Why did you forcefully
break up with me?

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,039
You can tell me
if you don't have feelings for me.

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
I'd back off.

95
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,480
Jin Da Xi...

96
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
keeps telling me
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,520
Who is that girl?

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,800
He's secretly dating,
and he dares to keep it from me.

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
Don't be mad anymore.

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Have some good food.

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,160
This shop's cake is really tasty.

102
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,559
Actually,

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,400
I know who that girl is.

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Who is she?

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,760
She's the daughter
of the Yan family.

106
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,720
The daughter of a rich family...

107
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,360
actually fell
for an egomaniac like your brother.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,080
She's really blind.

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
But don't worry.

110
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,280
She's a nice person.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
She's kind,

112
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,919
experienced, and knowledgeable.

113
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
She's nice?

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
She's rude
and has no matters at all.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,920
He's all grown up, it's normal
to be unable to control him.

116
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
He's secretly dating someone...

117
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
and doesn't want to tell you.

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
Maybe he wants to surprise you.

119
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
We just don't know
how long they've been dating.

120
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,880
Maybe...

121
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
something already happened
between them.

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,559
Tong Sheng, what exactly
is going on?

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,120
You have to explain it clearly
to me today.

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,519
The person you saw...

125
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,720
is someone named Tong Sheng,

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
the son of a group's owner.

127
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,679
What are you talking about?

128
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,800
That means...

129
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,680
there's someone who looks exactly
like me in this world.

130
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,240
Maybe we accidentally
switched identities.

131
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,640
And I'm actually the son
of that group's owner,

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,640
not Jin Da Huan's brother,
Jin Da Xi.

133
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
No wonder.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
In that case,

135
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,920
everything makes sense now.

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Hello.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Do you have time for a chat?

138
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,640
It's about your true identity.
