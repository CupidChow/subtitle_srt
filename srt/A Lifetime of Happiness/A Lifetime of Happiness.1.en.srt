1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
You wench.

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,280
What gave you the courage
to seduce my husband?

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,360
Here. Take a picture of this.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
This is the woman
who seduced my husband.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,160
That's right. She seduced me first.

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,760
- Don't do this.
- Why not?

7
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,360
Because you're my brother.

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
What if...

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
I'm not your brother?

10
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,560
(Episode 1)

11
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
(One Month Ago)

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,040
Jin Da Xi, go deliver the fish.

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Got it.

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
Mr. Tong, the car is ready.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,760
- Mr. Tong is here.
- Copy that.

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,519
Did you go gambling?

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
No.

18
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,880
Did you go gambling?

19
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,520
How dare you?

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,680
Da Xi, you're just in time.

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,640
Were you playing games last night?

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,440
The fish we got today
are all rotten.

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
No, ma'am.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
I didn't buy them.

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,239
I went with the boss
to buy meat yesterday.

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Ask him if you don't believe me.
That's right.

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
- Dear, did you hear that?
- Are you sure you bought the meat?

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,960
If you dare lie to me,

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,720
I'll rip all your hair off.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
Do you believe me?

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Tong Sheng, why did you leave?

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
- Mr. Qi will be here soon.
- Send him away.

33
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,759
But they want to buy in...

34
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,160
Do I have to repeat myself?

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,800
(April 17, 2023)

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Is that him?

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Tong Sheng.

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,880
Sir, it's really Mr. Tong.

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Please make the arrangements.

40
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,600
Tong Sheng. Are you okay?

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,440
Hello. Which room is the patient
who was just in a car accident in?

42
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
- It's 303.
- Thank you.

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,040
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Why did you set me up?

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Where am I?

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,720
Are you crazy, Jin Da Xi?

47
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm your sister.

48
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,600
Jin Da Xi?

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
You said my name is Jin Da Xi?

50
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
What just happened...

51
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
was a stress reaction.

52
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,599
Your brother suffered
a blow to the head.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
He might have temporary amnesia.

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,800
Doctor, when will he recover?

55
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
It's hard to say.

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
But I suggest...

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
you take him to a place
he's familiar with.

58
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
It will help with his recovery.

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
We're home.

60
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
You still can't remember anything?

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,879
Da Xi, take a look around.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,120
See if you remember anything.

63
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm going to cook for you.

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,920
Da Xi, it's time to eat.

65
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
Come on. I'm so tired.

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Eat up.

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I'll do it myself.

68
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,600
He's so handsome.

69
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
What's wrong?
It's very noisy.

70
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
It's noisy?

71
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,080
You used to play it louder than me.

72
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
This is really nice.

73
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
Jin Da Xi, what are you doing?

74
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,480
So my name is Jin Da Xi.

75
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
What's your name?

76
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm Jin Da Huan.

77
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm your sister.

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,760
We grew up together.

79
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
You really don't remember?

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
I grew up with someone like you?

81
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Yes. What do you mean
by someone like me?

82
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
I don't want to eat anymore.

83
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Do whatever you want.

84
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,960
I want to take a shower.
Where's the bathroom?

85
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
It's upstairs.

86
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Why are you looking at me?

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm not interested in you.

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
What are you talking about?

89
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,279
- Then why did you look at me?
- What are you thinking about?

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
I want to take a shower.

91
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,840
Then why did you strip
in front of me?

92
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Aren't you my sister?

93
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
The doctor said going back
to your old life...

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,080
would help you regain your memory.

95
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm having your old one repaired.

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,680
I borrowed you a new one.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm a deliveryman?

98
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,320
You deliver fish.

99
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,320
How could I be delivering fish?

100
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
How could you not deliver fish?

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,200
My hands don't look like
they do this kind of work.

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
You used to ride this,

103
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:12,080
fetch goods from the fish market,

104
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
and deliver them
to this restaurant every day.

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
You don't remember?

106
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,360
Your phone is broken.

107
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Use my old one first.

108
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,160
If you need money,
the family card is in there.

109
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,719
All your old addresses...

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
are in there too.

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm going to work.

112
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Where am I?

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Tong Sheng, you're finally awake.

114
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Who are you?

115
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm your brother, Tong An.

116
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,560
Mr. Tong, your brother
is recovering well.

117
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
He should be fine.

118
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
He's been in a coma for too long.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
It might have affected his memory.

120
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Mr. Tong.

121
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,280
You're the president
of Xuebao Group.

122
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,960
That's right, Tong Sheng. Look.

123
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
This is a photo of us
when we were kids.

124
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
That's me?

125
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Tong Sheng.

126
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,160
You don't even recognize me.

127
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Maybe you really have amnesia.

128
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
Maybe I'm dreaming.

129
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
- Hello?
- Hello, Da Xi.

130
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,040
I ordered a cake for you
to celebrate your discharge tonight.

131
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,440
Buy some groceries on your way back.

132
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I'll send you the list.

133
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,240
If you see anything you need,

134
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
you can buy it on your way back too.

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

136
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,240
Jin Da Huan, right?

137
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,040
- That's me.
- Here's the cake you ordered.

138
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Thank you.

139
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,480
(Payment Notification)

140
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,840
(Payment Notification)

141
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
Jin Da Xi.

142
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Jin Da Xi.

143
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
You're back.

144
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
What's this?

145
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,240
I've been wearing the clothes
in the closet for five years.

146
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I got some new ones.

147
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
What's this?

148
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
Don't you already have one?

149
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,600
The one in the bathroom
isn't my favorite brand.

150
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,480
I'm afraid my boss
will deduct my pay if I'm late.

151
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Jin Da Xi.

152
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,000
You want to die, don't you?

153
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,120
Didn't you tell me
to buy something I like?

154
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,400
Did you look at the price
when you bought it?

155
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,840
Are you out of your mind?

156
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,240
Don't you know what our family's
financial situation is like?

157
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,280
I don't think it's expensive.

158
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
It's not expensive?

159
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,760
It's 70,000 yuan
and you say it's not expensive?

160
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,360
Do you know how hard it is for me
to save money every day?

161
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,720
You spent it all in a flash.

162
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Who do you think you are?

163
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
Are you some young master?

164
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
You're right.

165
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,999
There was a moment
when I was shopping...

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,519
that I thought
I should be a rich kid...

167
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,840
or the owner of a company
or something.

168
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
- Why do I have a brother like you?
- Right.

169
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Here's yours.

170
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
You've been wearing those shoes
for almost 3 to 4 years.

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Wear these.

172
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
What era are we in?

173
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,520
How are there still
power outages here?

174
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I was going to pay
the electricity bill,

175
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,840
but you spent all the money.

176
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
What should we do?

177
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
There's some loose change
at the door.

178
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,080
Go and pay the electricity bill.

179
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
I bought drinks.

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
They are all gone.
