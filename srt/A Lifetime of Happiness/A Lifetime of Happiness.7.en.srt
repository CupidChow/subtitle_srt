00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,920
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,800
(How to earn money quickly
High-paying reward)

3
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm going to cram school.

4
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
What time is it already?

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,360
Hello, I'm Jack.

6
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,400
I used to work at a private bank
in Singapore.

7
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,520
Welcome to my class today.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
For what we're going
to talk about today,

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
please turn to page 10.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Please pay attention.

11
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,199
To capture trends,
you have to capture momentum.

12
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,720
The king of momentum
is the transport route.

13
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
This is very important.
Please take note of this.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,240
Who let you secretly listen here?

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,240
You're even taking notes?
Can you understand it?

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,559
As a cleaner,
can't you act like one?

17
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
How many times has it already been?

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Get back to work.

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,479
Instead of working hard,

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
you're listening in
to class for free.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
Why are you making yourself
so pitiful?

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Why are you here?

23
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
I passed by...

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
so I came to pick you up from work.

25
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
How coincidental.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Let's go.

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Is the tuition expensive?

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Why do you ask?

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm just asking.

30
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,280
It's 10,000 yuan for 8 classes.

31
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Hello.

32
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,080
This is Xuebao Group.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Your design proposal...

34
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
won the competition this time.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Please come to the company tomorrow
to collect your prize money.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Okay, I got it.

37
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Who was that?

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
The Xuebao Group.

39
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,120
The Xuebao Group?

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
Why are they calling you
at this hour?

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
They said I won a prize.
They want me to collect it.

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,599
You won a prize? How much is it?

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
It's 100,000 yuan.

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,120
It's 100,000 yuan?

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,320
It was what you were working on
in the middle of the night?

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Anyway, don't worry about it.

47
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I told you, I'll take care of you.

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Wait.

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
It's 100,000 yuan.

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
You're not happy at all?

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Is 100,000 yuan a lot?

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,880
Isn't 100,000 yuan a lot?

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,800
The Da Xi in the past...

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,480
would be elated.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,480
I don't think 100,000 yuan is a lot.

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
When will you get
your memories back?

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,360
Your sour face
is really annoying right now.

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
I want...

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
to trample you to death now.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,039
I'll step on you!

61
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
How childish.

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
I'll step on you!

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,800
You didn't want to do it, right?

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Tong Sheng, this is our company.

65
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Do you remember it?

66
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
Let's go. I'll show you around more.

67
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
I'll show Tong Sheng around.

68
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,120
Hello, I'm here to accept the prize.

69
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,280
May I ask where I should go?

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,040
Any news from the person
I asked you to find?

71
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,200
I've already asked people
to look for him.

72
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,120
But please also understand.

73
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
The scope of the search
is quite broad.

74
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Thank you for your hard work.

75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,240
This is actually my fault.

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
I was too busy with work back then.

77
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,720
That's why I lost...

78
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Tong Sheng's twin brother.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,400
Dad, it's not your fault.

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,920
The situation was complicated.

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,840
Moreover, Madam was careless, so...

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Chang Ming.

83
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,720
I've always thought
you know your place.

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,640
That's why I entrusted you
with this task.

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
I... I'm sorry.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,040
I shouldn't have said that.

87
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Keep searching.

88
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,040
Remember, don't let Tong An
and Tong Sheng know.

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Okay.

90
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
What did you say your name is?

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Jin Da Xi.

92
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Da Xi.

93
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Da Xi.

94
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
That's a good name.

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
What's the matter?

96
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Nothing.

97
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,239
When you were downstairs,

98
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,640
did anyone recognize you?

99
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
What do you mean?

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,000
I mean,

101
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,440
we have some employees...

102
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,200
who aren't that bright.

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
As you know,

104
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
our company is most famous...

105
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,000
for doing charity work all the time.

106
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,719
I'd let them do simple jobs.

107
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,279
But there are always some people...

108
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,960
who call everyone Mr. Tong.

109
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
They can't be stopped.

110
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
They always go crazy.

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,480
Please understand if you meet them.

112
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
That didn't happen.

113
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,160
But a few people
suddenly bowed to me.

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
That's normal too.

115
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
As you know,

116
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,280
our company is most famous
for being polite to people,

117
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
especially to talented people
like you.

118
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
Please don't find it strange.

119
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,040
What exactly is the company
most famous for?

120
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,720
We're famous for all of that.

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Anyway,

122
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,400
thank you for your contribution
to our company.

123
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
If we need anything in the future,

124
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,400
we'll contact you again.

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
You should go now.

126
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Wait.

127
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,920
I'll see you out.

128
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,680
Our company is quite strict
with our employees.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
Look, that's
our newly-built factory.

130
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
What are you doing?

131
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm just showing you around.

132
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
By the way, you can go now.

133
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
How ridiculous.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's you.

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,920
Our company is very satisfied...

136
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
with the proposal
you made last time.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I have a better job for you now.

138
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
I wonder if you want to consider it.

139
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
What is it?

140
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
Our company...

141
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,520
has a branch in Shanghai...

142
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
that especially needs
a talent like you.

143
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,560
In terms of salary,

144
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
it's very good.

145
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,840
And food and lodging are included.

146
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,640
After working there for a year,

147
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
we'll give you a property
in the city.

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,680
What do you think?
Do you want to consider it?

149
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,280
(Xuebao Biotech Industrial Park)

150
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,480
Mr. Chang, I've investigated.

151
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
Someone named Jin Da Xi
was hospitalized that day.

152
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,640
He had a concussion
and lost his memories.
