00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,600
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,080
Young Master,
I've packed your luggage.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,879
Tong Sheng, you're leaving so early?

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,000
Isn't your flight in the afternoon?

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
I want to go out for a walk.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,720
There are places I want to visit.

7
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,360
Don't tell me you know
about postpartum care too.

8
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,960
How does it feel
to lose your memory?

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,119
(We are recognized
as a baby-friendly hospital)

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,680
Mr. Tong, it's almost time.

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
We should go.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Da Huan,

13
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
goodbye.

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Da Xi?

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Da Xi!

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,760
Da Xi, stop!

17
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Da Xi!

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Da Xi!

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,680
This is the sales report
for this quarter.

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Take a careful look.

21
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
And this.

22
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,640
I need to take this call.

23
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Hello?

24
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:07,120
Hello, are you Tong Sheng's family?

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
- Who?
- Do you know Tong Sheng?

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,519
Who are you?

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,759
I'm calling from the city hospital.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,879
A man had an accident.

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
He was brought
to the emergency room.

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,759
But he doesn't remember anything.

31
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,119
He only remembers your number.

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,600
Can you come over?

33
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Who are you?

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,160
You remember my number,

35
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,000
but you don't know
who I am, Tong Sheng?

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Tong Sheng?

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
You mean...

38
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
my name is Tong Sheng?

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,560
You don't remember me?

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm Da Huan.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Da Huan?

42
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,760
You really don't remember me?

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
I don't.

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,080
But for some reason,

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,280
when I hear that name,

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,360
I feel so sad.

47
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,480
Did anything bad happen
between us?

48
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
No.

49
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,000
Everything that happened
between us was beautiful.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,320
It's something I'll never forget.

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
Hello, Tong An.

52
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,280
Tong Sheng had an accident.

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
He's at the city hospital.

54
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,120
What? We've been looking
for him everywhere.

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
I think he lost his memory again.

56
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Again?

57
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Take him to a safe place first.

58
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,720
Why don't you take him home first?

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll pick him up right away.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Don't let news of this leak.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Okay.

62
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,279
You really don't remember anything?

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,360
Nothing at all?

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,480
I only remember that someone
called Jin Da Huan lives here.

65
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,440
Why do you only remember her?

66
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,440
She might be
someone very important to me.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Tong Sheng!

68
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Tong Sheng!

69
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,920
Your family is here to pick you up.

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Go home with them.

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I...

72
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
No.

73
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
They are bad people!
I don't want to go with them!

74
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Tong Sheng!

75
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,200
Don't worry. I'll find him.

76
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Hello?

77
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,359
Da Huan, good news!

78
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
They found Da Xi!

79
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
What?

80
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Who?

81
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Da Xi?

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Where is he?

83
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
He has gone home.

84
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Da Xi.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,360
You're still alive.

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,240
It's good that you're back.

87
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,720
May I know who you are?

88
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,720
Have you lost your memory?

89
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm your sister. Have you forgotten?

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,080
I don't know who I am either.

91
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
But someone asked me
to bring you something.

92
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
Da Huan, I hope I didn't scare you.

93
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,759
I didn't know how to tell you this,

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,840
but everyone said
to give you a surprise.

95
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,559
Why are you hesitating?
Get to the point.

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,239
Be quiet. He's the main character.

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Let him speak.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,359
Yes, that's right.

99
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,600
The person in front of you
is Jin Da Xi.

100
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
But he seems
to have lost his memory.

101
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,759
But it's okay.

102
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,039
I'm sure he'll remember.

103
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,320
After all, you could say
we're experienced in this matter.

104
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,320
What exactly is going on?

105
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Da Xi!

106
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,200
Stop running.
Don't you recognize me?

107
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
We've been trying
to contact his family.

108
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
But he was found on the shore.

109
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,440
He didn't have
any identification on him.

110
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
And he suffered from memory loss
after he drowned.

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,520
But fortunately,
the brain damage isn't too serious.

112
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,680
If he rests for a while,
he'll gradually recover.

113
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
That's what happened.

114
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,560
But why are you here?

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,360
Of course I have to be here.

116
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
And I want to know...

117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,360
how you are going to tell Da Huan...

118
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,920
all the things that should
and shouldn't be said.

119
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,080
I have a great idea.
Do you want to hear it?

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,120
I think we should...

121
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,880
give Da Huan a surprise.

122
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,039
Surprise? What surprise?

123
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,200
Let's put on a play together.

124
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm the director.

125
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,879
Not only am I going to direct,

126
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm going to act too.

127
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Me too.

128
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,720
Director, give me a role.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
What does this have to do with you?

130
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,880
It's none of your business.
You do your part. I'll do mine.

131
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Come on.

132
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Please.

133
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Is this it?

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,479
All right, fine.

135
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
I'll take it.

136
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,079
You cheated!

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
How have I cheated?

138
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
I have one too.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Although it's hard to say...

140
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,160
whether this will end up
as a surprise or a shock,

141
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
everyone can't wait...

142
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,280
for you to get this news,

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,439
especially...

144
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Da Huan.

145
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I used to think...

146
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,520
we wouldn't have the chance
to be together anymore.

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,640
But I didn't expect...

148
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
God to give me another chance.

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,960
So will you start over with me?
