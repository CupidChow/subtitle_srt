1
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,850
Möbius circuit

2
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,499
No sugar?

3
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,332
Three parts water, without sugar.

4
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,707
Have you ever been to Spain Said?

5
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,249
In Spain? Not.

6
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,874
Never?

7
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,249
Not even with your girlfriend when you were younger?

8
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,999
So you have no connection with Spain

9
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:04,040
Will you not be surprised if I bet on the collapse of your actions in Spain?

10
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,942
The price for placing the 3 -month shares of the GDP?

11
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:16,900
- I stay in 2.5. - So give me 100,000.

12
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:21,817
"Are you safe?" - May this be a problem?

13
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:27,025
That is. 100,000 per 3 months of GDP offers you the option of a 340 million euro profit.

14
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:35,733
Mr. Redmond, they invested in the money placement option.

15
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,567
- They risked a lot. - Right.

16
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:44,233
They can still withdraw your confidence. Do it right away.

17
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,942
They hired me for my knowledge in working with exotic products.

18
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:51,775
They did not negotiate the contracts but I know my buyers.

19
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:55,608
When I sell the CDS Spaniards, I know what the impact is.

20
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,150
Spain issues 8 million shares tomorrow.

21
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:02,567
The banks open and I could choose with the profit.

22
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,900
Are you sure that Spanish bonds are not for sale?

23
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:10,108
The sale of certain products can draw attention to the Spaniards.

24
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:14,567
If I am not wrong, I have sold 4 times over the market price.

25
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,692
Should I give up?

26
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,442
Hi.

27
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,733
Hi.

28
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:06,400
Do you think Euribor will recover from the vicinity?

29
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:13,275
- We ask? - Do you think Euribor will recover?

30
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:18,567
"Why are you asking me?" - Your flood is quite diverse.

31
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:22,567
- Why do you think I just knew? - intuition.

32
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,858
Intuition do you say?

33
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,900
Do you have that?

34
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,692
Okay, try to use the model but not to exaggerate.

35
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:37,775
You know who he is. Show him interest. Makes more of a direct approach. Try again.

36
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:45,567
- Why do you think I would know about it? - Don't you work for RBI?

37
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:49,775
- Do we know each other? - I know you.

38
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,608
- You also work for RBI? - No.

39
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:58,775
- Why do you have to be so mysterious? - I moved quietly.

40
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:02,608
"So I didn't scare you." - Now you're really scared!

41
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:08,275
"I know, but not from RBI." Attack directly, action! This is like a hot sizzling.

42
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,108
Once again. How much is in total?

43
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:15,733
- Is it just a matter of money? - It was just a question.

44
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,400
You are free. The others are arrested.

45
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:30,317
- No. It doesn't work that way. - Why not?

46
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:34,567
Do you insincere that all the bank's employees are accused in direct involvement?

47
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,025
That doesn't scare him.

48
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:41,983
Carp knows that we cannot close it by motivating it with large amounts of money.

49
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,483
Is that all you have after more after 3 weeks of work?

50
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,483
Find something else. As soon as possible!

51
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,650
- What did you find? - He speaks in French.

52
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:06,775
Tell others. Don't speak Russian here.

53
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:09,900
Good. What do you think about it?

54
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:14,192
Is glittering intelligent. He works alone.

55
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:18,692
Very confident. Quite modest.

56
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:23,108
- It's a nervous yarn. - As a physical aspect?

57
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:30,650
- It's attractive. - Just that! He has that feminine something.

58
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,900
Why isn't a man?

59
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,775
This is what happens because of the job. It makes it even more wrapped.

60
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:42,442
Like when you play, don't leave room for more.

61
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:51,733
It is our only bait carp to get them work from the US.

62
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,442
- Urgent. "Because of her father?"

63
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:58,817
"How are you, my dear?" - I'm fine. But you?

64
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,442
- I'm fine too. "Did you meet with Nair?"

65
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:08,442
Yes. Nothing new. It will continue the treatment.

66
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:14,067
- How do you stay with taste recovery? - Almost normal. It starts to recover.

67
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:19,067
I don't know when. The food here is sad.

68
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,983
- Dad, you have to eat. - Yes really.

69
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,192
Spanish banks are in red

70
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,733
Hello.

71
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,733
I like this situation we are just the two here.

72
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,983
Do you think the long -term actions will grow?

73
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:14,817
- I asked if you think ... - I heard you.

74
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:19,858
- Do you have no opinion? - Should?

75
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:24,983
- Don't you work in the world of finance? - No. And I want peace.

76
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,317
"I'm sorry about the disturbance." - Thank you.

77
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:31,400
I can't give you peace. I am from the Financial Police.

78
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:42,233
- To spy on employees? - It would be stupid to refuse.

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,525
- I refuse. - Uninspired choice.

80
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,775
When the scandal begins, your career will go.

81
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:53,942
It seems strange to ask me this.

82
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:57,650
You know how hard it is to fight when it comes to a lot of money.

83
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,400
We tried by all the methods. And I received help from people of good faith.

84
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,692
I am probably not the most appropriate person.

85
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:09,192
And what if I could send you back to the US?

86
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:10,650
Cum?

87
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:15,858
Help us, and we, the American side let you work there.

88
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:19,025
Who says I could work there?

89
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:24,942
If you change your mind, call me this number.

90
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:08,608
I had a dream exactly like the one last week.

91
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:15,192
I was simply ... in a room.

92
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,775
A round -shaped room. There was only dust around.

93
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:22,817
They were like a lot of furnished firides.

94
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:28,400
A kind of living room, or rather a budoir.

95
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,192
A boudoir ...

96
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:34,817
"They tried to recruit me. Instructions?"

97
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,650
Well, he says everything.

98
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,192
Yorktown, Virginia yours

99
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:47,192
I do not know if we can use the coincidental word in what we do.

100
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:52,233
No, we can't. There is no such situation.

101
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,692
I don't know what to say. What we have here seems to be a great coincidence.

102
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:02,942
- What is it about? - about one of our agents in Europe. Something happened, madness.

103
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:09,400
- Damn it! - an expert in transactions.

104
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:14,608
It is the answer to Rostovski's priorities. And FSB is concerned about it.

105
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:19,150
- What was the main mission? - to become Rostovski's right hand.

106
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:23,025
- and tell us about his activity. - In exchange for what?

107
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:29,525
We make sure that it will be allowed to return here to work. So what to do?

108
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:33,275
Will say yes. But he does not tell him that it is about the Russians.

109
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:38,983
Let her believe that it is about the French or the Monegascus or with everything else.

110
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,942
It's beginner. So the less he knows the better for us.

111
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,942
The called number is not ...

112
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,900
- Did you call me? - I thought I was wrong.

113
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,733
- No, it was right. - What should I do?

114
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,942
Conversations with traders are stored on a server, is it?

115
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,108
- Yes. - Copies all those files.

116
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:28,900
- How? I don't know the password. - Find something.

117
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,900
- It was time. - Yes.

118
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:13,692
I wasted a lot of time. I would like to see some results as soon as possible.

119
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:17,442
- You have a month available. - Very good.

120
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:30,442
Rostovski recommended to the president as the leader of the FSB.

121
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:34,900
Because I am loyal to Rostovski.

122
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,275
And now you want to compromise it?

123
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,567
Created kings. And he can remove him from the throne.

124
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:53,067
Such a businessman is dangerous.

125
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,483
- So you want to ... - I'll crush it.

126
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:34,025
- He doesn't have time now. - Two minutes.

127
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,567
Can we talk for a few moments?

128
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:42,275
Ivan, Alice Redmond Head of Department of Derivatives.

129
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,442
Ivan Rostovski.

130
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,608
- Hello. - I am pleased to meet you.

131
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:53,942
- You predicted the fall of Spain, is it? - I invented a program, which did this.

132
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm hungry. You don't?

133
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,567
- Why not take lunch together? - I would be pleased.

134
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:09,442
- Our friend leaves the bank. - Alone?

135
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:15,567
- No. It is also the diamond around. - Don't get too close.

136
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:28,483
"Don't get too close" ... I like his instructions.

137
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,192
As if we wanted to enter into his intimacy.

138
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,733
- carp? - Fuck?!

139
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:56,983
Call the boss.

140
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,858
It's Khorzov, the boss of my security team.

141
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:13,025
It's bad and paranoid, but that's why I pay it.

142
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:16,983
He gets a brother with you if he seems to hurt me somehow.

143
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,317
So if you want to hurt me, let him know in advance.

144
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:24,400
In French. He doesn't speak English.

145
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:29,608
Well, Mr Khorzov. I'll inform you about any diabolical intention.

146
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,275
We have a wise woman here.

147
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:37,317
- smart and beautiful. - cute from your part.

148
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:42,275
"Are you Jew?" - Why?

149
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:46,692
My mother does not like again, that I should sleep only with those who do not have this origin.

150
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:51,233
I must warn you: I am neither Jewish nor a virgin.

151
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,317
Go immediately to the toilet!

152
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,233
We worked with Lehman Brothers.

153
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,650
Yes. Probilil you heard that I helped them to fail.

154
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,192
Excuse me. I will eat the same thing as you.

155
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,608
What's wrong with you? Please put us on guard.

156
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:18,650
- I can't steal, just seduce. - What plan do you have?

157
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,775
- To get closer. - How close?

158
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,900
- You're not French. - Russian.

159
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:30,900
- Does the police in Monaco and foreigners have? - I'm Russian.

160
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:36,775
- I don't work for KGB. - KGB no longer exists.

161
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:38,900
Now it's called FSB.

162
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:43,900
We collaborate with the secret services in Monaco and France.

163
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,942
Yes, of course.

164
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,733
Should Monaco also enter the US?

165
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,775
We can definitely be useful. It's a good news for you. Believe me.

166
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,025
Gate microphone.

167
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,692
- No. - It's an order!

168
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:07,067
Don't do it because you're at the first date, right?

169
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:29,150
- Are you okay, Alice? - Yes.

170
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,942
- Why? - You stayed for a long time.

171
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,275
Can my urinary issues make problems for your boss?

172
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,067
Only in the case of a sexual act.

173
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,983
So we should understand ourselves.

174
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,733
How did you have so many trouble in the US?

175
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,775
As in any bank transactions. I was there the scapegoat

176
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:04,775
It is easier to enter one in front than to criticize the whole system.

177
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:07,525
And what did you do?

178
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:12,108
Just like others. I sold derivatives.

179
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:16,108
- Where were you hit by the crisis? - Should I tell you some numbers?

180
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:20,650
- 700 million. - Because you bought my products.

181
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:25,233
If you had worked for me, would I have put the winnings or losses on your account?

182
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:30,358
You would have lost the dirty money with me and you would have earned some clean.

183
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,567
You're upset.

184
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,150
Why did you mention dirty money? Because I am Russian?

185
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:44,817
I apologize. It was a joke moved.

186
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,067
However, there is a truth in all this.

187
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:56,150
I have no idea where your money comes from, but one thing I know.

188
00:19:56,317 --> 00:20:00,858
The products they sell diminish. The risk, the origin, the volume, everything.

189
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:05,442
Do you wear a microphone?

190
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,233
My specialty is lending to the real estate market.

191
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,775
I hide the situation well and transfer the risks from one to the other.

192
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:18,817
I did not invented the concept. I just use it.

193
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:23,233
- Who had the idea with lunch? - I don't remember.

194
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,775
Something is not good.

195
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:30,608
Craple would not dare to steal the files, but would he dare to put a microphone?

196
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:34,192
Yes, "would be in love"! Are you up to date?

197
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:40,108
We must admit, "not healthy." And in your car there could be microphones.

198
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:52,192
Boris of yours is on a thin ice. It's very strange.

199
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:58,400
He does not do what we ask. It does, but things we do not ask.

200
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,858
I'm afraid he got out of control.

201
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:10,358
- I try to sniff something. - No, it has to be under observation.

202
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,900
The whole mission is already under observation.

203
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,942
Okay. So see what you can collect.

204
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:32,525
Ivan will meet you tonight. Allée des Roses 10 head anti.

205
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,025
The number format is not ...

206
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,608
We will meet tonight. To accept?

207
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:06,025
Not only. Give him understand that someone knows where you are.

208
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:23,275
They arrived.

209
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,150
Continue to be vigilant.

210
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,025
"Be vigilant" ...

211
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,650
- Impossible. - It's my trainee.

212
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:00,817
- I thought ... - Impossible.

213
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:04,108
- He's a discreet guy. - Impossible.

214
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm sorry. You can leave now.

215
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,025
- Toileta. - Thank you.

216
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:17,858
Good evening, Alice to introduce you to my people.

217
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,817
After that, you can teach me about ...

218
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:25,025
- loans on the real estate market. - That's right.

219
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,233
Everything is happening right now. Most likely at Destiny.

220
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,608
"This is our friend." - Don't enter the club after him.

221
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,858
- Wait outside. - Okay. Where are you?

222
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:43,400
We keep in touch.

223
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:48,067
You will have problems if you keep staring at me.

224
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,775
You can create their problems.

225
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:55,442
- Do you know who he is? - No.

226
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:59,733
- Ivan Rostovski. - businessman in the field of meat?

227
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:05,650
Do you think you can cling to him?

228
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:09,733
"Are you with him?" - No.

229
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,358
But it will be the last night. So it is something you can hang on.

230
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:18,275
Aren't you with me either?

231
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:27,775
"Are you Russian?" - Do I look Russian?

232
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:32,567
Why are you here if you are not Russian?

233
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:40,650
I felt that I am full of sins. And the name of the club made my eye.

234
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:47,150
Destiny actually means "fate". Anything can happen here.

235
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:53,400
- Good luck then. - Move, and the same.

236
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:14,650
We need to go now. You will have news from me. Should we drive you home?

237
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:17,567
No, I'll take a taxi.

238
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,150
I lost the carp on the viewfinder.

239
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:40,775
He didn't take a taxi, he simply left. We tried to stay as close to him as possible.

240
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:44,233
We tried as much as we could, but it was heavy traffic.

241
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,275
I lost my sight outside the casino.

242
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:50,525
- And the diamond? - And his shadow also.

243
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:55,150
- Do you know what that means? - Well, don't worry. We find it.

244
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:58,817
- And he follows us. - Find it as soon as possible.

245
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:04,317
I went to his apartment and put some people there.

246
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:11,275
- Good evening. - Good evening.

247
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,317
- Do you go home? - Yes.

248
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:21,358
I would like to hear if fate has brought someone to your way.

249
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:26,400
Not so great. Not so far.

250
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,275
I will find a much more suitable place with my disposition.

251
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:39,483
"How would it be?" - Maybe a bar -named bar?

252
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:44,525
So I know exactly where to go.

253
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:47,150
APOCALYPSE

254
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:02,483
So you ruined a whole world?

255
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,150
I was punished for this ... maybe even more.

256
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:14,817
What crime can cause you to write a biography?

257
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:21,275
I had no idea about what I was doing. Maybe there's something in what I would like to do.

258
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,733
I had a dark thought.

259
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:32,817
Could I tell you something?
