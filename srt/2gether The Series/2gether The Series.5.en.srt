Next week, my seniors' band will perform at the Faculty of Accounting.

They are playing Scrubb's songs.

You can take Pear to see them.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,540
I'll think about it.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,173
Why?

I don't know.

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,459
I like it better when you play guitar.

8
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:21,849
It sounds perfect for Scrubb's songs.

9

I'm not so sure about other bands.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,339
But… I won't ask you to play Scrubb's songs for Pear again.

11
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:38,060
I feel bad.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,970
Asking you to fake flirt with me

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,260
bothers you enough already.

14

It's good that you know.

Great talk, Man. To Man!

168
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,319
- Cheers!
- Cheer.

169
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,379
That was an awesome speech, Man.

170
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,549
Cheers!

171
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,509
I am Tine. Man is right there

172
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,210
and he hasn't said anything for a while now.

173
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,563
Tine.

174
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,380
What?

175
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,709
Are you drunk? Can I touch your boobs?

176
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,343
What?

177
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,599
Are you crazy? What a pervert!

178
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,470
Go!

179
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,303
Be careful.

180
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,959
Fong! Fong!

181
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,479
Hold it until you get home.

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,409
You can't pee there.

183
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,700
Do it here!

184
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,165
Your car is parked over there. This is my car.

185
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04,179
Right there. Give me the key. I'll drive.

186
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,219
Let's go. Let me go.

187
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,069
Tine! Tine!

188
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,279
Tine! Tine! Are you all right?

189
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,243
I am.

190
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,190
Give it here.

191
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,660
Tine. Tine. Tine

192
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,499
- Am I in the car?
- Tine.

193
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:36,965
Get up. Let me get you home

194
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,292
- Let's take them home.
- My car is over there.

195
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,550
Be careful.

196
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,790
Where are we?

197
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,523
Your dorm?

198
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,149
Your dorm?

199
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,660
Fong, we are here.

200
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,800
- Motherfucker!
- Hey, Fong!

201
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,889
Do you want to have a problem?

202
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,630
That's Tine.

203
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,163
Fong!

204
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,029
Come get your friend.

205
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,990
Let me help.

206
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,249
Let me go. I'll kick his ass.

207
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,920
That's Tine.

208
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,370
I'll kick his ass.

209
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,690
Are you all right?

210
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,270
Hell no.

211
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm completely sober because of Fong's foot.

212
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,400
Are you all right?

213
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,399
Wat, are you coming?

214
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,739
- I will look after Tine.
- Okay.

215
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:59,439
Not going back. No way.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,340
Take care of Boss.

217
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,100
- See yah!
- See you.

218
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,559
Aren't you going?

219
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,360
I am walking a nuisance to his room.

220
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,199
You don't have to. My room is just here.

221
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,730
I can walk myself there.

222
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,050
I left my car at the bar.

223
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,020
I can't go home.

224
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,279
Then hurry up and catch up with your friends. They left just now.

225
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,020
Call them.

226
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,489
The battery just died.

227
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,919
- Let me see.
- The battery died.

228
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,090
Let me crash here tonight.

229
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,953
Here?

230
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,030
Let me sleep in your room tonight.

231
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,810
Come on! Let me sleep in your room tonight.

232
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,640
Fine.

233
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,730
Shit!

234
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,969
They are lying everywhere.

235
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,799
Where should I sleep?

236
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,079
Cold. I'm cold.

237
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,299
Are you sleepy? Let's go sit outside.

238
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,630
It's breezy.

239
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,120
Why did you bring a guitar?

240
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,699
Let's practice for the video.

241
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,069
You want me to play now?

242
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm still numb because of Fong's kick.

You're drunk and sang it off-key. And you said you are a Scrubb fan.

256
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,960
Was that off-key?

257
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,089
It was totally off-key. How about we sing again? You'll see.

258
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,340
That was fine.

259
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,139
Do you remember when I said I had something to tell you?

260

No.

Is it true when your mom said you'd never had a girlfriend?

270
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,070
What kind of person do you like?

271
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,133
Pretty one?

272
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,013
Smart one?

273
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,864
Cute one?

274
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,898
No.

275
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:32,995
What kind of person then? That was almost every kind.

276
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,875
Do you like the weird one then?

277
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,805
I must really like a weird person.

278
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,155
And it is so weird that…

279
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,380
the one I like is…

280
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,885
I need to pee.

281
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,799
Fong, it's a balcony.

282
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,069
A bathroom.

283
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,389
A bathroom is right there.

284
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,300
It's inside.

285
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,709
You again? You want a problem?

286
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,205
It's me, Tine!

287
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,260
It's Tine!

288
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,630
♫ I never thought I'd find a good day ♫

289
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,329
The sun has risen. Tine, wake up.

290
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:39,200
Just 5 more minutes.

291
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,814
Tine! My leg is numb.

292
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:46,520
Shit!

293
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,494
You slept on my lap all night and now you swear at me?

294
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,020
What?

295
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:06,659
Why are you still here?

296
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,759
I asked, why are you still here?

297
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,360
I want to have breakfast with you.

298
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:20,545
What are you looking at?

299
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,413
Can I…

300
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,240
grab your boobs?

301
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,390
Are you out of your mind? Damn it!

302
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,409
Go take a shower. I am super hungry.

303
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,013
Stop it.

304
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:46,015
Can I borrow this?

305
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:48,739
Damn it! I'm naked.

306
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,359
I know. I saw it.

307
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,525
You saw it?

308
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:02,699
- Tine, I have good news for you.
- What?

309
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:06,219
There will be a Scrubb's live show at our university in two weeks.

310
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,115
For real?

311
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:11,475
And my band will be the opening act for them.

312
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:15,149
Really? So you get to see P'Ball and P'Muei (Scrubb) backstage, right?

313
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,850
Can you get their autographs for me?

314
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,335
Sure.

315
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,179
What's wrong?

316
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,540
Are you not excited?

317
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,320
You get to be on the same stage with Scrubb.

318
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,215
I am.

319
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,829
But I have a tight rehearsal schedule.

320
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,105
I won't have much time to see you at the Music Club.

321
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:47,249
So we won't see each other for a while then.

322
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,984
How sad! I want to cry.

323
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:52,665
Quit doing that bullshit face.

324
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,070
Do you really think you will have a chance to hit on Pear?

325
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,034
No. Who would think that?

326
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,529
Hey, Nuisance!

327
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,074
Promise me that you will not cheat on me or talk to anyone when I'm not around.

328
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:10,649
Cheat on you? We are not dating.

329
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:17,680
Fine.

330
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,700
I promise.

331
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,043
Okay.

332
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,475
Don't ever talk to Pear behind my back.

333
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,885
If I hear that you hit on her once,

334
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:37,925
I'll grab your boobs once.

335
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,855
Don't ever do it.

336
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:43,394
- Are you crazy?
- No.

337
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:44,689
You're so obsessed with my boobs.

338
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,423
That's true.

339
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,435
Eat. Why are you looking at me? Or else I'll grab your boobs.

340
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,079
Excuse me. Can I sit here?

341
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,219
Can I sit here?

342
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,419
Man, is your dorm around here too?

343
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,160
Do we know each other?

344
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,750
I am Aom. We met last night at the bar. Don't you remember?

345
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,980
At the bar?

346
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:13,470
Just to be sure, did I take you to do something heavenly last night?

347
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,625
No. But I am about to ask you.

348
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:23,650
Do you want to do something heavenly with me?

349
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,200
We all have a hidden power.

350
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,284
Where are you going?

351
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,979
Bathroom. I need to discharge my hidden power.

352
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,554
If I disappear too long, don't wait for me.

353
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:38,725
You are free to go.

354
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,204
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

355
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:51,038
No. Please.

356
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,860
Aren't you going to the bathroom?

357
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,180
No. Discharging the power right here is more heavenly.

358
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,074
Pear.

359
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:19,884
Don't ever talk to Pear behind my back.

360
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,184
If I hear that you hit on her once,

361
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:25,980
I'll grab your boobs once.

362
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,303
Tine.

363
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,724
Can I bother you with something?

364
00:25:33,725 --> 00:25:35,519
Sure.

365
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,649
Listen.

366
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,389
It sounds wrong whenever I strum it.

367
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,740
Am I doing the chord right?

368
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,099
This guitar has very stiff strings.

369
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,035
Sarawat told me that they need to be changed.

370
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:55,989
Is there any shop around?

371
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,400
Around here?

372
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,971
Sarawat told me that the shops around here don't have light guitar strings.

373
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,745
No. I mean I'm buying a new guitar.

374
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:07,930
Buying a new one?

375
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:11,515
You got some time?

376
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:13,890
Can you help me choose?

377
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,494
I have a spiritual poem for those who are feeling discouraged.

378
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:25,009
"With a strong mind, the dispirited feeling will be gone.

379
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,139
You still have tomorrow to live on.

380
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,399
Your failure will be your teacher.

381
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,584
In your hand, that's your future."

382
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:37,019
Strikes right through my heart.

383
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,753
Thank you.

384
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,613
Thank you.

385
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,660
Are you okay, Tine?

386
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,385
I am. I'm just looking around.

387
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,959
What criteria do you use when buying a new guitar?

388
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,224
- The feeling.
- The feeling?

389
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:18,299
Yes. If you feel that this one is right for you, then it is.

390
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,789
It's like love. You don't need a reason.

391
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:24,029
What is right is right.

392
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,635
This guitar must be the right one for me then.

393
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:40,755
Why are you checking it so closely?

394
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,924
- Is that Sarawat?
- What?

395
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,239
- Is that Sarawat?
- What?

396
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,719
Is that Sarawat?

397
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,855
No.

398
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:49,425
You're mistaken.

399
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:52,458
He is. Sara…

400
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:58,014
Pear, look. This case is so beautiful.

401
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,729
Touch it.

402
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,463
What?

403
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:07,289
It's so beautiful. Look.

404
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,639
Aren't they all the same?

405
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,720
No.

406
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,245
Never mind.

407
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,770
Tine, thank you for helping me choose the guitar

408
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,650
and waiting for my mom with me.

409
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,514
It's my pleasure.

410
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:36,348
Thank you.

411
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,839
Should we do some other heavenly things together?

412
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,289
I just realized I got something to do.

413
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,839
If you want to go home, you can.

414
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,260
See you later.

415
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,719
Sir, this seat is already taken.

416
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,064
I think he already left.

417
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:58,160
Left?

418
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,664
Yes. Someone dropped this.

419
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,965
I think it belongs to him.

420
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:04,933
Thank you.

421
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,374
[Faculty Building]

422
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,730
Here you are.

423
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,049
Looking for me?

424
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:22,485
I just want to see if Law cheerleaders can beat Political Science cheerleaders.

425
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:27,519
Who are you looking for?

426
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,724
Wat can't be here. He has guitar practice.

427
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:32,589
Who told you I was looking for him?

428
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,300
I'm looking for my friends.

429
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:42,974
Since we are here, let's take a photo and capture the moment.

430
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:44,609
Your skin is so bright.

431
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,849
Send it to me.

432
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,683
Okay.

433
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:49,444
Good luck and see you.

434
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:51,445
I hope you're qualified.

435
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,259
Your friends said you had guitar practice.

436
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,293
I bailed on it.

437
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:03,515
How did you know that I was here?

438
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:11,525
Here to see U Cheerleader qualification. Law is the best!

439
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,935
I knew it.

440
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:18,450
A bunch of girls here but they wanted to take a photo with me.

441
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,840
Those guys were just messing with me.

442
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:25,465
Messing with you or with me exactly?

443
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,445
What do you mean?

444
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:30,978
Forget it.

445
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,850
Why don't you clean your face?

446
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,510
I want to but the makeup is waterproof.

447
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,825
It won't come off.

448
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,690
You go around with a makeup remover in your bag?

449
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,335
It is for you.

450
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,345
Ouch! Can you be gentle? You're plucking my eyebrows.

451
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:16,895
Did you hit on anyone when I wasn't around?

452
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:21,179
No. Of course not.

453
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,755
Who would I hit on?

454
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:35,605
The names of our university cheerleaders are out!

455
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:38,839
Tine, you are enlisted.

456
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,003
- I am?
- Yep!

457
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,620
I am tired. I don't want to practice for the U Cheerleader.

458
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,395
Isn't it good?

459
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:52,949
You will get to wear makeup more often.

460
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,019
Sarcastic much?

461
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,375
Give me the remover.

462
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,539
I can use it next time.

463
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,849
No. It's mine.

464
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,924
Why are you being stingy? You're such a hog.

465
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,859
I'll clean the makeup for you after every show, all right.

466
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,069
Now stop complaining. You're annoying.

467
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:18,188
Face up. Turn this way.

468
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:28,578
Done.

Thank you!

My hubby, Sarawat. Your wifey has brought you snacks.

472
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,634
What possessed you? Why did you bring me snacks?

473
00:32:57,635 --> 00:33:00,085
And when did I become your husband?

474
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,840
I actually wasn't going to buy it for you.

475
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,360
But I did anyway to say I was sorry.

476
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,920
Sorry that I teased you before.

477
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,553
Teased me about what?

478
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:17,445
I think I just found the one.

479
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:23,325
Now I know how it feels to meet the person we like.

480

But I don't know who he is or where he lives.

481
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:34,435
I don't even know his name.

I don't know if I will ever get to see him again.

483
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,010
What do you think I should do?

484
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,905
Should I give up?

485
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,510
If you really are my best friend,

486
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,835
you know the answer.

487
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,430
Give me my snacks.

501
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,960
Pissed at me?

502
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,030
No. I was talking to my friends.

503
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,454
Bye then.

504
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:36,188
I am so pissed!

505
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,879
You already told that to your friends.

506
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,520
I wasn't telling them. I was telling you.

507
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,853
What?

508
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:02,660
Passed out right after hanging up.

509
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,050
And he said he wasn't drunk.

510
00:36:05,055 --> 00:36:06,770
Time for revenge.

511
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,210
I am going to post all the pics in his phone.

512
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,089
Your mom said you'd never had a girlfriend.

513
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,954
What kind of person do you like?

514
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,910
Do you like the weird one?

515
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,990
I must really like a weird person.

516
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,390
And it is so weird that…

517
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,545
the one I like is…

518
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,025
Wat typed this. I'm helping him just because he sucks.

519
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:50,799
Is there anything going on between you and Sarawat?

520
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,834
Are you crazy? Of course not.

521
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:57,984
Are you telling me that he created an IG account and followed only you,

522
00:36:57,985 --> 00:37:01,019
and his phone is full of your pictures…

523
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,189
all of this is just a plan to flirt with you to fool Green?

524
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,100
That's right.

525
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,059
Do you really think he actually likes me?

526
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,004
And what about this message?

527
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:15,090
What does he want to say?

528
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:20,029
Is it a code that only you two know?

529
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,554
No.

530
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:24,524
He must have typed it when he was drunk.

531
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:27,165
Why hasn't he deleted it yet?

532
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:32,240
Is it short for something?

533
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,439
It's easy guys.

534
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,239
Just google it and find out. Change the language first.

535
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,909
Sorry.

536
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,590
Wait! Keep on typing.

537
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,599
"I loke you."

538
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,233
What?

539
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,639
Wait!

540
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,959
Sarawat always makes typos.

541
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,309
Look here. "O" and "I" are close.

542
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,175
Maybe he wanted to say he liked you.

543
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,525
He likes me?

544
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:22,399
Hello.

545
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,814
I washed your football jersey.

546
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,860
So?

547
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,339
Nothing. Where should I give it to you?

548
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,749
No need.

549
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,550
I will go get it myself.

550
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,285
Hello.

551
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,629
Are you drunk?

552
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,819
Where is my jersey?

553
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,453
There.

554
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,673
Wait!

555
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,498
What?

556
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,049
A senior at the club asked to see our video.

557
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,550
I grabbed an extra guitar here just in case.

558
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,515
But if you can't right now, let's…

559
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,033
You okay?

560
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,189
Hi, guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic.

561
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,959
The person next to me is Sarawat.

562
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,210

564

581
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,665
Thank you.

582
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,979
Bye now.

583
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,523
Sit down first.

584
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,535
I…

585
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,440
I will seriously be hitting on Pear.

586
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,350
Did you hear what I said?

587
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,614
I said I will seriously hit on Pear.

588
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:28,284
You will hit on her.

589
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:29,919
So I'm just your secret lover?

590
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,753
Wait!

591
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,625
Should I act heartbroken?

592
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,850
Should I cry?

593
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,859
What is wrong with you?

594
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,960
I just want to have a girlfriend. Why are you…

595
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,750
You are reserved.

596
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,580
Don't ever hit on anyone.

597
