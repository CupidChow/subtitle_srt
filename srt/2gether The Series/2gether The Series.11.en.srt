Not really.

00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,810
It's just that we haven't celebrated

I'm good. Nothing is troubling me.

You said you wrote a love song.

What's it called?

You said you had never had a girlfriend.

35

Have you ever had a crush on someone though?

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,380
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

75
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,906
That's my business.

And now you won't get to hear things about P'Type.

Do you have any updates on P'Type?

He has an internship program.

But I'm not sure whether it's in Chiang Mai or Bangkok.

82
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,280
He seems to be interested in the one in Chiang Mai.

How do you know?

Let me guess.

He doesn't want to be near you.

You're wrong.

Tine said P'Type will do the internship here in Bangkok.

How did you know?

92
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,446
I prayed to god.

You're credulous.

- Where?
- The Club.

You can sit beside me.

How come you have time for a trip?

It depends on who is on the trip.

Well, this trip is a waste for you.

Aren't you going to ask how I know that you were here?

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,460
There's only one coffee shop near my workplace.

Trust me. It's worth it.

138

You can buy a brand-new book.

Excuse me.

140
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,200
Have you seen the cute guy sitting right here just now?

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,593
He left.

- Left?
- Yes.

171
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,620
Green?

172
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,053
You.

173
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:38,720
Come on. People are planting.

174
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,980
- Can you do it?
- Sure I can.

175
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,150
What are you doing?

176
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,973
Here.

177
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,766
Naming our tree.
[Nuisance Tree]

178
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:19,766
I can tell which tree is ours in case I come back here ten years later.

179
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,520
Do you really think we will last ten years?

180
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,366
Maybe not.

181
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,880
I want to be with you more than that.

182
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,386
- I told you to take it off.
- But I don't think so!

183
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:44,909
- Take it off!
- No! Trust me!

184
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,730
If you can't... tell me.

185
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,740
It's okay.

186
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,790
What's wrong?

187
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,190
I've got dust in my eyes.

188
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,890
I'll get you some water.

189
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,460
Thanks.

190
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,160
What are you doing?

191
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,166
Well, you left him.

192
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,329
Give me your hands. Wash them first.

193
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,800
Your hands are all dirty.

194
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,900
You aren't wearing the bracelet?

195
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,309
What? It was here a second ago.

196
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,813
Did you just bury it with the tree?

197
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,634
Are you sure you wore it here?

198
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,666
Sure.

199
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,113
Where is it?

200
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,500
Just leave it.

201
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,513
I can make you a new one.

202
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,220
But I want the old one.

203
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,093
I am sorry.

204
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,400
Don't worry. It's just a bracelet.

205
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,120
Give me your hands.

206
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:01,553
Is it too much if I say bad things have been happening to us lately?

207
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,059
It's nothing. It's going to be okay.

208
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,293
Okay?

209
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,739
We can look again.

210
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,610
It might be near.

211
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,530
Are you sure you didn't forget it in the bathroom?

212
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,600
I am.

213
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,240
P'Dim, have you seen a bracelet around here?

214
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,671
- What does it look like?
- Like this.

215
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:33,600
No. Where did you last see it?

216
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,133
Don't know.

217
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,787
Have you guys seen a bracelet like this?

218
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,110
No.

219
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,680
No.

220
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,100
May I sit here and read with you?

221
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,710
You read Sunset at Chaophraya. Really?

222
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,226
Why so surprised? I am in love.

223
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,150
I want someone in my life.

224
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you interested?

225
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,013
Can I have some?

226
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,600
Where are you going?

227
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,452
I am turning in my report. But the Wi-Fi inside is weak.

228
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:20,940
I am stepping outside.

229
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,419
I am not going anywhere. I am charging my phone right here.

230
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,547
- Watch it.
- Okay.
- I'll wait for you here.

231
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,360
What are you doing?

232
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,159
I'm getting my phone back.

233
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,279
I left it with the guy sitting right here.

234
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,560
That is my friend's phone.

235
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,780
I am sorry.

236
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,320
Okay.

237
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,570
I am going to get back at you, P'Type.

238
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:05,260
With the help from you all and the volunteers from different clubs,

239
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,833
our tree planting activity is now beautifully completed.

240
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,983
Give yourself a big hand!

241
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,220
Wait!

242
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,790
We still have lots of fun activities for you to join.

243
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,510
And now we are going to test your bravery.

244
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,580
You will go into the woods in pairs,

245
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,460
light your candles and pray to the pine tree spirit.

246
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,804
I'm telling you. The pine tree spirit is a holy and very haunted figure. Super haunted.

247
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:41,400
A senior from our U went to pray with his lover.

248
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,100
Their candles couldn't stay lit.

249
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,499
The two of them broke up in the woods immediately.

250
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,646
What? You guys don't believe me?

251
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:53,519
No?

252
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,560
Let me tell you. That senior is me.

253
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,460
And who did you go with?

254
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,699
- That was a long time ago.
- It wasn't me.

255
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:03,439
Green, drop it!

256
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,920
The story isn't over.

257
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,480
Can you guess what happened after I came back?

258
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,889
The pine tree spirit was angry that I didn't keep the candle lit and pray.

259
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,520
He haunted me in my dreams saying I needed to come back here and complete the ritual.

260
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,640
I couldn't take it anymore.

261
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,910
I couldn't sleep.

262
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,130
I had to have the pine tree tattooed on my back to make amends.

263
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,886
After that, he left me alone.

264
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:47,450
If you don't want to have the same fate as me,

265
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,850
try your best keep your candles lit.

266
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,970
To be fair,

267
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,800
you guys will draw numbers.

268
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,300
Any two of you who get the same number will go together.

269
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,680
Sarawat, you first.

270
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,519
Hurry up. Same number only.

271
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,026
Tine, come on out.

272
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,686
I'll open it for you.

273
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,023
What number?

274
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,750
Here. It's yours.

275
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,005
You got number 9.

276
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,738
Number 9?

277
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,020
Mine is 9 too.

278
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,379
- Hey! How is it possible?
- There are many people here.

279
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:43,930
Well, I don't know.

280
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,970
Maybe the spirit wants us together.

281
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,413
I know you're plotting a mischievous plan against us tonight.

282
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:51,973
What do you want?

283
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,140
Tine has been stressed out lately.

284
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,680
Just help me.

285
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,320
It might help us get to pray to the spirit together.

286
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,040
I got number 9 as well.

287
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,300
A hot coffee for you.

288
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,600
Are you still working?

289
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,193
Can I sit here and read with you?

290
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,110
Do whatever you want.

291
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,180
Just don't bother me.

292
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,986
Loving you is kind of bothersome?

293
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,743
Man!

294
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,520
Peekaboo! Are you looking for me?

295
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,849
What are you doing?

296
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,820
You said not to bother you. Isn't it good?

297
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,040
It will be better if you disappear.

298
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,369
No way. I will haunt you every day.

299
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,820
I will stick with you no matter what.

300
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,100
I can follow you for the rest of my life.

301
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,730
Did you ask me if I want to be followed?

302
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,800
We will see about that.

303
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,533
You'll have to miss me if I don't show up one day.

304
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,693
Just back off.

305
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:50,910
I'm leaving. Do not follow me.

306
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,010
Give me some time to miss you.

307
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,980
Fine. I won't follow you.

308
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,360
See you tomorrow.

309
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,940
Flat tire?

310
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,000
You've got a flat tire.

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Do you have the equipment? I can fix it for you.

312
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,911
No need. I just found a garage nearby.

313
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,560
That's pretty bad.

314
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:37,410
What is with him?

315
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:43,640
Super flat.

316
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,080
Where is the equipment?

317
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,093
The door is not locked.

318
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,053
Here you go.

319
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,973
How did you do it?

320
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,191
You didn't lock your doors.

321
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,466
You got full equipment inside.

322
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,560
I guess nothing needs to be done here.

323
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
Thank you for coming.

324
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,500
Take care.

325
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,993
Here.

326
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,605
- For me?
- Do you see anyone else?

327
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,540
Totally worth it.

328
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,873
Thank you.

329
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,546
Almost done.

330
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,720
Done!

331
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,419
You've got something. Here.

332
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,603
This side.

333
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,300
Are you finished?

334
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,493
Just one second.

335
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

336
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,580
I have my way to decide.

337
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,253
Give me that box.

338
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,130
All of us will draw again.

339
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,726
You first.

340
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,580
Are you afraid of me?

341
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,290
The guys that hurt you are my friends, but I dealt with them for you.

342
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,074
I won't let someone I like to get bullied again.

343
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,860
I said I am sorry.

344
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,900
What else do you want from me?

345
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,260
Take him away from my boyfriend.

346
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,400
He is hitting on Tine there.

347
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,339
This is a very bad time to flirt.

348
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,000
You'll see. He will be embarrassed in front of your boy.

349
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,533
Shit!

350
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,351
It's okay. Just a fake one.

351
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:54,180
He is grabbing my boyfriend's shoulder.

352
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,799
I am praying to you, the pine tree spirit…

353
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,000
You all close your eyes!

354
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,900
Please grant me my wish.

355
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,086
Please make it come true.

356
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,613
Why is it out?

357
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,373
It's nothing.

358
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,550
Close your eyes.

359
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,593
The spirit doesn't like it when you pray with your eyes opened.

360
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,200
What the heck are you looking at?

361
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,403
What?

362
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,180
There is no wind blowing.

363
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,280
How come it's out again?

364
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:06,360
Is it because of the pine tree spirit?

365
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,099
Nonsense.

366
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,993
Let's try again.

367
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,534
Now you guys see his power?

368
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:22,680
Close your eyes. Otherwise, you are doomed!

369
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,513
Shit!

370
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,084
I'm telling you. The pine tree spirit is a holy and very haunted figure.

371
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:48,240
Super haunted.

372
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
Don't think too much.

373
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,646
It's not your fault.

374
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,220
Don't be sad, all right?

375
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Let's go to bed.

376
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,400
We have to get up early.

377
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,090
I'm going to turn off the light.

378
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,460
Get some sleep and stop thinking about it.

379
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,893
Goodnight.

380
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,010
[Shelter 1]

381
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,380
Why is it so cold in here?

382
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,566
Can you sleep, Tine?

383
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:48,950
I apologize for what I've done wrong.

384
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,453
What?

385
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,680
You just have to die now, don't you?

386
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:54,900
Shit!

387
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,763
Tine!

388
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,586
Tine!

389
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,580
He was here.

390
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,820
What do we do?

391
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,300
I look this way. You go that way.

392
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,840
Yes.

393
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,746
- Tine!
- Shit, it's raining.

394
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,640
- You go back to the camp…
- Tine!

395
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,180
Sarawat!

396
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,260
Tine!

397
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,820
You go that way then.

398
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,560
Tine!

399
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,479
Tine! Tine!

400
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,940
Where the heck are you?

401
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,473
Tine!

402
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,393
Tine!

403
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,426
Tine!

404
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,323
Tine!

405
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,000
Damn it!

406
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,413
Is it too much if I say bad things have been happening to us lately?

407
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,740
It's nothing.

408
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,410
It's going to be okay.

409
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,843
Tine!

410
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,660
Are you all right?

411
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,846
Come here. Get up slowly.

412
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,433
Let me help.

413
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,880
Does it hurt?

414
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,160
It's pouring now.

415
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,140
Let's get on the bus.

416
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,020
We will wait until the rain stops.

417
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,706
I am sorry.

418
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,233
It's just that we have faced many bad things recently.

419
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:28,130
I just didn't want it to get worse.

420
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,330
I caused a problem again.

421
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,780
Don't be sad about it.

422
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,706
The shrine you just set fire to was fake.

423
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,860
P'Dim made it all up just to mess with us.

424
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,860
As for the bad things that happened to us, it might be because of me.

425
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,980
Why?

426
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,193
I prayed for something.

427
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,390
But I haven't redeemed that pray yet.

428
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,426
What did you ask for?

429
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:14,079
It's… if I got to see you again,

430
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,646
I would show you the video I made.

431
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,046
It's the song Your Smile you are so curious about.

432
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,340
You won't find it because I renamed it.

433
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,380
That's why.

434
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,350
Hello. Test. Test.

435
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,846
- Are you recording, Boss?
- Just hold on.

436
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,460
Do you think he will like it?

437
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,940
Not just like. He will love it. Trust me.

438
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,700
Hi. I am Sarawat.

439
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,433
I…

440
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,049
I saw you at the Scrubb concert today.

441
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:08,279
Your smile makes me want to play this song for you.

442
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,013
It's…

443
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,680
What next?

444
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,733
You forgot the script?

445
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:15,473

After that, I went to every Scrubb concert…

460
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,580
just to look for you.

461
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,540
But I didn't find you.

462
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,000
Man told me to pray to God.

463
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,753
And if I ever saw you again, I had to show you the video.

464
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,150
That's the story.

465
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,479
But I was to shy to show it.

466
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,370
I actually have something to say to you.

467
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:21,300
But it might get stuck in this video forever.

468
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,420
I like you.

469
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,113
Yeah. I know.

470
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,760
I like you, too.

471
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,820
It's great that you prayed for it.

472
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,426
That made us together today.

473
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,680
The wish only drew us to cross paths again.

474
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,059
Us being together is because of something else.

475
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,620
What then?

476
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:07,973
Let's start from my squad who helped me since the day we met again.

477
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,699
I was losing my mind.

478
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,099
I found him!

479
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,206
I found him!

480
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:14,349
I finally found him!

481
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:16,009
Who?

482
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:20,340
The guy I just talked to is the one I like.

483
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,953
The one I like.

484
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,353
Great!

485
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,946
But I…

486
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:33,289
I just told him I would kiss him till he dropped.

487
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,413
He just emailed me!

488
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,800
His name is Tine.

489
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,320
What a cute name!

490
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,039
- Don't get too carried away.
- Give it here.

491
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,484
Your typos will ruin it.

492
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,839
- Let me reply to him for you.
- Give it back.

493
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,493
- Wanna see?
- Yes.

494
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:57,780
I just said how could he be so horny that he asked for sex via email.

495
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,369
He is going to hate me! Why did you say that?

496
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,660
Isn't it good?

497
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,760
That way he will never know that you like him.

498
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,545
- You're a psycho!
- You're a psycho!

499
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:14,669
Please. Just enlist him in our Music Club.

500
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:17,790
We have enough beginners in the club.

501
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,906
Why do we need one more?

502
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,489
Is there something I don't know?

503
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,223
He…

504
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,980
He is the one I like.

505
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,733
Shit!

506
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,620
You can't tell him I like him.

507
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,779
Let's suppose that I'm flirting with you.

508
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:44,499
What should I say when I take you home like this?

509
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:47,500
Goodnight, I guess.

510
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,149
See you later.

511
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:51,253
Get home safe.

512
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,050
Tine, goodnight.

513
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,459
I'm going to create an IG account to hit on him.

514
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,659
What is it called?

515
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,493
How about… LoveTine?

516
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:09,109
Dickhead! Why don't you just name it FuckTine then?

517
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:11,329
I got one.

518
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:12,899
Sarawatlism.

519
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:14,679
It's cool.

520
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:17,059
It's like an obsession.

521
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,945
People are obsessed with Sarawat.

522
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,593
I like it.

523
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,030
What will you choose?

524
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,403
LoveTine.

525
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,620
Sarawatlism is way better.

526
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,006
Tine doesn't want to see me.

527
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,319
He thinks I like someone else.

528
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,460
He must be talking about Earn.

529
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,673
The music video of you two is all over the place.

530
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,226
But Earn has a boyfriend.

531
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,973
Tine doesn't know that, does he?

532
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:57,520
He is sulking.

533
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,720
Does it mean he likes you?

534
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,320
That's impossible.

535
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,039
It's about time for you to talk to him.

536
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,713
Tell him that you met him before.

537
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,849
You get it now?

538
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:16,406
Us being together…

539
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,906
is not a coincidence.

540
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,486
It's because of us.

541
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,273
Stop overthinking it. Okay?

542
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,030
The rain has stopped. Can you walk?

543
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,710
Let me help.

544
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,280
I am okay. It doesn't hurt that bad.

545
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,973
Oh?

546
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,253
I almost carried you here.

547
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,390
♫ A million stars floating above the sky ♫

548
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:17,723
I think… nothing bad is going to happen anymore.

549
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:25,760
♫ They refuse to orbit anywhere, you always see at least one ♫

550
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,219
It's so beautiful.

551
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,053
Yeah.

552
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,130
♫ But all the stars are far apart ♫

♫ I don’t know when it started or who started it exactly ♫

555
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:06,720
♫ I don’t know if you came into my life or I came into yours ♫

556
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:15,530
♫ Maybe it’s just a coincidence, maybe it’s not,
I still can’t figure it out ♫

557
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:24,220
♫ All I know is that the one in my heart is you ♫

558
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:29,810
♫ I don’t want anyone to come between us,
we will stay side by side ♫

559
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,510
♫ Wherever you are, I’ll be right next to you ♫

♫ I own the space beside you,
