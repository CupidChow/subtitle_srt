What the heck are you doing?

6
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:22,566
I said I would flirt with you.

7
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:26,560
I will flirt until you agree to be my boyfriend.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,780
I know that. I just didn't think you would be flirty in here.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,019
Why? Are you blushing?

10
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:36,600
Or…

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,540
are you actually falling?

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,579
Falling, my ass. Bye.

13
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,029
Hey! Wash your hands first.

14
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,310
I forgot.

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,345
You think you're so hot, don't you?

16
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:08,250
I don't want to see my girl like your posts ever again.

♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,510
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,530
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

21
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,110
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

22
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,440
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,690
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and unconsciously
fell in love with you ♫

24
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:12,210
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

25
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,080
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,120
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,340
♫ Just being able to love you, I can't force
myself to forget about you ♫

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,519
We are having final exams in a month.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,700
So we decided to temporarily withhold our club activities.

31
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,740
So that you guys will have more time to study.

32
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,960
Before we leave today,

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,060
I have an important survey for you to fill out.

34
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,200
Answer honestly.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,030
What do you feel about our Music Club?

36
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:00,473
I have a reward for the best answer.

37
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:04,650
The one giving the worst answer will stay here with me a bit longer.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,320
Damn you!

39
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:13,900
Give the right answers!

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
What do you write about me in the last question?

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,140
Nosy!

42
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,510
I bet you wrote down something bad about me.

43
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,750
Let me see.

44
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,440
- I want to see.
- No.

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,306
It's mine.

46
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:46,020
Can I have a volunteer to share your answers?

47
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,313
- Whose answers do you guys want to hear?
- Sarawat!

48
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,270
Like I needed to ask.

49
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,699
Wat! Come here and read out your opinion.

50
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,040
Loud and clear.

51
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,150
Start with how do you feel about the Club President?

52
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,460
Don't compliment me too much. I hear it a lot.

53
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,010
A club president is a holy figure.

54
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,460
People treat him with respect, but no one wants to be friends with him.

55
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,890
What the heck are you laughing at, Air?

56
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,590
I admire your honesty. Very good.

57
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:38,120
Let's move on. What chord do you like the most?

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,310
C chord.

59
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,880
Why?

60
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:48,310
It's the first chord I taught Tine to play.

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,940
Too much love around this place.

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,190
And the last question.

63
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:01,820
What do you feel about your video partner?

64
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,650
Answer nicely. I'm helping you here.

65
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,370
For me…

66
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,380
Tine is a living thing…

67
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:13,730
that I want to call 'nuisance' for the rest of my life.

68
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,700
I'm jealous.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,640
What's up?

70
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,214
People in #SarawatsWives group said you guys shared a sweet moment in the Music Club.

71
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:33,140
Nothing sweet! He just wanted to call me a nuisance in front of people.

72
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,900
I guess you haven't seen what P'Dim posted on his IG.

73
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,480
What IG?

74
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,260
Look.

75
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,140
Sarawat's answer sheet.

76
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,786
What do you feel about your video partner?

77
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,890
"Tine = Wife."

78
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,290
That's why he didn't let me see what he wrote.

79
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,119
I don't get it. Why is he still hitting on you?

80
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,150
Green is not after you anymore.

81
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
Why can't you look me in the eyes?

82
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,833
Is there anything we don't know?

83
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,920
- So?
- No. Nothing.

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,510
High pitch voice. Will you tell us right now

85
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,690
or should we go ask him?

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,420
Fine.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,380
He said he truly likes me.

88
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,300
And he is hitting on me for real.

89
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,710
Just what I thought.

90
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,260
What about you? What do you feel about him?

91
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,150
Nothing much.

92
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,790
When I'm with him, my heart is light and weak.

93
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,180
When I listen to Scrubb songs with him, the songs sound better.

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,460
And when he gets his face close to mine,

95
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,290
my heart pounds like crazy.

96
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,640
But I guess that's normal. Right?

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,960
Normal, my ass!

98
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,006
All the things you said…

99
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:13,000
are signs of someone falling in love.

100
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,970
You're right.

101
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,510
So have I fallen for him already?

102
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,290
Don't rush it.

103
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,730
You might just be shaken by him.

104
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,440
Every time you were in a relationship, you were the one taking care of your date.

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,520
But now you are being taken care of and pleased,

106
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,780
it's normal to be shaken.

107
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,272
Especially, by someone looking that hot. Right?

108
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:43,404
It's our fault for getting you close to him.

109
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:48,560
Rest assured. We will go check out hot girls and recall your player soul back.

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,093
Tine.

111
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:54,869
Don't look at him. Let's go.

112
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:56,560
Come.

113
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,660
Don't look back.

114
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,960
Have you seen Phukong?

115
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,670
We have an extra class here, but he hasn't shown up.

116
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,930
I heard from his friend that he is sick.

117
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,520
He might be resting at his place.

118
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,419
You miss him, don't you?

119
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,060
What? Did I just hit the spot?

120
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,119
It's good that he skips class. I will go home and sleep then.

121
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,720
Go then.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,900
Bye.

123
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,570
Where are you guys dragging me to?

124
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,730
This is far enough from Sarawat.

125
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:41,180
We are not running away from Sarawat.

126
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,970
We are here to check out hot girls.

127
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,619
- Check out girls?
- Yes.

128
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:49,530
Here?

129
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,960
Tine likes someone cute, fair-skinned, and tiny.

130
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,970
You don't know anything.

131
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,940
The final exams are coming up.

132
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:03,040
A lot of hot girls gather here to study.

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,959
Wait a second. Is that Wan, the Freshy Girl from the Law international program?

134
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,040
I follow her IG account.

135
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,930
She looks so damn cute in person.

136
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,570
Really?

137
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:20,099
We are Law students from the regular program.

138
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,040
Would you mind if we sit here and study?

139
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,559
Sure. We are done reading. The seats are all yours.

140
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,950
What?

141
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,013
It's okay, man.

142
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,380
Are you Tine?

143
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,080
Yes. You know me?

144
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,560
How can I not know a university cheerleader?

145
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,930
Do you usually come here to read?

146
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,220
Do you want to join us next time?

147
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,760
Why are you doing nothing?

148
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,614
Take out your phone and get her Line ID.

149
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,293
- Line?
- Hell yeah!

150
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,550
Here.

151
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,680
Whenever you want to study, just tell us.

152
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,160
We are always ready for you.

153
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:14,100
We are a bunch of nerds.

154
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,070
Take it back.

155
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,940
I'll Line you.

156
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,240
Once a player, always a player.

157
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,060
You get back on the field for two seconds and already get a girl.

158
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,120
Post it online and let Sarawat know that you have a new girl

159
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,440
so he can stop flirting with you.

160
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,325
- Wait a moment.
- What now?

161
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:49,429
- Shit!
- What?

162
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,191
- What?
- Someone already posted something.

163
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:54,149
- Who?
- Where?

164
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,790
This Saturday, my friend is going to beat Engineering.

165
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,840
and someone is going to post a love confession to him online.

166
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,860
Man?

167
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,700
Hey!

168
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:10,040
When did my friend say he would post a love confession to your friend?

169
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
I didn't mention any names in the post.

170
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,600
What makes you think I was talking about your friend?

171
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,220
We don't know that.

172
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,900
But what we know for sure is that your friend is hitting on my friend here.

173
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,753
Don't mess with his head like that.

174
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:27,090
Who is messing with his head?

175
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,010
No one is.

176
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,410
I posted it because I am very sure that we will win.

177
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,993
You can't be too confident.

178
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,040
Your opponent holds six championship cups.

179
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,200
So?

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,310
We are going to break that record.

181
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,960
If you don't think we can, you don't need to panic.

182
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,830
Fine. If you guys win,

183
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,100
my friend will post a love confession to your friend.

184
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,780
If you lose, Sarawat will have to leave my friend alone.

185
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,420
Deal?

186
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,843
I think…

187
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:04,520
your friend here is going to have to prepare a sweet love confession for me.

188
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,880
[P'Mil]

189
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,350
Hello?

190
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,639
- Chat told me you are sick.
- Yes.

191
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,451
I can't attend the tutoring class with you for a while.

192
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,804
That's okay. Chat told me your address.

193
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:30,259
He got it from your application.

194
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,979
I will meet you there and assign you some homework.

195
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,084
You don't have to.

196
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,571
- I'm almost there.
- What?

197
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,278
See you.

198
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,950
What a coincidence!

199
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,390
Someone I hate lives around here, too.

200
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,706
His name is Sarawat.

201
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,343
Do you know him?

202
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,953
I don't.

203
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,229
I don't come here very often.

204
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:17,230
Whose football jersey is this?

205
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,039
My brother's.

206
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,040
What Faculty is he in?

207
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,726
The Faculty of…

208
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:25,000
He wears number 12.

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,650
It reminds me of that jerk Sarawat.

210
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,033
The Faculty of…

211
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,820
- Poli…
- Political Science?

212
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
No.12 from Political Science is Sarawat.

213
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,810
How are you related to Sarawat?

214
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,252
The thing is… my brother is having a football match against Political Science.

215
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:51,599
So I tried to find Political Science football jersey to burn just to jinx them.

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,949
Really.

217
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,430
You are such a great little brother.

218
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,340
You picked the right number.

219
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,393
Anything that belongs to Sarawat should be burned to the ground.

220
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,720
That's right. Burn them all.

221
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,020
Burn them all.

222
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,830
[Faculty Building]

223
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,926
We are at the checkpoint.

224
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,299
Stop and boost your energy, guys.

225
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,550
- Thank you.
- Me too.

226
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,259
That's not refreshing enough.

227
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,513
Try this.

228
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:56,740
Man!

229
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,086
You did it again!

230
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,779
Man!

231
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,786
- Refreshing, isn't it?
- It's sticky.

232
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,026
That girl is cute.

233
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,180
Don't look at him.

234
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,089
Don't look.

235
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,790
Don't let him mess with your head.

236
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,623
Go.

237
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,260
They scream for you again.

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,620
I did this once.

239
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,831
- Taking off your shirt?
- Yes.

240
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:38,725
Girls screamed their lungs out for me.

241
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,390
Don't play it again.

242
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,073
What? It was fun.

243
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,300
Your trick to get Tine to confess is superb.

244
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,439
Why can't you apply that to your love life?

245
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:57,239
Do you want to get beaten up?

246
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,399
My own plan is in progress.

247
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,139
I got my hand on his phone.

248
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,519
Now I have both his number and Line ID.

249
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,779
There is one problem though.

250
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,639
He is not single?

251
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,559
I'm not brave enough to call.

252
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,399
If I were a cute little girl, I wouldn't worry.

253
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,630
I am a handsome young man.

254
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,940
I'm sure he would freak out if I called.

255
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,289
Not a problem. Just create a fake Line account.

256
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,799
- Fake Line account?
- Yes.

257
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,600
Make it up?

258
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,833
Good idea.

259
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,980
Who should I be?

260
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,619
It's brilliant, Boss!! Thank you so much.

261
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,719
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't know who I should pretend to be.

262
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,559
You are super clever, my friend!

263
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,310
I know now who I'm going to be.

264
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,479
Are you pretending to be Wat?

265
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,226
Wat My Ass!!

266
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,953
Great plan!

267
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,869
She is so cute.

268
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:09,269
If I were him, I would definitely want to talk to her.

269
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,309
You want to talk to every cute girl.

270
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,346
Let's see if he's easily deceived like you.

271
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,909
- I'm going to start now.
- Yes.

272
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,319
Sawasdee Ka.

273
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,319
Are you P'Type, the one who likes to go to business seminars?

274
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,239
How do you spell 'Ka'?

275
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:36,400
K and A.

276
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:40,466
Yes.

277
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,300
Who is this?

278
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,400
He replied so quickly.

279
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,560
My name is Earn. I am a freshman.

280
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:57,270
I see you at several seminars so I think it would be great

281
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,720
if we can exchange knowledge.

282
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,899
Sure. I am happy to help if I can.

283
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:09,179
I told you he is friendly.

284
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,649
Right? Earn is pretty.

285
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,600
If I were him, I would be friendly too.

286
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,989
What's next?

287
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:21,679
I need some information for my report.

288
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
Can I have an interview with you..?

289
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,679
Wait!

290
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,069
You talk to him for 5 minutes and now you want to see him?

291
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:31,939
Is it weird?

292
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,773
Of course.

293
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:36,619
Okay. I'm going to delete it then.

294
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,649
Delete.

295
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,340
Shit!

296
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,099
I just hit send! Can I unsend it now?

297
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,466
No! He read it! He is quick!

298
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:48,573
What do I do, Boss?

299
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,369
Shit!

300
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,870
This can go in two directions.

301
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,099
He might answer that question.

302
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,099
Or he blocks your account completely.

303
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,659
Block?

304
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,980
You sound like a pervert.

305
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,300
Damn it!

306
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,849
Let me see her picture again.

307
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,273
Knock it off.

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,829
So Tine isn't Sarawat's boyfriend?

309
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:20,753
Sarawat is going after him but he doesn't care. Right?

310
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:21,766
Is that so?

311
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,599
I've been misunderstanding.

312
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,510
That's why I didn't reach out to you.

313
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,173
I was afraid Sarawat would get jealous.

314
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:29,279
Don't be afraid.

315
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,986
My friend likes a cute little girl with fair skin just like you.

316
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,312
The library will be closed this Saturday.

317
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,119
Where should we study?

318
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,849
How about Tine's room?

319
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,470
It's available. He lives alone.

320
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,750
We can study as long as we like.

321
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,000
Study?

322
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,300
Sounds good.

323
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,970
This Saturday, I have to go watch…

324
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,106
Education is more important. Right?

325
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,280
We should study.

326
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,520
See you guys at Tine's place on Saturday then.

327
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,420
Okay, okay.

328
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,789
- My room?
- Yep!

329
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,565
I told you to deactivate your IG.

330
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,566
Why is it still there?

331
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,779

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,739
How can you still be calm?

502
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:25,773
Or are you preparing yourself for defeat?

503
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:27,159
Sure.

504
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,580
Of course.

505
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,533
Goal!

506
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,189
Engineering holds a one-nil lead.

507
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:44,949
That goal was brilliant.

508
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:46,569
Engineering has the ball again.

509
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,070
Will Political Science stand a chance?

510
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,099
Super Bright! Super Bright!

511
00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:56,659
Super Bright just defended the second goal.

512
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:57,799
Engineering got a throw-in.

513
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,829
Super Bright!

514
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:04,039
Super Bright!

515
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,039
Hey! Why are you here?

516
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,373
Why aren't you studying with Wan?

517
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:11,153
Tine!

518
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,463
Tine!

519
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,640
What is happening?

520
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,390
This last minute, Super Bright got the ball inside the penalty area.

521
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,620
Will he make it?

522
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:39,540
Sarawat goals!

523
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,033
- That was brilliant.
- Foul!

524
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,606
The referee calls a foul.

525
00:32:44,606 --> 00:32:47,259
Political Science didn't score.

526
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,504
That goal doesn't count.

527
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:49,539
It was a hard tackle there.

528
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,800
The Engineering player was injured.

529
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,119
And that is the time.

530
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,959
Engineering, the former champion beats Political Science one-nil.

531
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,519
They are to defend their title again.

532
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,419
If you guys win, my friend will post a love confession to your friend.

533
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,030
If you lose, Sarawat will have to leave my friend alone.

534
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,249
Deal?

535
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:15,780
Political science will have to fight for the second runner-up title with Architecture.

536
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,545
Great job!

537
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:20,840
Great job, referee.

538
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:26,470
What a pleasant result!

539
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,453
Your plan to come and distract him last minute was awesome.

540
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,160
He can't bother you anymore.

541
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,750
We need to celebrate.

542
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,250
I already booked a table for us.

543
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,999
You guys go ahead. I'll catch up with you later.

544
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:46,659
Why?

545
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,620
Are you…

546
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,452
going to change first?

547
00:33:51,453 --> 00:33:53,919
That's great. It's the jersey of a loser.

548
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,210
Hurry up and meet us at the bar.

549
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,953
See you.

550
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,889
If you lose, you need to leave me alone.

551
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,800
It doesn't mean I need to leave you alone.

552
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:28,353
Whenever I'm down, Scrubb songs are my therapy.

553
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,290
Just listen.

554
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:37,120
♫ Look up to the sky of a new day with a blank mind ♫

555
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,225
♫ Forget about bad days ♫

556
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:45,066
♫ Sad days that passed ♫

557
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,105
♫ We take on a journey ♫

558
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:50,839
♫ We've been through things together ♫

559
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,979
♫ Sometimes we make mistakes ♫

560
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:01,980
♫ When I feel discouraged, you are here comforting me ♫

561
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,939
♫ I know ♫

562
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,073
♫ I can give you anything ♫

563
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:11,934
♫ As long as I have you on this journey ♫

564
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:14,000
♫ No matter how long ♫

565
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,220
♫ I am right here ♫

566
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,110

577
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,906
When is your next match?

578
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,986
Why are you asking?

579
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,853
You can't come cheering anyway.

580
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,800
I watched the playback.

581
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,230
That was not a foul.

582
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,399
The referee made a mistake.

583
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,870
Let's not count this match.

584
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,270
You still have one more game to fight.

585
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,160
Super Bright?

586
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,200
Whose jersey are you wearing?

587
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,786
My teammates challenged me to screen the physical appearance of the one I like.

588
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:02,536
The one with super bright skin is not me.

589
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,120
It's you.

590
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,733
Little buffalo.

591
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,660
Why don't you just call me an albino buffalo then?

592
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,060
I'm going to go now.

593
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,580
Albino buffalo!

594
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,180
Where are you going?

595
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,913
Albino buffalo!

596
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,979
- Thank you.
- Wait!

597
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,619
It's mine.

598
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,169
You're still sick.

599
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,666
You are so mean.

600
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,280
I have to go.

601
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,380
I will give a comment on your work tomorrow.

602
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,089
What is wrong now?

603
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm dizzy.

604
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,086
I'm about to faint.

605
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,540
I think you need to drive me home.

606
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,720
I don't think I can drive.

607
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,409
It's your car. You drive.

608
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,746
I can't, seriously.

609
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,969
You must do it.

610
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,506
I think I'm going to pass out.

611
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,879
Fine.

612
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,190
You are such a baby.

613
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,740
Give me your car key.

614
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,460
Thanks a lot.

615
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,332
What?

616
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,183
I forgot my headphones.

617
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,200
I think I left them on the football field.

618
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,550
I'm going to go back and get them.

619
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,183
Okie dokie!

620
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,920
Dickhead!

621
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,260
You said you felt dizzy.

622
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,039
How about you drive yourself home? Here.

623
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,239
Nope! I have a headache.

624
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,510
- Headache, headache.
- Asshole.

625
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,979
I'll be right back.

626
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,266
Headache, headache.

627
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,910
Was it you who messed with my friend?

628
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,340
What the hell are you guys doing?

629
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,819
Watch out!

630
