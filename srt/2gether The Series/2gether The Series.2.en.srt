Sorry.

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,009
A presentation is about to start.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,650
Why don't you come tomorrow?

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,340
We are late because we were talking to those girls about you.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,270
They wanted to have my Facebook or Line ID. Right?

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,329
They wanted to know about your "wanting to eat Sarawat" status.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,079
How hungry were you, really?

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,329
I told you a thousand times that I didn't post that.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,429
Sarawat did it.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,380
I have no idea how he got my password.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,099
The first group, are you guys ready to present?

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,349
We are.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,199
But may we have a second? We're having a problem connecting to the projector.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,589
Ohm, can you go borrow the cable from next door?

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,230
- Me again?
- Yes.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,050
Was Sarawat delicious?

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,310
Sarawat, how did you know my lock screen password?

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,619
You set a dumb password, 1 2 3 4 5 6.

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,270
Even a little kid can find out.

21
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,240
Saraleo! Stop messing with my Facebook account.

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,600
Do you even get what I mean?!?

"Sexy Uni Girl in Classroom."

24
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,890
Saraleo!

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,330
I am sorry for being loud, professor. Shit!

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,263
Damn it!

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,339
Shit! Since when?

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,339
Since your dumb password.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,300
I wanted to tell you but it was so pleasing that I couldn't stop watching.

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,400
Guys, I got a new cable.

♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

33
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,360
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,000
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,360
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:05,500
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and unconsciously
fell in love with you ♫

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:14,060
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,970
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

40
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,050
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

43
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,270
Tine, can I ask you a question? Do you like Sarawat?

44
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,309
Of course not. I like girls.

45
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,830
What a relief!

46
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,120
I saw you joined Team Sarawat's Wives Group

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,430
and you posted you wanted to eat him. I was in shock.

48
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,440
My friends were just messing around.

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,869
Are you afraid I will be taken?

50
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,789
I am afraid Sarawat will be taken.

51
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,970
It's all good now. See you later.

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,433
Here.

53
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,669
You better hurry and get his phone fixed

54
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,219
before your image is completely ruined.

55
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,260
You don't usually have one to keep anyway.

56
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,440
Hey! I do, all right?

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,730
Does he think he will get away with this so easily?

58
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,389
Are you getting revenge on him?

59
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,460
No. I'm going to get his phone fixed.

60
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,610
Sir, do you think you can fix this one?

61
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,090
Let me see.

62
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,970
Not hard! Yo! Yo! I can fix it!

63
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,803
You can?

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
It can't be turned on.

65
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,599
I think the battery is dead.

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,333
Battery is dead?

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,660
Yikes!

68
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,529
What is that smoke?

69
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,869
An electric shock, I guess. Yo! Yo!

70
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,460
- It's nothing. I can fix it.
- You sure?

71
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,549
Not hard! Yo! Yo!

72
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,880
It's not hard to fix?

73
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,260
It's not hard to give up and throw away.

74
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,550
Yo! Yo!

75
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,280
May I recommend a new one?

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,420
Yo! Yo!

77
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,530
I'll give you a special price.

78
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,010
- This one?
- Yes.

79
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,050
I'm sure you'll love it.

80
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,630
Yo! Yo!

81
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,090
It's a triple-sim phone.

82
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,030
3 SIM? Who would I call?

83
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,863
Girls.

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,579
Is there any other shop around?

85
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:05,280
This one is smaller and its battery lasts longer than your previous one.

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,119
Plus, a charger here.

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,370
The battery will be fully charged in no time.

88
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,589
I am sorry.

89
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,619
I will ask my mom for money and buy you a new one. Okay?

90
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,420
Don't need to. I already bought a new one.

91
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,660
You did?

92
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,840
Why did you want me to fix your old one then?

93
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,210
Because you needed to take responsibility for the damage.

94
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,270
Here is your phone.

95
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,800
Wait! I need to talk to you about something.

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,649
But I don't.

97
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,389
Please. It will take me less than 10 seconds. I promise.

98
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,520
I give you 5, 4, 3, 2…

99
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,453
Be my boyfriend.

100
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,940
What on earth did you just say?

101
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,130
Not a real boyfriend.

102
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,720
Just pretend that you like me.

103
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,719
I've been followed around by someone.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
So I need you to be my shield.

105
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,270
Why? Is she not pretty?

106
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,230
It's a guy but I like girls.

107
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,979
What's wrong with that?

108
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,960
It's good that someone admires you.

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,369
It's not good.

110
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,060
I don't like people to get too involved with my personal life.

111
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,719
You will never know.

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,170
Someday you might want someone to be a nuisance in your life.

113
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,089
That's funny.

114
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,949
I know you don't like people to invade your private life either.

115
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,190
There is one anyway.

116
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,913
One?

117
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,480
Where?

118
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,040
It's you! You're such a nuisance in my life.

119
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,773
Me?

120
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,200
You let him go just like that?

121
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,160
How stupid!

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,219
He said that to my face. What would you do?

123
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,299
Right, Fong?

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,560
Right.

125
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,500
Phuak is right.

126
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,839
You don't have his number. How will you contact him now?

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,760
You're silly!

128
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,929
Ohm, go ahead and yell at me like these two just did.

129
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,790
- Shit!
- That's it?

130
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,389
I wasn't talking to you.

131
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,874
Someone posted a video of Sarawat in a closed group.

132
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm sure we will get something out of this.

133
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,390
- Sarawat, what club will you be joining tomorrow?
- I don't know.

134
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,540
What kind of activity do you like?

135
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,435
We might be in the same club.

136
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:09,155
Football, archery, planting, meditation, boxing, fencing…

137
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:13,149
Why doesn't he mention scuba diving and coral planting, too?

138
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,230
Scuba diving and coral planting too.

139
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,500
See? Let's not watch it.

140
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,569
It gets me frustrated.

141
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,524
I think I just found you a way.

142
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:28,255
If you can get in the same club he's in,

143
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:31,660
- you'll get to see him more often.
- That's right.

144
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,230
There's one problem though. We don't know which club he's going to join.

145
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,165
Right.

146
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,444
That is easy.

147
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:42,909
A senior called him this morning

148
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,294
and told him to go rehearse in the music club.

149
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,129
Music club?

150
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,589
You know and you just sit here making a dumb face?

151
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,670
What a dumb ass!

152
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,270
I don't know what to call you, really.

153
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,950
You give me a headache.

154
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,215
My head hurts! It really hurts!

155
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,259
But I can't play any musical instrument.

156
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,154
Get into the club first and think about it later.

157
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:12,109
We will apply too and help you talk to Sarawat.

158
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,535
Hot freshmen over there, do you want to join Swimming Club?

159
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,360
- We do.
- Hold on!

160
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,940
What about our Music Club?

161
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,160
Music Club.

162
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,940
Swimming Club?

163
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,573
What?

164
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:52,810

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,943
Yeah?

329
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,945
Chord C now.

330
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:25,678
Like this?

331
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,019
It sounds weird. What did you do wrong?

332
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,335
Try it again.

333
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:40,360
What kind of strings are they?

334
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,550
This is painful.

335
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,700
Cooking Club always welcomes you, Tine.

336
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,009
I heard that Music Club was cruel to you.

337
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,750
They gave you an old guitar to practice.

338
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,709
I was so shocked.

339
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,999
I am more shocked that you know about this.

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,550
I know everything about you.

341
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,130
Move to my club and you will get to eat delicious food every day.

342
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,500
Look.

343
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,840
I made this especially for you.

344
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,600
Thank you for your concern but I am okay.

345
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,105
I need to get back to the club.

346
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:27,405
Tine, don't go!

347
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,215
Wow! Tine, you seem really determined.

348
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:41,029
I will do whatever it takes to be in this club.

349
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,663
What?

350
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:49,230
I mean I will keep practicing hard.

351
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,509
I will play a song eventually.

352
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,055
That's good.

353
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:58,010
But what you played earlier was all wrong.

354
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:02,370
No worries. You still have time.

355
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,410
You will get better.

356
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,608
We have no time.

357
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,259
Why is that?

358
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,910
The university board doesn't allow more club members than we agreed on.

359
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,769
This Friday, newbies have to go through a test.

360
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,670
Those who fail will be out of this club.

361
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,340
What chord are you playing exactly?

362
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,635
What chord is it?

363
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:38,350
I don't know either.

364
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,620
P'Dim, are you being serious? Do we have any other way?

365
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,149
No.

366
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,750
And don't be too nice to freshmen.

367
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:50,335
The test will be on Friday. Don't forget to practice.

368
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,629
Tine, you're still here.

369
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,895
Yeah. I don't have a guitar of my own.

370
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:00,864
So I think I will play on a bit more.

371
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:04,485
You guys can go.

372
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,150
I like your determination.

373
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,935
But what you're playing is still wrong.

374
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:17,975
Thank you for your advice.

375
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,530
Enjoy your snacks. From Team Sarawat's Wives.

376
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:11,809
I am not stealing.

377
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,800
I am just protecting your snacks from anyone who wants to steal them.

378
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,363
Wrong!

379
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,603
Wrong!

380
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,789
Can your fingers work properly?

381
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,190
Press harder. Wrong!

382
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:45,540
I can't press any harder.

383
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,423
Here.

384
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,130
What?

385
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,660
My guitar. Its strings are better.

386
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,360
Try it.

387
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,630
It's okay.

388
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,265
Just take it. Now play it.

389
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,615
It's right this time.

390
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:14,534
Does it hurt your fingers?

391
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:15,839
No.

392
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,510
That's good. Keep practicing.

393
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,845
Now try chord D.

394
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,219
How do you do chord D?

395
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,953
Move over.

396
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,300
Your middle finger on the second fret, fifth string.

397
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,750
Your ring finger on the second fret, fourth string.

398
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,604
Your point finger on the first fret, third string.

399
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,690
Now play it.

400
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,470
Memorize it so I don't have to teach you again.

401
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,323
Play on.

402
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,394
What are you looking at?

403
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:51,745
I'm just wondering why you aren't in the Faculty of Music since you're so good.

404
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,740
I play because I enjoy it.

405
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:59,249
I'm afraid that if I actually learn it,

406
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,550
it won't give me pleasure anymore.

407
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,230
I do what I like by heart, not by duty.

408
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,785
What are you still looking at?

409
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:46,450
I'm begging you. Please help me.

410
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,600
Just pretend that you like me.

411
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:58,800
So you're in this club because of this?

412
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,930
It's not like that.

413
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,010
It's…

414
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:08,125
It's…

415
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,600
Yes! I admit it.

416
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,549
Now that you know it,

417
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:20,389
please help being my fake boyfriend.

418
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,050
Are you saying yes or no?

419
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:46,270
[Faculty Building]

420
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,055
Sarawat is here.

421
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,300
Record a video.

422
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,995
He is so cute.

423
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,090
Let's take a selfie.

424
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,960
Let's take a selfie with him in it.

425
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,630
Sarawat…

426
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,810
Hey, Sarawat, can you...

427
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:20,079
Have you seen a guy who comes to practice here every day?

428
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,580
I haven't seen him. He might be finding himself a new club.

429
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,940
I don't think he will pass the test.

430
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,359
P'Dim wants to see you in the storage room but I have no idea why.

431
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,310
Don't forget to go.

432
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:19,230
Hey! Is that you, Nuisance?!?

433
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,619
Do you think I will give up that easily?

434
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,704
If you want to get out, you have to be my fake boyfriend.

435
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,620
Deal your own problem.

436
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,900
Let me out.

437
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,749
Up to you then.

438
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,609
Sleep tight in there tonight.

439
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,600
Hey! Are you threatening me?

440
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,700
Do you want to get hurt?

441
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,225
- Do you think I'm afraid?
- Tine!!

442
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,850
Are you in here? I think I just saw you.

443
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:54,700
You won't get out of Music Club because you're afraid of your seniors. Am I right?

444
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Don't be. I have friends from the Bodybuilder Club just to help you.

445
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,990
Let me deal with the seniors for you.

446
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,840
Open, please.

447
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,975
Tine! You don't want to be in that club.

448
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:15,610
Just resign and join Cooking Club with me.

449
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,685
(Don't say anything.)

450
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:27,670
I know that someone is in there.

451
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,830
If you don't open the door, I will.

452
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:47,430
What are you doing here so loud?

453
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,440
I was sleeping in there? Who are you here for?

454
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,520
In there?

455
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,600
Yeah, why?

456
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,659
I'm looking for Tine. Have you seen him?

457
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,493
Tine?

458
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:04,329
No.

459
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,814
Really?

460
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,550
I'm going to continue my sleep. Anything else?

461
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,720
Nope. Sleeping in a cabinet?

462
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:17,905
Sorry for bothering. Bye-bye.

463
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:29,745
Tine! Tine!

464
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:31,990
Come out, Nuisance.

465
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,625
That was close. Thank you so much.

466
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,395
I didn't want to help you.

467
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:46,249
I just didn't want to get involved in your business.

468
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,775
It's a good idea to change the club.

469
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:54,130
You won't pass a test for Music Club.

470
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,130
What if I pass?

471
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,130
If I pass, you have to be my fake boyfriend.

472
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,320
Deal.

473
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:06,215
If you do, I'll help you.

474
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:11,425
But if you fail, you have to leave me alone.

475
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,158
Deal.

476
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,865
You told him you would stop bothering him if you failed?

477
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,860
Yes. I didn't have time to think.

478
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,729
Who would think he'd challenge me back like that?

479
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,749
Can I call him and cancel the deal?

480
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,340
It's too late now. The test is tomorrow.

481
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,684
You don't have a guitar, do you?

482
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:38,580
I don't. Are you buying me a guitar?

483
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,530
I am.

484
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,480
A guitar practicing app.

485
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,690
I just downloaded it for you.

486
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,544
You are so stingy when it comes to friends.

487
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:52,265
You can buy this but can't buy me a guitar.

488
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,860
Come on. We don't have a guitar for you,

489
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,479
but we promise to stay with you all night.

490
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,330
- We won't yawn.
- Won't lie down.

491
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,163
Won't sleep.

492
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,304
You guys can go back to your rooms actually.

493
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:20,270

Thirty years since this club was founded,

you're the only one who dared to do this.

Get out! Next!

Wait! I am sorry.

507
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,640
I really want to be in this club.

00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,850
Can I have one more chance? Let me play again.

He kept playing with that old guitar with hard strings.

That's right.

513
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:48,755
I think we should give him one more shot.

514
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,030
Wat, bring out your guitar for him to play.

He did it within a week.

I don't.
