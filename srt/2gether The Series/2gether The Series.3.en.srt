1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Cheers!

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,719
Tine, what did you do to make Sarawat help you?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,129
Did you give him some kind of special service?

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,000
You are gross!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
I have no idea. He changed his mind all of a sudden.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,109
He might think being flirtatious in front of Green is not going to ruin his reputation.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,879
It's not like he has to flirt in front of his fans.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,480
I guess so.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,700
I need you guys to help me with something.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,780
Sarawat will be at his faculty tomorrow morning.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,149
You guys need to tell Green that I will be there.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,979
Tine!

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,989
Your friends told me someone's been hitting on you. Is that true?

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,523
True.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,823
Sarawat.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,000
A guitar is for you to play…

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,200
but I am for you to love.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,469
You can compete for anything with anyone

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,259
but you can't beat Sarawat when it comes to love.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,259
No!!!

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,359
That's not true.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,699
There?

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,729
There where?

24
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,630
In front of his faculty.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,800
Where exactly?

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,759
In front of his faculty building where there is a parking lot.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,099
Then there is a road.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,019
When you cross it, you'll see his faculty building.

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,319
Ah!! The parking lot.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,140
Right.

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,780
Isn't that at the back though?

32
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,999
I will share you guys the exact location.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,869
Can you do it now?

34
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,749
I want to see where.

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,549
Damn it!!

36
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,120
You pieces of dumb shit!

37
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,379
5, 4, 3, 2, 1…

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,969
Tine!

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,770
Good morning…

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,260
Where is Tine?

41
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,189
- He is where his heart belongs.
- Wait!

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,219
You said the same thing at the same time?

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,529
Is this some kind of a plan?

44
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,540
It's not a plan!

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Really!

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,969
So where is Tine?

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,019
Tine!

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,084
Your friends told me someone has been hitting on you.

49
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,120
Is that true?

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,010
You can see for yourself.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,120
Sarawat.

52
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,863
Hey!

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,193
Hey!

54
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,979
Hey, Tine…

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,659
Are you trying to make me jealous?

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,909
God! You are such a cutie.

57
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,180
Don't worry. I won't be jealous because I know you belong to me.

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,220
Come on. Let's go.

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,800
[2gether the Series]
[Episode 3]

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,950
♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

61
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,890
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,830
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

63
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,560
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,960
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:00,470
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and unconsciously
fell in love with you ♫

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:08,550
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

67
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,530
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

68
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,570
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

69
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:24,880
♫ Just being able to love you, I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,420
♫ I've fallen in love with you, I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

71
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,839
Sorry.

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,829
I didn't know you wanted me to start being flirtatious already.

73
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,980
I didn't pay attention.

74
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,269
Because of you, Green was stalking me for almost an hour.

75
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,999
It was hard to sneak away.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,269
So what do you need me to do?

77
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,670
You just don't know anything, do you?

78
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,629
Do it like when you hit on girls.

79
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,159
Buy me snacks and drinks. Take care of me.

80
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,960
Something like that.

81
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,043
Got it.

82
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,609
What? Green is not here.

83
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,009
Just freakin' take it.

84
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,560
Someone bought it for me.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,830
I will have it all then.

86
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,400
Your fans are so kind and caring.

87
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,729
Are you Tine?

88
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,270
Where is Wat? I saw you two talking just now.

89
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,220
He went that way.

90
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,819
Thanks.

91
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,869
His fans bought him lots of ice cream.

92
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,579
- Do you want one?
- That's okay.

93
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,749
He just gave me a snack from his fans.

94
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,139
That can't be right. He bought that from a shop himself.

95
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,509
You're mistaken. I have to go before these ice creams melt.

96
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,949
No snacks!

97
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,340
Food first.

98
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,869
Why are you here?

99
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,819
To have lunch with you.

100
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,870
I skip my faculty event just to come to see you.

101
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,289
- The Faculty of Humanities is having an event?
- Yes.

102
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:19,479
There is a charity auction on used stuff from hot girls from my faculty.

103
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,909
The event is about to start.

104
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,149
- You guys can go. I can stay with Tine.
- You don't have to.

105
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:28,399
My friends might be jerks,

106
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,319
but they won't leave me for those girls. Right?

107
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:37,479
I made you a lunchbox.

108
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,440
I put all the effort I have into this.

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,089
Look how cute it is.

110
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,469
Oh my god!

111
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,470
I am so surprised I can even do this.

112
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,339
Sarawat, don't go.

113
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,050
Do you understand my signal?

114
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,060
Help me.

115
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,889
Sarawat! Help! Don't leave me.

116
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,629
Let's try it. Come on.

117
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,940
Open your mouth.

118
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,190
Here is your lunch.

119
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,749
- Can I have this?
- I already drank it.

120
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,163
So?

121
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,009
You were exaggerating it.

122
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,879
Green thought that you were just pretending.

123
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,979
It didn't look real.

124
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,229
It was how people flirted in the series I saw. What do you want me to do?

125
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,030
What series do you possibly think we are in?

126
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,129
The Nuisance…

127
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,999
and the Handsome Prince.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,150
I was just being sarcastic.

129
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,069
You are so dull at flirting.

130
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,990
Haven't you been in love with anyone before?

131
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,270
Are we all here?

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,919
Go back to your professional zone.

133
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,960
This zone is for new waves only.

134
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,839
Where have you been?

135
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,510
We have fewer members now

136
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,560
so we will all practice together.

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,059
Be focused and don't let your weird music distract me.

138
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,590
- I need to rehearse.
- Weird music?

139
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,989
- I don't play weird anymore.
- You think?

140
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,309
That's wrong. You need to press harder.

141
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,309
My fingers can't press any harder.

142
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,019
Do you have a guitar with less stiff strings?

143
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,889
You need to put up with it for now.

144
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,679
When we get the new allowance, we will buy a new one.

145
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,249
Do you have any recommendations for guitar strings?

146
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,879
I will change them for the time being.

147
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,629
If you prefer a clear sound, I recommend Elixir.

148
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,879
If you prefer a soft and deep sound, go for D'Addario.

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,799
Da… what?

150
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,229
D'Addario.

151
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,319
D'Ad… da… ri… o

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,753
Got it.

153
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,359
Guys.

154
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:25,169
Before you leave,

155
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,899
I need to inform you of two things.

156
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,619
Firstly, our club will have a music show called Altermajeeb.

157
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,369
You need to advertise that.

158
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,639
Many cool bands will perform at this event,

159
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,770
especially the band called Sunshine, Daisies, and Butter Mellow.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,419
That's a band name?

161
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,020
It sounds like an essay topic.

162
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,489
That's my band. Do you have a problem?

163
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:54,540
I don't.

164
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,660
Secondly, there will be a small evaluation

165
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,030
for those who are in guitar class.

166
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,059
Skillful players record themselves playing a song.

167
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,230
Beginners record themselves playing basic chords and send it to me.

168
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,139
Sucky players will be criticized on social media.

169
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,169
If you don't turn in the video,

170
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,209
you will be kicked out of this club.

171
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,050
If you get it, now go home.

172
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,030
Play it like I taught you, Tine.

173
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,370
Keep fighting.

174
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,349
Wat, where are you going after this?

175
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,930
Why? Are you asking me on a date?

176
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,370
No. Can you go buy D'Addario strings with me?

177
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,770
I think maybe the flirting was awkward

178
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,760
because we are not close enough.

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,829
We might need to spend more time together.

180
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,030
So you're asking me on a date in a guitar shop.

181
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,939
No need to beat around the bush.

182
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,989
A date is a date.

183
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,479
Sorry though.

184
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,299
Shops around here don't have the strings you want.

185
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,240
They don't?

186
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,750
What should I do? I need to practice.

187
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,360
I have a guitar with soft strings that I don't play very often.

188
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,539
Seriously?

189
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,989
Can I borrow that one to record a video?

190
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,723
Sure, on one condition.

191
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:38,830
What is it?

192
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,960
Come to my place.

193
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,759
Get the guitar from my place.

194
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,560
Okay.

195
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,043
Come in.

196
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,903
Come in.

197
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,050
Are you sure this is not a haunted house?

198
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,749
There is one. Right there.

199
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,510
Shit! Don't say that!

200
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,039
I was just kidding.

201
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,880
You have me here. It's nothing to be afraid of.

202
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,130
Right! You're the one who likes to tease me the most.

203
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,020
Is that the guitar?

204
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,820
I'll grab it and go.

205
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,909
- Give it here.
- What?

206
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:34,100
- It needs to be tuned first.
- It does?

207
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,899
Or do you want to do it yourself?

208
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,560
Of course, you can't.

209
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,880
What song will you record and send to P'Dim?

210
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,120
Don't know yet.

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,180
How about "Close" by Scrubb?

212
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,615
I love this song.

213
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:18,070
You listen to Scrubb's songs?

214
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,753
Yeah. Why?

215
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,250
Scrubb is my favorite band.

216
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,979
My brother put their music on all the time when I was a kid.

217
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,240
Do you only listen to Scrubb or what?

218
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,080
No.

219
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,490
I listen to other bands too but they just aren't like Scrubb.

220
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,690
How?

221
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,740
If you listen to Scrubb's songs when you are happy,

222
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,560
you will be even happier.

223
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,630
If you listen when you are in love,

224
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,830
you will be more deeply in love.

225
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,179
What if I feel sad? Will I be more miserable listening to their songs?

226
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,669
No.

227
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,499
If you listen to their songs when you are sad,

228
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,709
you will feel better.

229
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:11,790
It's like someone is comforting you.

230
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,760
What about you? What bands do you like?

231
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,533
Me?

232
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,410
I bet you don't know them.

233
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,459
Don't underestimate me.

234
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,380
I know every band in Thailand.

235
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,880
- Just say the name.
- Desktop Error.

236
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,090
Are you talking about a band or a computer?

237
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,040
Harmonica Sunrise.

238
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,510
The Connect.

239
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,130
Moving and Cut.

240
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,780
Name Thai bands.

241
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,310
These are all Thai bands.

242
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,790
You should listen to other bands, too.

243
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,409
Sorry. I will.

244
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,680
But for now, play "Close" for me.

245
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,229
What are these?

246
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:25,279
The chords of the song you want me to play.

247
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,450
Does it look easy?

248
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,259
Are you done tuning?

249
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,089
Tuning? All I did was talk to you. I haven't even started.

250
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,570
Can I borrow that one to record then?

251
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,663
Thanks.

252
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,899
Will it be done by tonight?

253
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,649
Hold on.

254
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,929
Can it see my face?

255
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,069
Your face, not mine.

256
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,703
Yeah?

257
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,999
I will start now.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,410
Don't tell me. Tell the camera.

259
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,930
Hi, guys. I am Tine, Mr.Chic.

260
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,320
I am just the cutest thing!

261
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,799
I am going to play basic chords.

262
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,720
Let's start with C.

263
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,183
Wrong.

264
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,689
Don't interrupt me. I am recording here.

265
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,940
But it was wrong. P'Dim won't let you pass.

266
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,269
It didn't sound wrong to me.

267
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,220
I'm playing C chord. See?

268
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,929
Here.

269
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,280
Your ring finger has to be here.

270
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,680
What you just did was F major 7.

271
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,133
Now play it.

272
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,860
This is C chord.

273
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,243
Remember it.

274
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,263
Thanks.

275
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,010
So this is C chord, guys.

276
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,510
I am recording here.

277
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,970
Why are you tuning now? Why didn't you do it earlier?

278
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,540
Do you want it or not?

279
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,180
Wait until I finish.

280
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,340
Be quiet.

281
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,013
Thank you.

282
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,493
Tune it now.

283
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,720
Where is my drink?

284
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,710
Hold on. I only have two hands.

285
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,433
Wait!

286
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,849
How did you know I like this drink?

287
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,900
Of course, I know.

288
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,010
I am a member of #TeamSarawatsWives…

289
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,070
You joined that group, too?

290
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,760
Do you want to be my wife?

291
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,250
I joined in just to get your info.

292
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,850
Are you done tuning?

293
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,340
Done.

294
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,113
Wait.

295
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:02,730
I will use this one to record.

296
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,570
- Sit down.
- I've waited for hours.

297
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,300
A bit more waiting won't kill me.

298
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,980
You said you didn't want to play this song.

I am done recording. You can go.

314
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,570
Thanks for the snacks.

315
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,320
Once I got new strings, I'll return your guitar.

316
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,963
Wait.

317
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,879
Let's suppose that I'm flirting with you.

318
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:45,660
What should I say when I take you home like this?

319
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,240
Goodnight, I think.

320
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,079
Why do you ask?

321
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,729
Nothing. Just asking.

322
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:03,439
Don't worry. You will never have to take me home in front of Green.

323
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,480
Bye now. See you later.

324
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,790
Get home safe.

325
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,679
- Goodnight, Tine.
- Hello.

326
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,850
Hi, Tine.

327
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,060
Sarawat, you brought Tine home?

328
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,110
What did you say?

329
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,780
What is with him?

330
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,940
[Faculty Building]

331
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,079
Tine, come here.

332
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,219
What did I do wrong now?

333
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:56,939
So wrong. Look.

334
00:22:56,939 --> 00:23:01,029
After your club president posted this video, everyone went crazy.

335
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:05,610
People were wondering why you were with Sarawat in his room.

336
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,069
He doesn't even allow his own friends inside.

337
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:13,249
#TeamSarawatsWives must have set the price for my head by now.

338
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:16,550
Calm down.

339
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,050
Look on the bright side,

340
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,830
at least Green has stopped bothering you.

341
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,370
Did he come to see you this morning?

342
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,110
See?

343
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,289
You are right.

344
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,299
Sarawat is very helpful.

345
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,829
We have a reason to celebrate. How about this evening?

346
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,059
Sounds good?

347
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,350
- This evening?
- Yes.

348
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,709
I am not available.

349
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,129
What? Come on.

350
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:45,089
It's the first day of cheerleading rehearsal.

351
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,669
I don't really want to go.

352
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:48,619
Don't lie to us.

353
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,429
We know you want to hit on cute cheerleaders. Right?

354
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,229
Nah! I only do this for our faculty.

355
00:23:56,229 --> 00:23:58,199
You guys know that.

356
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,095
Here. Get this, you asshole.

357
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,439
Ready!

358
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:07,764
Ready! 3, 4!

359
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:10,479
I should have gone with them.

360
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,299
Don't lower your arms. Keep them up.

Faculty cheerleaders are faculty representatives.

If you are not up for it, you can go home.

Break for 15 minutes.

Out of my way!

Sarawat, what brings you to the Faculty of Law?

367
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,730
I came to see Tine.

368
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,149
We practice too hard. I needed an excuse to slack off.

369
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,729
What practice?

370
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:53,430
Soccer.

371
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,179
Soccer? You are a soccer player?

372
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,599
Why? Someone like you can be a cheerleader.

373
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,669
Tine, can I talk to you for a second?

374
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,020
We are borrowing him just for a while, Sarawat.

375

Tine, you know Sarawat?

376
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,169
Kind of. We are in the same club.

377
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,080
Can you ask him a few questions for us?

378
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,080
A group of seniors wants to know something about you.

379
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
What?

380
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,329
- What do you like between Rock and Jazz music?
- Jazz.

381
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,149
- Movie or drama?
-Drama . Especially soap operas.

382
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:56,909
- Music or painting?
- Painting.

383
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,419
That's it! You are lying.

384
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,449
I know you will choose music for sure.

385
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:04,000
I answered with what I hate.

386
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,499
I asked you what you liked.

387

They want to know you so they can serve you right.

388

You're such a jerk.

389
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:18,319
Can you choose between me and soap operas then?

390
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,500
I choose you.

391
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,989
What? You hate me more than soap operas?

392
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:25,250
For that question, I answered what I like.

393
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,489
Bye, now. Soccer practice is waiting.

394

00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:19,369
This case is super heavy.

398
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:22,209
And just a moment ago, a house lizard cried when I walked by.

399

A bad thing must be happening to me.

400

You're overthinking it. Green has gotten off your back already, hasn't he?

That's right, but I still feel weird.

I am sure a bad thing is going to happen.

People in guitar class, I have good news for you.

Many people in our club moved out

405
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,150
so we recruited new members.

406
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,379
That's it. Do you think it's Green?

Not Green.

So you two already know each other?

That's great. Teach Green basic chords.

You guys are friends. Green can pick it up quicker.

Teach him 8 basic chords. Okay?

I will listen to it and think of Pear.

449

I don't listen to love songs.

450
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:17,840
No wonder you are so terrible at flirting.

451
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,130
You don't know anything about love.

452
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,373
Do you think…

453
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,089
a person who has never been in love can write a love song?

454
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,314
I don't think so.

455
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:37,665
Even if he could, it would sound meaningless.

456
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:41,140
Are you writing a love song?

457
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,980
Something like that.

458
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,949
I get it now. You agreed to flirt

459
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,630
because you wanted some experience to write a song.

460
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,474
Do you think so?

461
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,108
Am I right?

462
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,289
I am telling you.

463
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:02,339
Flirting with me is quite special.

464
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,540
Because I am extraordinary!

465
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Right!

466
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,150
I said yes because you are special.

467
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,795

I don't know. I don't understand it.

You don't need to understand music.

471

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,758
Feel what?

473
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,310
Feel love.

474
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,215
I just played you a love song.

475
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:43,180
I'm going to go now. Take it.

00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,780
so I asked to come and take care of you.

486
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,670
If you want someone to wipe away your sweat or anything at all,

487
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,870
just tell me.

488
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,890
Are you tired?

489
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,319
I know you are.

490
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,230
Let me take care of you. Don't you worry!

Green has been following me around like a shadow.

493
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:41,954
And how can I help you with that?

494
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,020
I'm still in practice.

495
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,894
But I don't want to go back to the cheerleading thing.

496
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:50,749
Look. He wiped my face every second he nearly peeled my skin off.

497
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,730
Please help.

498
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:58,319
Wait for me near the field. I will take you home after practice.

499
00:34:58,319 --> 00:34:59,743
For real?

500
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,275
You will help me?

501
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:04,554
Thank you so much.

502
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:08,500
I will give you anything you want in return.

503
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,373
Let's go.

504
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,305
See? They are together again.

505
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,470
Tine!

506
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:30,080
You're here.

507
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,744
You came to see Sarawat again.

508
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,749
Why are you two always together lately?

509
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,959
Exactly!

510
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,469
What's going on between you two?

511
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,869
Tine was in your room the other day.

512
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:44,599
So the rumor saying Sarawat likes Tine is true?

513
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,059
Just say yes first and deal with them later.

514
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,909
Is there anything going on between you guys?

515
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,249
Green is listening.

516
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,859
Can you ignore your fans for a second?

517
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,830
Just say yes.

518
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,040
Otherwise, my plan will screw.

519
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:02,165
He's just a friend from Music Club.

520
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,329
What a relief!

521
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,239
Let's continue your cheerleading practice.

522
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,710
Sarawat, can we take your photos?

523
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,550
Photos, please.

524
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,830
That order belongs to Sarawat.

525
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,529
I will make you a new one.

526
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,180
That's okay. I can drink this one.

527
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,850
What is wrong with you?

528
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,304
Do you have to ask?

529
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:43,689
What did you tell Green yesterday?

530
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,291
You told me to be flirtatious in front of Green.

531
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,224
- But…
- I know.

532
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:50,649
You were in front of your fans.

533
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,619
But couldn't you just help say yes and deal with your fans later?

534
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,484
Does it mean everyone else can know that I'm hitting on you?

535
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:00,194
Forget it.

536
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:04,099
All you care about is your popularity.

537
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,733
I get it.

538
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,480
You don't get it.

539
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,474
Don't get what?

540
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:13,610
I will make you get it.

541
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:21,934
This girl is pretty.

542
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,119
Pretty what?

543
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,560
Pretty amazing!

544
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,682
We're looking for info for our report, not looking at girls.

545
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:31,879
You jackasses.

546
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,360
We are not looking at girls.

547
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,600
We are finding some info on Instagram.

548
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:41,735
Guys, look!

549
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:46,979
- Nice coffee cup.
- I think so, too.

550
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:49,220
It makes me want to drink coffee.

551
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,120
My freakin' ass!!

552
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,499
I didn't tell you to look at the cup.

553
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,440
Look at the account name.

554
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,444
Do you think it belongs to Sarawat?

555
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,509
He's not the type who is on Instagram.

556
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,509
Shit!

557
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,540
It is really his.

558
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:09,069
His friends keep commenting on his post.

559
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,649
"Sarawat broke his own rule and created an IG account just to hit on someone."

560
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,264
Is that person you, Tine?

561
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:18,259
Not me.

562
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,989
He's blushing.

563
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,665
He humiliated me in front of his fans yesterday.

564
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,949
Really?

565
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,840
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

566
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,749
He cares so much about his fans and popularity.

567
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,364
No. Are you sure?

568
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,619
If he really cares about that,

569
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,519
why would he let a senior post a video of him and you together?

570
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,164
He could have told him to delete it if he didn't like it.

571
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:43,304
I agree.

572
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:47,169
Do you think he has some other reasons why he said that to his fans?

573
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,014
Whatever. Let's do the report.

574
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:51,499
I'm hungry.

575
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,939
He is so blushing.

576
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,624
He suddenly became frustrated.

577
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,740
How cute!

578
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:03,475
This shop belongs to Jae Tun, a former student from the Faculty of Architecture.

579
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,329
No one is taking our orders.

580
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,349
Regular customers don't need to order.

581
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,959
Jae Tun will serve you whatever she feels like it.

582
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,279
Eat if you like. Throw away if you don't.

583
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,979
People usually throw away her food.

584
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,539
Why did you bring us here then?

585
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,789
You have no idea.

586
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,210
The highlight of this restaurant is here.

587
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,704
Jae Tun hires hot girls from her faculty to help run the shop.

588
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:34,110
She has this concept "Gross food, Good girls."

589
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,099
This is strawberry milk with ketchup.

590
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:46,099
This is green tea with red lemon soda.

591
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,809
Thank you.

592
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,925
The last one here is ice-cream with spicy mango sauce.

593
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,739
- Do you want more ketchup?
- Yes, please.

594
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,830
Look at each menu.

595
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,640
Can we go to a new restaurant?

596
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,504
It's called creativity.

597
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,120
Creativity?

598
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:15,060
Look. Sarawat just posted something.

599
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,049
[1 or 2?]
Choose 1 or 2?

600
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,579
- What is it?
- I don't know.

601
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:28,185
If you want to know, ask him in person.

602
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,235
What the heck is he doing here?

603
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,639
P'Dim told him to promote the music event around the university.

604
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,109
Don't mind him.

605
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,109
Let's eat before this place is packed with his fans.

606
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,475
Is this even edible?

607
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:54,415
You said it's creativity.

608
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,003
Go on.

609
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,260
Here's yours.

610
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,700
They look normal and edible, not gross.

611
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:10,689
Someone ordered these for you.

612
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,790
They look normal because they're not on our menu.

613
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,149
Who ordered for me?

614
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,019
I can't say.

615
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,149
Don't ask any more questions. I don't want it to slip out.

616
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,523
It's okay to slip out.

617
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:23,650
Slip out, please.

618
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,433
Who is it?

619
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,709
No idea.

620
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,168
I think I know who.

621
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:35,024
Really? Who is it?

622
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,545
Tine!

623
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:40,649
We haven't met for hours.

624
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,044
Did you miss me?

625
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,769
Stop it, Green.

626
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,194
Why did you order a cake for me? I don't like cakes.

627
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:51,328
Cake? What cake?

628
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:53,685
The cake you ordered for me.

629
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,365
You didn't order this?

630
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,000
Then, who did?

631
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,625
Who ordered a cake for my beloved Tine?

632
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:13,689
Sarawat.

633
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,360
Did you order that cake for Tine?

634
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,344
Yes. I wanted to.

635
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,789
Why?

636
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,104
You said you were just friends yesterday.

637
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:31,385
Friends won't do things like this.

638
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,619
And what did you mean when you said you created an IG account just to flirt with someone?

639
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,129
Did you mean Tine?

640
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,464
Can you make it clear here?

641
00:42:38,465 --> 00:42:40,935
Tell us.

642
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,660
1 or 2?

643
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,019
- What?
- Just choose.

644
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,044
Choose what?

645
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,784
1 or 2?

646
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:55,129
1.

647
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,555
2. means I'm hitting on you.

648
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,429
But Tine chose 1.

649
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,550
That means Sarawat isn't hitting on Tine?

650
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,615
1. means you are hit on… by me.

651
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:13,454
Both 1 and 2 mean I like you.

652
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:15,300
Got it?

653
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,070
WHAT?

654
