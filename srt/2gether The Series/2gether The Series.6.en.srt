1
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:04,293
I will seriously be hitting on Pear.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,040
Did you hear what I said?

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,399
I said I will seriously hit on Pear.

4
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:17,786
You will hit on her. So I'm just your secret lover?

5
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:19,319
Wait!

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,500
Should I act heartbroken?

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
Should I cry?

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,700
What is wrong with you?

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,930
I just want to have a girlfriend. Why are you…

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,660
♫ I don’t know when it started or who started it exactly ♫

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,600
You are reserved. Don't ever hit on anyone.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,380
♫ I don’t know if you came into my life or I came into yours ♫

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,606
Hey! Wat! Wat!

14
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:01,234
Sarawat! Asshole!! What did you just do?

15
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,060
Get up and talk to me.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,760
Let go of my hand.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,060
[2gether the Series]
[Episode 6]

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:27,120
♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,110
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,120
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,720
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,120
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:58,250
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and unconsciously
fell in love with you ♫

24
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:06,850
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,730
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

26
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,810
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

27
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:23,130
♫ Just being able to love you, I can't force myself
to forget about you ♫

28
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,690
♫ I've fallen in love with you,
I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,023
Tine!

30
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,346
Tine! Are you dead in there?

31
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:41,003
Tine!

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,013
Tine.

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,260
What are you up to? Why haven't you taken a shower yet?

34
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,600
Come on. I am hungry.

35
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,630
Hey! A new wallet? I haven't seen you use this one.

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,933
That's my brother's!

37
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,830
He didn't just forget his wallet.

38
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,270
He forgot his phone, too.

39
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,209
That also belongs to my brother.

40
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,160
Hold on.

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,153
He uses your picture as his lock screen wallpaper.

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,670
Of course. It's normal. We are brothers.

43
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,570
It's not normal because it's a picture of you and Sarawat.

44
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,590
It's…

45
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,020
Enough already. I know Sarawat slept here last night.

46
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,540
"I didn't want to wake you. I am off for music practice."

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,100
He left a note for you.

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,734
So you guys moved in together already?

49
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,350
Are you crazy?

50
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,519
He came to record a video for Music Club.

51
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,910
By the time we were done recording, it was really late.

52
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,460
So, I let him crash here.

53
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,459
But he was gone when I woke up.

54
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,065
And have you asked him how he feels about you yet?

55
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:01,970
You are reserved. Don't ever hit on anyone.

56
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,490
Uh… I have.

57
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,840
He said he was just messing with Green's head.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,330
He was playing.

59
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,970
It's nothing, guys.

60
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,129
It's late. Let me go take a shower.

61
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,550
Quickly.

62
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,160
I am hungry.

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,889
Tine, what's wrong?

64
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,449
You seem really distracted today.

65
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,313
I am sorry.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,150
We can leave it here for today.

67
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,550
Don't forget to practice at home.

68
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,486
These are yours. You forgot them.

69
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,950
Thanks.

70
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,620
You're welcome.

71
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,233
I'm going to go now.

72
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,300
Tine.

73
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,580
Tine! Why are you mad?

74
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,260
Don't you think I should be mad at what you did to me?

75
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,250
I am sorry.

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,350
I was in a rush this morning. I didn't wait until you woke up.

77
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,160
I am not talking about this morning.

78
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,720
I am talking about last night.

79
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,413
Last night?

80
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,406
Don't you remember what you did to me at all?

81
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:46,470
I did something to you? What?

82
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,700
I was drunk last night.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,150
We recorded a video in your room.

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,480
And then…

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,446
Then you…

86
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,820
Forget it. I'm going to go now.

87
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,310
Wait!

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,950
I'm not done talking to you.

89
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,700
I have a soccer match this Saturday. Come and cheer for me.

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,869
I don't think so. University cheerleaders are not assigned for this match.

91
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,430
Screw U-cheerleaders.

92
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,830
I just want you to cheer for me.

93
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,920
Fine. I'll think about it.

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,573
I actually have to help Phuak with his food review page.

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,180
I will be off now.

96
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,813
If any of you wants to attend an intensive course for the Faculty of Architecture,

97
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:45,440
register right here with me, P'Chat, your handsome tutor.

98
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,600
Can I ask you something?

99
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,540
P'Mil, a senior who played guitar at the Open House, will he be a tutor too?

100
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,659
And does he have a girlfriend?

101
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,846
Am I his type?

102
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,859
They are all here because of you.

103
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,820
Why don't you tutor them?

104
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,580
I am sure our faculty welcomes the biggest number of freshmen this year.

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,685
- Really?
- Yes.

106
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,880
I am sorry, guys. I dedicate my time to music practice.

107
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,200
I am afraid I won't have enough time to take care of you guys.

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,500
I don't think I can tutor you.

109
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,630
How about just one student?

110
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,310
Are you here for the Open House?

111
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,720
What faculty are you enrolling in?

112
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,210
I don't know yet.

113
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,590
Yeah? Let me give you some advice.

114
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,219
Enroll for any faculty but Architecture.

115
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,359
The workload is crazy.

116
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,579
I told you Architecture is not easy.

117
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:50,719
That's why I need a great tutor... like you.

118
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,040
But I don't need a troll student like you.

119
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,310
See you.

120
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,270
Wait! Register first.

121
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,450
Mil will be back.

122
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,780
Hand it to your friends, too.

123
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,520
Hi, guys. I am admin Phuak

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,160
from page "Gross But Cheap So We Gotta Eat."

125
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,330
I am taking you to a hotpot restaurant near the university.

126
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,490
It's cheap, but the taste is horrible.

127
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,910
Fits our concept.

128
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,520
Damn it! Phuak!

129
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,300
Did you have to say 'horrible' so loud?

130
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,926
They will kick us out.

131
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,459
The game is about to start. Where are you?

132
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,346
Tine, taste it and review.

133
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,950
What kind of soup is this? It burns my throat.

134
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,513
Of course, it does.

135
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,970
They put Thai herbal liquor in it. It's a special recipe.

136
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,340
Prepare to get drunk.

137
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,860
Guys can't bring girlfriends here then.

138
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,750
Why not?

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,070
People always speak the truth when drunk.

140
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,480
If you're hiding secrets from your girlfriend,

141
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,320
you will spill it all out after having this soup.

142
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,320
Come on. Drink up.

143
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,460
It's really great.

144
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,450
- That's right.
- Cheers!

145
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,413
Cheers!

146
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,833
Cheers!

147
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,121
Drink it all. Drink up.

148
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,760
Is it true… that when people are drunk, they speak the truth?

149
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,260
Of course not. Ohm was just saying.

150
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,060
There is something I've always wanted to tell you, though.

151
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,440
- What?
- Do you remember your phone with a cracked screen?

152
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,250
You didn't sit on it. Ohm dropped it and blamed it on you.

153
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,732
Shut your pie hole, Phuak!!

154
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:08,030
Don't listen to him. He's drunk.

155
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,840
I am not. I remember all of it.

156
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,466
As for Fong... he used your Facebook account to register on a porn website.

157
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,640
It's okay, guys. Let's have more soup.

158
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
Cheers! Come on.

159
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,020
Cheers!

160
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,500
Cheers!

161
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,843
Is this the end of the world?

162
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,980
My husband shows up here and helps out.

163
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,666
I have to. My car broke down.

164
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,359
I need some money to fix it.

165
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,439
Be a tutor and make some money then.

166
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,340
I heard that many girls wanted to be your students.

167
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,149
Little girls have nothing on a real deal like you, Jae Tun.

168
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:03,880
What a sweet talker!

169
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,940
I can't raise the wage for you though.

170
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,753
If you want more money, do the OT in my room.

171
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,603
Here.

172
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,833
What is this?

173
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,829
P'Chat told me to draw a person, car, and tree.

174
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:34,540
I've finished it and I want to hear your opinion.

175
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,533
If I give you my opinion, will you leave me alone?

176
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,903
You'll never know.

177
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,786
Once you see my drawing, you might want to be my tutor.

178
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,643
Let's see.

179
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,499
Here it is.

180
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:56,209
A person watering a tree.
(car and watering are homonyms)

181
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,225
Can you just go and be a troll somewhere else?

182
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,152
I am your customer.

183
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:02,690
You can't shoo me away.

184
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,739
I'll report this to Jae Tun.

185
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:06,993
Jae…

186
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,679
What do you want? Just order. Quickly.

187
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
Honey toast.

188
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,410
A hundred honey toasts.

189
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,339
You order for the whole freaking universe?

190
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,385
I'm not doing it.

191
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:23,013
Jae Tun…

192
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,279
What do you want?

193
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,080
If you agree to be my tutor, I will be a good boy.

194
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,600
I will stop bugging you.

195
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,113
Fine.

196
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,219
Draw a person, a car, and a tree. Hand them to me tomorrow morning.

197
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,129
I'll be your tutor then.

198
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:48,229
You don't need to wait till tomorrow. I can finish it right now.

199
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,149
A hundred drawings altogether.

200
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,566
If you can't do it, get out of my sight completely.

201
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,719
Go now. You're running out of time.

202
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,613
Let's go to the next restaurant.

203
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,093
I'm not going.

204
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,990
What is happening?

205
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,806
RIP Sarawat's knee.

206
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,686
Looking for me?

207
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,709
Hey! How can you still stand?

208
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,469
Didn't you break your leg?

209
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,379
I just got a little scrape from a wrong tackle.

210
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,659
When did I break my leg?

211
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,169
Man posted on his IG that your leg is broken.

212
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,970
Man was just being Man. You believe him?

213
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,980
It's good you're here though.

214
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,360
So I don't need to do it myself.

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,299
Why would I? Do it yourself.

216
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,589
My energy ran out. Bandage me, please.

217
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,306
Tine, be gentle.

218
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,950
Why are your hands shaking so much?

219
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,349
I… I am afraid of blood.

220
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,520
I guess I am, too.

221
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,520
Because I am all shaking here.

222
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,160
I meant my heart.

223
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,960
I got some work to do.

224
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,140
I will be off now.

225
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:50,026
Hey!! We won!

226
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,019
I told you.

227
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,420
Eight years in practice at Old Trafford.

228
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,490
You're here, too?

229
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,380
That's great. We are celebrating.

230
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,913
Come with us.

231
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,180
Come on. Come with us!

232
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,220
Your friends are coming too. Especially Phuak.

233
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,870
He said he had stories to tell.

234
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,946
Let's go.

235
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,359
To Political Science victory!

236
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,760
Cheers!

237
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,499
To 10 points for our presentation!

238
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,626
Cheers!

239
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,746
To the parking spot that we fought for this morning!

240
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:53,333
Cheers!

241
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,139
Bottoms up.

242
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,019
See? I drink it all.

243
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,293
Drink up, Tine.

244
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,020
Why do you guys keep celebrating?

245
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,573
It's like you're trying to get me drunk.

246
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,269
And why are you avoiding eye contact with me?

247
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,506
Don't tell me that you want them to get me drunk.

248
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,000
He was just playing.

249
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,346
You're overthinking it.

250
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,292
I am envious. You have someone so cute to play with.

251
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,339
What about the one you met at the seminar?

252
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,490
Go play with him.

253
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,300
I don't even know what his name is.

254
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,599
It's no problem. Just look for him then.

255
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,759
Go to every freaking seminar.

256
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,739
Right, inspector?

257
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,740
Copy that, sergeant!

258
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,393
You guys talk too much.

259
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:06,040
To us for being lucky enough to get this table!

260
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,810
Cheers!

261
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,539
Enough already.

262
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,500
Cheers!

263
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Cheers!

264
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,389
Where are all my friends?

265
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:23,540
Why did they leave me to get drunk alone?

266
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,793
To your friends that are missing!

267
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,879
Cheers!

268
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,589
My beloved friend, Tine.

269
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,320
To the Line ID, I got from a hot girl there!

270
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,026
Cheers!

271
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,253
Great!

272
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,393
Cheers!

273
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,819
How was your night?

274
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:40,486
They got me so drunk I passed out.

275
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,293
Which one of you got me home last night?

276
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,979
Don't tell me you still haven't seen it on your IG.

277
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:54,800
- IG?
- Yes.

278
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,990
Where is your room key?

279
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,179
- What are you trying to grab?
- Stay still.

280
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,260
I had fun though.

281
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,893
- Do it one more time.
- No.

282
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,059
Hey! What are you doing?

283
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,946
I'm taking them off so you will be comfortable.

284
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:13,280
Take them all off.

285
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,489
I am reserved.

286
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,893
Asshole!

287
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,439
Between Green and Sarawat, I can't even tell who is more dangerous at this point.

288
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,200
I'd say Sarawat.

289
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,504
He found a way to your room.

290
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:39,755
I won't be surprised if you become his one day.

291
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,020
By the way, Green is not bothering you anymore.

292
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,970
When will you tell Sarawat to stop with this fake flirting thing?

293
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,079
Right.

294
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,066
Right.

295
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,170
A hundred drawings as promised.

296
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,860
It's your turn to keep your promise.

297
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,899
He has done a great job.

298
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:32,493
If you say no, you're a loser.

299
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,560
Sure. I will be your tutor.

300
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,193
Are you happy?

301
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,193
Tine.

302
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,410
Green, why are you here?

303
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,110
I know everything.

304
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,420
You asked Sarawat to fake flirt with you.

305
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,127
No. What are you talking about?

306
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:00,460
Why did you lie to me?

307
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,370
I heard you and your friends talking in the bathroom.

308
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,560
I know it was all your plan.

309
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,920
Why did you have to be so harsh?

310
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,310
I didn't mean to be harsh. But…

311
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,553
I just…

312
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,960
Tine, I know that I'm not good enough for you.

313
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,990
But please give me one more chance.

314
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,650
Who said I flirted with him just to get rid of you?

315
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,540
I did everything because I genuinely like Tine.

316
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,580
I don't believe you.

317
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,560
I know that everything is just a plan.

318
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,806
It was a plan at first.

319
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,246
But then I realized…

320
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,140
I really like Tine.

321
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,860
I will never believe that.

322
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,180
You don't? Do you want us to kiss to prove it?

323
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,166
That's enough.

324
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,393
That's enough.

325
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,460
Fine. I believe you.

326
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,493
I believe that Sarawat really likes Tine.

327
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,780
That was close.

328
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,280
How did you know he was coming?

329
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,409
He's been following you since the university.

330
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,960
I knew something was happening.

331
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,173
If Green didn't stop you, would you really kiss me?

332
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,670
Do you really think I would kiss you?

333
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,160
I said it because I knew Green couldn't take it.

334
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,206
Who would kiss you?

335
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,086
Drink up.

336
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,000
This meal is my treat.

337
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,050
What's got into you?

338
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,890
I am just bored.

339
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,660
And I haven't sat down and eaten with all of you for quite some time.

340
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Come on. Drink while they're still cold.

341
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:53,060
- Since we are all here… I have...
- Something to ask.

342
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,080
How did you know?

343
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,673
Whenever you say it's your treat, you always need help.

344
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,780
What is your problem this time?

345
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,560
The thing is…

346
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,540
I have a friend from Music Club.

347
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,920
He is worried and wondering if his friend…

348
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,100
Let's do this.

349
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,679
Let's call that guy "A."

350
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,860
He is wondering if A likes me…

351
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,180
No!

352
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,980
He is wondering if A likes him. I meant my friend.

353
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,130
So… Who is this guy A anyway?

354
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,060
I can hack into his Facebook account.

355
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,720
Let's not go that far.

356
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,800
How about this? Get him drunk.

357
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,680
I am sure he will confess everything.

358
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,480
That method works only for you.

359
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,033
I must be out of my mind asking you guys.

360
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,426
I know a way.

361
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,373
Make him jealous.

362
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,400
Why?

363
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,880
No matter how good people are at keeping it inside,

364
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,850
jealousy always shows when they see

365
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,350
someone else approaching the ones they like.

366
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,190
If your friend wants to know if A likes him,

367
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,600
try to make A jealous.

368
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,733
I'm here because I want to get better at time management.

369
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,460
Helo.

370
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,459
I don't think you need to know my name.

371
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:32,759
I am here just to look for someone.

372
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,460
But it doesn't seem like… he is here.

373
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,240
So I'm just going to go. Thank you very much.

374
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,190
Don't give up just yet.

375
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,270
There are plenty of seminars for you to look for.

376
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,472
He must be at one of them.

377
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,660
Do you want to hear the event list that I went to?

378
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,180
I went to all academic seminars,

379
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,020
both direct and indirect sales meetings,

380
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,893
online marketing classes, and leadership camps.

381
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:02,906
Only Dharma camp that I haven't been to.

382
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,630
That is an old people community.

383
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,830
Your darling won't be there.

384
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,590
Dang it! He's here.

385
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,240
I have to go.

386
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,660
Sir, may I see your pass, please?

387
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,212
It is with my friend.

388
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:25,359
The one that just went in there. I'll go get it for you.

389
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,426
Can you call him to bring it out instead?

390
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,040
We can't let you pass.

391
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,840
Ah… Look!

392
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,180
Sir, you can't get in.

393
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,439
Please wait outside.

394
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,940
He was just there.

395
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,270
Wait outside, please.

396
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,280
Okay.

397
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,900
Okay.

398
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,390
[Faculty Building]

399
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,480
Wat! Are you done practicing?

400
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,113
Do you want to grab something to eat?

401
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,980
What's wrong? You have a plan already?

402
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,263
No.

403
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,490
You just asked me to eat with you. It's weird.

404
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,630
Don't think too much.

405
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,800
Sarawat, my dear friend.

406
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,530
Go out and have a drink with me tonight.

407
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,620
Please.

408
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,653
Okay.

409
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,133
My band is playing at L Co Hol tonight.

410
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:50,210
It's like a big rehearsal for the opening act for Scrubb this Saturday.

411
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,750
Meet me there.

412
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,260
We are playing Scrubb songs. You will love it.

413
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,470
Okay. See you at L Co Hol.

414
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,613
L Co Hol! See you there.

415
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,040
What's wrong with him?

416
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,960
And why am I taking a detour?

417
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,560
It's really you. Do you remember me?

418
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,689
You found my friend's pen at the seminar last week.

419
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,653
That's right. He is here, too. He sat beside me.

420
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:41,400
He even invited me to an event but I'm not sure I can make it.

421
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,900
What kind of event? Can I join?

422
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,486
Here. He left me a brochure.

423
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,820
Meditation retreat for two nights?

424
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,639
Exactly! It's perfect for someone like you.

425
00:29:55,639 --> 00:30:00,300
Perfect for someone like me? A meditation retreat?

426
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,700
Thank you.

427
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,430
So when a guy named Sarawat walks in,

428
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,620
I need to act like your girlfriend and make him jealous?

429
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,670
That's correct.

430
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,470
If you do it well, I'll reward you with extra tips, Nancy.

431
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,170
Let's practice then.

432
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,793
Practice?

433
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,010
Babe, where should we go after this?

434
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,350
Hey!! This is too much.

435
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,120
- Too much?
- Make it less obvious.

436
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,150
Do it naturally.

437
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,033
How about this?

438
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,673
Hi, baby. Do you want some snacks?

439
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:43,060
Sarawat is here.

440
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,586
Aww!! He is so hot!

441
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,700
Nuisance, have you been waiting for long?

442
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,860
Not long but I'm leaving.

443
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,060
I have something else to do.

444
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,000
Sit! Sit right here. I will pay.

445
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,493
Watch me play first. Wait here.

446
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,733
Nan…

447
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,933
Thanks for absolutely nothing.

448
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,070
Hi, guys.

449
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,699
We've prepared a special song for you tonight.

450
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,480
One of our members requested it actually.

451
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,900
He even wants to sing it himself.

452
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,793
Give our guitarist a big hand, guys!

453
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,810
This song is for someone so silly...

454
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,120
who didn't get to hear it when I played the first time.

455
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,470
This song is called Everything.

456
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,620
♪ I will do everything ♪

457
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,300

465
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,950
Tine, I want to take a picture with Sarawat.

466
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,039
Can you ask him for me? Please. Please. Please.

467
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,739
Ask him yourself.

468
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,379
Why are you upset?

469
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,430
Are you his boyfriend or something?

470
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,289
No matter how good people are at keeping it inside,

471
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:37,990
jealousy always shows when they see someone else approaching the ones they like.

472
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,013
I am sorry.

473
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,200
It's okay, Tine.

474
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,259
You know my name?

475
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:03,190
A university cheerleader. Of course, I do.

476
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,999
That's right. Sorry again about that.

477
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,739
Wait up.

478
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:14,413
I won't get mad at you for bumping into me if I get just one selfie with you.

479
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,346
Thanks.

480
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,830
What the heck is wrong with you?

481
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,639
Why did you take a photo with him?

482
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,229
It's none of your business.

483
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:38,109
I didn't say anything when those girls handed you drinks and hugged you.

484
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,959
I didn't touch their drinks or hug anyone.

485
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,460
Think twice about what you saw.

486
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,020
Yeah?

487
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,899
Tine! What is your problem exactly?

488
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,109
- Let go of me.
- I won't! Unless you tell me.

489
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,379
I am jealous, all right. You happy now?

490
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,760
Do you still want to get Scrubb's autographs?

491
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,960
I am waiting for you at the entrance.

492
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,905
- What is wrong, Tine?
- I am jealous, all right.

493
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,866
You happy now?

494
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,920
If we want to know if someone likes us, we need to make that person jealous. Right?

495
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,220
That's right.

496
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,150
But love is not easy to prove like in dramas.

497
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,040
It's a lot more complicated than that.

498
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,460
Sometimes you need to take it slow and let time tell you.

499
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,879
Sarawat, let's go. Everyone is ready.

501
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,509
Can I still get their autographs?

502
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:12,106
Too damn late. My show was over like 10 years ago.

503
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,659
I drank a little too much last night.

504
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,050
I can't remember anything

505
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,613
Oh! I remember one thing.

506
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:26,280
I was watching you play live and then woke up in my room.

507
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,140
Forget it.

508
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,820
You can still make it to the concert though.

509
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,279
Do you want to go?

510
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,129
Don't ask.

511
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,763
Come on.

512
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,154
We have come to the end of the show.

Deep Down.

515
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,394
Tell your friends to get their hands in the air.

My band is playing at L Co Hol tonight.

Meet me there.

This song…

And you said you are a Scrubb fan.

539

That was off-key?

- I have good news for you.
- What?

541
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,665
There will be a Scrubb's live show at our university in two weeks.

542
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:39,886
For real?

Know what?

In the concert, how did you know they would play Deep Down?

Of course, I know.
