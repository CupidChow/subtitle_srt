Have you ever wondered why many things are in pairs?

2
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:10,630
Like friends or… lovers.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,120
Especially when you find the right one to pair with,

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,130
you will do whatever it takes to be with that person.

5

- Anything.

- Ice-cream?
- Makes you fat.

24

- A honey toast?
- Too sweet.

25

A pudding? Bingsoo? Choux cream?

NO!

31

That was a big fat no.

Whatever I did wrong, I am sorry.

33

Why are you apologizing? I am not mad!

Of course not! I had lots of effeminate and gay friends back in high school.

00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:20,519
It's dangerous. I will protect you.

167
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,289
You're not hurt, are you?

168
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,924
You are so fragile. Let me take care of you.

169
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,720
We're here.

170
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:41,056
Are you sure you don't want me to stay with you tonight?

171
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,111
I am. I'm fine.

172
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:44,549
You can go.

173
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,967
Please. Go.

174
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,289
Fine.

175
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,256
But if you need anything, I stand by to take your call 24/7.

176
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:56,249
I will check into a hotel around here just in case.

177
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,620
Call me.

178
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,960
Take care.

179
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,308
Bye-bye.

180
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,220
Tine, my beloved friend, how are you?

181
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,679
Not good, my beloved friend Phuak.

182
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,679
All of my friends just left me alone with him.

183
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,359
How could we stay on? He almost broke my arms to pieces.

184
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,047
I think we're screwed. We need help.

185
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:29,899
Help?

186
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,023
Do we need a boxer or a bodybuilder?

187
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,312
It's not what we meant.

188
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:37,460
We need someone to be your fake girlfriend.

189
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,540
- My girlfriend?
- Yeah.

190
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,230
Green is shadowing you because you still don't have anyone.

191
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,439
Find someone to be your fake date.

192
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,139
Green will be out of your hair soon.

193
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,309
Good idea. Who can it be?

194
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,649
Hot girls from our faculty are not available.

195
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,759
What about that girl from your dorm, the one who asked for your Line ID?

196
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,039
She is single but not hot.

197
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,879
I don't want to ruin a chic guy's reputation.

198
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,320
You take a fake girlfriend too seriously.

199
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,100
Just find a hot girl who is willing to help you. That's it.

200
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,750
I know a pretty girl who might be single but…

201
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:28,247
But you dumped me.

202
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,447
We're not back together for real.

203
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,967
Just pretend to be my girlfriend to fool someone.

204
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:37,087
Please. We are in the same university. Can you help?

205
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,679
What will I get if I do?

206
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,213
What do you want?

207
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:42,399
Anything?

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,559
Armani, Gucci, Prada.

209
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,407
A bag from any brand I just said.

210
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:50,324
I see. It's not "anything" anymore.

211
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,208
I'll rent one for you.

212
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,641
- Buy one.
- Buy?

213
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,989
Deal!

214
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,999
I will help you then but don't let my boyfriend know.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,789
That's easy. See you at The Freshy Night on Friday.

216
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,248
Someone is going to be heartbroken.

217
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,087
Tine. Did you wait for long?

218
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,389
Did you feel lonely over here?

219
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,000
Not that long and I wasn't lonely

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,440
because I wasn't here alone.

221
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,689
What do you mean?

222
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,323
I mean…

223
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,109
This is Noomnim, my girlfriend.

224
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,720
Now you know why we can't be together.

225
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,300
Please give up on me.

226
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,585
Sure.

227
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,980
Tine, don't you think it was too harsh?

228
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:20,468
I am sorry I did that.

229
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,339
I just don't want you to waste any more time on me.

230
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,569
So you pretend to date someone else's girlfriend just to fool me?

231
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,599
Right. Hey!! How did you know that?

232
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,219
Noomnim is my friend's girlfriend.

233
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,092
I see them at my faculty every day.

234
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,480
What a small world!

235
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,339
If you already knew, why did you cry then?

236
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,132
I was sad because you fooled me to make me give up.

237
00:14:56,704 --> 00:15:01,660
But then you came to comfort me. I get it now.

238
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,889
Get what?

239
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,719
You just wanted to test if I really like you or not, am I right?

240
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,132
- You're not. You're so not right.
- Of course I am.

241
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,891
- No.
- Don't be shy.

242
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:13,713
No.

243
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,060
Yes! I like you even more now.

244
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,380
Let's go inside.

245
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,399
Where?

246
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,580
- In the event.
- No.

247
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,359
Let's go. Bye-bye, Noomnim. See you in class.

248
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,980
Tine come on. There's lots of food.

249
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,568
Throw the ball.

250
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,096
You suck.

251
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,770
That was close!

252
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,760
This one will kill. I'm sure.

253
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,495
Oops!

254
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,823
What if this plan fails?

255
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:54,132
I have plan B.

256
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:55,709
Here.

257
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,552
Right here!

258
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,549
This will put him to sleep.

259
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,919
Find the right time to put it in his drink and get out of there.

260
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,968
We will take care of the rest.

261
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,919
Seriously?

262
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,860
Yes.

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,327
Can I get three more balls and play on?

264
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,319
I don't want to start over.

265
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,431
Green, are you thirsty?

266
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,782
I will go get you some drink.

267
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,832
Thirsty?

268
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,948
Is he all right?

269
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,920
Oops!

270
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,949
Energetic Pandan.

271
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,887
I don't think so.

272
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,183
The Muse of Roselle.

273
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:04,500
Super Power Chrysanthemum.

274
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,452
Elephant Power Black Tea. Two cups, please.

275
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,548
- How much?
- 20 Baht.

276
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,769
The right cup. Right cup.

277
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,759
Right.

278
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,211
- What are you doing?
- What?

279
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,809
What took you so long?

280
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,367
I'm getting you a drink.

281
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:53,179
What drink?

282
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,949
It's called Elephant Power Black Tea.

283
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,319
It's strong.

284
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,652
It's so good.

285
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,799
Left or right?

286
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,719
It's all the same.

287
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,039
Come on. The next band will be up soon.

288
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,632
That's the one.

289
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:34,272
I shouldn't have stayed up watching a series last night.

290
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,559
Wait a minute.

291
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,871
You yawned because you stayed up late watching a series?

292
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:44,920
Yes. It took me until this morning to finish it.

293
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,656
So this cup…

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,329
Tine! Tine! Are you sick?

295
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,776
Do you want me to take you back to your dorm?

296
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:10,000
It's the time we've been waiting for.

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,770
Please welcome Sssss..! on stage.

298
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,596
Hi, guys. We are Sssss..!

299
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,559
Shit! My eyes hurt.

300
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,376
I am sorry.

301
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,390
We rescued you last night.

302
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,359
If it wasn't for that guitarist who distracted Green,

303
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,060
you might be waking up in his room by now.

304
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,295
A fake girlfriend didn't work.

305
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,511
The plan didn't shake Green for a bit.

306
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:31,549
He even said he would change me and make me fall for him one day.

307
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,669
Date a guy then.

308
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,209
Are you out of your mind?

309
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,130
No. I mean find a guy to be your fake boyfriend,

310
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,690
so Green will give up.

311
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:46,959
At this moment, no one fits this duty more than this guy.

312
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Introduce yourself!

313
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,415
I am only here as a substitution.

314
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,440
Can I please not introduce myself?

315
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,850
Everyone is talking about him on social media.

316
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,119
He got thousands of messages from many girls.

317
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,260
This is the type of guy that can make Green back off.

318
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,895
How can we ask for his help?

319
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:26,663
We don't know his name or his faculty.

320
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,071
Who are you talking to?

321
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:30,887
I am Ohm, the god of social media.

322
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,639
I can find you that information.

323
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,300
It's up to you. Do you want to do it?

324
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,144
Do I have a choice?

325
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:46,159
From what we know, our target is a real introvert.

326
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,079
He doesn't have a Line, Facebook, or Instagram account.

327
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,287
That's Line. That's IG.

328
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:54,929
I can do it.

329
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,895
I've been refreshing the Cute Boy Page for hours.

330
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:00,079
I still don't have any info on him.

331
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,059
The Cute Boy Page won't do you any good.

332
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,679
The right page is called Dilitious Boy.

333
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,769
Delicious!

334
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,015
Whatever! Look what I found here.

335
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:14,523
See? Sarawat from Faculty of Political Science, IR major.

336
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:16,119
What a weird name!

337
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,189
We know where he is. Let's go.

338
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,439
Calm down.

339
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,279
You don't even know what he's like.

340
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,549
How are you going to talk to him?

341
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,416
You're right.

342
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
[Sarawat]

343
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,183
Someone posted a video of Sarawat. Look.

344
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:41,111
Sarawat, we bought snacks for you.

345
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:42,857
I don't like snacks.

346
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:44,639
What do you like then?

347
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,259
I don't.

348
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,383
You don't like anything at all? Or…

349
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:51,884
I don't like it when people buy me snacks.

350
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:58,096
That's okay. I will take it.

351
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,943
Shit! How hot does he think he is?

352
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:05,009
I'm hotter but I don't do that.

353
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,527
Let me see. Where is your hotness?

354
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:09,699
Why don't I see it?

355
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,335
Right here.

356
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:13,039
There's more.

357
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,860
Another video.

358
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,567
Hi. Can we get a picture…?

359
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:21,128
Just do it.

360
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,439
1 2.

361
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,973
Here.

362
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,050
This guy is not only antisocial,

363
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,550
but he is also a jerk.

364
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:39,649
This is the best one.

365
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,748
Someone found his schedule.

366
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,800
He's about to get out of class.

367
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,927
What now, Tine?

368
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:48,903
Should we go now?

369
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:51,732
Definitely! What are you waiting for?

370
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,500
Seems like it's not just me who wants to see Sarawat.

371
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,729
Look on the bright side, this means our source is reliable.

372
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,103
Reliable my ass!

373
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:11,188
My spy just told me that the schedule is fake.

374
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:14,351
Sarawat is actually at the university's main building.

375
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,448
Main Building?

376
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,548
Main Building?

377
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,368
That's it. That's how everything started.

378
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,556
I am running to find the right one…

379
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,364
and I stop at... him.

380
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,800
Sarawat. Sarawat.

381
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,628
Saraleo! (Asshole)

382
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,056
I am sorry.

383
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,209
What?

384
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,479
It's…

385
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,520
Say it already. I'm in a rush.

386
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,919
Keep looking at me like that… and I will kiss you till you drop.

387
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,856
You're annoying.

388
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,470
Sarawat! You, asshole! Shit, Sarawat!

389
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,055
Stop complaining already.

390
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,208
Just decide if you want to go on or find a new target.

391
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:06,860
No. The harder it is, the more Mr. Chic wants.

392
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:11,415
Do you guys have anything else on him?

393
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,495
I don't. He is a very private person.

394
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:17,255
The Cute Boy Page can't get anything either.

395
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:21,648
No one cares about the Cute Boy Page anymore.

396
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,790
What page should we be looking at?

397
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,159
Do you have any news?

398
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,270
Exactly! Let me tell you.

399
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,300
His fans created a secret group chat just to share stories and news about him.

400
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,769
The group is called Team Sarawat's Wives.

401
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,528
Sarawat's wives?

402
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,639
Speaking of which, they just found you his contact.

403
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,247
Let me see. His number or his Line ID?

404
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:52,044
His email.

405
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,830
- Email?
- Yep.

406
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,720
Am I back to MSN time?

407
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,111
Just choose whether you email him or wait for him at his faculty.

408
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:06,720
I don't know if you will see him that easily.

409
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,803
Up to you.

410
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:15,632
Email it is.

411
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,644
"Hi, Sarawat.

412
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,639
I am Tine,

413
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,690
the one you said you would kiss till I dropped the other day.

414
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,340
I need to ask you a favor.

415
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,650
Are you available tomorrow?

416
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,576
Meet me anywhere. I don't mind the place."

417
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,528
Hey! Why are you here?

418
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:21,384
You emailed me.

419
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:25,979
That's right but I didn't think you would come to my room.

420
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,596
You said it could be anywhere.

421
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:33,903
What are you doing?

422
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:35,700
Helping you.

423
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,695
Do you want it now?

424
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:41,399
Hold on!

425
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,259
I don't mean this kind of help.

426
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,100
I mean I want you to…

427
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:51,076
Shit!!

428
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:05,939
"I can't believe that someone just emailed me asking for sex.

429
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,791
It can be anywhere, you said? You can fuck yourself, you psycho!"

430
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:12,687
Asshole! You want it this way, huh?

431
00:29:12,688 --> 00:29:16,359
Let the game begin.

432
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,800
In Team Sarawat's Wives, they say he drives a white car…

433
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,959
A white car?

434
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,504
…with some stickers at the rear.

435
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,999
Stickers at the rear?

436
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,077
He likes to park at the back of his faculty building.

437
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:30,168
I'm going to hang up now. I think I found it.

438
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,910
Is this your car?

439
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,744
I am sorry, ma'am.

440
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,639
Sarawat! Sarawat!

441
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,103
Hey, Wat!

442
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,820
Hey, Wat! Slow down!

443
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,812
Hey, Wat!

444
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,303
Hey, Wat!

445
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,516
I need to talk to you.

446
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,720
Let's talk.

447
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,904
I don't talk to strangers.

448
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,809
Stranger, my ass!

449
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,319
You said you would kiss me till I dropped the other day.

450
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,719
Please. Can I have five minutes?

451
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,792
No.

452
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,143
Three minutes then?

453
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:41,629
No.

454
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,783
Ten seconds? Just ten seconds.

455
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:46,652
- Nine eight seven
- Wait.

456
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:47,992
I…

457
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,375
Can you please help…?

458
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,144
Your time is up.

459
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,327
Look what he did to me.

460
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:05,768
I followed him like a shadow yet he still didn't care to talk.

461
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,240
Do you think I will stop here?

462
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,416
I don't think so.

463
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,936
I won't stop and give up now.

464
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,220
Tine.

465
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,656
Tine, are you okay?

466
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,840
Where is this place?

467
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,175
University, of course. Where do you think you are?

468
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:37,376
Or you want to go to my house?

469
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,719
Just kidding.

470
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,819
Lucky for you I found you lying face down right here and gave you first aid.

471
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,760
If it wasn't for me, you would be dead already.

472
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,539
Let's do this. I will stay with you tonight to take care of you.

473
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,960
Let me call and tell my mom.

474
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,739
Tine!!

475
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,732
Wait up!!

476
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,695
Tine!

477
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:10,663
P'Fang.

478
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:13,305
I'm on my way to a share-coded dinner. You want to come with me?

479
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:17,259
That's okay. I'm going to… find…

480
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,709
Tine!

481
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,508
Never mind. Let's go.

482
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,340
Come on.

483
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,159
Wait up!

484
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,200
Tine! Wait up!!

485
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:35,068
Let's cheer for Ann.

486
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,189
Go girl!

487
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,699
Ann My name is Ann. I am a freshman.

488
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,190
I hate grumpy face. All I do is smile.

489
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,360
Do you, seniors, like it?

490
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,520
Cheers!

491
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,380
And the next one... Go girl!

492
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,840
And the next one…

493
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,086
Hey, Tine! Where are you going?

494
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:05,711
It's your turn to introduce yourself.

495
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,175
I'm going to the restroom.

496
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,000
Don't be shy!

497
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,624
Come on. Get up there. It's our tradition.

498
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:15,287
- Don't be shy. Up on stage.
- Yes.

499
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,839
Quickly. Ann did it.

500
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,596
Let's cheer for Tine.

501
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,912
Go on.

502
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,289
My name is Tine. I am a freshman…

503
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,549
What? That's all you got?

504
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,135
Show more energy! Come on.

505
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:40,436
Don't keep it to yourself!

506
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:46,020
Come on. You can do it!

507
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,939
My name is Tine. I am a cute freshman. My friends call me Mr. Chic.

508
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,880
I can be top but the bottom is also fine. I like to strike hard. Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!

509
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,679
We want more!

510
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,060
Get down here.

511
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,728
Give him a big hand.

512
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,052
I like the cry.

513
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:19,290
Cheers to that 'Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!'

514
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,020
What were you laughing at?

515
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,272
Do you have a problem with the way I introduced myself?

516
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:37,623
I don't.

517
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:39,357
It's cute.

518
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,489
Damn it!

519
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,620
- What the heck are you doing?
- Getting your phone number.

520
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,980
Give it back.

521
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,530
Hey!

522
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:52,736
Give it back.

523
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:53,775
Give it here.

524
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:57,900
If you want it back, then give me your number.

525
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,580
What are you playing at?

526
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,040
Shit! I am sorry.

527
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,852
I will get it repaired.

528
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,516
What are you doing?

529
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:28,185
Give it back.

530
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:30,399
What if you disappear on me?

531
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,863
Once you get it fixed,

532
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,399
you can have yours back.

533
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,407
Don't you trust me?

534
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:39,304
Damn right!

535
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,672
Shit!

536
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,096
How much will it cost me?

537
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:57,860
Congratulations! You finally got his number.

538
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,299
I asked for his number but I got a broken phone waiting to get fixed.

539
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,448
Is it worth it?

540
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:08,712
In exchange for Green to stop bothering you, it's worth it.

541
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,500
You're right.

542
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,550
He must have something on his phone

543
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,580
that I can use to blackmail him to help me.

544
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:24,176
Wait. Aren't you afraid that he can get into your phone?

545
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,120
Don't worry. My phone is locked.

546
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,216
I'm sure he can never unlock it.

547
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,044
What's wrong with my Facebook?

548
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,980
They might be spams.

549
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:46,089
[Tine Mr.Chic: He looks so yummy. I want to eat Sarawat.]

550
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,430
"He looks so yummy.

551
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,780
I want to eat Sarawat."

552
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,680
You asshole!

553
