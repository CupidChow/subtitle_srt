Can you even remember getting beaten up?

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,633
Sure I can.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,673
They totally crossed the line this time.

5
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:18,906
They need to be taught that

6
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:21,680
they can't lay a hand on someone so important to me.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,170
Let me bandage you.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,946
Does it hurt really bad?

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,213
Not too bad.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,220
Does my face look really wrecked though?

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,460
I'm sure I will get yelled at by the cheerleading captain.

12

This is so like you.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,870
After getting beaten up, all you care about is how you look.

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,603
Turn this way.

15
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,986
Sorry.

16
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,330
It's going to hurt a bit.

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,133
Bear with me.

18
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,966

Why are you nestling up with me here?

55
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,009
You said you wanted to sleep on a couch.

56
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,219
We need to snuggle up due to the small space.

57
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,379
You didn't choose the mattress.

58
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,819
I said I wanted to sleep on a couch alone!

You didn't say "alone."

I hope you're not having any pervy thoughts.

Who?

67
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,280
Do you know him?

68
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,483
I don't.

69
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,279
But I have a feeling he is a senior from the Faculty of Architecture.

70
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,440
Maybe… there's a reason behind this.

71
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,133
I don't know what's behind it.

72
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:34,940
But now… I'm more interested in what's in front of me.

73

Keep looking at me like that… and I will kiss till you drop.

Is he… one of the Architecture students that hurt you yesterday?

116

I don't know. Might be.

117
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,440
Of course, he is!

118
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,133
He bullied you because of Tine.

119

123
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:53,869
I am sorry. I woke up late.

124
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:57,246
That's okay.

125
00:10:57,246 --> 00:11:01,193
Let me clip your hair up and apply foundation.

126
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,739
Wearing the wrong foundation shade is a hit now?

127
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:09,312
I don't think it's wrong.

128
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:12,980
This shade fits Tine's skin perfectly.

129
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,313
Sarawat, I think it evens his skin just fine.

130

If you don't approve, I won't do the foundation.

I don't think he needs it.

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,329
His bottom lid is black enough.

134

No liners needed.

135
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,559
Not that black, I guess.

136
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,859
Bottom eyeliner is trending.

137
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,280
Just a bit?

138
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,027
If you don't approve, we can skip it then.

139
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:45,319
Let's skip to the blush.

140
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,619
A blush will make his cheeks redder.

141
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,959
I think they're too red.

142
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,832
Let's just not wear any makeup then.

143

You are cute enough already.

147
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,340
Do you want to be cuter to attract more people or what?

148
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,670
What the heck are you saying?

149
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,072
I'm going to get changed.

Thanks.

153
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,393
So you can't play today.

154
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:34,833
I have to.

155
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,350
You gave me a promise.

156
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,380
If I win today, you will post a love confession to me.

157
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,719
This is not funny.

158
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:46,060
Promise me you won't play.

159
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,813
Yes.

160
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,504
- Promise?
- Yes.

161
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:56,373
Promise?

162
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,693
Do you want an extra ball boy?

163
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,840
No ball boy is needed here.

164
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,740
I just need an undertaker for Sarawat's dead body.

165
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,179
Just kidding.

166
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,580
I won't kill him. Disability is enough.

167
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,399
Sounds satisfying.

168
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,830
But wouldn't you be prouder to win a clean game?

169
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,069
Hey! Whose side are you actually on here?

170
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,193
Your side, of course.

171
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,153
I'm going to go warm up.

172
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,369
The players of both teams are walking onto the field.

173
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:03,893
Sarawat, the Political Science star player is sitting on the bench.

174
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:07,053
Is he injured?

175
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,620
That was a foul there.

176
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,000
The referee is giving him a yellow card.

177
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,143
Wait!

178
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,879
It's okay. I can play.

179
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,550
My knee!

180
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,073
Are you okay?

181
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:54,420
Architecture lads are hot-headed today.

182
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,989
I don't think he can play on.

183
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:58,973
I can!

184
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,200
You can't, Boss.

185
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,473
I am okay. Okay, okay, okay.

186
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,206
Ouch!! Slow down!

187
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,340
Ouch!! Slow down!

188
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,060
Sarawat!

189
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,010
The game has resumed.

190
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,209
Sarawat just goaled!

191
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,249
Tine, are you okay? You look a bit pale.

192
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:45,060
Right after he hits the field, Political Science leads Architecture one-nil.

193
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,013
I woke up quite late this morning.

194
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,839
Tine.

195
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,333
And I forgot to have breakfast.

196
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,789
Let me find something for you to eat.

197
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,844
I have a sandwich.

198
00:15:57,844 --> 00:15:58,769
Okay.

199
00:15:58,769 --> 00:15:59,939
Let's rest for a bit then.

200
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:03,039
- Guys! Tine has fainted!
- Sarawat just got tackled there!

201
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,953
Help! Bring me first aid and water!

202
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:08,919
An Architecture player is given a red card.

203
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,853
Looks like we have a situation here on the side.

204
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:15,193
Let him get some air!

205
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,906
Take this.

206
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,313
Are you okay?

207
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:28,143
You stay away!

208
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,029
Go!

209
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,026
What a dickhead!

210
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,713
You two go fight somewhere else.

211
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:38,573
Stop it!

212
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,689
Tine!

213
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,179
I am okay.

214
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,619
I will find you a fan or something.

215
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,279
Hey! Your leg!

216
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,526
Wat, your leg!

217
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,239
I am fine.

218
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,580
Don't worry about me.

219
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,220
Worry about yourself.

220
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,986
I am okay really.

221
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,719
- Some help here, please.
- Come on.

222
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,030
Okay.

223
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,979
You passed out. The seniors brought you here.

224
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,586
What about Wat?

225
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,130
He barely slept.

226
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,119
All he did was was look after you.

227
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,209
Man and I had to drag him out to see a doc for the wound.

228
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:37,580
He didn't want to leave you.

229
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,406
How is his knee?

230
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:51,286
Quite terrible.

231
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:55,400
A brace is going to be with him for a month.

232
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,250
The red mark there is either because of the tackle

233
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,800
or the infection when he ran to save you.

234
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,592
Don't worry about him.

235
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:10,943
Think about yourself first.

236
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:14,349
By the way, the Political Science won 1-0.

237
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:19,179
I guess you need to post a love confession as promised.

238
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,593
It was just a joke, wasn't it?

239
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,720
I am hungry. Let's find something to eat.

240
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:34,939
You okay?

241
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,633
Do you want to wake him?

242
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,753
No.

243
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:17,440
Since when did you like Americano?

244
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,800
It's for Sarawat.

245
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,013
I see.

246
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:27,393
Actually, Sarawat seems like a nice guy.

247
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:29,690
He really cares about you.

248
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,013
What are you implying?

249
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,546
At first, I thought you were just shaken by him

250
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:45,099
because you hadn't dated girls for a long time.

251
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,513
Now I am not sure.

252
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:50,520
Not sure about what?

253
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,920
You know I hate him.

254
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,270
If I ever get together with him,

255
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,410
you guys will tease me until the end of my days.

256
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,719
- Sarawat, can we take photos of you?
- Please.

257
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,633
- Have some, please.
- Have some, please.

258
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,749
What's wrong?

259
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:16,580
You should have gotten used it by now.

260
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,793
I haven't said anything.

261
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,786
Shit!

262
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,099
It's okay. We can buy a new one.

263
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,359
I had just one sip of it.

264
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,720
What a waste.

265
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,570
If you really wanted it, why didn't you hold on to it firmly.

266
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,860
It's up to you.

267
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,300
If you don't want to regret it later, try to keep what you want.

268
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,500
Try while you still can.

269
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,366
You can pick it up after you drop it.

270
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,150
But it's not going to be the same.

271
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,606
I think you should rest and come back next week.

272
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,889
I can't rest.

273
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,019
I have to show and promote a music contest next week.

274
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:21,670
I'll have no time for friends.

275
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,886
What is happening here?

276
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,086
We're discussing the show Sarawat has to perform.

277
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,999
I can perform. Just let me.

278
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,179
I asked your doctor.

279
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,633
Besides the injured knee, you have an injured wrist too.

280
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,213
I can't let you perform in this condition.

281
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:44,070
My wrist is okay now.

282
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,780
My knee won't be a problem. Let me perform.

283
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,513
No.

284
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,489
We don't want any substitution.

285
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,900
Without you, it's not Control S.

286
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,913
Please.

287
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,293
Let me perform.

288
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,259
P'Dim, will my show be good enough to substitute Control S?

289
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,340
What's got into your head?

290
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,690
I am not as good as Sarawat.

291
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,100
But I can perform by myself.

292
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,119
Great! I will perform a guitar solo after Tine's show.

293
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,806
Me too.

294
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,293
Us too.

295
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:43,669
It doesn't sound so bad.

296
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,600
We give this stage to newbies.

297
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,760
It might motivate more people to step up and join the contest.

298
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,810
Do you all know that?

299
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,546
When you are on stage, you carry the club's reputation with you.

300
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,060
I do.

301
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,286
This club accepted me and taught me guitar lessons.

302
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:20,953
It's time for me to repay it.

303
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,506
P'Dim is crazy enough to let Tine perform.

304
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,499
Fong, talk to him. He only listens to you.

305
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,959
Try to change his mind.

306
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,959
What's wrong with him playing for the club?

307
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,339
He is a newbie. He doesn't have enough time to practice.

308
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:57,320
The first time on stage is tough.

309
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,739
I don't want him to fail.

310
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,019
Do you know why Tine hasn't said yes to your confession?

311
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,209
How does that have to do with anything here?

312
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,726
Tine was always the one taking care of his ex.

313
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:17,399
But now he is the one being taken care of. I guess he is not used to it.

314
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:24,386
He might want to prove that he is good enough to be with you.

315
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,446
Don't be happy just yet.

316
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:33,860
If he fails this time, he might get too discouraged.

317
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,923
He might withdraw himself from a relationship with you forever.

318
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,623
Thanks.

319
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,712
Your food is right here. I'm going to go practice now.

320
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:06,059
Hey! I hurt my knee, not my eyes.

321
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,259
You can practice here. I can be your mentor.

322
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,773
Fine.

323
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,340
I will get you a chair.

324
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,213
Thank.

325
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,406
What are you looking at?

326
00:25:55,406 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm just thinking… Ever since you gave me this guitar,

327
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,259
I haven't named it yet.

328
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:06,059
Is it the right time to name a guitar? Practice.

329
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,729
I am serious here.

330
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,273
If you were a guitar, you would want to play for the owner who gave you a nice name.

331
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,230
Up to you then.

332
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,100
Well... What kind of name do you like then?

333
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,800
Something that describes me.

334
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,473
Ringworm.

335
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,900
Just call yourself that.

336
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,940
Scrubb?

337
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,760
- Scrubb?
- Yes.

338
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,410
Don't you feel pity for them at all?

339
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,240
Don't ruin their band by naming your guitar that.

340
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,089
What name do you want then?

341
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,846
Just pick one already, Nuisance.

342
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:54,799
Stop being picky and practice.

343
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,500
Nuisance!

344
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,925
That's right. Nuisance!

345
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:02,160
Freaking right for my guitar.

346
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,299
You are awesome! You are clever.

347
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,640
Let me see your music chords.

348
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,230
Are you playing a Scrubb song?

349
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,006
Yes. Why?

350
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,160
The first time having a girlfriend,

351
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,230
the first heartbreak,

352
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,070
the first music video recording.

353
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,940
Scrubb songs took part in all of them.

354
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,113
This will be my first time on stage.

355
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:37,163
How can I play a song from other bands?

356
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:38,686
You're right.

357
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,659
I am jealous of Scrubb. They are your first of many things.

358
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:46,830
I want to be Scrubb.

359
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,260
Why?

360
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,020
So that I can be with you both, when you're happy and sad.

361
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,173
I want to be Scrubb.

362
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,853
Cheesy!

363
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,390
Let me practice already.

364
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,506
Otherwise, the true sadness will come if I can't play.

365
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,349
Wrong. Press harder.

366
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,283
Wrong.

367
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,999
Wrong. Press more firmly.

368
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,260
Isn't this firm enough?

369
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,489
If it's firmly enough, it won't sound wrong. Press harder.

370
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:31,640
Wrong. Press harder.

371
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,600
Here. Press harder.

372
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,070
Now play.

373
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:41,953
This is called right.

374
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,913
Memorize it.

375
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,699
Try it. Give me a pick.

376
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:49,860
Nobody holds a pick as you do.

377
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,649
Look. Use your point finger like this.

378
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:58,290
Spare the edge.

379
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,480
Grab it together with your thumb and you strum it.

380
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:04,040
Give me your hand.

381
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,186
Here.

382
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:10,780
Put a pick on your point finger.

383
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,326
Leave the edge.

384
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:17,940
Press it with your thumb.

385
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,003
Tine, will you marry me?

386
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
What the hell?

387
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,930
You're teaching me to hold a pick, not putting on a wedding ring.

388
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,726
Okay. Keep going!

389
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,230
Why are you smiling?

390
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,153
Who is?

391
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Does it hurt your fingers?

392
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,339
Stop. Let me see.

393
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,966
All of them hurt?

394
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:27,220
Yes.

395
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,340
Just take a break.

396
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,012
If you practice too hard and hurt your fingers, you can't perform anyway.

397
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:34,700
Let me have a look.

398
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,620
See? Your fingers are about to bleed.

399
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,470
You have to be able to play when the day comes.

400
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,453
I'm trying to be gentle, but this is hard.

401
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,663
Sorry.

402
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,660
You know what.

403
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:07,660
No one has ever put a band-aid on for me before in my life.

404
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,100
And do you think I have done this for anyone?

405
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,793
Marry me?

406
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,973
Again? Stop it!

407
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,253
It's done.

408
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,106
Thank you.

409
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,560
Take a break for a while until your fingers heal.

410
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,520
Listen to the song in the meantime.

411
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,000
I said no practice.

412
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,833
Put it down.

413
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,530
[To help you see the chords more clearly.]

414
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,052
Good timing. We are teaming up.

415
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:59,660
This game, I will play your opponent.

416
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,140
What?

417
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,940
Be my guess. Play for the team you want.

418
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,480
What the heck is your problem?

419
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,900
That was one hell of a tackle.

420
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,180
Ouch! Shit!

421
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,380
What are you playing?

422
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,760
I'm doing what you did to my brother.

423
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,380
Yes! I am Sarawat's brother!

424
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,150
Fuck you!

425
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,892
You have an appointment for the x-ray tomorrow.

426
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:05,253
I am not available tomorrow morning.

427
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,109
Can we postpone it for later?

428
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,199
Your doctor is free only tomorrow morning.

429
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,446
After that, he is fully booked.

430
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,573
We can't postpone it.

431
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,413
Wat.

432
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,623
Wat.

433
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,881
- Wat!
- Yes.

434
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,731
What is on your mind?

435
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,320
Nothing.

436
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,150
The nurse told me you have to come for an x-ray tomorrow.

437
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,280
Just come. I will be fine.

438
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,126
But you are performing.

439
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:44,853
Do you think I went through all the practice just to bother you at the end?

440
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,520
Can you take me somewhere today?

441
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,083
Where?

442
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,060
Why do you want to come here?

443
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,940
I can't come to see you tomorrow.

444
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,473
Just take it as a big rehearsal.

445
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,140
- Play?
- Yes. Go up on stage.

446
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,940
I'll be your audience.

447
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,350
Come on. If you can't perform for one person,

448
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,290
you can't perform in front of a bunch of people tomorrow.

449
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,480
Why are you fidgeting?

450
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,860
I don't know.

451
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,626
Being up here makes me nervous.

452
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,850
Hey! What are you doing?

453
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,040
Filming you.

454
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,540
Imagine yourself as a protagonist in a movie.

455
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,459
You are a well-trained guitar player.

456
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,779
It's a scene where you're about to perform in front of many people.

457
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,646
They are screaming and cheering for you.

458
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,192
You are so great. It's the ending scene of the movie.

459
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:31,624
A happy ending, you know?

460
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,960
- The ending scene?
- Yes. A happy ending.

461
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,680
That makes me even more nervous.

462
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,100
Well. It's not a big movie. It's just a short film.

463
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,500
Only a small project for your class.

464
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,890
A short film for class? It still makes me nervous.

465
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,090
I can't.

466
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,020
Let's say it's just a video clip, not a film.

467
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,160
A video clip that only I can see.

468
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,540
- Only you?
- Yes.

469
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,840
- You sure?
- Yes.

470
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,000
Fine then.

471
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,730
3, 2, 1. Action!

472
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,050
What? Action?

473
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,340
I mean… You can play now.

474
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,512
You can start now. Start.

475
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:13,573
- Now?
- Yes.

476
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:15,130
Should I play now?

477
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,240
Action!

478
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,400
- Now?
- Yes. Action!

479
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,550
Tine! Are you okay?

480
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,461
- Sarawat!
- What are you guys doing here?

481
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,540
We're bringing snacks for Sarawat.

482
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,040
- He is not here.
- Is he still in recovery?

483
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,460
Yes. But… if you leave them here,

484
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,960
I promise Sarawat will get them. Each one of them.

485
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,399
It's okay.

486
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,990
Leave them here.

487
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,890
Are you ready, Tine? The event will commence soon.

488
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,423
I am.

489
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,300
Just leave for now.

490
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,280
- Come back again when I'm done greeting. Okay?
- Yes.

491
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,580
Tine, keep fighting. We are rooting for you here.

492
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,153
Come back later.

493
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,049
Welcome everyone to our Music Club shows.

494
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,119
Our club members will perform acoustic songs for you.

495
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,340
If you're ready, let's welcome the first show on stage.

496
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,166
Go and slay.

497
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,040
Hi, guys. My name is Tine…

498
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,930
Tine, Mr. Chic! Let's cheer for him!

499
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,930
Hi, guys! I am Tine, Mr. Chic. The one and only.

500
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,170

My friend here is too chicken to ask you himself.
