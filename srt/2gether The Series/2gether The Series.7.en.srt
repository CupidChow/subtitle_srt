00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,760
♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:23,020
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,030
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,600
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,010
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:47,080
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and unconsciously
fell in love with you ♫

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,740
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,600
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,720
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,790
♫ Just being able to love you, I can't force myself
to forget about you ♫

12
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,290
♫ I've fallen in love with you, I can't force myself
to forget about you ♫

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,319
I was here watching their concert last year. I got the same feeling.

14
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,739
God! I miss that time. I was really happy.

15
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,250
I know.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,320
How did you know?

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,700
Because… you looked so happy at this concert.

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,559
Let's go. Stop asking.

19
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:55,680
A year has passed but I still remember the feeling so well.

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,820
It was the first Scrubb concert in my life.

21
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,370
The songs they played were those I had listened to a thousand times before.

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,020
But when I got to hear them at a live concert,

23
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,750
the good songs sounded even better.

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,132
Scrubb will have a moment with fans after the concert.

25
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:16,020
Can you take a photo of me and them?

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,220
Wait! Did you misunderstand something here?

27
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,560
At our lustful party,

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,330
everyone must speak up about one truth that is on their mind.

29
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,506
You asked me which Scrubb concert I liked the most.

30
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:36,380
I am about to tell you here. How is it wrong?

31
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,820
Wrong! Because the Scrubb concert that you like the most

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,940
is definitely not that one.

33
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,170
This recent one sure is.

34
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,400
I couldn't see. So, I grabbed his shoulder. That's all.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,440
If you don't believe me, ask him.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Now that you mention it, my friend.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,100
How did you feel to have someone holding on to you like that?

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,580
Happy.

39
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,760
You turned red.

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,150
What are you looking at?

41
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,493
If you were my boyfriend,

42
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,870
I'd kiss you everywhere from your hair to your shadow.

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,760
You really are a perv.

44
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,140
Man told me to practice that line with you in case we see Green.

45
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,560
I just didn't think anyone would blush at it.

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,246
Damn! I can't be more envious.

47
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:10,660
I heard you met someone at a seminar.

48
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,540
When will you introduce us to your special someone?

49
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,469
Introduce? In my dreams!

50
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:18,460
We haven't said a word to each other yet.

51
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,760
I heard that he is attending a meditation retreat.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,580
I don't know if I'm going to follow him there.

53
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,280
Follow him?

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,620
Once you step foot in a temple, you will get burned to death by hellfire.

55
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,590
Not arguing about that.

56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,550
But trying to change is not going to hurt.

57
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,739
- Like you guys.
- How so?

58
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,670
Look at Sarawat. He changed.

59
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,420
He is on IG, the thing he never laid eyes on.

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,460
He is a very possessive kind of guy but lets you borrow his guitar.

61
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,120
Because of that, I get to see him smile like normal people.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,350
[Faculty Building]
I have news for you.

63
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,220
It's our club tradition to form a band out of the top skilled members.

64
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,620
The band is called CTRL S. Sarawat will be the bandleader.

65
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,070
And this is their poster.

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,190
Upside down.

67
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,560
Sorry.

68
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,580
If you think this is cool, you need to see my…

69
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,500
I heard that you named the band yourself.

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,506
What is it from?

71
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,000
On a computer, we hit CTRL + S to save.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,100
It's like we are saving good memories in our hearts.

73
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,960
Nice name.

74
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,960
It reminds me of when I named my band…

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,980
P'Dim, besides the poster, do we get any more surprises from the band?

76
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,540
I'll get to the point then.

77
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,826
Damn you, Air!

78
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:06,969
To catch up with the trend these days, we will have a music video to promote the band.

79
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,470
Sarawat will be the male lead.

80
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,650
But we are looking for a female lead.

81
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,730
So may I just choose now?

82
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,820
You wish.

83
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,409
Stop it, Green. I said "female." Knock it off!

84
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,430
Let's go for… Earn!

85
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,870
Yes. You're a band member anyway. It's like a band promo.

86
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,010
Yes. You're a band member anyway. It's like a band promo.

87
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,630
Go for it.

88
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,570
You too, Wat.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,420
Clap your hands, people.

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,070
Are you guys jealous of Earn?

91
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,830
How about it?

92
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,080
Want some?

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,670
No. You eat.

94
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,340
Not hungry?

95
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,290
I just want to be with you.

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,733
I will be busier with my band and stuff.

97
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,860
You might not be seeing me often.

98
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,030
Come closer.

99
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,370
I have something to say.

100
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,686
What the heck are you doing?

101
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,500
Too much air in my stomach.

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,793
I think you should go puke in the toilet.

103
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:32,970
I already did.

104
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,830
Puke again.

105
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,770
You just spoiled the mood.

106
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,270
Haha! So funny.

107
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,290
Sarawat! Can I have your number?

108
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,900
I'll call you and discuss the music video tonight.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,120
Thank you.

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,420
Don't call so late.

111
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,250
I thought I would message you but then it'd be so hard for you to type things right.

112
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,680
I type okay now.

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,170
Really?

114
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,860
So how is it going with the song?

115
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,960
It's going all right. But I will be free to practice only after classes.

116
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,700
Can I go practice with you when I finish classes, too?

117
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,320
May we have your phone, please?

118
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,612
Can't I take it inside with me?

119
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:25,750
No, sir.

120
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,772
Just in case I need to exchange contacts with anyone for discussing Dhamma.

121
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:32,399
No, Sir. People normally come here to escape from heartbreak or unfortunate situations.

122
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,600
Contacting with the outside world is prohibited.

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
But some people might be here hoping to find love.

124
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,279
That's even more impossible.

125
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,545
Everyone in this camp is forbidden to talk to each other.

126
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,820
What? We can't even talk on breaks?

127
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,900
No, sir. If you're not sure, you can still change your mind.

128
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Here then.

129
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,520
Thank you.

130
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:03,840
Right foot.

131
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Left foot.

132
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,560
Focus on your steps.

133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,920
Right foot.

134
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,089
Left foot.

135
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,980
Try to focus on your breathing.

136
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,390
When you breathe in, think "Bud."

137
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,230
When you breathe out, think "Dho."

138
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,120
Try to control your mind.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,390
Excuse me, Can we switch places?

140
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,013
Thank you.

141
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,400
You go!

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,770
That's it.

143
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:52,020
I heard Sarawat is forming a new band.

144
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,280
Yes. Why?

145
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,480
His guitarist is so cute. What's her name?

146
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,579
It's time to leave now. I will go to bed early.

147
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,360
What? It's only 8.

148
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,680
I need to get enough sleep for the cheerleader photoshoot tomorrow.

149
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,126
I need to have nice and clear skin.

150
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,280
Unlike yours.

151
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,750
Fine. I will get out of here then.

152
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,239
Green! What are you doing here?

153
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,839
Can I get inside, please?

154
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,049
No. Just go back.

155
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,700
Tine, listen to me first.

156
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,420
My ex-boyfriend is chasing me.

157
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,210
I don't know where else to hide.

158
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,014
I think you might be able to help.

159
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,520
Please help.

160
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,620
Please, Tine.

161
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,020
Please.

162
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,800
My ex-boyfriend is a short-tempered guy.

163
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,790
He always hurt me when I did something wrong.

164
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,730
I couldn't take it so I asked to take a break.

165
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,370
And he refused, didn't he?

166
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,320
He didn't refuse.

167
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,910
But when he found out I had a new boyfriend, he got really jealous.

168
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,110
He went to see me at my dorm.

169
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,640
I saw him first so I ran to you.

170
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,520
Hold on a second. Who is your new boyfriend?

171
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Do not say that…

172
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:39,140
It's you, Tine.

173
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,280
Just what I thought.

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,900
I guess he's on his way here.

175
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,200
He doesn't know that you live here.

176
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,610
(Shit.)

177
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,619
Tine, it's my ex.

178
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,493
What do I do?

179
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,413
Let's do this.

180
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,310
You open the door.

181
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,779
Really?

182
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,270
Open it.

183
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,486
P'Dim!

184
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,429
- Are you Green's boyfriend?
- Ex-boyfriend.

185
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,493
When did we break up, Green?

186
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:46,060
On that day.

187
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,300
We broke up for two minutes and then made love in bed.

188
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,630
Is this what you call a breakup?

189
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,700
Why do you think I brought Green who can't play any musical instrument into Music Club?

190
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,100
Of course, I needed to keep an eye on him.

191
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,840
I just didn't think that his new lover is in the club, too.

192
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,306
It's not that. You're misunderstanding.

193
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,190
Step aside if you don't want to get hurt.

194
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,313
No. You might be his boyfriend, but you have no right to hurt him.

195
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:21,900
I said step aside!

196
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,313
Green, I am sorry.

197
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,333
I am sorry I hurt you.

198
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,206
I know how you feel now.

199
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,293
It hurts me so bad to see you with someone else.

200
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,966
Aren't you here to yell at me?

201
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,353
No.

202
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,940
I came to apologize

203
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,280
and tell him something.

204
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,493
If you hurt Green, prepare to get hurt even more.

205
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,046
P'Dim.

206
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,953

207
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:28,153
Does it hurt?

208
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,060
It did... but the pain is gone now.

209
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,893
Will you forgive me?

210
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,990
I can never be angry with you.

211
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,120
Come on. Let's go home.

212
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,093
Tine, I am sorry.

213
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,466
I won't be bothering you again.

214
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,126
I hope you and Sarawat are together forever.

215
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,453
Let's go home.

216
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,489
Someone dropped this.

217
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,073
I think it is his.

218

People normally come here to escape from heartbreak or unfortunate situations.

219

Thank you.

220
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,825
Excuse me. Have you seen the guy sleeping next to me last night?

221
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,719
He went home. How can I help?

222
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,439
Can I have his number, please?

223
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,771
I can't give you that. It's personal information.

224
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,251
Go back to your meditation, please.

225
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,839
- Please. At least tell me his name.
- I really can't.

226
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:51,891
Please, pretty lady.

227
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,192
The young man who went home forgot to take his phone.

228
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:57,792
I'll just leave it here. I will call someone to pick it up later.

229

Yesterday, Green was…

231
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,586
Good timing. Try this.

What are you playing now?

What kind of person do you think I am?

This is good and I want to share it with you.

235
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,800
Hasn't it ever occurred to you…

236
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,110
that when you see something nice, you want to share it with me?

237
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,843
No?

238
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,610
I don't know. What kind of question is this?

239

Try to get to know each other.

You don't have to like me very much.

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,210
Just keep your heart open for me.

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Did you just practice your lines with me?

245
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,830
Do you think I just confessed my love to you?

246
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,506
What a relief!

247
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,233
Sorry. My class finished later than expected.

248
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,689
Did they start with the makeup yet?

249

No one is here yet.

250
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,686
That's great. Sarawat, have you seen the new playlist?

251
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,030
Well, how about we play the Desktop Error song?

252
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,840
It's really difficult.

The Connect is also interesting.

255

See? I included their songs here. I know you so well, don't I?

256
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,560
Are you guys trying to pick a song?

257
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,270
Let me help you.

258
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,240
You don't know any bands besides Scrubb.

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,380
Stay out of it.

260
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:07,740
I just heard this song the other day.

261
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,010
It is super awesome. Just listen.

262
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,359
If it's great, we can include this one instead.

263
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,569
Right! I heard it and thought of you.

I am going to go get us some drinks.

- It's good.
- It's awesome.

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,389
Include it on the list. It's a good choice.

That's why I want you to hear it.

270

I don't know.

295
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,999
He might be courting some girl.

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,319
He usually talks about Nong…

297

What's the name?

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,279
But I think… he is playing soccer.

Sometimes I walk past a soccer field at midnight,

I still see him playing and gambling with his Engineering friends.

I think we need to bet a little.

303
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,993
I bet 100 baht that he's courting a girl.

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,066
Hello, professor.

331
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,013
P'Mil!

332
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,360
You.

333
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:36,360
Yeah! Woohoo!

334
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,099
Stop the time. This kid interrupted the game.

335
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:42,033
Start over.

336
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:45,069
If you lose, you lose, man. Pay up.

337
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,159
What the heck are you doing here?

338
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,599
You said you would be my tutor. You never showed your face.

339
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,340
Mil.

340
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:10,110
Are you going to play or not? If you aren't, we will go celebrate.

341
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,909
Sure I am. I am going to empty your pockets.

342
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,460
Wait. What about the tutoring?

343
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Do you want me to tutor you that bad?

344
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,490
You sketch this football court and turn it in.

345
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,533
Are we done here?

346
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,559
Let's continue.

347
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,640
Pass it to me.

348
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,433
Are you okay, man?

349
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,653
Do you have a substitute?

350
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,450
Phukong, over here.

351
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:58,646
Thanks.

352
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:02,579
Let's do it again sometime. Later, guys!

353
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,160
You are a super-sub.

354
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,693
Want some water?

355
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,940
Here. I was just kidding.

356
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,839
Cheers!

357
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,213
To my freedom.

358
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,119
Now that Green is out of the picture, you can flirt with girls all you want.

359
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
Where should we start?

360
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,849
Did you forget something?

361
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,860
Tine has Music Club today.

362
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,200
So what? Green has stopped bothering me.

363
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,390
I don't have to go to the club to meet Sarawat anymore.

364
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,990
Wherever you want to go, whatever you want to do, just tell us.

365
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,066
We will be at your service.

366
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,569
I hadn't felt freedom like this for a long time.

367
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,759
What should we do first? I have no idea.

368
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,020
If you can't think of one, we have a solution for you.

369
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,680
Clear the table.

370
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,600
- What are you doing?
- Ohm, go get the cardboard.

371
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,893
Get rid of the plates.

372
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,000
Selfie with the girls nearest to you!

373
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,505
Excuse me. Can we take selfies with you two, please?

374
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,880
It's part of the game.

375
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,453
Can we get closer?

376
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,603
Come on.

377
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,510
Get down, please. I can't see you guys.

378
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,826
Go check out hot Faculty cheerleaders!

379
00:29:28,546 --> 00:29:31,253
Oh my gosh!

380
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,300
I just can't.

381
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,513
Be more flexible.

382

♫ Whoa-oh, shiny town ♫

384

♫ Whoa-oh, shiny town ♫

385

♫ Whoa-oh, shiny town ♫

386
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,710
Party with girls all night long!

387
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,600
Cheers!

388
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,046
Cheers. Bottoms up.

389
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,580
Wat!

390
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,689
Look again. Cheers

391
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,839
She is so cute.

392
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,400
No.

393
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,333
Bottoms up!

394
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,826
Drink up.

Sorry to bother you. My air-con doesn't work.

402
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:19,141
Sure. Make yourself at home.

403
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:22,560
What's wrong with the air-con anyway?

404
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,360
I don't know. It wasn't cooling.

405
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,879
When was the last time you had someone clean it?

406
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,049
I don't know. I'm sleepy. I'm going to go to bed.

407
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,793
Hey! Sarawat posted a picture of you holding onto his shoulder at the Scrubb's concert.

408
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,985
I don't care what picture he posts.

409
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:49,386
You don't have to tell me.

410
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,433
Hey. He posted another one.

411
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,599
This one… you have to see it.

412
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,939
I don't give a shit!

413
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,790
His posts don't concern me anymore.

414
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,290
But it's a picture of Scrubb's concert last year at the university.

415
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,540
What? Why didn't he tell me he was there, too?

416
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,240
Where have you been? I don't see you at the club these days.

417
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,659
I am sorry. I've been busy with the cheerleading practice.

418
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,953
Anyway, have you seen Sarawat?

419
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:51,899
Sarawat? He is out promoting his band.

420
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,199
He won't be at the club for a while. What's the matter?

421
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,470
Nothing. I will be on my way now.

422
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,410
Hold on. Come here.

423
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,710
I have something to ask.

424
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:05,440
Have you told anyone about Green?

425
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,863
No.

426
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,623
That's good.

427
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:18,940
I have no problem with that but Green kind of does.

428
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,750
He doesn't want everyone to act weird around him.

429
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,260
So only a few people know about us.

430
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,339
The ones who know are friends and a few juniors.

431
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,780
Temp does. Sarawat does.

432
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,286
Sarawat?

433
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:39,289
Sarawat knows about Green?

434
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,240
Be quiet.

435
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,490
People are now looking at us.

436
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,973
Yes.

437
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,300
He was there when I started a relationship with Green at the freshmen orientation.

438
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,650
He was one of the first people to know.

439
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,006
If he did, why did he agree to help me?

440
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:00,013
Help what?

441
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,065
No, it's nothing.

442
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,860
See you later.

443
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,593
Hey!

444
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,099
Your guitar, take it back.

445
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,706
I will buy a new one.

446
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:37,513
You keep it.

447
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,119
It's been yours since day one.

448
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,513
"Tine Teepakorn."

449
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,220
It looks more like a room now. Do you see pillars here?

450
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,180
Hey! What have you done to the real P'Mil?

451
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,279
I usually see you as a hazer. Never imagined you as a tutor.

452
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:26,119
Is he the one Mil has been talking about?

453
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,501
The one that is very cute.

454
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,550
Hey. I am a tutor and a boxer.

455
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,373
Wanna try? Do you want to get punched?

456
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,179
You're here to see Wat?

457
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:54,579
He's rehearsing at the university. I think it will take all night.

458
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,729
That's why I came to grab his homework for him.

459
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,150
You might find him in a rehearsal studio.

460
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,839
I saw the picture he posted on his IG.

461
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,249
He met me before, didn't he?

462
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,489
IG?

463
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:12,092
Just tell me. I want to know the truth.

464
00:37:12,092 --> 00:37:14,200
Come on.

465
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,353
It was at Scrubb's concert.

466
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,980
My friends and I dragged him to see Scrubb's concert.

467
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,800
Just before he started to get bored, a person in front of him was jumping and having fun.

468
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,546
That guy stepped on Wat's foot.

469
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,290
He told me then...

470
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,920
that he had never seen anyone listening to music so happily before.

471
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,279
When he heard that you guys wanted to get Scrubb's autographs,

472
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,986
he followed you.

473
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,453
I think we should abort the plan.

474
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:21,310
Why?

475
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,230
It's not like we see them every day.

476
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,805
I know. But look at the number of their fans.

477
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,380
It's going to take forever until they can rest.

478
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,926
If I sit this one out, I can spare them a bit more rest time.

479
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,459
If you're not taking a photo with them, should we go then?

480
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,139
Who said I wasn't?

481
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,320
If I don't, how can I call myself the biggest fan?

482
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,986
P'Muei, are you tired?

483
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,739
Here. Make them look good.

484
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,713
Sure.

485
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,000
One, two...

486
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,452
Awesome. They look so good.

487
00:39:05,453 --> 00:39:07,260
They are tired already.

488
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,593
You are crazy.

489
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:11,303
See?

490
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,593
One, two...

491
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,920
Smokin' hot!

492
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,080
Me?

493
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,153
That's the story.

494
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,320
Tine, why are you still here so late?

495
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,620
You have music practice?

496
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,790
No.

497
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,759
I am looking for my friend.

498
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,320
But I am about to leave.

499
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,849
Wait a second. Let me take you home.

500
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,979
It's okay.

501
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,439
Why? Are you scared of me?

502
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:13,093
I won't do you any harm.

503
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:26,749
I can take him home. Stay away.

504
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:29,073
What if I don't want to?

505
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,080
Try me.

506
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,650
What's the matter with you?

507
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,434
You let him pat your head just like that?

508
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:54,860
What I do is my business.

509
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,809
You've been lying to me all this time. Do I get to say anything?

510
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,489
I've been lying to you about what, Tine?

511
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,820
You already knew that Green and P'Dim were dating.

512
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,933
And you met me before at the concert last year.

513
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,780
Are you having fun taking me for a fool?

514
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,480
Huh? It's so damn fun. Right?

515
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,159
It's not like I kept it a secret just to play with your feelings.

516
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,411
Why did you do it then?

517
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:30,612
Because I really wanted to hit on you.

518
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,673
But you like Earn…

519
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,086
Just so you know,

520
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:52,140
Earn already has a boyfriend.

521
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,240
And the only one I've always had feelings for…

522
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,493
…is you, Tine.

523
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,306
I like you. I've liked you since the first second I saw you.

524
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,740
If it's so, why did you refuse

525
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,760
to help me from the beginning?

526
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,320
How could I start then?

527
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,393
You said you liked girls.

528
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:27,570
Even if I started, you'd ask me to get back to the way things were anyway.

529
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,060
You would definitely want us to get back to life before we met.

530
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,870
Can you ever think of me more than a friend?

531
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,240
I posted that picture on IG...

532
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,400
just to let you know

533
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:47,810
that even though you didn't ask me to be your fake date,

534
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,333
you would never be a stranger to me.

535
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,239
I didn't talk to you.

536
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,220
I didn't go to see you.

537
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,946
I did what you asked.

538
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,280
I thought I could handle it.

539
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,806
But when I saw you with someone else,

540
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,559
I don't think I can stop my feelings anymore.

541
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,906
And do you think I can?

542
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,866
From the day you disappeared, my life was never the same.

543
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:29,986
Whatever I did or wherever I went, you caught up with me.

544
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,453
Even in my dreams, you were there teasing me.

545
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,060
Are you going to take responsibility for what you did?

546
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,883
Huh?

547
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,780
I can't go back to fake flirting with you anymore.

548
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,290
From now on, I'm going to flirt for real.

549
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,670
Do you want to try?

550
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,870
Try to get to know each other.

551
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:13,240
You don't have to like me very much.

552
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,290
Just keep your heart open for me.

553
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,300
I really mean it. This is not a script.
