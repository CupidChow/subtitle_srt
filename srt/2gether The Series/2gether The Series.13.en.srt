00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,713
I… I want a love song...

2
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:09,150
that describes two close friends.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,900
They are so close that...

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,530
they take their relationship for granted.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,504
One day, the other friend has a new best friend.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,070
They don't do what they used to do together anymore.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,960
And it's when she realizes...

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,190
how much she loves her friend.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,352
She is willing to do anything…

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,152
to get her friend back.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,296
You are not talking about the song.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,840
You are talking about us, aren't you?

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,353
Right.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,212
I love you.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,536
And I know you feel the same way.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,916
Can we still go back to the way we were?

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,570
I am sorry, Pam.

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,303
Why?

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,048
I met you first.

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,940
Why didn't you ask me out back then?

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,552
Why…?

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,088

39

Hold on. We're about to reach the car.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,824
Where are you taking him?

41
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,359
Don't stop me. I am taking him to a hospital.

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,552
Back off! I will take him myself.

43

You back off!

44
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,504
I told you I will take him there myself.

45

Calm down, man.

46
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,190
Where the hell have you been?

47
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,008
You can't even take good care of your boyfriend.

48
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,020
And you think you can freaking ask for anything now?

49

Tine.

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,930

Between Pam and me, it's not what you think.

Why were you hugging her then?

60
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,192
Pam was hugging me goodbye.

61
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,810
She is studying abroad with her boyfriend.

62

Sorry for causing a misunderstanding between you two.

You okay?

69
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,360
Do you still have a stomachache?

between you and Wat?

72
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,260
He lied to me.

73
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,184
I asked him directly.

74
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,032
He said he didn't have feelings for Pam.

75
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,049
It didn't seem that way from the way I saw it.

Calm down.

77

Pam?

78
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,480
His first love.

79
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,124
You know what?

80
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,860
I thought he wrote me a song.

81
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,868
It turned out that I was wrong.

82
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,616
He wrote the song for Pam.

83
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,912
I feel like I am an idiot.

84
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,376
I hate liars.

85
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,952
When I am in a relationship, I trust my love with all my heart.

86
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:18,648
But he just took me for a fool.

87
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,832
He lied to my face all he wanted.

88
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,900
What he has done for me was real or not,

89
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,640
I just can't tell anymore.

90
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,492
Being lied to hurts.

91
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,910
But being lied to by the one you trust…

92
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,064
It hurts like hell.

93
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,356
If it hurts that bad,

94
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,588

I want to see you before I close my eyes to sleep.

167
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,880
And I want to see you first thing after I wake up.

168
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,410
Thank you for moving in with me.

169
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,516
100 honey toasts, please.

170
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:35,549
Why are you here? I have nothing else to teach you.

171
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,079
I didn't come for an extra class. Because I passed the test.

172
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,859
And?

173
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,740
And I want a faculty tour from a senior.

174
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,250
Should we go now?

175
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,579
Do I have to?

176
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,784
So you want to stay and make me 100 honey toasts?

177
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,152
Wow! Which one is yours?

178
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:00,100
Be quiet, would you?

179
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,639
This piece is yours, isn't it?

180
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,130
How can you tell?

181
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,980
That guy is having a honey toast.

182
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,829
That's me, right?

183
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,930
Are you the only one in this world who can have a honey toast?

184
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,640
The initial M. M as in Mil?

185
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,509
Is there anything else to see?

186
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,688
There is one more place.

187
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,160
Are we there yet?

188
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,693
We are.

189
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,000
When I need to clear my head,

190
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,752
I always come up here.

191
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,730
You can too if you need to clear your head.

192
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,104
I hope I get a chance to be here.

193
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,360
You said that because...

194
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,000
you didn't pass the test, did you?

195
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,436
You knew?

196
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,250
Chat and I used your ID to search for the result online.

197
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,796
You didn't pass.

198
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:42,628
I didn't mean to lie.

199
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,588
I…

200
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,340
I needed an excuse to see you once again.

201
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,990
My band is playing at Jae Tun's place tonight.

202
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,449
Come.

203
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,079
Can I really come?

204
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,910
Of course, you can.

205
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,620
I'm off for the music practice now.

206
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,570
See you at the shop at 7:00 p.m.

207
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,730
Hold on. We're about to reach the car.

208
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes, P'Mil.

209
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,389
Sorry I didn't show up yesterday.

210
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,628
Something came up.

211
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:09,970
Your friend told me you needed to take P'Tine to a hospital.

212
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,650
I understand.

213
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,680
I guess P'Tine needs you more than I do.

214
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,276
Don't worry about it.

215
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm going to hang up now.

216
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,790
The movie is about to start. I have a date.

217
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,323
Yeah?

218
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,748
Why am I seeing you all alone on the bleacher?

219
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,727
Should I come to you?

220
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:41,768
You better not.

221
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:47,604
If you walk right in, I might not let you go to P'Tine again.

222
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,020
I get it.

223
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,333
Then…

224
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,123
Bye now.

225
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:04,532
Good luck to you.

226
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,370
[#TeamSarawatsWives - They've broken up!]

227
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,971
[Great! They don't match.]

228
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,719
[It served him right.]

229
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,999
[Sarawat has come back to us.]

230
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,896
[My husband is single again.]

231
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,910
Do they really think he will date them now that you two have broken up?

232
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,470
Stop reading it. What a waste of time!

233
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,270
Let's find something else to do.

234
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,810
I'm going to put it here. Just don't read it.

235
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,250
Look!

236
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,050
Today, last year, we were at the Scrubb concert.

237
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,600
I miss that time.

238
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,050
Hey! The movie you want to see premieres tomorrow. You want to go?

239
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,653
Tine.

240
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,340
It's okay.

241
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,850
I have somewhere to go tomorrow.

242
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,580
Are you here hoping to see Sarawat?

243
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,213
No.

244
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,450
I just… came to reminisce one last time.

245
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,130
The place where everything started.

246
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,140
Unlike me.

247
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,860
I came to recall my old Sarawat.

248
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,520
His eyes before they had laid on you.

249
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,470
I had always liked him.

250
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,348
And I thought he felt the same way.

251
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,160
I waited for him to confess his feelings.

252
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:09,410
Until that day, we came here for the concert.

253
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,712
And he met you, Tine.

254
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:16,460
From then on, his eyes changed.

255
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,680
I learned the truth long ago.

256
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,690
That's why I went to a different university.

257
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,704
I thought I could forget about him.

258
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,364
But one day, he posted your photo on his IG.

259
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,000
He didn't have the guts to say he liked me,

260
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,850
but he told everyone on social media about you.

261
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,660
That made me wonder if I came back,

262
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,890
would things be different?

263
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,990
But no.

264
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,292
How do you know?

265
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:04,500
I think he still loves you.

266
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,030
- Answer me!
- Pam!

267
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,673
I am sorry.

268
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,200
I can't love you.

269
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,980
He tried to hide it, but I knew he was writing a love song for you.

270
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,330
He told you that...

271
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,580
because he felt guilty about me.

272
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,016
About the song…

273
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,612
Give it a try.

274
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,084
Why do I have to?

275
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,480
Just listen to it and you will know.

276
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,764
What nice weather!

277
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,510
May I sit here and read with you?

278
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,720
Do whatever you want.

279
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,190
Just don't bother me.

280
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,088
Loving you is kind of bothering?

281
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,160
I will haunt you every day.

282
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,610
I will stick with you no matter what.

283
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,409
I can follow you for the rest of my life.

284
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,892
Did you ask me if I wanted to be followed?

285
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,100
We will see about that.

286
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,632
You have to miss me if I don't show up one day.

287
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,520
Excuse me. Your friend came here the other day.

288
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,279
He asked me to return this to you.

289
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,933
Thank you.

What a surprise that you are Tine's brother.

298
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,370
Do I know you?

299
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,940
You don't remember me?

300
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,780
No. You were never in my memories.

301
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,900

Who is he anyway?

00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,840
He comes to play with us every day.

315
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,440
I don't know. I guess he doesn't have any friends.

316
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,300
What is wrong with you?

317
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,060
The contest is about to start. Why aren't you in practice?

318
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,390
Why do you care?

319
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,440
It's none of your business.

320
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,359
Fine. I will play with you.

321
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,820
That's two.

322
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,266
Two what? It was the first goal.

323
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:47,336
Two times you've lost to me.

324
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:50,600
One for soccer and one for Tine.

325
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:55,980
And when did I lose Tine to you?

326
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:59,320
Just look at yourself now!

327
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,760
If my band wins the contest this year,

328
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,460
I'll ask Tine out.

329
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,820
And if you can't take it, don't dare show your face at the contest.

330
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,650
I am warning you.

331
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,604
You must treat me to BBQ pork this time.

332
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,524
You bailed on me last time.

333
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,874
Trust me on this. I won't bail this time.

334
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,149
- We'll see about that.
- Come on.

335
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:51,948
I won't ditch you.

336
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,630
I don't trust you.

337
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:04,970
Man.

338
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:07,464
Man!

339
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,524
Why are you avoiding me?

340
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,360
I am not.

341
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,910
Are you still mad about what P'Beam said?

342
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,400
Hell yes.

343
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,490
I am mad because I was insulted.

344
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,060
I am mad because you didn't try to protect me a bit.

345
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:30,356
And I am mad at myself the most because I suck just like they said.

346
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,610
You know what?

347
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,220
I promised myself that I won't see you again

348
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,880
until I am more mature.

349
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,559
I don't know if I can ever be mature in this life.

350
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,393
You cannot.

351
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,832
You can't even keep your promise.

352
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,930
What promise?

353
00:34:57,832 --> 00:35:00,550
You promised to come and see me every day.

354
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,056
You came into my life, and followed me around every day.

355
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:06,800
And now you want to disappear on me?

356
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,772
All you can do is talk.

357
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,710
But you already have P'Beam.

358
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,556
Who told you that?

359
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,104
I don't want a luxurious life.

360
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:24,440
I just want a simple life.

361
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,800
Are you okay with this?

362
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,972
I have nothing for you.

363
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:34,005
I am not.

364
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,420
You said you would take care of me.

365
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:38,960
Find a way to do it.

366
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,260
If you can pester me everywhere, taking care of me won't be so hard.

367
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,253
I guess so.

368
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,304
Will you take me home today?

369
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,540
No.

370
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,710
- What?
- Just joking.

371
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:01,430
Didn't you drive here?

372
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,463
I did.

373
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:06,060
But I want to ride through smoke and dust with you.

374
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,570
Dust?

375
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,230
That's unexpected.

376
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:13,610
It's not nice and clean.

377
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,990
Will you take me home or not?

378
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,530
It's hot out there.

379
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,630
I know.

380
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,280
Of course, I will.

381
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,540
I won't let you go home alone.

382
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,419
So… are we cool now?

383
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,020
Then…

384
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,800
- Can I hug you?
- No.

385
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,870
Come on. There is no one around.

386
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,460
Give me a hug.

387
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,993
Fine.

Don't mind him.

392
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,087
Let's go!

393
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:24,563
What? Do you want to eat BBQ pork?

394
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:25,640
No.

395
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,980
Why not? Are you on a diet?

396
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,304
- I want to go home.
- BBQ pork and dessert.

397
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:33,442
- No. I want to go home.
- It won't take that long.

Sorry, I am late.

404
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,840
Hurry! I have set up the guitar for you.

405
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,053
Thanks.

Why do you have to look so nice and bright?

Ah! It's the Music Contest tomorrow.

Yeah?

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,848
And this guitar?

412
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:21,998
Why haven't you returned it to him?

413
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,440

I will but I need to take my name tag off first.

- Yes.

00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:36,616
Stop talking about this.

417

If he sees it, he will definitely tease you.

420

- Yes.

425
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,640
Can I have my guitar back?

426
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,980
Sorry.

427
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,512
I didn't mean to keep it.

428
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,990
I was going to return it to you.

429
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,748
That's okay.

430
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm just borrowing it for the contest.

Did I ever say you owe me anything?

447
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,390
Did you challenge my brother that if you win,

00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,600
you will take P'Tine out?

what do you want me to do?

453
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,150
Tine, I think you should give Sarawat one more chance.

He must be really remorseful.

00:46:42,404 --> 00:46:45,250
but I can't write one for you anyway.

499
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,352
I tried.

500
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,170
No matter how hard I tried, the lyrics wouldn't come out.

501
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,100
I don't know why.

502
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,196
All I know is that the only one I want to write a song for is Tine.

503
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,264
Though he doesn't want to hear it anymore.

504
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:18,488
Thanks, guys.

505
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,180
Here comes the last song from us.

506
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,124
I'm going to let someone perfect for the song take over my job.

507
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,833
Tine.

508
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:05,016
I don't know if you are listening.

509
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,252
I want you to know this.

510
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,324
Ever since I knew you,

511
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,832
this song has been stuck in my head.

512
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,688
Sometimes it sounds nice.

513
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,196
Sometimes it sounds weird.

514
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,732
But the song really makes me happy.

515
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,228
You know?

516
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,940
I never confessed to Pam,

517
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,576
because I just knew what love was when I met you.

518
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,650
This song is called "Tine."

Face up. Turn this way.

I will flirt until you agree to be my boyfriend.

Sorry. Just a bit more.

No one has ever put a band-aid on me before in my life.

And do you think I have ever done this for anyone?

544

Don't be afraid you will fall because I'm going to hug you like this all night.

I will find you a fan or something. Ouch!

I am fine. Don't worry about me.

- Worry about yourself.
- I am okay.

Are you all right? Come on. Get up.

551

I am not so sure you can take care of my little brother.

552

I won't ask you to believe me, but I will show you.

553
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,070
Who said I hit on him just to get rid of you?

554
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,650
I did it because I genuinely like Tine.

555
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,167
Just so you know.

556
00:53:39,168 --> 00:53:42,468
The only one I've always had feelings for…

557
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:44,536
…is you, Tine.

558

I like you.

I've liked you since the second I saw you.

Do you really think we will last 10 years?

561
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:55,692
I want to be with you more than that.

562
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:57,724
For me…

563
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,644
Tine is a living thing…

564
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,100
that I want to call "nuisance" for the rest of my life.

565
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,430
I just want to be with you.

If it is our movie, you can choose…

567
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:27,080
whether you want it to end with tragedy

568
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,909
or end with happiness.

What do you say? What will you choose?

570

Will you trust me again?

571
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,476
I wouldn't be here if I didn't trust you, would I?

572
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,590
Don't ever take it off again.

Have you ever wondered why we are in pairs?

603
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:56,524
- If you love someone, don't be quiet about it.
- Be quiet.

Tell that person right away.

If you are beginners, don't worry.

636

Please welcome P'Tine upfront to share his experience.

639
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,725
Hello, everyone.

640
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:41,889
I couldn't play any musical instrument.

641
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:46,250
I even practiced on a guitar app for that test

642
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,600
because I didn't have a guitar of my own.

643
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:54,160
I cheated at first, but I got caught.

644
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,460
So I had to play it with the little ability I had.

645
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:01,508
When I was done, the club president asked me about music.

646
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:03,979
I couldn't answer any of them.

647
01:01:03,979 --> 01:01:07,140
What? How did you pass?

648
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,659
For the last question, he asked me if I knew anything about music at all.

649
01:01:11,659 --> 01:01:15,249
Back then, I had a friend in this club.

650
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:18,939
So I said I didn't know anything about music.

651
01:01:18,939 --> 01:01:23,270
But I knew a friend named Sarawat.

652
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,850
He was the reason I wanted to play guitar.

653
01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:30,540
Do you want to know who Sarawat is?

654

Stand here.

661
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,860
Start with the basic chords.

662
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,740
C chord.

663
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,940
Wrong! The way to place your fingers is wrong.

664
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,483
Wrong!

665
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,380
Press harder and play.

666
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,740
Wrong!

667
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,740
A year has passed and your fingers are still weak.

668
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,690
Have you been practicing?

669
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,780
Wrong!

670
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,440
Aren't you embarrassed?

671
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,944
A member can't play a basic chord. Who would trust our club?

672
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:46,528
Stop teasing him!

673
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:49,230
Tine is about to cry.

674
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,911
Guys, don't be frightened.

675
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:53,980
P'Sarawat always teases his boyfriend like this.

677
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,176
Oh! You were teasing me?

678
01:03:03,176 --> 01:03:07,456
I pretended to yell but you really played it wrong.

679
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,600
That's it.

680
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,233
Good job.

681
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:21,052
As for our couple, I am not so sure what the reason is.

682
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,820
What I know is that when we are together,

683
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,784
we are the couple people are jealous of the most.

684
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,900
That's how we teach.

685
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,850
If you can't take it, you can withdraw.

686
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,093
It's still hot.

687
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,550
♫ I’ll do everything

688
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:53,080
♫ I’ll try every possible way, this makes me know well how things will be ♫

689
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,860
You don't have to do it.

690
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,824
Eat more.

691
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,047
Just stay put. Let's go see a movie.

692
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,940
How about we have dinner after the movie?

693
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,830
What is your stomach made of?

694
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:13,744
Your shirt is so cool.

695
01:04:13,744 --> 01:04:15,493
Man!

696
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,636
[Your P'Mil]

697
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,093
Damn it!

698
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,972
Fine. I surrender.

699
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:33,788
Don't!

700
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,010
Look at you.

You're playing it right. What's left to teach?

705
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,340
We are done with basic chords.

706
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,890
Let me teach you the harder ones.

707
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,360
Point your finger on the fifth string.

708
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,610
This one on the second string. This one on the fourth and this one on the third.

Ten years from now or even more,

711
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,496
our couple will be just you and me.

712
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,212
The Nuisance and the Handsome Prince.

♫ I don’t know when it started or who started it exactly ♫

715
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:11,890
♫ I don’t know if you came into my life or I came into yours ♫

716
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:17,410
♫ Maybe it’s just a coincidence, maybe it’s not ♫

717
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,740
♫ I still can’t figure it out ♫

718
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:29,440
♫ All I know is that the one in my heart is you ♫

719
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,110
♫ I don’t want anyone to come between us ♫

720
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:35,010
♫ We will stay side by side ♫

721

♫ Wherever you are, I’ll be right next to you ♫

722
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:42,430
♫ I own the space beside you ♫

723
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:45,980
♫ Because we are meant to be together ♫
