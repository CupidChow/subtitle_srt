1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
Nothing bad is going to happen anymore.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,239
Hey, Sarawat! Hey, Tine!

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,059
What are you two doing here?

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,260
Why don't you go back to camp?

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,739
We've looked for you everywhere.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,739
We needed shelter from the rain.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,079
In there?

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,940
Yes. Do we have any other choice?

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,659
Of course, you did it!

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,899
What?

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,619
Let's go.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,330
I can't believe you guys.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,486
You can wait on the bus.

14
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:03,713
I will help them load.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,673
About last night…

16
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,086
Thank you for helping me search for Tine.

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,093
Here.

18
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,606
I found it in the woods.

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,353
Try harder keeping it.

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,513
Or I will take it back.

21
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:08,553
Not a chance.

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,633
Wait!

23
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,640
What day is it today?

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,240
You can look on your phone screen.

25
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,860
I hope it's a good day.

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,459
I have nothing for you to keep.

27
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,860
Consider it a farewell gift from the tutor camp.

28
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,940
Going on a trip is more exhausting than studying.

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm talking to Man about work.

30
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,813
Really?

31
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,960
You can see for yourself.

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,933
I don't have any secrets.

33
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:25,099
Nope. I have something better to do.

34
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,740
You mean I can score with you now?

35
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,513
I mean I'm taking a shower!

36
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,459
Tine, I found your bracelet.

37
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,699
Really? Where?

38
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,500
Doesn't matter where.

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,025
Be more careful next time.

40
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:53,079
I am taking a shower. Why are you here?

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,319
I am taking a shower with you.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,659
I know you want more than just taking a shower.

43
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,450
How have you been? I miss you, Mr. Grumpy.

44
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,020
No, get out!

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,840
[2gether the Series]
[Episode 12]

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,890
♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,900
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

48
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,950
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

49
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,390
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

50
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,780
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:47,920
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and unconsciously
fell in love with you ♫

52
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:56,570
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

53
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,640
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,630
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

55
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:12,940
♫ Just being able to love you, I can't force
myself to forget about you ♫

56
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:21,190
♫ I've fallen in love with you, I can't force
myself to forget about you ♫

57
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,809
So how do you feel, Tine?

58
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,219
Tine.

59
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,901
I'm asking you how you feel about the song we just played.

60
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,753
I feel... sleepy.

61
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:37,713
What?

62
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,910
You want to sleep after we just played a rock song.

63
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,812
It's not about the song.

64
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:51,399
I am sleepy because I've been with you guys for weeks.

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,984
We need to practice hard. Competitors are tough this year.

66
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:58,032
Especially the former champion. Sarawat's favorite.

67
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,660
- Who?
- P'Mil's band!

68
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,089
Don't worry. We will win the contest.

69
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,819
Because we have Sarawat.

70
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,499
That's true.

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,340
I am the best guitarist.

72
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,819
I just posted a photo of you to gain more fans.

73
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,451
Oh! You got time to do that?

74
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:18,302
How about you practice more? You forgot the lyrics again.

75
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:24,573
If you love Sarawat, cheer for Ctrl S.

76
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,906
You look so cool, Mr. Grumpy.

77
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:34,946
We don't have any more water?

78
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,505
I'll get you guys some drinks.

79
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,379
You sit here. We'll go get them ourselves.

80
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,939
Keep on practicing. I'll handle that for you.

81
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,470
I want mineral water, not just water.

82
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,940
Excuse me. Which way is the Music Club?

83
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,839
It is that way. I am actually headed there.

84
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,129
Can I go with you, please? My friend is practicing there.

85
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,292
Who is your friend? I might know him.

86
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:07,346
His name is Sarawat. Do you know him?

87
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,579
This is Pam, my close friend from high school.

88
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,866
Pam, these are my friends.

89
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:19,412
Why haven't you told us you have such a cute friend?

90
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,013
Do you want to hear a love song?

91
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,180
No!

92
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,006
You guys just can't hide it when you see hot girls, can you?

93
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:31,330
What are you doing here, Pam?

94
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,209
I just dropped out of school.

95
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,579
I was thinking of studying here.

96
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,479
You dropped out of the Faculty of Medicine?

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,186
Why? You want to study Medicine here?

98
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:49,419
No. I want to be in the Faculty of Music here.

99
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,020
That's why I need a guitar teacher.

100
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,320
Well, I am a pro. I've been playing guitar since middle school.

101
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,529
Sorry. I am a slow learner.

102
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,319
My teacher has to be very patient.

103
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,920
Isn't it right, Teacher Sarawat?

104
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,140
Hold on.

105
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:13,560
Did you teach her guitar before?

106
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,399
Yes. A long time ago.

107
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,939
Pam, I am very busy right now.

108
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,860
We are practicing for the contest. I don't have time.

109
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,140
Sarawat, I came all the way here just to ask you.

110
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,619
Please help. Please.

111
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,579
My chance of getting accepted is in your hands.

112
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,839
Please help. Please.

113
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,213
Please say yes.

114
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,193
Please.

115
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,153
- Boo!
- Boo, my ass!

116
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:18,649
Man? Why are you here?

117
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:23,826
The door isn't locked so I walked right in.

118
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,040
Just kidding.

119
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,160
I had waited for you downstairs, but you never showed.

120
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,659
So I came up here with coffee and snacks.

121
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,839
No need. I am not hungry.

122
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,009
You are cruel.

123
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,119
I came to support you.

124
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,579
You didn't come to support me.

125
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,330
But you came to get on my nerves.

126
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,513
You can go. I have work.

127
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,513
What?

128
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,446
Sometimes your work is not saved when the power is down.

129
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
How soon is this work due?

130
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,420
It's pretty soon from the way you look. Do you want some help?

131
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,173
No.

132
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,599
Think again.

133
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,286
If you can't turn the work in on time, you might fail the internship.

134
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,520
Tik-tok. Tik-tok.

135
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,239
Type these and print them out.

136
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,450
All of them?

137
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,233
Yes.

138
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:47,679
You are not doing it for free. You'll get paid.

139
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,721
If my wage is too much, you can pay with your heart.

140
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:56,593
Just don't do it. I will do it.

141
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,003
Thanks.

142
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,899
Whose computer is this? Can I use it?

143
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,973
You can.

144
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,700
♫ I want to go out and see people I don't know ♫

145
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,270
♫ Go out and say hello and discover new stories ♫

146
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,230
♫ I want to get out to the same places we've been before ♫

147
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,539
P'Type, I need to type this section here. Right?

148
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,429
That's right. Be careful with the numbers.

149
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,573
Okay.

150
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:41,020
♫ I want to know how we would be, if we were together ♫

151
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,766
Can I sit with you? It's more convenient this way.

152
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:50,319
Just sit there. My table is too small. It's uncomfortable.

153
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:52,780
It's easier to ask questions.

154
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,280
You sit there.

155
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,586
Hey!

156
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,279
And the folder?

157
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,184
- The folder?
- Folder?

158
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,473
The original file.

159
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,700
This is way more difficult.

160
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,600
You said you wouldn't eat or drink what I brought for you.

161
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,880
You're hungry, aren't you?

162
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,080
You can grab snacks. They are in that bag.

163
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,828
Open it.

164
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,316
I am done…

165
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,390
What are you doing?

166
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,710
Keeping you warm.

167
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:24,936
You've been watching too many romantic dramas?

168
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,804
If it were really a romantic drama, I would have put my jacket on you.

169
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:36,800
And when we got romantic, your boyfriend walks in…

170
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,239
Type, why are you so early?

171
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:44,202
I got a little problem with the document. I spent the night here.

172
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:47,100
Wow! You are hardworking.

173
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,890
How about ending the internship here and be a real employee?

174
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,764
I am flattered.

175
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,039
P'Beam, this is my brother's friend. He helped me with the document.

176
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,020
Are you Man?

177
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,877
P'Type talks about me?

178
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,130
He said you are annoying and following him everywhere.

179
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,430
You won't get off his back no matter what he says.

180
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,929
But you are generous. I have something in return.

181
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,089
Tomorrow is Type's last day of internship. We will have a farewell party.

182
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,840
Why don't you come, too?

183
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,430
Are you sure? I don't think so.

184
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,900
He doesn't have to come.

185
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,020
How can I say no to your invitation?

186
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't come.

187
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,220
He invited me.

188
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,930
Are you done working?

189
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,170
[LaSalle Suites]

190
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,840
[Gluta C]

191
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,100
You drink it, too?

192
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,220
I want to have nice skin like you do.

193
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,980
You have to look good for who exactly?

194
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,100
It's not that.

195
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,923
We practice really hard these days and Temp asked me to take care of my looks.

196
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,188
I can't look worn out on stage.

197
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,320
You are super busy.

198
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,940
And yet you have time to teach Pam guitar.

199
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,419
She is about to go through tests. I can't just ignore her, can I?

200
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,620
I am teaching her at the Music Club. Do you want to come?

201
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,570
I don't think so.

202
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,860
I am helping Phuak with his food review page.

203
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,173
Really?

204
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,752
Yes. Why?

205
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,279
You've been acting weird. You know you can talk to me. Right?

206
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,729
Nonsense. You should get going.

207
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,313
Okay.

208
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,113
See you.

209
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,719
Hi, guys. Welcome to "Gross But Cheap So We Have to Eat."

210
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,585
We are here at the legendary rice porridge shop.

211
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,999
The one and only legend around here.

212
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,920
Why are they legend? Because the other shops nearby are all good.

213
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,890
This is the only place that serves gross food. I don't know why they are still open.

214
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,179
That was just a tale. The food looks yummy.

215
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,660
Yummy or yucky?

216
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,360
Let's stop recording and eat.

217
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Otherwise, the shop owner will kill you.

218
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,824
This is gross.

219
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:31,250
Every time we do the food review with Phuak,

220
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,950
we need to be careful not to get beaten up.

221
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,383
Right?

222
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,573
Are you okay?

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,020
Tine.

224
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,553
What?

225
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,860
It's just that I…

226
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,679
My friend at the club had a fight with his boyfriend.

227
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,129
That guy again? Why so many problems?

228
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,820
Do you think I want to have…?

229
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,144
I mean, my friend doesn't want problems.

230
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:05,410
Hey! Let me ask you guys. If you find someone you like,

231
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,990
will you leave the one you went after for a long time?

232
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,730
I will.

233
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,610
Don't you guys need time to think?

234
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,360
Why do I need to think?

235
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,920
A new face is always better.

236
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,380
Not always.

237
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,540
There is one thing that someone new can't be.

238
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,724
- What's that?
- Armpit (sounds like 'first love').

239
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,984
First love!

240
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,453
Sorry.

241
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:39,556
People never forget their armpit.

242
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:41,150
First love.

243
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,769
Think about it.

244
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:50,984
We always pick someone who reminds us of our first love in some way.

245
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,070
You're right.

246
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,870
Tine's first love was such a princess.

247
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:04,088
His girlfriends after that were all similar.

248
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,925
Shit! I better check my girlfriend.

249
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,632
Just in case I am someone's shadow.

250
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm worried now. I can't eat.

251
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,524
You said you had never had a girlfriend.

252
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,140
Have you ever had a crush on someone though?

253
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,030
- I have.
- Who?

254
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,890
A friend from high school.

255
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,640
This is Pam, my close friend from high school.

256
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,800
Better?

257
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,719
Don't let your ring finger touch this string.

258
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,200
Don't you remember?

259
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,399
We always pick someone who reminds us of our first love in some way.

260
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,610
Trim your fingernails next time. Who plays guitar with such long fingernails?

261
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,788
Press harder.

262
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,700
- Do it right.
- I am doing it right.

263
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,260
Don't touch the bottom string.

264
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,976
Do it again.

265
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,607
I think you should rest your fingers. Let's take a break.

266
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,610
You are as grumpy as always, Teacher.

267
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,250
Look at you. You've forgotten everything.

268
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,952
Do you have a song to play for the test?

269
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,832
I might play the one I wrote.

270
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,084
That's good.

271
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,640
Can you even write a song?

272
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,544
I can't.

273
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,724
But I know who can.

274
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,732
You once said you would write me a song, remember?

275
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,716
It's time to keep the promise.

276
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,540
Man, this way.

277
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,973
Sure.

278
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,980
Helo, everyone.

279
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,280
He woke up and

280
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,040
thought I took his clothes off.

281
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,880
He punched me in the face.

282
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,080
- What?
- How could you do that to me?

283
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,704
I was standing there in shock.

284
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,320
I heard you are a Political Science student.

285
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,330
Where will you go for your internship program?

286
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,010
I don't know yet.

287
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,644
Political Science grads now have broader career paths than before.

288
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:14,644
What are you leaning toward?

289
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,139
I haven't thought about that yet. I am just a first-year student.

290
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,880
People here usually plan ahead since high school.

291
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,080
You should start thinking about it.

292
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,210
The competitions are high these days.

293
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,612
Well, I do have a plan for my future.

294
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:44,296
I will graduate and ask P'Type to be my boyfriend.

295
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,996
Seriously?

296
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,360
But you have no clue about your job.

297
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,940
Type gets paid really well.

298
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,230
Will you be able to take care of him?

299
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,229
Of course, I will.

300
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:09,833
I might not have a lot of money, but I have the heart of a fighter.

301
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,724
A heart, he said.

302
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,468
The heart of a fighter.

303
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,919
Let's stop teasing him. He is still young.

304
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,780
I don't have money.

305
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,300
Can I pay with my heart?

306
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,370
I will pay for P'Type and me.

307
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,490
Don't worry about that. It's my treat.

308
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,720
Please don't. I will pay.

309
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,488
Up to you then.

310
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,910
I was joking.

311
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,660
Give it back here.

312
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,690
Keep your money for the tuition.

313
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,480
Let me take care of this meal.

314
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,813
Cheers!

315
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,980
- I'm paying the bill.
- Okay.

316
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,799
See you guys.

317
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,300
Get home safe.

318
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,380
Didn't you drive here?

319
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,939
- Come on. I'll give you a ride.
- That's okay.

320
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,949
Come on. I had only soda.

321
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,240
You're safe.

322
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,268
Type, get in.

323
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,660
You can just go. I will give P'Type a ride home.

324
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,740
Did you ask him if he wanted to ride on your aged motorbike?

325
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,688
P'Type, are you coming with me?

326
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,350
That...

327
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,270
Take your pick.

328
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,300
If you want to ride comfortably, come with me.

329
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,470
But if you want to experience a tough life

330
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,150
full of smoke and sweat, go with him.

331
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,550
- You!
- Man, stop!

332
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,150
Stop.

333
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,860
Just stop.

334
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,050
P'Beam, I'll go with you.

335
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,700
Come on. Let's go.

336
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,533
Please.

337
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,850
Please.

338
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,283
Thank you.

339
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,910
But I think I better go with him.

340
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,220
All these times, I thought we got along pretty well.

341
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,320
Good luck to you, then.

342
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,960
Let's go.

343
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,108
What are you doing?

344
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,219
You seem drowsy. Are you sick?

345
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:46,816
No. I am fine.

346
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,743
Really?

347
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,320
Actually, it's bloating up in my stomach.

348
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,496
Phuak took us to four restaurants.

349
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,356
Okay. Just a sec.

350
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,763
Here.

351
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,400
Take one pill at a time.

352
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,992
Next time, you can just say it.

353
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,430
Give it here.

354
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,773
Got it?

355
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,860
I'll turn off the light.

356
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,743
Hey!

357
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,640
We haven't had a music clip together for quite some time.

358
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,040
How about we record one tonight?

359
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,870
It is late, and you are not well.

360
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,570
Let's do it later. Okay?

361
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,019
Get some sleep. Goodnight.

- Yes.

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,509
You can be cheesy, too.

383
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,760
Do you still have a stomachache?

384
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,652
I feel a bit queasy inside.

385
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:12,480
I want to throw up, but I can't.

386
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,340
How about you get some rest today?

387
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,620
You didn't get enough sleep last night.

388
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,828
How did you know?

389
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:22,712
I know you listened to music all night.

390
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,760
Do you want to eat anything?

391
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,240
How about congee?

392
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,040
No, don't worry about it. I am okay.

393
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,624
Just go take a shower. You're late.

394
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,930
I can skip one day to take care of you.

395
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,300
It's just bloating, not appendicitis.

396
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,368
Just go.

397
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,420
But I'm worried.

398
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,572
I am okay.

399
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,110
You can go.

400
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

401
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,191
So my friend needs to watch out for his boyfriend's first love. Right?

402
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:28,111
His first love came back and took back what was hers?

403
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:30,750
Well, not really.

404
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,084
Just tell your friend to ask his boyfriend frankly.

405
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:39,450
If he asks and it turns out to be nothing,

406
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,720
then my friend is a fool.

407
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,650
But if he keeps it inside, his brain will explode.

408
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,870
If someone doesn't love us anymore, that person will leave

409
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,200
whether we ask the question or not.

410
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,410
Why are you calling me?

411
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,940
Why did you come back early?

412
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,280
I ditched the rehearsal.

413
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,930
I am worried about you.

414
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,950
I bought you some congee.

415
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,128
Don't worry about the band. They are all okay.

416
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,863
What is it?

417
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,168
Is Pam your first love?

418
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,120
Yes. Pam is my first love.

419
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,256
It started out from being friends.

420
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,432
I didn't tell her anything though.

421
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:16,820
Why not?

422
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,830
Maybe… I didn't feel the same way about Pam as

423
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,890
I felt about you when I met you at the concert.

424
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,220
Maybe you didn't want to lose the friendship…

425
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,540
and I am just her shadow.

426
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,060
What?

427
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,510
Who put this crazy idea into your head?

428
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,760
She and I have many things in common.

429
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:40,536
You and her?

430
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,020
You guys are not alike.

431
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,840
I saw it on her IG.

432
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,908
She likes Blue Hawaii.

433
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,340
She likes coffee and coffee was sold out then.

434
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,250
That's why she ordered a Blue Hawaii.

435
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,680
She likes to play guitar.

436
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:02,710
She does like guitar.

437
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,688
But you played it because you wanted to get close to me from the beginning.

438
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:09,480
She likes Scrubb.

439
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,188
She likes every band.

440
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:14,338
She went to that concert because Man dragged her there.

441
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,670
And you are the only one who likes just one band.

442
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,560
More importantly, Pam seems normal.

443
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,020
But you are being paranoid here.

444
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,800
Your mind is thinking too much, little buffalo.

445
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,326
Fine. I am sorry.

446
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:38,200
I was being silly.

447
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,320
Do you know how you and Pam are really different?

448
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:52,904
One day, Pam will belong to someone else.

449
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,216
But you…

450
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,064
You belong to me and me only.

451
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,928
You kept me up all night.

452
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:18,590
Give me back the tears I cried for this.

453
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,160
You cried?

454
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,660
How about I make you cry even more right now?

455
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:29,592
Damn you!

456
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:31,588
Always with a dirty mind!

457
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,600
What about your rehearsal?

458
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,740
I sorted it out with Temp and my friends.

459
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,250
I want to be with you more.

460
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,210
I am fine.

461
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,412
You can go back to practice. I'll go with you.

462
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:53,690
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

463
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,699
Okay. Good idea.

464
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,490
No. I will carry them.

465
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,136
You have a stomachache. You shouldn't carry anything heavy.

466
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,080
Are these the chords of the song you wrote?

467
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,200
It's Temp's.

468
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,352
Must have been here by mistake.

469
00:38:22,456 --> 00:38:24,896
Let's go. We don't want to be late.

470
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,800
Pam, what are you doing here?

471
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,350
I have a guitar lesson with you, don't I?

472
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,250
We have a lesson tomorrow.

473
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,780
I have to practice all day today.

474
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,810
I already came here.

475
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,110
Can I discuss with you a little bit about the song for the test?

476
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,120
You can talk to her first.

477
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,490
You have half an hour before practice.

478
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,552
I will bring all these to the rehearsal room.

479
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,090
Give it to me.

480
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,530
Thanks.

481
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,816
I am so excited.

482
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:06,166
I want to hear the song you wrote for me.

483
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,290
Is it so hard to write, anyway?

484
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,640
To be honest, the lyrics are not completed yet.

485
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,790
I know. Writing a song is not very easy.

486
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:10,612
May I guide you on how I want the concept to be in case it helps?

487
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:19,164
I… I want a love song...

488
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:22,660
that describes two close friends.

489
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,450
They are so close that...

490
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,040
they take their relationship for granted.

491
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,490
One day,

492
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,970
the other friend has a new best friend.

493
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,280
They don't do what they used to do together anymore.

494
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,090
And it's when she realizes how much she loves her friend.

495
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,720
She is willing to do anything…

496
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,508
to get her friend back.

497
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,296
You are not talking about the song.

498
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,850
You are talking about us, aren't you?

499
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,313
You're right.

500
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,300
Do you think someone who has never been in love can write a love song?

501
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,050
Are you writing a love song?

502
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,650
Something like that.

503
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,550
I get it.

504
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,870
You agreed to help me

505
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,120
because you want to have some experience to write a song?

506
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,470
Do you think so?

507
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,003
Am I right?

508
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,850
I am so excited.

509
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,200
I want to hear the song you wrote for me.

510
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:13,300
[Rehearsal Room 1]

511
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,200
Can we still go back to the way we were?

512
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,712
I love you.

513
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,748
And I know you feel the same way.

514
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,890
♫ In my memory ♫

515
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,520
Why?!

516
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,800
♫ I am standing there among the days/i> ♫

517
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:49,490
♫ Yesterday, where we kept the days, those words were stuck in my mind ♫

518
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,210
♫ Watching days change into nights ♫

519
00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:00,500
♫ Every time I wake up ♫

520

Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

521
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:23,320
♫ I don’t know when it started or who started it exactly ♫

522
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:31,570
♫ I don’t know if you came into my life or I came into yours ♫

523
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,490
♫ Maybe it’s just a coincidence, maybe it’s not ♫

524
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,030
♫ I still can’t figure it out ♫

525
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:49,760
♫ All I know is that the one in my heart is you ♫

526
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,190
♫ I don’t want anyone to come between us ♫

527
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,290
♫ We will stay side by side ♫

528
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:59,210
♫ Wherever you are, I’ll be right next to you ♫

529
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,760
♫ I own the space beside you ♫

530
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,600
♫ Because we are meant to be together ♫
