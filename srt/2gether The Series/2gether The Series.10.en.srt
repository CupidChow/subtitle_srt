1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,893
Tine, I am so done flirting.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,570
Will you be my boyfriend?

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,059
Wow!

4
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,899
How are you, shippers, doing?

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,529
You are all squealing.

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,733
Even I was shipping them.

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,073
And that was a surprise show from our Music Club.

8
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:30,270
Now let them take a break backstage.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,046
Give them a big hand, guys!

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,949
It's all ruined.

11
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,309
How could he say it was just a show?

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,300
If he didn't say that, the rest of them wouldn't get to perform.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,230
Yeah, yeah! Hero!

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,680
We won't help you ever again.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,440
We are off now.

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,633
So that was just part of the show?

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,466
I'm relieved then.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,940
I was in shock for a moment.

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,253
Are you really happy that it wasn't real?

20
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,963
Yes.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,973
If it was real, I would feel really bad.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,260
I thought I could do this one thing for you,

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,640
but I completely failed.

24
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,546
You told me that…

25
00:01:54,546 --> 00:02:01,393
it was supposed to be the happy ending scene in the movie.

26
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,585
I ruined it,

27
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:08,213
even though I had practiced really hard for it.

28
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,166
Maybe… I am not the protagonist in your movie.

29
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,730
That scene doesn't have to be the end of it.

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,346
You can still give it a happy ending.

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,153
How?

32
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,393
If it is our movie, you can choose…

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,549
whether you want it to end in tragedy

34
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:53,513
or end in happiness.

35
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,860
Just be my boyfriend now.

36
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,780
Quit playing already.

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,210
I am asking you for real.

38
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,930
What do you say? What will you choose?

39
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,100
What are you playing, Tine?

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,246
I hate movies with sad endings.

41
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,873
Yes.

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,773
Yes?

43
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,140
Yes, I am your boyfriend now.

44
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,740
[Sarawat already has a boyfriend. His name is Tine.]

45
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,560
You…

46
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,166
You are so damn cute!

47
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,979
Ouch! My leg!

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,026
Sorry.

49
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,399
Tine!

50
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,233
What?

51
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:36,920
We wanted to know if Sarawat asking you to be his boyfriend at the concert

52
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,410
was a real thing.

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,899
- It's…
- It's…

54
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,099
You know what?

55
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,240
Fong thinks it's real.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,906
And he thinks you already said yes to him.

57
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:54,109
Right. Tine curses Sarawat three times a day.

58
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:58,660
If he ends up being Sarawat's boyfriend, then he is a loser.

59
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,790
Loser?

60
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,623
Exactly.

61
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,979
So, Tine?

62
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,519
Is it real or not?

63
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,453
Real.

64
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,900
Real, my ass!

65
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,313
You know that he likes to tease me.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,440
I am going to get a coffee.

67
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,593
Slow down.

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,546
What now?

69
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,793
Have you told your friends that we are together?

70
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,699
I haven't.

71
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,900
You told me you would tell everyone here today.

72
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,559
Change of plan.

73
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:56,766
Can we tell them later?

74
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,519
I need more time.

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,733
They are so ready to tease me.

76
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,313
What is wrong?

77
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,286
Are you mad?

78
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,823
No.

79
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,099
I… want to grab your boobs.

80
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,400
I want to grab your boobs.

81
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,913
Now?

82
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,393
Can I?

83
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,373
Can I?

84
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,353
Yes, but just once.

85
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:40,030
And don't tell your friends that we are dating yet.

86
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,684
- Can I squeeze?
- Hell no!

87
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,740
That's enough. That's all you get.

88
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,360
I just forgot about you.

89
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,726
What were you two whispering about?

90
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:19,073
Did you just stop Sarawat from telling us that you're together?

91
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,199
What?

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,439
We were talking about the Music Club.

93
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,990
Guys, I just won a lotto. This table eats for free.

94
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,909
Are you serious?

95
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,039
Of course.

96
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,649
On one condition though.

97
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,140
Let me kiss Sarawat on the cheek.

98
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,329
What will my friend get then?

99
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,089
Okay. Everyone here eats for free then.

100
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,253
Deal?

101
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:50,900
Kiss him!

102
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,740
- Do you see the guy in this picture?
- I do.

103
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,811
He is my boyfriend.

104
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,760
- Who?
- I can't let you kiss me.

105
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,629
Damn it!

106
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,179
You said you wouldn't tell our friends.

107
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,199
I wasn't telling them.

108
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,100
I was telling the one hitting on me.

109
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,500
What did I do wrong?

110
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,145
So they are boyfriends now.

111
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:18,153
What are you waiting for, guys? Give them a round of applause!

112
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,040
Keep on clapping.

The exams are finally over.

126
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,179
I was about to ask you to celebrate with us,

127
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,930
but someone is already here to pick you up.

128

See you later.

00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,463
See you.

130
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,199
Are you done with your exams?

131
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,080
Should we go out and celebrate?

133
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,860
Exams are over and you are walking like a pro again.

134
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,339
Ouch! It still hurts.

135
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,490
I think…

136
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,080
I need to ride on your back on the way to dinner.

137
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,370
I wish… it really hurts.

138
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,020
That you are in pain forever.

139
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,140
But if I'm in pain and you take care of me,

140
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,890
I'm okay with that.

141
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,450
You're such a…

142
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,183
Come on.

143
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,713
I need to go somewhere before dinner.

144
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,800
Wow!

145
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,413
This room is way better than my dorm.

146
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,980
It's beautiful.

147
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,893
You like it?

148
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,806
I do!

149
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,133
Let's go upstairs.

150
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,993
Whose room is it anyway?

151
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,793
I am thinking…

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,120
it can be our room.

153
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,640
What?

154
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,239
I've been thinking about this for a while now.

155
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,540
I want to see you before I close my eyes to sleep.

156
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,020
And I want to see you first thing after I wake up.

157
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,273
Move in with me?

158
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,310
Stay with me tonight?

159
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,360
Stay with me tonight?

160
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,300
Fine!

161
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,810
Yes! It's our love lair.

162
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,853
Come here!

163
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,320
Should we put our clothes together in the same basket?

164
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,100
Why?

165
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,120
Come on.

166
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,500
No. We need to separate them.

♫ There will be no light, only darkness and gloom ♫

168
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,146
I want some.

169
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,519
Don't spill it.

170

Why did you bring a ball with you?

171
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,600
What?

172
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,473
It is clean.

173
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,492
Tine, don't!

174
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,470
You like to bug me, don't you?

175
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,873
Okay. You can have some.

176
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,959
Where are you putting it?

177
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,729
Don't know.

178
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,940
Put it right here.

179
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,350
♫ I don't want anything more than that ♫

180
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,210
♫ Just having you with me ♫

181
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,893
Dipshit!

182
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,179
I can't.

183
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,353
Help me.

184
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,430
I am trying to pick a song to play at the contest.

185
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,680
Play a Scrubb song.

186
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,239
I knew it.

187
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,670
I will…

188
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,970
If you let me kiss you on the cheek.

189
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,173
No way!

190
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,853
- No?
- No.

191
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:12,160
Just one kiss?

192
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,053
No.

193
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,564
Fine then. A Scrubb song will be played.

194
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,206
Here it is. A housewarming gift for you two.

195
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,793
Thanks, bro.

196
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,210
Wait!

197
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,460
What kind of flowers are these wrapped in plastic?

198
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,360
Holy shit!! They are condoms.

199
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,593
For a newly wedded couple.

200
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,460
Why are you guys turning red?

201
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,489
Is it hot in here?

202
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:56,589
No. It's cool.

203
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,400
Are you turning red because of the condom bouquet?

204
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,909
We are interrupting their sweet moment.

205
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,745
We will be out of your hair now.

206
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,639
Right. Just go already.

207
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,253
But we just got here.

208
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:15,160
There are 120 condoms in there.

209
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,960
Be careful with those.

210
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,939
Didn't you lock the door? How did they get in?

211
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:27,773
I don't know.

212
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,840
What a gross bouquet!

213
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,770
Besides Man and Boss's, there's another gift too.

214
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,399
Are you more interested in your phone than me?

215
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,579
Hey! I am sorry.

216
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:03,719
What did you just say?

217
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,329
Forget it. You can continue playing on your phone.

218
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,765
I am sorry. I didn't ignore you.

219
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,960
You can see it for yourself.

220
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,710
I like Sarawat.

221
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,233
You promised to post a love confession to me.

222
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,120
Are you still mad, sir?

223
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,853
I am.

224
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,170
I'm mad at myself for not being able to be mad at you, little buffalo!

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,950
What were you talking about just now?

226
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,610
I have something for you, too.

227
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,980
Thank you for moving in with me.

228
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,959
Wait!

229
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,960
It's the pick I cut in half.

230
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,333
You kept it.

231
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,110
I keep everything about you.

232
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,710
If I could, I would keep you locked up in there.

233
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,660
So that the two of us can stay together forever.

234
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:41,520
It could be my mom.

235
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,320
She might be wondering about the new place.

236
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,520
I'm going to talk to her for a bit.

237
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,627
Who the hell is Sarawat? Why is he with my boy?

238
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:11,773
Tine is my boyfriend. F*ck off!

239
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,120
Tine! Who the hell is this guy?

240
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,079
He said you're his.

241
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,629
Did he ever hit on you or something?

242
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:24,463
Where?

243
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,873
Shit!

244
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,840
What?

245
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,869
The one you were talking to is my brother.

246
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,400
My friend was just teasing and messing around.

247
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,240
Really.

248
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,380
I am sorry about that.

249
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,440
Bye.

250
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,773
Who is your friend?

251
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,019
Come on.

252
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,509
My brother is vicious.

253
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:05,433
I will tell him when he is in a good mood.

254
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,412
But right now…

255
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:14,440
just say sorry to him first, so that our story will have a nice ending.

256
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,006
Please.

257
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,340
I am sorry.

258
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,333
Here. Have a look.

259
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,500
Are you happy now, my friend Tine?

260
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,949
Don't be sulky.

261
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:46,753
He can't know we're together.

262
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,820
I am just a friend when your brother is around.

263
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,270
How about in reality? What am I?

264
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,493
My boyfriend.

265
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,360
If I am your boyfriend,

266
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,793
tonight, can I…?

267
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,399
Damn it!

268
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:21,960
Say yes to that or I'll continue pouting.

269
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,133
Yes or no?

270
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
No?

271
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,806
- Hey!
- No?

272
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,000
Can I help you?

273
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,933
Who are you?

274
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,970
I am Tine's brother. Where is he?

275
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,839
P'Type, why didn't you tell me you were coming?

276
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,773
Thanks.

277
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,779
This is Sarawat. The one I was telling you about.

278
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,660
- Sarawat.
- Hello.

279
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,100
The one bugging me on IG.

280
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Sorry about that.

281
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,339
I know all of Tine's friends.

282
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,790
But your name never came up before.

283
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,679
What are you to him?

284
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,080
Why did Tine move in with you?

285
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,710
Tine told me to say we are friends.

286
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,349
Tine told you to say you are friends?

287
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:18,350
And if he didn't tell you to, what would you say?

288
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,140
We are…

289
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,613
…friends.

290
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,199
Do you have something to do around here?

291
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,151
No. Nothing.

292
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:32,670
I thought I would stay with you for a week.

293
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,480
Why so surprised?

294
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,780
Stay here?

295
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,025
Yes. I have an internship program nearby for weeks.

296
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,310
Not just that,

297
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,066
I am here to keep an eye on you and see if you are unruly.

298
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,099
Of course not.

299
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,660
I can take good care of myself.

300
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,803
What's this?

301
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,393
There was a booth giving out condoms for free in the university.

302
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:11,859
They gave out a bouquet?

303
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,253
Right.

304
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:16,540
A bouquet.

305
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,929
What are you doing?

306
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,530
I don't like getting close to people.

307
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,273
Move!

308
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,139
Tell your friend to stay only on that side.

309
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,626
He can't cross!

310
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,370
Let's go find something to eat.

311
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,143
You stay here.

312
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,103
Got it?

313
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,313
Hey!

314
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,853
Sarawat.

315
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,160
Aren't you coming?

316
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,593
Tine!

317
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:35,409
Stay here.

318
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,680
You can take a detour.

319
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,073
Use a roundabout way.

320
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,565
There are so many places to have an event. Why the shop I'm working in?

321
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,659
I didn't choose this place.

322
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,020
The girls requested it because they wanted to see you.

323
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,373
By the way…

324
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:08,820
is your boy, Phukong, coming tonight?

325
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,590
No.

326
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,620
He's not coming?

327
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,670
No, he is not my boy. I don't want to hear this name again.

328
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,090
There you are. We were just talking about how to get revenge on Sarawat.

329
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,039
How about tomorrow? If you see him, just send out the message.

330
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,150
Didn't you get enough already?

331
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,299
Why? You hate him just like we do.

332
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,239
I don't like him, but I never outnumbered anyone like a bunch of thugs.

333
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,833
One-on-one on the soccer field is your way, then?

334
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,999
What is your problem? I told you I didn't mean for it to happen.

335
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,379
Do you want to see when I mean to do things?

336
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,879
I know you didn't mean to. Just chill, man.

337
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,839
We were just joking.

338
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,990
We are not doing anything to him. Okay?

339
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,520
This is for you, Brother.

340
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,433
Thanks.

341
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,020
But this is green curry. It's Sarawat's favorite.

342
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,146
I can have this plain soup instead.

343
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,553
Tine,

344
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
since when do you like wearing bracelets?

345
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,459
It's fashion.

346
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,745
It's trending in our university.

347
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:23,596
And do you need to wear a couple bracelet?

348
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,193
The Music Club had them made for members.

349
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:33,653
Everybody in the club wears one.

350
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,879
This is so good.

351
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,433
Delicious.

352
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,479
Where are you sleeping? I have only one bed here.

353
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,560
I will sleep on the bed with you.

354
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,593
With me?

355
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,820
I guess your friend can sleep on the couch.

356
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,025
I can.

357
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:03,859
Good.

358
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,386
Can you sleep?

359
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,889
I can't sleep…

360
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,286
without you next to me.

361
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,493
Come here.

362
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,689
You are going to wake my brother.

363
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,209
He's in deep sleep.

364
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,660
An earthquake won't wake him.

365
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,800
Tine,

366
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,136
sleep with me on the couch, please.

367
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,140
You can go back in the morning.

368
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,533
What if he wakes up?

369
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:15,790
He won't. Look at him.

370
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,040
He won't wake even though there's a fire.

371
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,820
Sleep here with me.

372
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,529
How am I going to sleep here?

373
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,999
I will make myself as small as possible.

374
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,559
You have space here.

375
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,673
It's all yours.

376
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,720
Don't be afraid you will fall because I'm going to hug you like this all night.

377
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,910
Here. Let me share the pillow.

378
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,060
♫ But when I met you, it was different ♫

379
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,670
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

380
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:04,060
♫ If today we were to end it, it must have been something wrong ♫

381
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,489
Well, well.

382
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:10,953
Look at you all so dull just because of a boyfriend's brother.

383
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:15,486
Don't worry. An outsider like me will find a way to help you.

384
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:17,720
Where is he?

385
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,680
Right there. Walking along with Tine.

386
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,180
Don't go too far. He is Tine's brother.

387
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,049
Rest assured. My life has no brakes.

388
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,550
When he comes, I am gonna yell at his face that…

389
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,559
- Damn!
- What?

390
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,920
The one I've been looking for.

391
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,686
That's why he looks so familiar.

392
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,800
What are you looking at?

393
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,310
Looking at a cute guy like you.

394
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,230
I have been looking for you everywhere.

395
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,833
What a surprise to find out that you are Tine's brother.

396
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,510
Do I know you?

397
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,070
You don't remember me?

398
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,560
No.

399
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,686
You have never been in my memories.

400
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:08,086
And I don't think I ever associated with someone like you.

401
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,827
But I really want to associate with someone like you.

402
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:16,199
How about we start with something simple?

403
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,799
Like you being my boyfriend?

404
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,080
Jackass!

405
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,889
If you agree, I promise to say goodnight to you every night.

406
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,960
During the day, I will be looking at you without blinking.

407
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,899
P'Type! Calm down.

408
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:34,639
Man's brain is not fully functional.

409
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,179
He is in treatment actually.

410
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,159
Let me take you to read a calming book over there.

411
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,606
Come on.

412
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,753
Calm down.

413
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,579
Thanks.

414
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,972
He hates us even more.

415
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:55,879
Who would think this world could be so small?

416
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,009
Invite P'Type to a party tonight.

417
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,760
I will make him open up to me.

418
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,353
No. I mean, open up to you.

419
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,339
I wish you all pass the test and be in the Faculty of Architecture soon.

420
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,980
Who are you missing?

421
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,689
Judging from your puppy eyes,

422
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,219
I wonder if you're thinking about that kid you tutored.

423
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,180
You're wrong.

424
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,740
He is not coming.

425
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,186
He hates me.

426
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:33,350
Why? Did you two fight?

427
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,719
I had a fight with his brother.

428
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,009
I like his brother's boyfriend.

429
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,319
What is he mad at you about, then?

430
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,265
About you having a fight with his brother…

431
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:48,300
or about you liking someone else?

432
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,220
I'll have the same, please.

433
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,940
The place is closed for a private party.

434
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,960
I can't take your order.

435
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,746
Mil told me to keep it for you.

436
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,760
This is my friend, Oak.

437
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,210
The more the merrier.

438
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,819
Do I sit here beside Sarawat?

439
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,030
What does his boyfriend have to say?

440
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,143
No boyfriends here.

441
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:55,105
We are all friends. We are all single.

442
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,963
What about you? Your loved one is okay with you here?

443
00:33:57,963 --> 00:34:01,719
I'm not taken. I am very single.

444
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:04,079
What kind of person do you like then?

445
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,619
I can recommend you one.

446
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,800
No type. The one who feels right to me is the right one.

447
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,800
Liverpool is playing tonight.

448
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,410
Really?

449
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,206
Let's watch it.

450
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,110
How did you know I like Liverpool?

451
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,640
The way you play on the field tells me.

452
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,960
I see Mohammed Salah in you.

453
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,100
Your friend here is not bad, Man.

454
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,370
Cheers to the new friend!

455
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,270
- All right.
- Cheers.

456
00:34:42,653 --> 00:34:44,386
Bottoms up!

457
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,453
Bottoms up!

458
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,153
Let's watch it.

459
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,369
1-0.

460
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,786
Let me mix you a drink.

461
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,740
To Liverpool.

462
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:17,046
It's so great to have a friend to watch soccer games with.

463
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,840
Tine, what's the matter?

464
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:28,740
Why are you following me here?

465
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,139
Go back and talk more about soccer games.

466
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,060
And what's wrong with that?

467
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,280
You said I needed to act like a friend.

468
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,540
Do you think I'm okay with that?

469
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,960
Do you think you're the one who feels uncomfortable?

470
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,510
I'm uncomfortable, just like you.

471
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,210
Why do you put up with it, then?

472
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,070
Do you want me to tell him that I'm your boyfriend?

473
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,860
Or should I say I'm jealous?

474
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,160
Or should I just say to my brother's face that you're not just a friend?

475
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,193
Is that what you want?

476
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,006
What did you just say?

477
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,793
I asked you, what did you just say?

478
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,600
I'm going to ask you one last time.

479
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,550
Are you two boyfriends?

480
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,433
We are just friends.

481
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,006
He is my boyfriend.

482
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,540
Yell at me all you want.

483
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,150
Just leave him alone.

484
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,500
I asked him to keep it a secret from you.

485
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,940
Cuddling each other on the couch is your way of keeping it a secret?

486
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,166
- You know?
- Yeah.

487
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,730
Of course, I know.

488
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,720
I was just waiting for you to tell me.

489
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,679
I am sorry.

490
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,969
I was afraid you couldn't accept me this way.

491
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,619
I am your brother.

492
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,699
I can accept whatever you are.

493
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,409
I am just worried about you.

494
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,969
I wanted to test you two at first.

495
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:14,333
If my yellow tape couldn't stop you from going to him, how can I?

496
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,363
As for you,

497
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,289
I don't trust you.

498
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,240
And I'm not so sure you can take care of my little brother.

499
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,200
I won't ask you to believe me.

500
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,120
But I will show you.

501
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,850
And I will keep watching.

502
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,559
But first, look after your friend.

503
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,880
Don't let him come near me.

504
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,560
Don't you want me all to yourself?

505
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,299
Come on.

506
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,280
Let's give a toast and welcome your brother-in-law.

507
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,319
Don't touch me, Man. Stay away from me!

508
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,719
Stop scowling.

509
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,833
Come with me. Trust me.

510
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,553
Man!

511
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,003
Stop it!

512
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,339
P'Mil, can I ask you something?

513
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,153
You didn't mean to break my brother's leg, did you?

514
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,286
You think I'm such a good guy?

515
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,903
Yes.

516
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,564
Just leave it. It was a long time ago.

517
00:38:32,564 --> 00:38:34,346
That's true.

518
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,910
I have something to tell you.

519
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,900
If I can goal, you will get to hear it.

520
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,820
If not, it will remain a secret.

521
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,310
I guess I'm not lucky enough to hear it.

522
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,100
Well, I have something to tell you too.

523
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,433
I like you…

524
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,313
like a brother.

525
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,940
Like a real brother.

526
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,710
I have nothing for you to keep.

527
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,320
Consider it...

528
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,480
a farewell gift from the tutor camp.

529
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,720
Wear it when you take an exam.

530
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,970
So you don't exceed the time limit.

531
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,900
Thank you.

532
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,580
Thank you for everything…

533
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,970
everything you've done for me.

534
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,646
I'll get going now.

535
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,563
Stand still.

536
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:04,460
Do you want to change yourself, or do you want my help?

537
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,893
Don't help.

538
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,380
We haven't talked about you making me jealous yet.

539
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,060
That was all Man's plan.

540
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,660
I didn't plot that.

541
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,370
But if you're still mad,

542
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:23,150
you can punish me all night right here.

543
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,780
Stop!

544
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,766
My brother can see.

545
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,470
Wait!

546
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,233
Where is he?

547
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,690
Your brother passed out.

548
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:46,180
Man took him to his place,

549
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,880
so he won't be our third wheel here.

550
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,619
Damn! Man must be eating him up by now.

551
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,709
No, Man! You are a gentleman.

552
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:57,980
You are a gentleman!

553
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,186
I just can't.

554
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,626
My friend might be foul-mouthed, but he is a gentleman.

555
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,780
You said your brother would stay for a week.

556
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,740
- Ask your friend what he did to my brother.
- Hey! You're awake.

557
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,513
Can you get up?

558
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:47,266
What a dickhead!

559
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,140
I didn't do anything.

560
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,680
He ran home like The Flash.

561
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,119
He doesn't have to stay for a week anyway.

562
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,679
He learned the truth in one day.

563
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,410
Do you think he knows because we live together?

564
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,133
Isn't it right?

565
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,310
He said his brother had listened only to Scrubb all his life.

566
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,379
But lately, his brother has been listening to some indie bands.

567
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,450
Then he saw these indie band CDs on my desk.

568
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,680
I guess he knew right away that I'm your special someone.

569
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,920
You're wrong.

570
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm just trying to open my ears to other genres.

571
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,640
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

572
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,439
Well, I have downloaded a bunch of indie songs in here.

573
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,973
You want to listen?

574
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:42,926
No, I don't.

575
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,880
I'm going to use the bathroom.

576
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,853
Your Smile by Sarawat.

577
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,070
Hello. Test. Test.

578
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,240
Have you recorded already, Boss?

579
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,373
I'm recording. Hold on.

580
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,720
Do you think he will like it?

581
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,739
Not just like.

582
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,899
He will love it. Believe me.

583
00:44:22,899 --> 00:44:27,719
Don't pretend like you don't, little buffalo.

584
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,030
Give it here.

585
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,469
Hi. This is Sarawat. I'm…
