167
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,250
You should have worn underwear at least.

168
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,380
I didn't wear anything?

169
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,813
That means…

170
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,350
You saw everything at the Sarawat Expo?

171
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,349
Stop it. Aren't you ashamed at all?

172
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:52,480
Why do you seem so proud?

173
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,590
I am not talking to you.

174
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,499
What do you want me to do?

175
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,369
Look at my room. Help me clean up.

176
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,283
Clean up what?

177
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,889
Everything.

178
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,549
Start with the shoes.

179
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,550
It's not even messy.

180
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,279
Do you call it clean then?

181
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,350
Can I just let you grab my boobs and then go?

182
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,719
Sure.

183
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,739
Seriously? I was kidding.

184
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:28,689
I was just playing. I will do it now.

185
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,340
Where do you want them?

186
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,413
On your head?

187
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,299
Sorry!

188
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Shit!

189
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,689
You have many pairs of shoes.

190
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,010
They are all new…

191
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,710
except…

192
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,890
this pair.

193
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,189
Why? They are comfortable.

194
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:16,670
Comfortable?

195
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,900
This worn out?

196
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,170
If your fans knew about this, they'd buy you a new pair for sure.

197
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,550
I won't wear anything that other people buy for me.

198
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,299
But if you do, I might.

199
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,133
Me?

200
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,060
And why would I do that?

201
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,159
- Where do you want it?
- Here.

202
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,210
Help me change the bed sheet.

203
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,510
I'm tired of black.

204
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,520
The Altermajeeb event tomorrow,

205
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,940
what songs are you guys playing?

206
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,679
Why?

207
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,229
Do you remember that I like Scrubb?

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,280
One of my favorite songs is called "Everything".

209
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,170
And why are you telling me this?

210
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,760
Can you play "Everything" for me tomorrow?

211
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,010
Sorry. The seniors have their songs listed.

212
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,670
Can you ask them to change?

213
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,230
Convince them. Please.

214
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,719
They made up their minds, Tine.

215
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,419
Just help me! I want to hear it live.

216
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,389
Try to talk to them, please.

217
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,729
Put the sheet on.

218
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,569
I won't do it then.

219
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,220
All right. I will talk to them. Make the bed first.

220
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,129
It looks good.

221
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,210
Test it.

222
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,570
It is so soft.

223
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,750
- I think it is soft too.
- Hey!

224
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,889
What are you doing?

225
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,990
This bed is so nice.

226
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,569
I am checking the sheet.

227
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,150
I should have changed it ages ago. Why did I put up with black?

228
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,559
Don't have to check it right here.

229
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,600
I need to check here because I sleep right here.

230
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,160
Wat, I bought you…

231
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,150
Why didn't any of you tell me that you would come?

232
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,149
Then it wouldn't be a surprise.

233
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,959
I thought I would find your girlfriend here.

234
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,960
But it turned out to be your new friend.

235
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,410
Weird. You don't usually bring anyone here.

236
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,690
My room was a mess.

237
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,980
I asked him to help me clean up and refurnish.

238
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,290
What on earth can convince you to refurnish?

239
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,019
Someone said it was messy.

240
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,559
So I just decided to change the atmosphere.

241
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,393
Your girlfriend?

242
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:33,293
A friend.

243
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,299
Friend again? When will you have a girlfriend? You are super insensitive.

244
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,123
Mom.

245
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,130
- Tine, do you know that Wat has never had a girlfriend before?
- Really?

246
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,120
Yes. All he does is play guitar.

247
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,289
He doesn't have time to find me a daughter-in-law.

248
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,999
You seem like you've had a lot of girlfriends.

249
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,599
Share Sarawat some tricks. I want to see him date.

250
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,450
That's enough, Mom.

251
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,189
When are you going to tell me why you are here?

252
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,759
Phukong will spend the night here.

253
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,759
Your university will have an Open House tomorrow.

254
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,179
Take your brother with you so that he can observe the faculty he likes.

255
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,499
But tomorrow…

256
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,339
I have to go. Your dad is waiting. Take care of your brother.

257
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,760
- Mom.
- Goodbye.

258
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,693
Goodbye.

259
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,590
Why didn't you call?

260
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,950
If I'd called, I wouldn't have seen what I saw.

261
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,190
I am going to get a coffee.

262
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,470
Tine,

263
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:49,830
you have to take my brother to the university tomorrow.

264
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,940
Why me?

265
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,590
Because I have a show to perform.

266
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,150
My mom will kill me if I let him go by himself.

267
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,569
I have to meet my friend. We will go together.

268
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,880
Then take my brother with you and your friend.

269
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,639
If you agree to take care of my brother,

270
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,459
I will ask the seniors to play a Scrubb song for you. Okay?

271
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,493
Really?

272
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:16,670
Damn it! You're luring me with a Scrubb song.

273
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,459
Okay?

274
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,020
Fine.

275
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,300
They are calling me for practice.

276
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,990
I need to get changed.

277
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,140
Pay for the food.

278
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,159
You need to pay, too.

279
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,019
Ask my brother to pay. Bye.

280
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:54,453
Shit!

281
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,940
You don't even finish your food!

282
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,673
Let me eat then.

283
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,560
How did you become my brother's boyfriend?

284
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,219
What? Boyfriend, my ass.

285
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,299
My brother was an introvert but now he seems so in love.

286
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,059
He even has an IG account.

287
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,459
He never cared about things like this before.

288
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,700
Maybe he wants to change.

289
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,959
I saw him writing a love song.

290
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,400
I saw that, too.

291
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,640
Maybe he is in love with some girl.

292
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,930
I hope he falls for a good person.

293
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,229
My brother isn't good at things like this.

294
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,039
Don't worry.

295
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,619
I haven't known him that long but I know he isn't a bad guy.

296
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,499
A good person will find a way to a good person eventually.

297
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,700
You're a good guy like my brother said.

298
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,880
What? He talked about me?

299
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,200
That's right.

300
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,700
He also said that you were looney and you suck so bad.

301
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,369
What? Suck? Did he say I suck?

302
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,183
Yep!

303
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,200
Here you go again, Sarawat!

304
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,650
Calm down.

305
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,739
You pay for your brother.

306
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,970
He ate and did a runner.

307
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,659
But he said it was your treat.

308
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,109
I don't have money.

309
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,289
You're rich. You pay.

310
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,669
Are you that hungry? You're eating my brother's leftovers too.

311
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,630
No food waste.

312
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,500
You can go ahead. I will look after your brother.

313
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,490
Don't forget to play "Everything".

314
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,270
You told me so many times already.

315
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,070
I'm going to go now.

316
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,683
See you.

317
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,929
Should we go now?

318
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,649
Wait for my friend for a sec.

319
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,399
It's not just us?

320
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,109
Why didn't you tell me earlier? How many of your friends are coming?

321
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,880
Only one.

322
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,749
If you don't like too many people, you can go alone so you don't feel uncomfortable.

323
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,669
I don't like too many people either.

324
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,380
I want just the two of us.

325
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,750
Did you wait for long, Tine?

326
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,329
Is this Sarawat's brother?

327
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,949
You are hot like your brother.

328
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,709
Hello, beautiful senior!

329
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,259
What a sweet kid.

330
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,129
Which faculty are you looking at?

331
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,049
How about Medicine? I can take you.

332
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,569
I was deadly sick when I was a kid.

333
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,359
Luckily, I was cured by an excellent doctor.

334
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,759
I want to be a good doctor just like him.

335
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,459
What about you, Tine?

336
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,220
Why are you asking?

337
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,350
Welcome to the Photo Club.. Do you guys want to get pictures? It's free.

338
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,409
Pear, do you want one? The two of us can take a photo together.

339
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,769
What about me?

340
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,599
You said you were going to a workshop.

341
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,309
But I'm still here.

342
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,799
Stop arguing. We will all have a photo together.

343
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,100
Help me choose the photo prop.

344
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,660
This one?

345
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,160
You wear that. You should try this, Pear.

346
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,109
How do I look?

347
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,979
I don't know

348
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,749
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

349
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,560
3, 2, 1. Smile!

350
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,390
3, 2, 1.

351
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,390
Thank you.

352
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,639
I like this photo. Can I keep it?

353
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,190
Should we each keep one?

354
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,290
That's okay. I don't know why I should keep your try-to-be-so-cool photo.

355
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,040
Are you envious because I'm hotter?

356
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,469
Tine, I need to use the bathroom.

357
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,103
Sure.

358
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,100
Can you please get lost for an hour or two?

359
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,133
I am begging.

360
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,590
Do I really need to pay?

361
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,329
I'll give you 500. Go

362
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:31,480
Do you really think I'm a little kid who can be bought?

363
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,849
1,000.

364
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,539
Have fun. Pear…

365
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,831
Stop right there.

366
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm just returning the prop.

367
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,733
Bye, now.

368
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,803
Go far away.

369
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,990
Hello.

370
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,900
Hello. So cute!

371
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,919
Who did you come with?

372
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,090
I came with my brother.

373
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,650
Who is your brother? We might know him.

374
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,640
His name is Sarawat.

375
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,010
Sarawat!

376
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,890
He looks yummy just like his brother.

377
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,940
We will give you these pork ball sticks for free.

378
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,949
But can we have a photo with you?

379
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,429
- You don't have to…
- Come on.

380
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:21,900
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

381
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,149
Can you do this pose? 1, 2, 3.

382
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:28,390
Oops! Are you whipped for high school boys now?

383
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,289
Let me join you!

384
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,699
He is not just a school boy.

385
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,919
He is Sarawat's little brother.

386
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,139
Really?

387
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,250
Let's take a selfie.

388
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,909
1, 2, 3.

389
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,259
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

390
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,309
Hold on a second, guys.

391
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,569
Sarawat, do you want to take a picture with us?

392
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,003
Where?

393
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,909
Boy, this is a restricted area.

394
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,539
I am looking for my brother.

395
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,859
He is playing guitar here.

396
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,269
You need to wait outside.

397
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,539
This zone is for band members only.

398
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,560
It will take just a minute.

399
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,210
My brother will be here soon.

400
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,050
Go wait outside.

401
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,259
Please. It won't take long.

402
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,249
What if their belongings are stolen?

403
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,959
They won't be stolen. I am not a thief.

404
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,170
What are you arguing about?

405
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,259
He is looking for someone.

406
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,210
I will see him out now.

407
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,249
No need. He is my brother.

408
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,229
Make yourself at home, then.

409
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,780
Let me know if you need anything.

410
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,320
Since when am I your brother?

411
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,150
I just don't like noises. They get on my nerves.

412
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,859
Now that you're here, make yourself useful.

413
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,660
Give me a massage.

414
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,083
Sure.

415
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,759
Are you here for the Open House?

416
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,109
What faculty are you interested in?

417
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,169
I don't know yet.

418
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,803
Yeah?

419
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,429
P'Mil it's time for your band to stand by backstage.

420
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,629
Okay.

421
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,480
I'm going to go now.

422
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,183
Here.

423
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,380
Why are you giving it to me?

424
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,919
Just eat. I know you're hungry.

425
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,380
Have you seen Sarawat?

426
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,719
What's wrong? Nervous?

427
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,263
No.

428
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,589
Don't you fool me.

429
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,590
Your loved one is here to watch?

430
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,330
I get it.

431
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,600
I was super nervous when my special one came to see me perform.

432
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,169
Hi, guys.

433
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,790
I will be your MC for today's event.

434
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,740
Well, it's time to wait a bit longer.

435
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,639
People at the back seem ready.

436
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,180
Make some noise to confirm that you are all ready!!

437
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,340
Okay!

438
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:31,060
Please welcome Sssss..! from Music Club on stage.

439
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,139
Sarawat's band is about to perform.

440
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,390
Let's move closer to the stage.

441
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,369
They might even play a Scrubb song.

442
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,699
Really?

443
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,840
I've always wanted to hear it live.

444
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,620
Hi, guys. We are Sssss..!

445
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,990
Excuse me for a second. My mom is calling.

446
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,079
[Faculty Building]

447
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,980
Thank you so much.

448
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,230
I don't know if you scream your lungs out for the good voice or just Sarawat.

449
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,860
Let me tell you.

450
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,240
The next band is as hot as the previous one.

451
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,230
Give a round of applause for The Rhythm.

452
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,730
Are you guys ready?

453
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,200
Make some noise!

454
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,980
1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4.

455
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,849
You have changed a lot.

456
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,109
So?

457
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,199
It kind of makes me scared.

458
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,840
If I really like someone, will I change too?

459
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,230
It is not that scary.

460
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,859
You will get it when you find the right one.

461
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,410
Thank you so much, guys.

462
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,730
Ladies and gentlemen, The Rhythm!

463
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,110
That was just amazing.

464
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,000
We are going to break just a little before we move on to the next show.

465
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,539
I am going to interview some of the young lads who are here for the Open House.

466
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,539
Don't go anywhere guys. Wait here!

467
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,549
This one.

468
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,429
I want to take him to meet my mom already.

469
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,299
What is your name?

470
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,869
My name is Phukong.
 (Captain in the police force).

471
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,960
Phukong?

472
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,730
Arrest me, please.

473
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,610
What faculty are you looking forward to?

474
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,039
Let me guess.

475
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,669
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

476
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,759
I know it.

477
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,329
Engineering?

478
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,863
Nope.

479
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,474
Medicine?

480
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:21,989
Interesting but still no.

481
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,300
Hot guy!!

482
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,875
Let's continue.

483
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,614
If not Medicine, then I don't know.

484
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:36,220
What faculty will you enroll in?

485
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:41,005
Faculty of Crispy Pork maybe. It's just so delicious.

486
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:46,860
He is not only hot but also funny.

487
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,995
You are just my type.

488
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:53,330
Do you need someone to take care of your tuition fee?

489
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,505
I am still okay.

490
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,709
Thank you for your time.

491
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,429
You are so hot.

492
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,304
Good luck.

493
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:04,838
Let's go.

494
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,414
Why are you giving it to me?

495
00:33:11,414 --> 00:33:13,864
Just eat. I know you're hungry.

496
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,583
What's wrong?

497
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,374
Pear almost got a chance to hear you play Scrubb's song.

498
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,969
But her mom called and she needed to go home.

499
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,639
I saw her off just now.

500
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,680
I am so pissed.

501
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:13,098
Pear?

502
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,775
I had to ask the seniors to play that song

503
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,769
because you wanted to take a girl to see?

504
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,244
That's right.

505
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:26,190
She has never been to a concert before.

506
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,204
I was about to be the first one to take her to a concert.

507
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:32,009
The first!

508
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,943
What about me?

509
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:36,670
Am I the first one that you used just to hit on a girl?

510
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:40,595
Why are you mad?

511
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,195
What's wrong with me seeing her off?

512
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:46,449
I'm hitting on you here!

513
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,769
Why are you hitting on someone else?

514
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,299
But we are just faking it.

515
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,465
Why are you pissed off?

516
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:01,100
What is with you?

517
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,746
[OPEN HOUSE]

518
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:06,150
Stop being mad.

519
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:09,854
Let's make a deal.

520
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:14,040
I'll treat you pork ball sticks and you have to stop being angry.

521
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:19,230
Can I have a lot of these, please?

522
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,605
I give you it for free in exchange for a selfie with Sarawat.

523
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:27,190
I'm going to a toilet.

524
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,680
Sorry about that. He has been having diarrhea lately.

525
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,264
That's why he seems so hot-headed.

526
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,800
You can take selfies with me instead.

527
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,369
That's okay. We're good.

528
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,244
- Just one.
- Seriously.

529
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:47,055
We're good.

530
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,083
Hey, Wat!

531
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,205
I am sorry for asking you to play a Scrubb song just to hit on Pear.

532
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Please forgive me.

533
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,130
I will do anything.

534
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,875
Anything, you said?

535
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:22,854
Damn it!

536
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:25,555
Mr. Chic's reputation is ruined.

537
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,529
I don't know how to do this.

538
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,230
I'll leave it like this.

539
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,229
Sarawat, don't you want to be in the picture, too?

540
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,499
Don't ask him.

541
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,700
He doesn't like to be in pictures.

542
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,694
Ready?

543
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:51,280
3, 2, 1.

544
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,443
Here.

545
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,250
What are you laughing at?

546
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,395
It's my turn now.

547
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,713
P'Dim!

548
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:31,019
Damn it!

549
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,760
This fucking club forced me to do the photo.

550
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,749
I said no a million times.

551
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,390
I need to perform now.

552
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,940
Next time, guys.

553
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,210
Don't tell anyone about this.

554
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,665
What songs are we playing?

555
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,000
You seem so happy when you get to tease me.

556
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:09,065
I did what you said so you have to forgive me.

557
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:15,049
What was wrong with you though?

558
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,250
Why did you agree to take a picture with me?

559
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,730
This picture is special.

560
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,053
How?

561
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,400
I rarely see when you don't try to strike a pose.

562
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,903
It's cute.

563
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,040
You're not picking at me, are you?

564
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,900
Where is my little brother?

565
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:53,130
Your brother?

566
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,979
He...

567
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,613
Phukong.

568
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,245
You took a taxi back home?

569
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,430
Okay. See you.

570
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,705
That's right. That's what I was about to tell you.

571
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:11,389
He took a taxi home.

572
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,879
I took good care of him all day.

573
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,770
Don't you worry.

574
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:23,104
Hi, guys. We will be the last band to perform.

575
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:26,200
We are Sunshine, Daisies, Butter Mellow.

576
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,564
P'Dim's band is performing.

577
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,365
Do you want to go?

578
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,413
Let's go.

579
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,000
We are the best in the Music Club.

580
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,260
We have lots of fans. You can see our signs here.

583
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,569
The next song will be the last song for this event.

584
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,825
Sing with us if you can.

585
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,674
I'm so mad I didn't get to hear "Everything" from Scrubb.

586
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:10,059
Because you weren't here to listen when I played.

587
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,989
I know.

588
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,415
I feel so damn guilty here.

589
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,775
