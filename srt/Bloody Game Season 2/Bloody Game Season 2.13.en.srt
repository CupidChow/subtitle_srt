1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,110
(The last morning of Bloody Game 2)

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,359
- Is it raining?
- Yes.

3
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,190
The noise is on another level.

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,129
(Stumbling)

5
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,479
I got off to a rocky start.

6
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,119
I started in the wild,

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,119
and I was worried at the time
that I might go home...

8
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,820
after suffering the whole time.

9
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,429
I was worried about that.

10
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,789
Now that I'm in the semifinals,

11
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,060
my sole purpose is
to win the championship,

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,170
and I'm ready to fight everyone.

13
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,469
Are you mentally prepared?

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,370
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,709
It's been ages since I felt
how hard it was to wake up in the morning.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm jealous.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,980
I can't be sure whether I woke up
while thinking or in sleep.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,209
What were you thinking about?

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,849
"Can I be the champion? What if I don't?"

20
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,019
"What will I do with the prize money?"

21
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,150
I didn't want to think about those at all.

22
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,719
But I guess that led to a dream...

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,620
because I had the weirdest dream.

24
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,230
(Tossing and turning)

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,400
(Xitsuh couldn't fall asleep
for a very long time.)

26
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,370
I noticed that my body and mind...

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,810
were crumbling while I was here.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,040
I should try to stay in shape.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,579
I'm going to the finals.

30
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,650
I must. And I will.

31
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,489
Oh, my. Thanks for the food.

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,859
Enjoy your meal.

33
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:15,539
(There's silence between the two.)

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,819
Jin Ho, Xitsuh, and Dex.

35
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,379
I don't care about them anymore.

36
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,150
My strength and strategy were...

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,919
uniting the alliance members
and having them work together.

38
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,689
I advanced to the semifinals using those.

39
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,599
(Struggling)

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,969
Is that a set?

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,310
They look similar.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,310
I never got to wear them
after I hurt my ankle.

43
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:54,680
This was the only one I never got to wear.

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,849
This is what I wore the first day.

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,580
For the Order of Arrival Game.

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,689
I wanted to finish it
with my original mindset.

47
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,020
I was injured...

48
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,689
earlier in the game,

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,889
and I was a bit discouraged.

50
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,889
I had to walk on crutches,

51
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,259
and it was hard for me to move.

52
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,599
I doubted that I could last long
in the game,

53
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,500
and I managed to stay in the top five.

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,370
There will be one winner remaining today,

55
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,370
and I want to be that winner.

56
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,009
I want to bring back the tension
that I felt...

57
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,240
on the first day
when we took our blindfolds off.

58
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,780
I plan to do my best
until I win the championship.

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,819
So, I decided to wear the same clothes
from day one.

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,930
All players,
please gather in the main hall.

61
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:04,620
I bet it'll feel strange when I wake up
looking at a different ceiling.

62
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,449
It'll feel empty.

63
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,529
Today is the day of the semifinals.

64
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,430
The five players
who advanced to the semifinals...

65
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,100
will have an individual match.

66
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,939
Depending on the result of today's game,
four of you...

67
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,639
will advance to the finals.

68
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:33,709
The loser of the day will be eliminated
from the game.

69
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,120
The final match will be held
in 1-on-1 tournaments.

70
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,250
The winner of the semifinals gets
the benefit of choosing...

71
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,389
the game of Round One of the finals
and their opponent.

72
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,089
I thought it was a fun benefit.

73
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,529
I wanted to win...

74
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:53,970
to play the game at an advantage.

75
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,699
If I were to play against Jin Ho,
I hope it's in the finals.

76
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,899
Then, I want him to place second.

77
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,610
I'd like to avoid Jin Hyeong as well.

78
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,610
He won two Deathmatches,

79
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,439
and he seemed pretty good
at 1-to-1 competitions.

80
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,610
I'd probably choose Hyun Ji.

81
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,750
I didn't mind it that much.

82
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,379
I wouldn't have to worry
if I got lucky enough.

83
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,089
To survive,

84
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:18,519
I'd perhaps pick Hyun Ji
and compete against her.

85
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,790
For your information,
no funds are transferrable today.

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,959
(Current Individual Funds:
Xitsuh 60,000, Jin Ho 40,000,)

87
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,100
(Hyun Ji 40,000, Dex 20,000,
and Jin Hyeong 10,000 dollars)

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,870
Now, we will announce the game
of the semifinals.

89
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,899
The game?

90
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,740
The game of the semifinals is...

91
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,110
Number Auction.

92
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,240
(This game was motivated by "High Society"
created by Reiner Knizia.)

93
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,339
Number Auction will be played
individually by five players.

94
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,149
Each player will bid for a number,

95
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:47,019
and the player
with the highest score wins.

96
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,089
Before the game, each player...

97
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,420
draws a number between 1 and 5
to decide on the order.

98
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,899
Each player will be given eleven blocks...

99
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:08,069
with the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 25.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,509
The blocks will be your funds
for the auction.

101
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,879
The card up for bid are 10 sale cards,
3 good cards, and 3 bad cards.

102
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,689
There are 16 cards in total.

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,220
The sale cards have numbers from 1 to 10.

104
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,589
Once you win a sale card,

105
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,529
you'll win as many points
as the numbers on your cards.

106
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,269
There are special cards in Number Auction.

107
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,730
They are good cards and bad cards.

108
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,870
The players who win these cards...

109
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,310
will earn points based on the cards.

110
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,709
Good cards double your points...

111
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,550
after the game is over.

112
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,180
There are three types of bad cards.
The minus-five card,

113
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,189
the half card, and the return card.

114
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,319
The minus-five card deducts
five points from your total.

115
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,589
The half card halves your total score.

116
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,660
(Half Card)

117
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,399
If you get the return card,

118
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,240
you must hand in a card,
excluding the special cards.

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
(Return Card)

120
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,509
Once the game begins,
a player has two options.

121
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,509
One, bid.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,480
You can bid one or more number block
on the sale card.

123
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,720
Two, pass.

124
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,389
You can pass on your turn without bidding.

125
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,189
When you do, you may withdraw
the number block you submitted,

126
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,899
but you cannot participate
in the current bidding again.

127
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,500
The bad card goes to the player
that passes first.

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
(Bid)

129
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,040
(Pass)

130
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,439
(Winning the half card)

131
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,839
Excluding the player who won the bad card,

132
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,149
the number blocks that the rest
of the players bid will be gone.

133
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,079
After the game,
your sale cards will be added,

134
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,250
and the player with the lowest score
is eliminated.

135
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,220
The player with the highest score
wins the game.

136
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,329
But the player who has the lowest total
of number blocks...

137
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,060
cannot be the winner.

138
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,199
During the game,
one player will be given one chance...

139
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,170
to buy the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars.

140
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,310
The player who won the previous bid...

141
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,810
will bid first in the next one.

142
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,480
When the three good cards
and the half card are auctioned off,

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
the game ends.

144
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,549
(Three good cards and the half card)

145
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,629
I realized
that it was definitely individual.

146
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,700
I enjoy games that include betting.

147
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,070
I thought I stood a chance.

148
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,539
I was certain that I wouldn't place last.

149
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,750
I've played games that required bidding,

150
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,250
and I was confident that I'd win.

151
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,750
I came all the way here,
so I naturally want to win.

152
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,220
I plan to win.

153
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,649
I thought about winning.

154
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,730
Number Auction will begin now.

155
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,370
The order will be decided first.

156
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,809
Jin Hyeong, please pick one.

157
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:35,309
I'll choose the second one
from your right.

158
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,549
- Jin Hyeong, you will go fifth.
- Good for you.

159
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,289
I'll choose the second one from your left.

160
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,919
Dex, you will go fourth.

161
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,990
I'll choose the first one from my left.

162
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,529
Jin Ho, you will go third.

163
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,370
I'll choose the first one from your left.

164
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,000
You will go first.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,700
Xitsuh, you will go second.

166
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:03,509
(Order: Hyun Ji, Xitsuh,
Jin Ho, Dex, and Jin Hyeong)

167
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,480
The sale card will be revealed.

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,080
(Revealing the first sale card)

169
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,779
It's six.

170
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,090
Hyun Ji has bid one.

171
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,029
Xitsuh has bid 15.

172
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,009
Jin Ho has bid 20.

173
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,710
Dex has bid 22.

174
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,419
Jin Hyeong has bid 25.

175
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,289
Hyun Ji has bid 1 and 25, a total of 26.

176
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:54,429
I'll pass.

177
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,429
Xitsuh has passed.

178
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:57,700
(Xitsuh passes.)

179
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,629
Whichever card I win...

180
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,830
One of the bad cards is
the return card, right?

181
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,200
I was determined...

182
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,370
not to bid for anything before I saw that.

183
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,940
It'd be meaningless
if I had to return a card...

184
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,210
that cost me a huge amount
because of that one bad card.

185
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,080
Xitsuh has passed.

186
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:26,360
Jin Ho has bid 27.

187
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,789
The game doesn't end
when all the cards are up for bid.

188
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,700
It ends once certain cards are up for bid.

189
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,100
There are numbers 1 to 10.

190
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,570
So, it goes 10, 9, 8, 7, and 6.

191
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,570
Six is the fifth highest number.

192
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,639
And there's no guarantee
that all the numbers higher than six...

193
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,039
will be shown when the game ends.

194
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,440
In that regard,
I thought six was a pretty large number.

195
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,509
I'll pass.

196
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,679
Twenty-seven.

197
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,690
Do you want it?

198
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,190
I'll accept whatever the result is.

199
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,590
It's still cheap.

200
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,399
Jin Hyeong has bid 31.

201
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,769
I'll pass.

202
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,970
(Hyun Ji passes.)

203
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,909
That's the highest it gets.

204
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,080
Twenty-seven.

205
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,679
(Contemplating)

206
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,379
I thought the number was too low...

207
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,590
for Jin Hyeong to just take it.

208
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,590
Jin Ho...

209
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
has bid 33.

210
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,029
So, I decided to bid more for it.

211
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,529
Pass.

212
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,600
Jin Ho has won sale card number six.

213
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,639
There are basically two strategies
in this game.

214
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,009
Doubling your score
with one of the good cards.

215
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,909
Or going after big numbers
without any good cards...

216
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,580
to get a high score.

217
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,350
You can't use both.

218
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,379
I intend on observing...

219
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,179
the numbers at first,
figure out what I can win,

220
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,850
and decide on one of the two strategies.

221
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,460
(Jin Ho won sale card number six.)

222
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,490
Let's go.

223
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,889
I will reveal the sale card.

224
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,899
(The second sale card)

225
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,759
One of the bad cards, minus-five card.

226
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,179
The minus-five card is the one
that I want to avoid the most.

227
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,549
I'm not that afraid of the half card.

228
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:31,149
Because it evens out
when I get the double card.

229
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,490
But the minus-five card lowers
the absolute value,

230
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,289
so it gets complicated.

231
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,490
It's a bad card.

232
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,220
It's Jin Ho's turn.

233
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,360
(Number Auction Rule)

234
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,230
(The highest bidder starts
the next round.)

235
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,730
Jin Ho has bid ten.

236
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,509
Dex has bid 12.

237
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,240
Don't raise it too high, guys.

238
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,950
- Are you going to take it?
- No.

239
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,889
Jin Hyeong has bid 15.

240
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,360
Hyun Ji has bid 16.

241
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,940
Xitsuh has bid 20.

242
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,340
(Xitsuh has bid 20.)

243
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,049
Jin Ho has bid a total of 22.

244
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,120
Twenty-two.

245
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,289
Dex has bid 23.

246
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,600
Twenty-three. That's a huge loss.

247
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,370
It hurts.

248
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,230
It hurts bad.

249
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,070
But I can't take it.

250
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,399
I think it's gone bad.

251
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,169
Why are you ripping me off?

252
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,639
- What?
- You should have taken it.

253
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,080
We're all going down.

254
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,450
It's bad
that I'm losing all these numbers.

255
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,850
(The players who don't win the bad card
lose all the number blocks.)

256
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,480
- Just because we're losing it...
- Right.

257
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,519
And it's still bad.

258
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,460
Once you have the minus-five card,

259
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,159
it's hard to overcome it
once you win a number...

260
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,830
higher than five.

261
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,929
There's also the return card,

262
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,429
so you need at least two cards...

263
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:32,000
that are higher than five.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,399
That's the only way to feel safe.

265
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,070
I tried to avoid the minus-five card
as hard as I could.

266
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,480
Hyun Ji, will you take it or not?

267
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,009
That's a secret.

268
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,679
- Secret.
- Take it.

269
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,250
Jin Hyeong...

270
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,460
- That's huge.
- has bid 25.

271
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,299
I'll pass.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,029
Hyun Ji has passed.

273
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,070
Why?

274
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,000
The losers of the bid lose
all their number blocks...

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,669
when they don't get the bad card.

276
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,509
I didn't think it was too bad
to take the card...

277
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,840
while making them waste their funds.

278
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,309
Because I can keep mine.

279
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,750
I can make up for it
when there's a large number later.

280
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,720
You have won one of the bad cards,
the minus-five card.

281
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,250
Except for Hyun Ji's,
the number blocks will all be gone.

282
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,190
(The players who don't win the bad card
lose all the number blocks.)

283
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,519
(Current Sale Cards: Jin Ho 6,
Hyun Ji negative 5)

284
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,960
I'll reveal the next sale card.

285
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,259
(The third sale card)

286
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,059
It's number eight.

287
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,169
- That's good.
- Okay.

288
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,970
I want that.

289
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,299
Can we split it?

290
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,500
I want it.

291
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,049
Hyun Ji has bid one.

292
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,610
That's a giveaway.

293
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,289
Xitsuh has bid 15.

294
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,659
Here goes a nuclear bomb.

295
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,130
Jin Ho has bid 25.

296
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,599
Shoot.

297
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,099
Come on now.

298
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,740
You're broke.

299
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:14,569
I am.

300
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,009
But I won't place last if I win that.

301
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,619
Dex...

302
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,750
has bid 26.

303
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,519
Follow my lead, guys.

304
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,650
I'm going all the way.

305
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,589
Jin Hyeong has bid 28.

306
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,630
Twenty-eight?

307
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay.

308
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,769
Hyun Ji has bid 30.

309
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,480
There are numbers from 1 to 10,

310
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,579
and I have my funds, right?

311
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,109
I calculated the average,

312
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,420
and I realized that spending 4
for 1 point was...

313
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,289
the fair price.

314
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,490
If it goes way past that,

315
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,759
I'll stop bidding.

316
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,029
Xitsuh has bid 32.

317
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,769
Jin Ho has bid 33.

318
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,869
I thought that staying away
from last place was crucial.

319
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,710
When I saw the number eight,

320
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,539
I was determined to win it.

321
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,079
Dex has bid 34.

322
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,549
That's too expensive.

323
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:31,720
It is.

324
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,250
It's a rip-off.

325
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,420
Jin Hyeong has bid 35.

326
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,619
I'll pass.

327
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,819
Pass.

328
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,289
(Hyun Ji and Xitsuh pass.)

329
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,329
Why am I left with so little?

330
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,430
(Jin Ho's remaining blocks)

331
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,529
What happened?

332
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,029
I'll pass.

333
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,440
Dex has bid 36.

334
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:56,609
Thirty-six?

335
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,980
- That's too much.
- It is too much.

336
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,509
I feel like this is the limit.

337
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,109
I just thought
that number eight was necessary.

338
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,519
Jin Hyeong, I'm going to win it
no matter what. Keep that in mind.

339
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,920
Seriously? Can I go all in, then?

340
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,450
- Go ahead.
- Then, will you do the same?

341
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,490
Yes.

342
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,559
Thirty-six.

343
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,990
Let's do it.

344
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,299
It's not a bad number.

345
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,500
(Contemplating)

346
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,440
Pass.

347
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,069
It worked!

348
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,740
- Jin Hyeong has passed.
- He wants it.

349
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,609
- Thanks.
- Dex...

350
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,339
has won sale card number eight.

351
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,380
Thanks.

352
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,819
(Current Sale Cards: Dex 8,
Jin Ho 6, Hyun Ji negative 5)

353
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,720
Here's the next sale card.

354
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,319
This is tough.

355
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,220
It's a good card.

356
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,059
A good card.

357
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,559
(Double the total)

358
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,259
I want it. Let me have it!

359
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,970
- That looks delicious.
- Let me have it!

360
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,569
- Let's get it.
- It's Dex's turn.

361
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,839
Okay. Here it goes.

362
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,009
You have zero shame, don't you?

363
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,019
I've become poor.

364
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,319
- You're poor now?
- Yes.

365
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,349
(Dex's funds)

366
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,519
Sorry.

367
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,890
You can't take it for four.

368
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,660
Jin Hyeong,
let's drive out the poor ones...

369
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,890
and play in the big leagues.

370
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,460
I second that.

371
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,099
Why are there flies in the auction house?

372
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,029
That's harsh.

373
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,799
Let's play among ourselves.

374
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,700
Four.

375
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,009
Hyun Ji has a lot. Xitsuh also has a lot.

376
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,680
He's calculating the chances.

377
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,380
Why are you glaring?

378
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,849
Stop glaring at my kids.

379
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,880
Jin Hyeong has bid 20.

380
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,490
Hyun Ji has bid 21.

381
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,259
Xitsuh has bid 25.

382
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,390
Jin Ho has bid 26.

383
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,460
Twenty-six?

384
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,329
Dex has bid 29.

385
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,900
Here we go.

386
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,640
Jin Hyeong has bid 32.

387
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,710
Hold on.

388
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,339
Hyun Ji...

389
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,710
has bid 33.

390
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,680
Pass.

391
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,950
Jin Ho has bid 34.

392
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,279
Pass.

393
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,690
(Dex passes.)

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,589
Jin Hyeong has bid 35.

395
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,460
- Good.
- Hyun Ji...

396
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,900
- has bid 37.
- Shoot.

397
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,769
I'll pass.

398
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,269
You'll be down to negative ten
when you get it, though.

399
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,970
No, they sum up the cards first.

400
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,369
I know.

401
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,839
You must be certain
that you can win more numbers.

402
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,039
Why are you glaring? You're scaring me.

403
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,410
I was just looking.

404
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,779
I wasn't looking at you.
I was looking at the one next to you.

405
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,609
You were just in her way.

406
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,849
- You have to get out of the way.
- I'll crouch.

407
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:53,049
I looked up, and you were just there.

408
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,059
Hyun Ji is a gambler.

409
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,559
I knew that I had to win it.

410
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,529
Even if it meant going all in
for number ten,

411
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:07,230
I was planning
on getting at least ten points...

412
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,369
after that round.

413
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,329
I'll pass.

414
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,170
Hyun Ji has won a good card.

415
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,710
Here's the next sale card.

416
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,940
Sale card number two.

417
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,109
It's my number.

418
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,039
Hyun Ji has bid two.

419
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,710
You've bid six.

420
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,579
Two?

421
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:26,849
That's my number, though.

422
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,220
Jin Ho has bid eight.

423
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,190
I'll get a loan.

424
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,829
(One player can buy the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars...)

425
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,390
(only once during the game.)

426
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,259
You've bought the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars.

427
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,900
You're spending 10,000 dollars?

428
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,430
Of course. We're playing a game.

429
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,230
- Gosh.
- It's a must.

430
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,299
I'll pass.

431
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,839
Why did you buy it, then?

432
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,509
Are you insane?

433
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,309
You've bid 12.

434
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,480
Pass.

435
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,819
Xitsuh has passed.

436
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,119
Pass.

437
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,750
Jin Hyeong has won sale card number two.

438
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,420
Here's the next sale card.

439
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,160
It's a good card.

440
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,789
Shoot.

441
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,730
You've bid 25.

442
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,529
I'll raise the bar,
so you'll spend more blocks.

443
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,029
You've bid 27.

444
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,569
I'm a little timid, so...

445
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,609
Gosh.

446
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,369
I didn't raise it too high.

447
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,210
You've bid 29.

448
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,680
I'll pass.

449
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,210
- Take it!
- Dex...

450
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,650
- has bid 36.
- Follow me.

451
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,549
You must be dying to win the game.

452
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,890
If Dex wins a good card and an eight card,

453
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,289
he's highly likely to win the game.

454
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,029
Jin Hyeong has bid 37.

455
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,470
I'll pass.

456
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,740
How would I beat that?

457
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,240
(Thinking)

458
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,710
Pass.

459
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,410
Jin Hyeong has won a good card.

460
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,220
(Current Sale Cards: Dex 8, Jin Ho 6,
Jin Hyeong 4, Hyun Ji negative 10)

461
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,049
Here's the next sale card.

462
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,450
(The seventh sale card)

463
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,390
- Ten.
- Goodness.

464
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,859
- Ten.
- Goodness.

465
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,329
That's huge.

466
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,500
(Is he going all in?)

467
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,299
What are those?

468
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,829
- What was that just now?
- He's...

469
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,529
- ready to go all in.
- What was that?

470
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,400
- I was thinking.
- You scared me.

471
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,569
He's funny.

472
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,269
You startled me.

473
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,240
Jin Hyeong will have to go all in.

474
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,680
Then, I'd win.

475
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,750
Mark my words. I'm going to bet 40.

476
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,519
- I'll go small.
- Small.

477
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,819
Jin Hyeong has bid one.

478
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,549
There are so many broke players.

479
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,259
Hyun Ji has bid 25.

480
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,960
I told you that I'd bid 40.

481
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,259
That's my number right now.

482
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,099
I am holding it.

483
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,829
Okay. Then, I'm bidding 43.

484
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,410
- How much is that?
- What?

485
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,440
It's 43.

486
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,210
Then, I'm going 44.

487
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,849
This is getting interesting.

488
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,779
You either go big or go home.

489
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,390
Xitsuh has bid 42.

490
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
(Pushing)

491
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,390
It's Jin Ho's turn.

492
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,700
Hey, Dex.

493
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,900
Why are you in such a hurry, Dex?

494
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,869
They only see each other right now.

495
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:30,900
I apologize.

496
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,039
- Don't be like that.
- I'm still here.

497
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,170
Dex is just powerful.

498
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,539
He bids high when he wants one.

499
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,779
He's like, "I'm going to win that
no matter how much it costs me."

500
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,279
He just announces it before he takes it.

501
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,109
That was very Dex-like.

502
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,750
I have to buy it anyway.

503
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,880
I'll pass.

504
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,450
They're all competing.
I don't see the need.

505
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,420
You've bid 43.

506
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,230
Maybe I should have bid 43.

507
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,630
I could have raised it one more.

508
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,299
- Come on, guys.
- I lack the guts for this.

509
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,970
Stop!

510
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,470
Forty-three?

511
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,869
Forty-three?

512
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,450
Well, I'll have to pass.

513
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,049
Jin Hyeong has passed.

514
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,960
- Forty-three?
- Yes, sir.

515
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,359
This is war.

516
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,700
Hyun Ji has bid 46.

517
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,630
Okay. Pass.

518
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,930
(Xitsuh passes.)

519
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,599
Pass.

520
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,410
Hyun Ji has won sale card ten.

521
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,140
Sale card number ten was out,

522
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,240
and I won that without a problem
to score ten.

523
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:52,920
(Current Sale Cards: Hyun Ji 10, Dex 8,
Jin Ho 6, Jin Hyeong 4, Xitsuh 0)

524
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,680
Here's the next sale card.

525
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,220
- It's nine.
- That's a juicy one.

526
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,390
Hyun Ji, let's go.

527
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,859
She's out of blocks too.

528
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,930
Yes. She has to get a loan.

529
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,170
I'll get a loan.

530
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,769
- She had more money.
- You've bought...

531
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,039
- the number 11 block for 10,000 dollars.
- You were lying yesterday.

532
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,579
(The night before)

533
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,480
(Are you totally out
of individual funds now?)

534
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:26,119
(Hyun Ji currently has 60,000 dollars.)

535
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,789
(Well, for now,)

536
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,220
(I have the prize money from last night.)

537
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,259
(Hyun Ji lied
that she only had 20,000 dollars.)

538
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,630
(She gave Jin Ho and Xitsuh
10,000 dollars each,)

539
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:48,769
(so the other players assumed
that she had no money left.)

540
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,640
- Liar.
- Liar.

541
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,410
It's number nine, but I'll start slowly.

542
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,680
- Here.
- I can't play with these liars.

543
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:01,220
Hyun Ji has bid two.

544
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,789
Xitsuh has bid 25.

545
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:10,190
Jin Ho has bid 8 and 25, a total of 33.

546
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,529
(Sale card 9 for 33)

547
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:16,369
Dex has bid 25 and 15, a total of 40.

548
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,700
(Dex bids 40.)

549
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,769
Forty?

550
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,369
You need to pay at least 40
for such a good one.

551
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,880
(Thinking hard)

552
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:28,980
I'll buy the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars.

553
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,220
Jin Hyeong has bought the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars.

554
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,920
(Jin Hyeong buys the number 11 block.)

555
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:43,890
(Sale card 9 for 40)

556
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,259
(All in)

557
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,299
What?

558
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,559
(Jin Hyeong bids 43.)

559
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,000
Jin Hyeong has bid 43.

560
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,339
- That's cool, Jin Hyeong.
- I'll pass.

561
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,400
(Hyun Ji passes.)

562
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,869
It is a bit too high.

563
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,210
- I'll pass.
- Xitsuh has passed.

564
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,849
I'll buy the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars.

565
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,779
I should have bought it sooner.

566
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,750
(Jin Ho buys the number 11 block.)

567
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:11,920
- Forty-four.
- What?

568
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,859
Jin Ho has bid 44.

569
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,329
- Pass.
- I'll pass too.

570
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,329
(Jin Hyeong passes.)

571
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:22,869
Jin Ho has won sale card number nine.

572
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:23,869
Good.

573
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:27,140
I overspent on sale card number nine.

574
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,440
I overspent.

575
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
But Jin Hyeong's cards were...

576
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,309
He could have returned card number two
if he got a return card.

577
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,579
He also had a double card,
so he could 18 with that.

578
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:40,220
I didn't win the bid
to keep the number nine for myself.

579
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,990
It was the opposite.

580
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,289
Jin Hyeong was likely to win
if he took it.

581
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,519
And I knew I couldn't let him have it.

582
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,890
(Current Sale Cards: Jin Ho 15,
Hyun Ji 10, Dex 8, Jin Hyeong 4, Xitsuh 0)

583
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,960
Here's the next sale card. It's four.

584
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,799
Jin Ho has bid two.

585
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,210
Dex has bid four.

586
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,640
Pass.

587
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,180
Hyun Ji has bid 13.

588
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,480
(Xitsuh bids 16.)

589
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,119
Xitsuh has bid 16.

590
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,849
- I'll pass.
- Pass.

591
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:17,119
Pass.

592
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,220
Xitsuh has won sale card number four.

593
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,029
Thank you.

594
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,630
A lot of them spent quite a sum
earlier in the game,

595
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,029
and I had been saving mine.

596
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,470
The next sale card is three.

597
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,470
(Sale card 3)

598
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,579
- Xitsuh has bid 10.
- That's a fair price.

599
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,640
Pass.

600
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,410
(Sale card 3 for 10)

601
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,650
Dex has bid 15.

602
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,980
- Pass.
- I'll pass.

603
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,119
(Xitsuh bids 16.)

604
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,650
Give it to me, Dex.

605
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,589
Pass.

606
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:56,829
Xitsuh has won sale card number three.

607
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,099
The next sale card is five.

608
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,470
(Sale card 5)

609
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,309
Xitsuh has bid 25.

610
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:15,809
(Xitsuh bids aggressively.)

611
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,910
- Pass.
- Pass.

612
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,849
- Pass.
- Pass.

613
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:22,589
Xitsuh has won sale card number five.

614
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:27,119
(Current Sale Cards: Jin Ho 15, Xitsuh 12,
Hyun Ji 10, Dex 8, Jin Hyeong 4)

615
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,630
Here's the next sale card.

616
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,599
It's one of the bad cards,
the return card.

617
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,400
- Oh, I'm tired.
- Let's feed him this.

618
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,200
(When you win the return card,)

619
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,240
That's a big one.

620
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,339
(you must return
one of the sale cards that you own.)

621
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:41,569
I have to protect myself.

622
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,069
(Return Card)

623
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,380
I'll buy a block.

624
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,180
Xitsuh has bought the number 11 block
for 10,000 dollars.

625
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,849
You guys are all gamblers.

626
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,589
(Current Funds,
Hyun Ji: 2, 3, 8, 10, and 11)

627
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:57,890
(Xitsuh: 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, and 11,
Jin Ho: 1, 2, and 15)

628
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,190
(Dex: 3, 4, 15, 25, and 11,
Jin Hyeong: 1, 2, 3, 6, 20, and 11)

629
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,930
(Xitsuh bids 1.)

630
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,960
I recommend you bid high.

631
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,200
I have quite a bit of funds
because I bought one.

632
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,269
- I'll follow.
- This is tough.

633
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,500
If it's only going to take one round,
I'll bid low.

634
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,140
But if I raise it too slowly,
I'll have to pay more in the end.

635
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:19,509
- Gosh.
- You have two sale cards, so it's okay.

636
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,009
Not me. I'm safe.

637
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,250
But I want to save my number blocks.

638
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,349
(Return card for 1)

639
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:26,450
- Keep fighting, guys.
- Yes, sir.

640
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,549
- Jin Ho has bid two.
- You're the best, sir.

641
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,720
We're losing this money anyway.

642
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,690
(Hyun Ji and Dex have one sale card each.)

643
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,430
Dex has bid three.

644
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:44,230
(Jin Hyeong is currently in last place.)

645
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,569
There was one person
who I could make sure to lose...

646
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:48,599
with the return card.

647
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,970
That was Hyun Ji.

648
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,240
She currently has
sale card 10, minus-five card,

649
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,410
and a double card.

650
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,410
If she gets the return card,

651
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,680
she must hand in her sale card number ten.

652
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,980
Then, Hyun Ji will place last...

653
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,190
as she has a negative score.

654
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,220
I could either take one more lap
with the return card...

655
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,529
or pay a huge sum
to give Hyun Ji the return card.

656
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:12,960
I had to think hard about that.

657
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,500
(Hyun Ji's remaining blocks)

658
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,230
I had totally forgotten about that card.

659
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,640
The bad cards were
the half card and the minus-five card.

660
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,940
I only had those two in mind.

661
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,480
And the return card showed up
out of nowhere.

662
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,279
I was running out of funds too.

663
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,480
It was my mistake.

664
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,119
We can send it over there
if we do a good job.

665
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,220
Think this through.

666
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,319
What if Dex gets me?

667
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,730
Fine. Send it to me.

668
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,289
- We can do it.
- Take me down with you.

669
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,059
Keep bidding, then.

670
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,130
We'll never get there.

671
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,970
Keep bidding.

672
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,940
You'll need some money
for sale card seven to win.

673
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,719
(Jin Hyeong bids 34.)

674
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,920
Jin Hyeong has bid 34.

675
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,360
Even if I went all in,
I had to take that card.

676
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,670
I'm doomed.

677
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,099
Goodness.

678
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,239
I can't bet anymore.

679
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:35,449
Hyun Ji has won the bad card.

680
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,250
That's cold.

681
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,230
Please return a card immediately.

682
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,599
(Hyun Ji returns sale card number 10.)

683
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,139
(Hyun Ji's score is negative 10,
and she's down to 5th place.)

684
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,139
Here's the next sale card.

685
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,340
- It's one.
- Shoot.

686
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,920
Hyun Ji has bid two.

687
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,650
Pass.

688
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,650
Xitsuh has passed.

689
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,320
(Sale card 1 for 2)

690
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,860
I'll pass.

691
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,730
Jin Ho has passed.

692
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,360
Dex has bid four.

693
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,960
(Sale card 1 for 4)

694
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,530
(Jin Hyeong bids 9.)

695
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,440
Jin Hyeong has 6 and 3, a total of 9.

696
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,639
Pass.

697
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,639
Hyun Ji has passed.

698
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,710
Pass.

699
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,079
Jin Hyeong has won sale card number one.

700
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,650
I'll be praying now.

701
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,010
Okay. Let's do this.

702
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,880
Here's the next sale card.

703
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,579
One of the bad cards,

704
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,519
the half card.

705
00:35:58,429 --> 00:35:59,429
(Half card)

706
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:02,599
(Jin Hyeong has no funds remaining
to protect himself.)

707
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,099
If one no longer has funds to bet
on his or her turn,

708
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,670
a bad card is automatically sold
to that person.

709
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,780
I'll take it.

710
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,909
I was dumbfounded.

711
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,219
I had spent so much...

712
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,849
to win a double card.

713
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,719
All that work went to waste,

714
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,059
and I only spent the money in vain.

715
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:28,719
I can't believe
the half card showed up now.

716
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,789
I know, right?

717
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,630
Here's the next sale card.

718
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,929
- It's one of the good cards.
- It's finished.

719
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay.

720
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:44,070
It's the last card.

721
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,880
(When the last good card
gets auctioned off, the game ends.)

722
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,150
I'll pass.

723
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,510
I'll pass.

724
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,349
I'll pass.

725
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,920
In the previous round,

726
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,789
I realized that I won't be able to win it.

727
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:00,590
In the previous round,
my funds fell below Dex's.

728
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,059
(Jin Ho is the next bidder.)

729
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,489
I knew that I couldn't win the card.

730
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,130
Dex had more blocks than me.

731
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,130
My original goal was...

732
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,340
Winning was an additional goal.

733
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,239
Not placing last was my first goal.

734
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,769
With that goal, I secured 15 points.

735
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,340
I knew that I wouldn't place last.

736
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,880
I had already met my goal.

737
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,409
All right.

738
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,780
Jin Ho has bid 16.

739
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,789
(Dex is the next bidder.)

740
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,989
Currently, Jin Ho has 15 points
and Dex has 8 points.

741
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,929
If Dex succeeds in winning the good card,

742
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:41,760
he will move up to the top
with a score of 16 points.

743
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,500
In the beginning, I told myself...

744
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,199
that I would avoid placing last.

745
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,500
But winning would be better.

746
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,409
The end.

747
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,309
Dex has bid 55.

748
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,880
Despite seeming a bit reckless,

749
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,519
he followed his own style.

750
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,719
I think the result was only possible
because he was Dex.

751
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,590
(Jin Ho passes.)

752
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,360
Jin Ho has passed.

753
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,400
Dex has won the good card.

754
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Good job.

755
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,329
Here is the result of the semifinals.

756
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,639
The winner of the semifinals is...

757
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,920
Hong Jin Ho.

758
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,349
(The winner of the semifinals,
Hong Jin Ho)

759
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,190
Jin Ho?

760
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,789
Dex has 16 points.

761
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,690
It's the highest number.

762
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,230
(Earlier)

763
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,730
(Jin Ho bid all of his blocks.)

764
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:01,210
It was impossible for me to win by myself.

765
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,909
I needed to rely on someone's mistake.

766
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,079
My target was Dex.

767
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,780
By bidding all of my blocks,
I gave off that vibe.

768
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,349
If he only focuses on the idea
of adding points...

769
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,920
to his score...

770
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,360
by winning the card,

771
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,730
he might forget about the rule...

772
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,030
that would keep him from winning.

773
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,260
But the player who has the lowest total
of number blocks...

774
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,929
cannot be the winner.

775
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:27,400
(The player who has spent
the highest amount of funds cannot win.)

776
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,070
I thought, "Wouldn't he go all in
like I did?"

777
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,610
Then the one with the next highest score
would have won...

778
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,510
due to the rule
about the number of blocks.

779
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,909
That was the situation...

780
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,980
and I was the one
with the next highest score.

781
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,480
That was the only thing I went for.

782
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,250
The end.

783
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,059
(As Jin Ho expected, Dex went all in.)

784
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,130
The moment Dex went all in,
I thought, "I did it."

785
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,900
(Then Jin Ho passed as he had planned.)

786
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,929
- Jin Ho, will you pass?
- Yes.

787
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,030
Jin Ho has passed.

788
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,940
Dex has won the good card.

789
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,300
- Congratulations.
- I won.

790
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,940
What? You?

791
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,980
Dex has 16 points.

792
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,809
It's the highest number.

793
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,579
Dex doesn't have remaining blocks.

794
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,750
(Dex doesn't have remaining blocks.)

795
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,679
- Dex doesn't have remaining blocks.
- Really?

796
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,550
I forgot about the details.

797
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,949
The strong message I wanted to give was,

798
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:21,360
"Don't even think about challenging me."

799
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,329
So I went all in as a strategy.

800
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,599
I didn't know it would keep it
from winning.

801
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:34,469
But I think those flaws are
what make me unique.

802
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,840
I always think about those things.

803
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,469
No matter how small,

804
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,550
I think about the rules and details
of the game.

805
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,519
The person who thinks about them
once more becomes advantageous.

806
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,119
That happened in this case.

807
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,519
(Current Sale Cards)

808
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,789
I am so disappointed. Why did I do that?

809
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,699
Dex, you couldn't resist being
the manly man.

810
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:02,059
I wanted to win once.

811
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,570
It's too bad.

812
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,699
The player who got eliminated is...

813
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,840
Shin Hyun Ji.

814
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,550
(Shin Hyun Ji)

815
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,110
I didn't think about the return card.

816
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,019
- Good work.
- Good work.

817
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,050
Good work.

818
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,389
You worked hard.

819
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:29,730
Since I picked Hyun Ji,

820
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,389
she struggled a lot in the wild.

821
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,400
She went through many hardships
to reach the semifinals.

822
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,099
Hyun Ji must be disappointed,
but she did well.

823
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,039
"You did well to come this far."

824
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,500
I had this thought.

825
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Good work.

826
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,010
- I should get going now, right?
- What?

827
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,639
I should get going now, right? Good luck.

828
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:48,340
You worked hard.

829
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,409
- All right.
- Good luck.

830
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,550
I never thought I would be
on another survival show...

831
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,619
since "Korea's Next Top Model."

832
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:00,619
I saw a side of me I didn't know about.

833
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,690
My goodness.

834
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,659
(The wood burns well since it's dry.)

835
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,730
(Come on out.
Wear your shoes and come on out.)

836
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,469
I made an effort
to give every game my best.

837
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:14,840
Sometimes, my strategy worked.

838
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,239
(For our survival,)

839
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,539
(let's discard one person.)

840
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:24,949
(If someone uses up 5 cards,)

841
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:26,880
(I will be able to use up 4 cards.)

842
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
Sometimes, my strategy didn't work.

843
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,820
(I see that you are up to no good.)

844
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,590
(I will go someday.)

845
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,260
(It would have been better
to get angry with me.)

846
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,300
Before I joined Bloody Game 2,

847
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,530
I confidently said, "I will win."

848
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,130
But it was a bloody battle.

849
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,269
Each day,
I didn't know what the game would be.

850
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,269
I didn't know
what psychological battles...

851
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,840
and politics would be necessary.

852
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,679
I think I did very well...

853
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:57,079
by advancing this far.

854
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,980
I am disappointed about my elimination,

855
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,920
but I learned a lot on the show.

856
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,849
I gained many things.

857
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,449
The experience was meaningful
and touching.

858
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,530
Congratulations on advancing to the final.

859
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,260
For the final, you will have
a 1-on-1 tournament.

860
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,170
The winner of the semifinals,
Hong Jin Ho...

861
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,840
can decide on the game for Round One
and the opponent.

862
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:24,010
I am jealous.

863
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,309
The winner of the semifinals,
Hong Jin Ho, enter the Voting Room...

864
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,849
to pick the game for Round One
and the opponent.

865
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,320
To become 1 of the 2 remaining people,

866
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,829
It would be best to avoid Jin Ho.

867
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:50,900
I know that I should never contend
against Jin Ho.

868
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,269
If I have a 1-on-1 match with him,
I will definitely lose.

869
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:00,880
(The game and rules are revealed
to Jin Ho first.)

870
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,280
I had this thought.

871
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,079
Being the winner, I had the benefit...

872
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:08,679
of drawing up the matches
and learning about the game in advance.

873
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,219
I wanted to make the most of that benefit.

874
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,320
But one game had rules...

875
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,530
that could be understood right away.

876
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,860
Getting them in advance
wouldn't have given me an edge.

877
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,440
(He picks up the rules of the other game.)

878
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,070
I could come up with the strategy
in advance.

879
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,869
I thought it was very nice.

880
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,639
I knew that it would play a big role.

881
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,309
- Did you decide on the game?
- Yes.

882
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,110
(He chose the game
for Round 1 of the final.)

883
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,449
Pick your opponent.

884
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:45,420
I might come across as cocky or confident,

885
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,690
but I was fine with going against
any one of them.

886
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:49,389
I will pick...

887
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:54,199
The matches for Round One of the final
has been decided.

888
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,079
(Jin Hyeong and Xitsuh)

889
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,389
I will pick Dex.

890
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,500
I decided to have Xitsuh and Jin Hyeong
go against each other.

891
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,199
Xitsuh is pretty good at playing games.

892
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:33,400
So is Jin Hyeong.

893
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,940
I thought it would be easier for me...

894
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:38,110
to eliminate a strong candidate.

895
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,639
(List of matches for the final)

896
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:45,480
Round One of the final match
will begin now.

897
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,150
Jin Hyeong would be strong
in a 1-on-1 match.

898
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:54,760
No matter the game, playing against
Jin Hyeong wouldn't be easy.

899
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,530
Xitsuh is a strong candidate.

900
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,960
He has the ability...

901
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,469
to come up with a thorough strategy
with details.

902
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:09,039
Both Xitsuh and I have strong points.

903
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,510
My only hope is that...

904
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,510
the game will be advantageous to me
and disadvantageous to Xitsuh.

905
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:17,750
The game for Round One of the final match
will be revealed.

906
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,150
The game for Round One
of the final match is...

907
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,719
(Hidden Mission)

908
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:23,090
Hidden Mission.

909
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:25,150
For Hidden Mission,

910
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,219
you will find and remove
two blocks with the same shape...

911
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,059
and answer the question
that is hidden behind the blocks.

912
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,929
The game requires
memorization and quick thinking.

913
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:36,570
(What's the relationship of Hansel
and Gretel from "Grimm's Fairy Tales?")

914
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,199
(Siblings)

915
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,769
With 6 blocks wide and 6 blocks tall,
the game board has 36 blocks in total.

916
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,780
There are 18 block pairs
with the same shapes.

917
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,380
The shape side will be revealed
for 10, 20, and 30 seconds...

918
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,380
in the three respective rounds.

919
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,590
The player that placed higher
in the semifinals...

920
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,590
will call out the numbers first.

921
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,360
The players will take turns...

922
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,170
to shout out two block numbers
with the same shape.

923
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,269
If a player is correct,
that player will win one point.

924
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,539
Then it will be the next player's turn.

925
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,079
Once the blocks are correctly paired,
they will be turned over...

926
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,079
to reveal a hidden mission.

927
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,010
The player that answers
the hidden mission correctly...

928
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,849
will win three points.

929
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,219
(What's the relationship of Hansel
and Gretel from "Grimm's Fairy Tales?")

930
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,289
(Siblings)

931
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:34,289
Then the round will end.

932
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,289
If the answer is incorrect,

933
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:39,429
the other player will receive a chance.

934
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:43,199
Two items can be used for Hidden Mission.

935
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,099
The first item is Double.

936
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,110
This item lets you answer
two times in a row.

937
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:53,780
If you pair the blocks on the 1st attempt,
you will win 1 point.

938
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,480
If you pair the blocks on the 2nd attempt,
you will win 2 points.

939
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,420
But if you fail, you will lose one point.

940
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,860
The second item is Open.

941
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,300
This item lets you open a block
when it's your turn.

942
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,000
You can use the 2 items only once
in 3 rounds.

943
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:20,039
You can use the 2 times at the same time.

944
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,769
After three rounds,
the player with the highest score...

945
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,309
will move on to Round Two of the final.

946
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:28,980
(Winner, Eliminated player)

947
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,710
It's a match of skills.

948
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,980
But while the necessary skills
are crystal clear,

949
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,719
it isn't impossible to strategize.

950
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,920
For example, you could decide
on the order of memorization.

951
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,289
Otherwise, you could focus on
getting the answer...

952
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:47,159
of the hidden mission
instead of memorizing the shapes.

953
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,530
I think I would be better
with the hidden mission.

954
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,869
It requires creativity, doesn't it?

955
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:55,840
I will focus on that more.

956
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:57,909
Let's go.

957
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,840
The moment we have a rough idea
of the question,

958
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,309
it will be a match
of getting the correct answer.

959
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,050
I thought that Xitsuh would be...

960
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,579
much better at answering
the hidden mission.

961
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,719
So I decided to do my best...

962
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:15,090
with my specialty, memorization.

963
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,690
Let's begin.

964
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,829
The hidden mission board
for Round One will be revealed.

965
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,840
(The hidden mission board for Round 1
is revealed for 10 seconds.)

966
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,809
(Hidden Mission Round 1 Problem)

967
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:41,619
(Hidden Mission Round 1 Problem)

968
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,949
I will close the doors.

969
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,960
This is hard.

970
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:51,989
Do you remember anything?

971
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,030
Darn it.

972
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,670
The number side will be revealed.

973
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,110
The numbers make it harder.

974
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,409
The player who received a higher score
in the semifinals,

975
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:10,550
Xitsuh will begin.

976
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,179
I memorized the shapes in the center.

977
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,190
It occurred to me...

978
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,090
that Jin Hyeong would memorize them
in an order.

979
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,989
So I went for the center blocks...

980
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:23,329
that were difficult to memorize.

981
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,500
I choose 22 and 23.

982
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,300
That is incorrect.

983
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,610
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

984
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,010
I will use Double.

985
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:45,210
If you use Double, an incorrect answer
makes you lose one point.

986
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,920
But you can't lose a point
when you have zero points.

987
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,349
Thus, I thought the 1st turn of Round 1...

988
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:53,760
would be my only chance...

989
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,789
to use Double.

990
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:57,389
(The first answer)

991
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:58,659
I choose 1 and 9.

992
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,699
That is correct.

993
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:07,539
(Jin Hyeong 1, Xitsuh 0)

994
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:11,039
(The hidden mission letters
are revealed for the first time.)

995
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,440
(Is)

996
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,110
(Of)

997
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,309
(If he correctly pairs the blocks again,
he will win 2 additional points.)

998
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,480
I choose 35 and 2.

999
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,679
(Jin Hyeong starts from 1.)

1000
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:28,619
That is correct.

1001
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,860
I started from the first row...

1002
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,989
and matched the numbers to the blocks.

1003
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,599
I memorized which one paired
with the first block...

1004
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,300
and which one paired
with the second block and so on.

1005
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,340
By memorizing six numbers,

1006
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,969
I could match 12 shapes.

1007
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:47,079
(With Double,
he acquired 3 points in his 1st turn.)

1008
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:48,679
Xitsuh, it's your turn.

1009
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:51,980
I choose 21 and 22.

1010
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,449
That is incorrect.

1011
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,090
Gosh.

1012
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,389
I am getting everything wrong.

1013
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,559
Jin Hyeong, it's your turn.

1014
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,360
I choose 11 and 3.

1015
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,400
That is correct.

1016
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,769
(Pic)

1017
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:18,570
(The revealed syllable is "Pic.")

1018
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,710
The revealed syllable was "Pic."

1019
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,380
The only word that came to my mind
was "Olympic."

1020
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,110
I thought "Pic" was a syllable
from "Olympic."

1021
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,780
Xitsuh, it's your turn.

1022
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,050
(The hidden mission begins
to reveal itself.)

1023
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,320
I choose 16 and 22.

1024
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:35,489
That is correct.

1025
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,590
(Ty)

1026
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,400
I choose 4 and 17.

1027
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,269
That is correct.

1028
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:51,039
(What)

1029
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,539
I choose 20 and 23.

1030
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:58,349
That is incorrect.

1031
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,280
I choose 6 and 26.

1032
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,150
That is correct.

1033
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:08,559
(The revealed syllable is "Pi.")

1034
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,230
I choose 5 and 15.

1035
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,800
That is correct.

1036
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,670
(Of)

1037
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,300
I choose eight...

1038
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,139
and seven.

1039
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:24,969
That is incorrect.

1040
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,110
I choose 8 and 20.

1041
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:29,679
That is correct.

1042
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:33,110
(Game)

1043
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,090
(France)

1044
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,929
(What, is, France)

1045
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,289
I saw "France."

1046
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,500
The answer had to be a city in France.

1047
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,070
(Pic)

1048
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,300
I will give an answer
to the hidden mission.

1049
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,170
Please state your answer.

1050
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:58,610
Paris.

1051
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,639
That is correct.

1052
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,820
(What is the name
of the capital of France...)

1053
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,889
(in which the twenty-twenty-four
Olympic game events will be held?)

1054
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:15,719
(Paris)

1055
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,389
Round One is over.

1056
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:19,429
(Round 1 is over.)

1057
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:20,500
Well done.

1058
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,699
Why is the answer Paris?
Is it asking for the capital?

1059
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,030
The capital of France
in which the Olympics were held.

1060
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,940
Right.

1061
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,599
You figured it out
through "France" and "Pic."

1062
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,170
You're bold.

1063
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,809
I will announce the points
that were earned in Round One.

1064
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,579
Lee Jin Hyeong, nine.

1065
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,610
Xitsuh, three.

1066
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,480
Round Two of Hidden Mission will begin.

1067
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,820
Come here. Let's switch spots.

1068
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,820
Okay.

1069
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,329
The hidden mission board will be revealed.

1070
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:56,630
(The hidden mission board
is revealed for 20 seconds.)

1071
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:05,239
(The shapes are much more complex
compared to Round 1.)

1072
00:55:08,909 --> 00:55:13,980
(Hidden Mission Round 2 Problem)

1073
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,050
(Hidden Mission Round 2 Problem)

1074
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,119
I will close the doors.

1075
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,800
The game became much harder in Round Two.

1076
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,400
In Round Two as well, I memorized
the blocks that corresponded...

1077
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,900
with the ones in the first row.

1078
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,869
Jin Hyeong will begin.

1079
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,510
I choose 1 and 10.

1080
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,909
One and ten.

1081
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,409
That is correct.

1082
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,519
(In)

1083
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,050
(A)

1084
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,650
(The revealed syllables are "In" and "A.")

1085
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:55,519
I will use Double,

1086
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:59,760
I decided to use it in the beginning...

1087
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,300
when my memory was fresh.

1088
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,769
I choose 2 and 15.

1089
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,139
That is correct.

1090
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,210
(Jin Hyeong: 10, Xitsuh: 4)

1091
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,679
(The)

1092
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,449
I choose 4 and 32.

1093
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,420
That is incorrect.

1094
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,389
(Jin Hyeong: 10, Xitsuh: 3)

1095
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:31,389
I am done for.

1096
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,530
(Sighing)

1097
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,630
Am I a fool?

1098
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,599
I choose 4 and 33.

1099
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:38,800
When I went after Xitsuh,

1100
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:41,170
I purposefully chose 4 and 33.

1101
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:43,300
(Xitsuh chose 4 and 32
and answered incorrectly...)

1102
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,340
(right before Jin Hyeong's turn.)

1103
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,710
I had the blocks memorized,

1104
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:53,750
so I chose them to give Xitsuh
a mental blow.

1105
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,019
I choose 4 and 33.

1106
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,389
That is correct.

1107
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,099
I am done for.

1108
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,900
I choose 6 and 8.

1109
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,840
That is correct.

1110
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,840
I choose 5 and 14.

1111
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,449
That is correct.

1112
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,750
I choose 3 and 36.

1113
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,690
That is incorrect.

1114
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:38,530
(The revealed syllables are...)

1115
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,829
(a, the, high, al, him, world,
so, and the.)

1116
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,570
I will give an answer
to the hidden mission.

1117
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,000
"Hunminjeongeum."

1118
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:52,340
That is incorrect.

1119
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,840
I thought the question
was related to King Sejong.

1120
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,210
Xitsuh, it's your turn.

1121
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,719
I choose 3 and 35.

1122
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,190
Correct.

1123
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,920
(Est)

1124
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,360
I choose 7 and 9.

1125
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,489
That is incorrect.

1126
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,199
I choose 9 and 36.

1127
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:23,739
That is correct.

1128
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:28,309
(The revealed syllables are...)

1129
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:31,409
(moun and tain.)

1130
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:33,920
We got moun and tain.

1131
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,050
What could be the question?

1132
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,619
It was obviously related to a mountain,

1133
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,849
but I couldn't figure out
how "Him" played into the question.

1134
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,489
I choose 16 and 27.

1135
00:58:44,489 --> 00:58:46,030
You chose 16 and 27.

1136
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,500
That is incorrect.

1137
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:57,170
I choose 24 and 27.

1138
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,809
That is correct.

1139
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:03,780
(Xitsuh received a hint
from Jin Hyeong's incorrect guess.)

1140
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,750
I choose 30 and 26.

1141
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,150
That is incorrect.

1142
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,150
I choose 7 and 30.

1143
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,559
That is correct.

1144
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,829
(The revealed syllables are is...)

1145
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:23,500
(and in.)

1146
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,469
I choose 13 and 19.

1147
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,869
That is incorrect.

1148
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,639
I choose 13 and 12.

1149
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,409
That is incorrect.

1150
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,420
I choose 13 and 12.

1151
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,590
You chose 13 and 12.

1152
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,489
That's right. I chose 13 and 12.

1153
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:48,659
Yes.

1154
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:51,489
I memorized about 10 to 12 blocks.

1155
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:53,860
Since I was done memorizing them,

1156
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,900
I didn't want to open new blocks...

1157
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,670
and reveal information to my opponent.

1158
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:00,340
So I chose the blocks
Xitsuh opened, 13 and 12.

1159
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,099
I choose 13 and 12.

1160
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,969
I choose 13 and 12.

1161
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:07,239
Without giving away information,
I thought about...

1162
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:10,650
what the answer
of the hidden mission might be.

1163
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,079
That is incorrect.

1164
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,679
I choose 18...

1165
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,519
and 23.

1166
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:20,190
You chose 18 and 23.

1167
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,659
- That is incorrect.
- This is bad.

1168
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,789
I choose 23 and 31.

1169
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,030
That is correct.

1170
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:34,300
(The revealed syllables are the...)

1171
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,739
(and yas.)

1172
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,809
I choose 18 and 25.

1173
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,139
That is incorrect.

1174
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,539
I choose 18 and 19.

1175
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,179
That is correct.

1176
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,690
(A)

1177
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,320
(Peak)

1178
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,230
(Peak?)

1179
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,960
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 14, Xitsuh: 8)

1180
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,469
- I will state the hidden mission.
- I will state...

1181
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:07,500
(Lee Jin Hyeong gets a chance
by a hair's breadth.)

1182
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,780
At some point, I started to think...

1183
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,280
that it would be the highest peak
in a certain mountain range.

1184
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,210
Mount Everest.

1185
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,019
That is correct.

1186
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,119
Round 2 is over.

1187
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,489
(The name of a peak in the Himalayas...)

1188
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,760
(that is also
the highest mountain in the world.)

1189
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,500
(Mount Everest)

1190
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,139
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 17, Xitsuh: 8)

1191
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,309
Round Three of Hidden Mission will start.

1192
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,349
If I follow my strategy,

1193
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:59,949
I know I'll be able to guess
at least six blocks.

1194
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,289
On the other hand,

1195
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,829
if I let my guard down...

1196
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:05,789
and fail to memorize six blocks,

1197
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,530
I could come behind
in memorization points...

1198
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,929
and end up losing.

1199
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:12,099
I need to prove my skills.

1200
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:13,329
It's not over yet.

1201
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,000
The hidden mission board
for Round Three will be revealed...

1202
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,610
for 30 seconds.

1203
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,650
It's over.

1204
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,579
I know I said that it's not over yet.

1205
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,320
But in elementary school,

1206
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,190
we were required
to take a Chinese characters test,

1207
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,460
and I couldn't pass Level Eight.

1208
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:37,429
I didn't even know...

1209
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,960
how to write water or soil.

1210
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,130
I still have to try my best though.

1211
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,539
This isn't a game
of memorizing Chinese characters.

1212
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:49,239
It's a game of memorizing shapes.

1213
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:52,210
I'm not going to memorize their meanings.
I'm just going to memorize their shapes.

1214
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,179
So I didn't think
it was important for me...

1215
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:55,940
to be well-acquainted
with Chinese characters.

1216
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:13,090
(Hidden Mission Round 3 Problem)

1217
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:15,929
I will close the doors.

1218
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,610
The numbers will be revealed.

1219
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:27,280
Xitsuh will start.

1220
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,039
I choose 9 and 1.

1221
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,849
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 17, Xitsuh: 8)

1222
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:36,219
That is correct.

1223
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,219
(Est and that)

1224
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,219
I choose 2 and 12.

1225
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:44,489
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 17, Xitsuh: 9)

1226
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:45,929
That is correct.

1227
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:50,670
(Bo and larg)

1228
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,300
(Syllables revealed so far:
est, that, bo, larg)

1229
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,340
(Est, that, bo, larg)

1230
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,710
I would like to state
the answer to the hidden mission.

1231
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,769
(Only 4 syllables have been revealed.)

1232
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,780
I wasn't sure,

1233
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,449
but I thought it would be a body part,

1234
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:08,050
like the longest...

1235
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,849
or the strongest bone in the body.

1236
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,289
- The answer is skull.
- That is incorrect.

1237
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:13,820
Can I try again?

1238
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,920
- Head.
- It is Xitsuh's turn.

1239
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,360
If I just get the answer right,

1240
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,030
the victory would be mine.

1241
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,900
So I tried hard
to get the correct answer quickly.

1242
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:26,670
I choose 5 and 29.

1243
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,300
Darn it. I got it wrong.

1244
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,639
That is incorrect.

1245
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:35,579
I choose 4 and 29.

1246
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:38,980
That is correct.

1247
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,949
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 19, Xitsuh: 9)

1248
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:42,719
I choose 5 and 19.

1249
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,989
That is incorrect.

1250
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,820
I choose 5 and 7.

1251
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,059
That is correct.

1252
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,530
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 20, Xitsuh: 9)

1253
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,329
I choose 6 and 26.

1254
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,199
That is incorrect.

1255
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:58,369
They look so similar.

1256
01:04:58,469 --> 01:05:00,369
I choose 8 and 26.

1257
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,739
That is correct.

1258
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:04,840
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 21, Xitsuh: 9)

1259
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,840
I'm so bad with Chinese characters.

1260
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,840
I choose 18 and 27.

1261
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:11,650
That is correct.

1262
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,710
I choose 3 and 34.

1263
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,820
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 21, Xitsuh: 10)

1264
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,050
That is correct.

1265
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,219
I choose 10 and 25.

1266
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,019
Number 10 and 25.

1267
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:22,619
(Lee Jin Hyeong: 22, Xitsuh: 10)

1268
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,860
- That is correct.
- Nice.

1269
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,989
(Mal and name)

1270
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:33,300
I choose 13 and 35.

1271
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:37,369
Number 13 and 35. That is correct.

1272
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,610
(Est, bo, has, land,)

1273
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:40,780
(a, trunk, that, name,)

1274
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,980
(larg, the, mal,)

1275
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,110
(a, of, the)

1276
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,949
I have no clue.

1277
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:49,820
Is it pimple? Nose...

1278
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:54,019
(Trunk)

1279
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:55,090
(Bo)

1280
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,219
Largest body...

1281
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,099
I know the answer.

1282
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,070
It's an elephant.

1283
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:07,969
That is correct.

1284
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,340
What is the question?

1285
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:13,570
(The name of a land animal...)

1286
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:17,650
(with the largest body
that has a long trunk.)

1287
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:22,250
(Elephant)

1288
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:24,920
Xitsuh versus Lee Jin Hyeong.

1289
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,420
The winner is Lee Jin Hyeong.

1290
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:30,889
- Good work.
- Not at all.

1291
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:31,960
You better win.

1292
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,800
- I will win.
- Yes.

1293
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,630
Looking back, I've come a long way.

1294
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,369
Thinking about how hard I've tried
throughout this show,

1295
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:46,539
I have no regrets.

1296
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,579
(If you multiply by 8
and then divide by 8,)

1297
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,139
(it will be 1 again.)

1298
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,710
(You can divide 48 by 3.)

1299
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:55,849
(He showed off his intelligence.)

1300
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,750
(As long as neither Seung Jin
nor YunB wins, you can win.)

1301
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:03,489
(He was also good
at cornering his opponents.)

1302
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:07,090
(Xitsuh was born
to be on a survival show.)

1303
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,929
When I was kidnapped to the wilderness...

1304
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:13,130
(You can take off your mask.)

1305
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,539
(He joined Jin Ho's team
as the first abductee.)

1306
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,079
(He was confused
by the unexpected situations.)

1307
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,349
I remember that the most.

1308
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:26,210
I kept sweating buckets,

1309
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,780
and I was hungry and thirsty.

1310
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:31,820
But it was also fun
and interesting at the same time.

1311
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
It was a weird combination of people.

1312
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:39,829
(His new teammates were very supportive
in the extreme situations.)

1313
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,199
The experience was unbelievable.

1314
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,929
I don't think I'll ever
be able to experience it again.

1315
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:49,000
It was an unrepeatable experience.

1316
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,510
Because I had someone I could trust
from beginning to end,

1317
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,179
without a doubt.

1318
01:07:54,179 --> 01:08:02,179
(Hong Jin Ho and Xitsuh
had massive trust in each other.)

1319
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,150
I don't think I'll ever
be able to experience that again.

1320
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:09,559
In that sense,
my time here was very meaningful.

1321
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,760
(Final match bracket)

1322
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,389
(Lee Jin Hyeong)

1323
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,260
The first round of the final match...

1324
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,270
between Hong Jin Ho
and Dex will start now.

1325
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,760
The Round One game for the final match
will now be revealed.

1326
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:49,760
The Round One game is...

1327
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:52,170
Color Turn.

1328
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,930
(Color Turn)

1329
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:56,670
In this game,
you have to form an unbroken line...

1330
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,409
of four chips of your color...

1331
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:02,279
on a board that contains mines
that change the color of your chips.

1332
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:05,979
Each player will receive seven chips...

1333
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,479
of either the color black or white.

1334
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,380
When you first move a chip,

1335
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,720
it can only be placed
in the first row in front of you.

1336
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:16,189
The two players
will take turns moving the chips.

1337
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,529
All chips can be moved...

1338
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:22,300
one space at a time in any direction.

1339
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:24,670
Any chip that has already been placed...

1340
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,739
on the board can be moved by any player.

1341
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,500
There are three mines per row...

1342
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,470
and a total of 18 mines.

1343
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,909
If a chip is placed on top of a mine,

1344
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:39,210
the chip will change
from black to white...

1345
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,319
or from white to black.

1346
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:48,020
You may not move the chip that was moved
by your opponent in the previous turn.

1347
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:53,260
The player that creates
a line of four first...

1348
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,729
will advance to the next round.

1349
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,600
I didn't think I would lose.

1350
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,329
I was thinking of winning no matter what.

1351
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,539
I thought it would be difficult
for Dex to fully understand the game.

1352
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:04,409
And I thought I would be
at an advantage...

1353
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,640
if I knew this particular game beforehand.

1354
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:09,310
That is why I chose Color Turn...

1355
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,510
instead of Hidden Mission.

1356
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:14,449
To be honest,
I knew I would probably lose...

1357
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:17,180
if I had to be against Jin Ho.

1358
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,520
But we've all played a lot of Gomoku
when we were little.

1359
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,720
I drew the game in a notebook
and played with my friends.

1360
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,859
I was pretty familiar with the game,

1361
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:28,630
so I thought I had a chance.

1362
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,500
The first turn will go to Hong Jin Ho,

1363
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,800
- who was the winner of the semifinals.
- Okay.

1364
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,340
(Hong Jin Ho goes first.)

1365
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:41,039
There is no change. Dex, it is your turn.

1366
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:49,550
There is no change.
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1367
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:56,159
The chip will change colors.

1368
01:10:58,289 --> 01:10:59,529
Dex, it is your turn.

1369
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,159
(He adds a chip.)

1370
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:06,100
The chip will change colors.

1371
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:08,800
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1372
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:11,869
It was easy to memorize
the locations of the mines.

1373
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:14,909
If the mines were in the 2nd and 4th spot,

1374
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,279
I just memorized 2 and 4 in my head.

1375
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,880
For the second row,
I memorized the numbers in English.

1376
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:22,420
The mines were in spots 3 and 5,

1377
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,619
so I just kept repeating
2, 4, 3, 5 in my head.

1378
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,250
Dex, it is your turn.

1379
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:31,159
(He moves the black chip
over a mine spot.)

1380
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,489
The chip will change colors.

1381
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,829
To be honest, it was hard to memorize
the locations of all the mines.

1382
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:42,000
Since I knew I wouldn't be able
to memorize the spots of the mines,

1383
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,869
I didn't touch the chips again...

1384
01:11:44,869 --> 01:11:47,880
if they changed colors
because the changed color...

1385
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,479
told me that there was a mine
at that spot.

1386
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:54,579
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1387
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,960
The chip will change colors.

1388
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,399
In the row right in front of me,

1389
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:10,960
there were three black chips.

1390
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:12,470
And I had a strategy...

1391
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,329
inside my head to complete the line.

1392
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:16,569
So I thought it would be
an easy win for me.

1393
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:20,109
Dex, it is your turn.

1394
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,750
The chip will change colors.

1395
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,390
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1396
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:40,189
There is no change. Dex, it is your turn.

1397
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,369
The chip will change colors.

1398
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,199
(Dex is actively looking for the mines.)

1399
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:51,970
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1400
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,739
The chip will change colors.

1401
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:00,409
(Hong Jin Ho creates a row
of three black chips again.)

1402
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,789
Dex, it is your turn.

1403
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,729
The chip will change colors.

1404
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:25,909
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1405
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,409
(Hong Jin Ho attacks again.)

1406
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:30,579
There is no change.

1407
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,850
Even in Gomoku, there is a 3-3 strategy...

1408
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,119
where you have two options to win.

1409
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:41,090
I kept thinking of that strategy,

1410
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,689
and it was almost complete.

1411
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:45,689
I only needed one more chip.

1412
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,100
Dex, it is your turn.

1413
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,399
There is no change.

1414
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,399
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1415
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,609
The chip will change colors.

1416
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,550
(He keeps getting close to winning.)

1417
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,920
Dex, it is your turn.

1418
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,800
The chip will change colors.

1419
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,630
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1420
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:31,409
As I was playing the game,

1421
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:33,810
I started to remember the locations
of the mines through shapes.

1422
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,239
I would remember where the mines were
by the shape of an "L" and so forth.

1423
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,350
That is how I engraved
the mines in my head,

1424
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,380
and I tried not to forget.

1425
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:44,920
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1426
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,960
It was pretty rough.

1427
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,659
I only needed to move one last chip,

1428
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:54,229
but Dex would move it somewhere else.

1429
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:55,659
Then I would move it back...

1430
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:57,359
and Dex would move it again.

1431
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,270
The same thing kept repeating
over and over again.

1432
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,270
The game wouldn't end.

1433
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:04,000
I wasn't sure
how to get out of that quagmire.

1434
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:13,550
(The current mines that have been found.)

1435
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:19,789
The chip will change colors.

1436
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:22,020
(Hong Jin Ho finds a new mine.)

1437
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,130
(Dismayed)

1438
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,130
Dex, it is your turn.

1439
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:31,829
Toward the end,
there were a lot more white chips.

1440
01:15:31,829 --> 01:15:34,939
And there were also
a lot more chances for me...

1441
01:15:34,939 --> 01:15:37,369
to try out a lot of options.

1442
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:42,880
There is no change.

1443
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,039
(Dex makes a row of three white chips.)

1444
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,380
Hong Jin Ho, it is your turn.

1445
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:47,680
(Confused)

1446
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,420
All of a sudden,
the chips in front of me were all white.

1447
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,050
There were three white chips,

1448
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,220
and I just needed to move one chip...

1449
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,619
to make four white chips.

1450
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,260
What? What is he thinking?

1451
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:04,899
I thought the game was over.

1452
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,710
So I moved the chip quickly,

1453
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:21,850
but I sensed a weird feeling.

1454
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,720
Something felt out of place.

1455
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,189
There is no change.

1456
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,789
(A line of four white chips
has been made.)

1457
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:33,829
The game is over.

1458
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,329
The winner is Dex.

1459
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,800
I thought I won.

1460
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:46,609
At that moment, my brain moved quickly,

1461
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:49,039
and I realized that Dex was white
and that I was black.

1462
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:51,109
So I was supposed to create a black line.

1463
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,010
That was the reason for my defeat.

1464
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,550
As the winner of the semifinals, I was
allowed to know the game ahead of time.

1465
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,720
I received the rules in written form.

1466
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,489
So when I read the rules,

1467
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:05,529
I understood that there were 14 chips...

1468
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:08,159
and that I just had
to create a line of four...

1469
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,460
within my boundaries,
whether the color was black...

1470
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,500
or white.

1471
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:14,600
(Hong Jin Ho lost
due to misunderstanding the rules.)

1472
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,300
Color Turn is over.

1473
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,039
The winner is Dex.

1474
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:20,670
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1475
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:23,010
- I made a mistake.
- It was an honor, Jin Ho.

1476
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:24,750
It was an honor.

1477
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,380
You went through a lot.

1478
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:30,020
I wished you would make a mistake,
but I made the mistake.

1479
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,420
I realized that I could lose like this.

1480
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,760
I didn't understand the rules of the game.

1481
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,060
I misunderstood.

1482
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:40,189
It was usually my strategy to win by
having a good understanding of the rules.

1483
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:43,060
But I was hoisted by my own petard.

1484
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:47,800
(During the semifinals,
Hong Jin Ho won by using the rules.)

1485
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,909
(During the semifinals,
Hong Jin Ho won by using the rules.)

1486
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:56,180
To put it nicely,
it was a learning experience.

1487
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,810
To put it in a bad way, I was an idiot.

1488
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,819
Darn it.

1489
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:11,689
The thing is, for half of my life,

1490
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:13,989
I've always been battling against someone.

1491
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,359
So I feel like I'm always...

1492
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:18,369
more eager to win than anyone.

1493
01:18:18,369 --> 01:18:21,100
I always want to win,
but it never happens.

1494
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,939
But what's important...

1495
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:25,170
is not the fact
that I can't become the winner.

1496
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,409
I always have a chance
of winning or losing.

1497
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,840
(Let's do 4 and 7.)

1498
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,109
(For the first turn?)

1499
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:31,850
(Submit 4 and 7, and for the next turn,)

1500
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,680
(just do the highest combination.)

1501
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:35,579
(He calculated every possible outcome.)

1502
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:37,649
(Ha Seung Jin: 4, 7)

1503
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,119
(We won.)

1504
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:43,689
(His predictions of the opposing team's
strategies were on point.)

1505
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,789
(We won.)

1506
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,329
(Did you do 7 and 4?)

1507
01:18:48,029 --> 01:18:51,130
(Hong Jin Ho helped his team win.)

1508
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:55,039
(He was a strategist who led his team.)

1509
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:56,800
(Make grey 4, and grey will be last.)

1510
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,840
(They were threatened.)

1511
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,140
(To prepare for the Deathmatch.)

1512
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:02,010
- If they choose.
- Darn it.

1513
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,279
(I should get prepared
for the Deathmatch.)

1514
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:07,050
(No, I'll compete in the Deathmatch.)

1515
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,779
(You can win.)

1516
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:11,079
(I'll go and beat KNUCKS.)

1517
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,420
(You can send YunB to the wild.)

1518
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,390
(After he brought victory
to his teammates,)

1519
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:20,090
(he volunteered
to participate in Deathmatch.)

1520
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:24,229
(He won against
the leader of the rival team.)

1521
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:26,829
(You want the 3-point block?)

1522
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:28,470
(That would be the best option.)

1523
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,640
(I can end things.)

1524
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:35,409
(He was a player who was skilled
in every aspect.)

1525
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,939
I like competing against other people,

1526
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,949
and I'm going to continue to do
what I've been doing.

1527
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:43,649
As hard as this was,
it'll leave a lasting impact on my life.

1528
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:49,560
I'm going to remember a lot
from Bloody Game 2.

1529
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:51,420
(Final match bracket)

1530
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,159
(Dex)

1531
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:55,859
The first round
of the final match has ended.

1532
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:58,470
Players, please gather in the main hall.

1533
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:06,369
I can't believe I made it to the finals.

1534
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,310
Before the final match,

1535
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,979
there are people who came
to cheer the two finalists on.

1536
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,779
What?

1537
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,149
- They're here.
- Goodness.

1538
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,350
- Hello.
- You guys went through a lot.

1539
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,819
(The eliminated players
came together for the finals.)

1540
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:22,390
- Hi.
- Jin Young!

1541
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,630
It's been a while. Gosh.

1542
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:28,029
- How did you make it this far?
- I'm going to the finals.

1543
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:30,300
- Win.
- Of course.

1544
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,770
- You have to win.
- Of course.

1545
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:34,869
Dex, how did this happen?

1546
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,840
It's only natural after beating you.

1547
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,039
Thanks. Then win for me.

1548
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:41,109
Okay.

1549
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,039
There's something
I've been saying half-jokingly.

1550
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,609
"The one who beats Jin Ho
will win the whole competition,"

1551
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:48,819
is what I said.

1552
01:20:48,819 --> 01:20:53,050
Since I actually beat Jin Ho,
I think it occurred to me...

1553
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:55,260
that I really have to win.

1554
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,659
Jin Hyeong was known as the brain,

1555
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:01,829
and he may be good at showing off
his personal abilities.

1556
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:05,630
But one method of knocking him down
is dominating him mentally.

1557
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:10,100
So my strategy was to be bold
and play aggressively.

1558
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,869
If there's one thing I could ask for,

1559
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,170
coming up to this point,

1560
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:17,810
there were a lot of moments
when luck was not on my side.

1561
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,710
But for this last moment,

1562
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:24,149
I hope Lady Luck will be on my side.

1563
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:25,420
Let's win this.

1564
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:28,760
Good work. You went through a lot.

1565
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,760
I came here to win.

1566
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,829
And there is only one game left
before my victory.

1567
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:37,460
I don't want to be satisfied
for coming this far...

1568
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,329
and go back home with the runner-up title.

1569
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,170
I came here to win,

1570
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:44,170
I'm going to win, and I must win.

1571
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:46,470
Dex may be slow
in understanding the rules,

1572
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:49,479
but once he gets
a good grasp of the rules,

1573
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:52,210
he's shown
that he can be a strong opponent.

1574
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:56,020
So I can't let my guard down
and consider him an easy opponent.

1575
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,390
For that reason, I will do my best...

1576
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,520
to get ready
for my final match against Dex.

1577
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:08,060
Now, the final game will be revealed.

1578
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,899
Today's final match is...

1579
01:22:11,529 --> 01:22:13,170
Jungle Maze.

1580
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,430
(This game was created
with the help of Korea BoardGames.)

1581
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:15,899
Jungle Maze...

1582
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:18,510
is a game that uses one's
spatial perception and judgment skills...

1583
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:21,609
to reach a destination
after moving maze tiles.

1584
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:23,909
On the maze between the two players...

1585
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:26,210
are 16 fixed tiles...

1586
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:30,220
and 33 movable tiles.

1587
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,720
Each player will have
four destination cards.

1588
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,720
The first card that is revealed
will show each player's first destination.

1589
01:22:38,989 --> 01:22:42,329
On a player's turn,
two actions must be carried out.

1590
01:22:42,329 --> 01:22:43,460
First,

1591
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:46,569
push a spare tile in the direction...

1592
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:49,399
of the arrows to move the maze.

1593
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:53,010
However, a tile
that was pushed out of the maze...

1594
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,140
in the previous turn
can't be pushed back in right away.

1595
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,909
(Destination)

1596
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,609
Second, after rearranging the maze,

1597
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:03,020
you may move your game piece.

1598
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:06,720
If the path is connected,
the game piece can move anywhere.

1599
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,020
Choosing not to move is also an option.

1600
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:11,020
Once a player reaches their destination,

1601
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,960
the corresponding destination card
is discarded,

1602
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:16,800
and the card on top of the deck...

1603
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,300
will be the next destination.

1604
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:22,840
The player that reaches
all four of their destinations...

1605
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,510
and returns
to their starting point first wins.

1606
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:30,439
(Winner, runner-up)

1607
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,489
- They're starting.
- They're starting now.

1608
01:24:13,489 --> 01:24:14,789
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1609
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:18,289
I'm going to sit up now.

1610
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:21,289
The final match of Bloody Game 2...

1611
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:24,699
between Dex and Lee Jin Hyeong will start.

1612
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:28,369
The person who gets to start is Dex,

1613
01:24:28,369 --> 01:24:30,670
who has more individual funds left.

1614
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:36,140
I will now reveal the first destination.

1615
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,750
(Dex: Eye, Lee Jin Hyeong: Moon)

1616
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,119
(Dex's destination,
Lee Jin Hyeong's destination)

1617
01:24:50,289 --> 01:24:52,159
Dex, please move a tile.

1618
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:56,359
(He inserts the tile without hesitation.)

1619
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,840
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1620
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,739
Lee Jin Hyeong, please move a tile.

1621
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:13,109
(Lee Jin Hyeong's destination.)

1622
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,079
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1623
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,819
Dex, please move a tile.

1624
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,789
I wanted to give him
a lot of "L" shapes...

1625
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:28,229
to make it hard for my opponent
to create a path.

1626
01:25:28,229 --> 01:25:30,859
I started the game with only one strategy.

1627
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,310
Will you move your game piece?

1628
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:40,340
Yes.

1629
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,210
Lee Jin Hyeong, please move a tile.

1630
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,850
Will you move a game piece?

1631
01:25:53,619 --> 01:25:54,619
No.

1632
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:57,720
(Jin Hyeong doesn't move his piece
closer to the destination.)

1633
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,689
Rather than getting closer
little by little,

1634
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:02,399
I wanted to hide
my big picture strategy...

1635
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:04,960
from my opponent until the last second,

1636
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,829
then reach the destination in one go.

1637
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,670
I thought that would help
in breaking my opponent's resolve.

1638
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,840
It's Dex's turn.

1639
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,069
Please move a tile.

1640
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,210
Will you move a game piece?

1641
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:22,479
No.

1642
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:25,689
They're trying not to give each other
any "I" or "T" shapes.

1643
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:27,649
The piece Jin Hyeong is holding
right now...

1644
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,789
is the worst one to place.

1645
01:26:29,789 --> 01:26:31,319
That one's the hardest to place,

1646
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,229
- and the "T" shape is the easiest.
- Yes, the "T" shape is the best one.

1647
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:34,829
He should keep moving out that shape then.

1648
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,210
(After pondering for a while,)

1649
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,250
(Jin Hyeong places his tile.)

1650
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:02,489
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1651
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:13,699
Will you move your game piece?

1652
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:14,729
Yes.

1653
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:15,800
(Dex arrives at his first destination.)

1654
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,840
You have reached your first destination.

1655
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,909
I thought that I started well,

1656
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:25,109
and that I was off to a good start.

1657
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:26,810
If I just kept going at this pace,

1658
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:29,149
I thought I could win handily.

1659
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:30,979
I will now reveal the second destination.

1660
01:27:31,649 --> 01:27:34,119
(Dex's second destination)

1661
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:38,159
(Mountain)

1662
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,689
Gosh.

1663
01:27:40,659 --> 01:27:41,890
(Dex's destination)

1664
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,529
(Jin Hyeong's destination)

1665
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:47,300
(Jin Hyeong lost a point
to Dex from the start.)

1666
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,739
That's not bad. He just needs
to move over the "I" shape,

1667
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:51,369
- and he can move to the right.
- You're right.

1668
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,319
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1669
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,250
You have reached your first destination.

1670
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,689
If I only try to defend,
I won't be able to create my path.

1671
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:15,189
In order to reach my destination,

1672
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:16,760
I thought I could make up...

1673
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,000
for any "I" shaped tiles
I ended up handing over to Dex.

1674
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,729
I will now reveal your second destination.

1675
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:24,600
(Lee Jin Hyeong's second destination)

1676
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,409
(Eye)

1677
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:32,779
(The destination that Dex
had just reached before)

1678
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:40,020
(Dex 1, Lee Jin Hyeong 1)

1679
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:41,789
Will you move your game piece?

1680
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:44,859
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1681
01:28:44,859 --> 01:28:46,060
Please move a tile.

1682
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,699
As soon as the second destination
was revealed,

1683
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:50,760
I became certain that I could reach it...

1684
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,029
without sacrificing too much.

1685
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,670
(He gets close with one turn.)

1686
01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:00,170
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1687
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:02,010
He can't give him an "I" shape here.

1688
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,239
Jin Hyeong will get it with an "I."

1689
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:05,380
(Jin Hyeong can reach his destination
immediately if he gets an "I" shape.)

1690
01:29:07,779 --> 01:29:11,579
(Dex gives Jin Hyeong an "L" shape tile.)

1691
01:29:12,289 --> 01:29:14,149
(An "I" shape tile got forced to move.)

1692
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:16,189
- Will you move your game piece?
- No.

1693
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:17,460
What? Really?

1694
01:29:17,789 --> 01:29:19,130
Jin Hyeong will get his second one now.

1695
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,159
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1696
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:22,329
Please move a tile.

1697
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:25,130
(Lee Jin Hyeong's destination)

1698
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,340
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1699
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:36,539
You have reached your second destination.

1700
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,279
I will now reveal your third destination.

1701
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:44,250
(Lee Jin Hyeong's third destination)

1702
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,989
(Mountain)

1703
01:29:47,989 --> 01:29:49,289
It's Dex's turn.

1704
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:50,619
Please move a tile.

1705
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:52,460
They both have "Mountain" right now.

1706
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,060
- They both have the triangle.
- They have the same destination,

1707
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,189
and the same path.

1708
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:56,630
This is fun.

1709
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:59,199
Jin Hyeong has the advantage
because he already got two.

1710
01:29:59,229 --> 01:30:06,739
(Dex 1, Lee Jin Hyeong 2)

1711
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:11,979
Will you move your game piece?

1712
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:14,510
(Lee Jin Hyeong and Dex's destination)

1713
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:15,680
It's Lee Jin Hyeong's turn.

1714
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,020
Please move a tile.

1715
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:20,989
(Lee Jin Hyeong and Dex's destination)

1716
01:30:20,989 --> 01:30:22,520
Will you move your game piece?

1717
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,560
Yes.

1718
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:29,329
(Moving far away from his destination)

1719
01:30:29,329 --> 01:30:31,729
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1720
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:33,829
He moved in the opposite direction.

1721
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:35,100
He has to block Dex.

1722
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,899
It's better if he makes a path...

1723
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:39,239
toward a destination Jin Hyeong's gotten
and Dex hasn't.

1724
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,439
If I open the path to the right,

1725
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:43,510
I can reach my destination,

1726
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:47,350
but Dex can follow me right after.

1727
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:49,920
That's why I chose to go around.

1728
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,890
Will you move your game piece?

1729
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,630
(Lee Jin Hyeong and Dex's destination)

1730
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,130
I have my own strategy.

1731
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:07,829
If I place my piece on a piece
that can move,

1732
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:11,039
my opponent can move my piece
in a random direction.

1733
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,810
It could create a situation
different from what I intended.

1734
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:18,180
That's why I tried to place my piece...

1735
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,579
on tiles that were fixed.

1736
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:21,449
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1737
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:22,720
Please move a tile.

1738
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,319
(Dex has reached the adjacent tile.)

1739
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:32,590
(Here?)

1740
01:31:34,229 --> 01:31:35,229
(Nodding)

1741
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:40,899
(Jin Hyeong pushed out a "T" shaped tile.)

1742
01:31:40,899 --> 01:31:42,500
Will you move your game piece?

1743
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:44,739
No.

1744
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,869
Why not?

1745
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,510
It's a "T" shape.

1746
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:49,909
Dex will get it now.

1747
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:51,239
Why did he give him a "T?"

1748
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:53,079
He didn't see it.

1749
01:31:53,079 --> 01:31:54,279
He missed it.

1750
01:31:54,279 --> 01:31:55,720
I don't think Dex saw it either.

1751
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,420
I'm sure he saw it. No way.

1752
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,920
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1753
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,729
(Dex doesn't place his tile right away.)

1754
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:14,729
See? He's not going right away.

1755
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,199
No.

1756
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,609
Just put it down, Dex,
and you can get your destination now.

1757
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:25,750
Just put it down.

1758
01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:41,989
- He put it down.
- That's it.

1759
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,560
That's it.

1760
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,000
Jin Hyeong just broke down mentally.

1761
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,069
He broke down.

1762
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,170
Will you move your game piece?

1763
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,170
Yes.

1764
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,810
You have reached your second destination.

1765
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,739
I will now reveal your third destination.

1766
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,649
(Dex's third destination)

1767
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:04,979
(Moon)

1768
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:07,250
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 2)

1769
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,819
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1770
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:10,020
Please move a tile.

1771
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,630
I was only thinking about my own path,

1772
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:20,029
and gave away that destination by mistake.

1773
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:21,470
After that,

1774
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:23,170
I felt surprised and discombobulated,

1775
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:25,399
and my mental fortitude
was definitely shaken.

1776
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,340
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 2)

1777
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,739
Will you move your game piece?

1778
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:29,779
No.

1779
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,239
Jin Hyeong.

1780
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:33,149
Jin Hyeong's totally...

1781
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:34,880
He's had a total mental breakdown.

1782
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:36,420
He realized he made a mistake.

1783
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,489
First of all, Dex played the game well.

1784
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,260
He didn't take obvious paths,

1785
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,529
but placed his pieces on fixed tiles,

1786
01:33:51,829 --> 01:33:54,729
or thought about what I would do
in my upcoming turns,

1787
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:57,470
and placed his pieces on tiles
to counter my moves.

1788
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:59,270
I could see all that clearly.

1789
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,739
After we reached a tie,

1790
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:03,039
I focused more on building a path...

1791
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:06,380
that Dex wouldn't discover.

1792
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:14,619
(Lee Jin Hyeong's destination,
Dex's destination)

1793
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:20,289
(Lee Jin Hyeong's destination)

1794
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,029
This is driving me insane.

1795
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,670
(Lee Jin Hyeong's destination)

1796
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,409
Will you move your game piece?

1797
01:34:36,409 --> 01:34:37,409
Yes.

1798
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:50,590
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1799
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,970
Jin Hyeong can make it with one more push
on that side.

1800
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,100
He can take that "I" shape...

1801
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,670
and connect his path like that.

1802
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:12,579
(He can make it to his destination
using any tile.)

1803
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:19,220
Whenever I wished most fervently...

1804
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:22,020
for Dex not to make a certain move...

1805
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,989
after placing my pieces,

1806
01:35:23,989 --> 01:35:27,130
Dex would do exactly what I feared
in his next turn.

1807
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,859
That happened several times.

1808
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:30,460
That's why I was praying so hard...

1809
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:33,500
that he wouldn't notice my plan
for just this turn.

1810
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:40,609
(Jin Hyeong had to push the fourth row
to the right.)

1811
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:48,750
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 2)

1812
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:58,819
(Identifying Jin Hyeong's plan exactly)

1813
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,930
- You're good.
- Yes, well.

1814
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:06,770
Now, you have nowhere to go.

1815
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:09,770
I could see the big picture,

1816
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:10,970
so I was able to predict his move.

1817
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,539
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1818
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:14,710
Please move a tile.

1819
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:22,779
(Jin Hyeong opens a different path.)

1820
01:36:22,779 --> 01:36:24,180
Will you move your game piece?

1821
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,250
No.

1822
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,590
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1823
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:37,229
(Lee Jin Hyeong's destination)

1824
01:36:37,229 --> 01:36:38,960
Will you move your game piece?

1825
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:41,029
(Dex's destination)

1826
01:36:41,029 --> 01:36:42,069
Yes.

1827
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:50,939
Let me reach my destination.

1828
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:52,239
No way, my friend.

1829
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:01,149
I felt pressured,

1830
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,590
and Dex seemed confident.

1831
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:07,229
"So this is how I go home,"
is what I was thinking.

1832
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:16,840
(Dex pushed his destination
in front of Jin Hyeong.)

1833
01:37:21,409 --> 01:37:22,939
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1834
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:24,479
Please move a tile.

1835
01:37:33,649 --> 01:37:34,920
Please take care of me.

1836
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:39,859
I thought it wasn't good
to only try to get close.

1837
01:37:39,859 --> 01:37:42,489
If I keep trying to create a path
where there is none,

1838
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,430
trying to get closer to the destination,

1839
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,699
the paths will become a mess.

1840
01:37:46,729 --> 01:37:49,439
(Dex had no path to get closer.)

1841
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:50,739
(Moving to a fixed tile
he can use to reach his destination)

1842
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:52,640
(Dex's destination)

1843
01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:56,380
This looks like a poisoned cup.
Can I really take this?

1844
01:37:56,909 --> 01:37:57,939
What should I do?

1845
01:38:05,619 --> 01:38:07,449
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1846
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,689
You have reached your third destination.

1847
01:38:10,689 --> 01:38:12,520
I will now reveal the final destination.

1848
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,659
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 3)

1849
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:19,829
(Sun)

1850
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:25,369
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1851
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,380
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 3)

1852
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:32,710
(The next destination is on the spot
that Dex is occupying.)

1853
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,649
Dex has a lot to think about now.

1854
01:38:37,649 --> 01:38:39,619
He has to defend and move forward.

1855
01:38:39,619 --> 01:38:41,189
He needs to make a path
to move out of there,

1856
01:38:41,189 --> 01:38:43,060
but then Jin Hyeong will reach
the destination,

1857
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,020
so he must be thinking about this.

1858
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:46,430
(He cannot make a path
without thinking it through.)

1859
01:38:46,789 --> 01:38:49,529
One mistake I made...

1860
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:51,199
is that the deeper we got
into the second half,

1861
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,869
the blocks at the ends...

1862
01:38:52,869 --> 01:38:54,630
were all good blocks.

1863
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:58,239
The time to give my opponent...

1864
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,239
the bad blocks I wanted to give him
had passed.

1865
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:04,510
It was a bad judgment call,
and it put me in danger.

1866
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:06,979
I thought things were going badly.

1867
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:10,520
I did get the sense that the pace
was coming over to my side.

1868
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:14,319
I started thinking I could win
after finding one mistake.

1869
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:18,920
A poisoned cup.

1870
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,770
(Tilting his head)

1871
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,710
- Will you move your game piece?
- No.

1872
01:39:35,409 --> 01:39:38,409
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.
Please move a tile.

1873
01:39:38,409 --> 01:39:46,420
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 3)

1874
01:39:50,689 --> 01:39:52,489
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1875
01:39:53,329 --> 01:39:55,390
You have reached your fourth destination.

1876
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:57,659
You now just have to return
to your starting point.

1877
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,770
(He will win if he can get back
to his starting point.)

1878
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,699
Dex, please move a tile.

1879
01:40:01,699 --> 01:40:07,310
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 3)

1880
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:09,439
Doesn't Dex need an "L" shape?

1881
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,710
He's been totally isolated.

1882
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:12,979
(He cannot reach his destination
with an "I" shaped tile.)

1883
01:40:12,979 --> 01:40:18,020
(Dex 2, Lee Jin Hyeong 4)

1884
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,890
(Dex's destination)

1885
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,489
Will you move your game piece?

1886
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:23,659
(Dex opens a path nowhere near
his next destination.)

1887
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,520
No.

1888
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:29,130
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.
Please move a tile.

1889
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:36,340
(Lee Jin Hyeong's starting point)

1890
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,300
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1891
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:44,180
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1892
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:54,319
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1893
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:56,920
(Dex's destination)

1894
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,659
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.
Please move a tile.

1895
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,210
What is he thinking?

1896
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:26,250
Currently, in a situation
where Jin Hyeong seeks a path...

1897
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:29,689
to his starting point, there is a reason
Dex is not aggressively blocking.

1898
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:31,619
In his next turn,

1899
01:41:31,619 --> 01:41:34,659
Dex can create a path
to his remaining destinations at once.

1900
01:41:35,029 --> 01:41:36,760
If he can get his hands
on an "I" shaped tile,

1901
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,260
he can return to his starting point
right away.

1902
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:41,699
While distracting Lee Jin Hyeong,

1903
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:44,970
he was making a path
to his final point on the board.

1904
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:52,039
Most of the remaining tiles
are "I" or "T" shapes.

1905
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:55,409
The situation allows for an upset
within 1 or 2 turns.

1906
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:58,420
Even after Jin Hyeong made it
to his fourth destination,

1907
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,090
I didn't give up.

1908
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:02,220
Jin Hyeong is someone
who feels rushed often,

1909
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:06,119
and who doesn't pay attention
to the details.

1910
01:42:06,529 --> 01:42:09,159
For example, if I can get
to the next checkpoint in one go...

1911
01:42:09,159 --> 01:42:13,829
There were two points
throughout the game when that happened.

1912
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:17,039
This was my chance, and I saw
that I could win with an upset.

1913
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:24,380
- Will you move your game piece?
- Yes.

1914
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:41,989
(Lee Jin Hyeong cannot let go
of his game piece.)

1915
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:57,579
You played well.

1916
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:10,319
You played well, but I played better.

1917
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:16,260
There was one spot.

1918
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,960
One spot where he couldn't block me,

1919
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:21,029
and from where I could get
to my starting point before Dex.

1920
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:22,500
There was one spot.

1921
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:28,010
With Jin Hyeong's piece on this spot,

1922
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:30,739
if Dex were to push the column down
to block his path,

1923
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:33,109
Jin Hyeong could use the pushed tile
in the first row...

1924
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:34,750
to reach his starting point.

1925
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,420
If Dex were to push the adjacent row
to the left to block,

1926
01:43:40,819 --> 01:43:43,720
Jin Hyeong can use the pushed tile
in the column to reach his starting point.

1927
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,960
Because he pushed the row left
in the previous turn,

1928
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,600
he cannot now push it to the right.

1929
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:52,800
It's Dex's turn. Please move a tile.

1930
01:43:58,869 --> 01:44:00,109
I'll move it this way.

1931
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:06,710
- Will you move your game piece?
- No.

1932
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:08,750
It's Jin Hyeong's turn.

1933
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,289
Please move your game piece.

1934
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:16,819
(Lee Jin Hyeong arrives
at his starting point.)

1935
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:18,159
Good game.

1936
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:23,000
Lee Jin Hyeong has reached
the starting point, and the game is over.

1937
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,100
(The final winner
of Bloody Game 2 is Lee Jin Hyeong.)

1938
01:44:26,529 --> 01:44:28,399
This was an almost unbeatable move.

1939
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:30,039
I really thought I lost.

1940
01:44:30,039 --> 01:44:31,140
(He won through a perfect checkmate.)

1941
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,510
- That's a pity.
- You did so well.

1942
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:36,310
(Runner-up, Dex)

1943
01:44:56,529 --> 01:44:58,899
The final match is now over.

1944
01:44:59,229 --> 01:45:01,699
All players,
please gather in the main hall.

1945
01:45:09,939 --> 01:45:13,550
The final winner of Bloody Game
is Lee Jin Hyeong.

1946
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:16,250
(The final winner of Bloody Game
is Lee Jin Hyeong.)

1947
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:25,220
- You worked hard.
- You really worked hard.

1948
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,729
This victory is a huge honor for me.

1949
01:45:27,729 --> 01:45:30,100
I came here because I got a perfect score
on the CSAT.

1950
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:34,569
But my strategies failed one after another
in the Money Challenges,

1951
01:45:34,569 --> 01:45:36,500
and I always lost by a hair.

1952
01:45:36,739 --> 01:45:41,439
(He led the calculations as the brain
of the Outdoor Team, but...)

1953
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:44,180
(Shoot, I'm doomed.)

1954
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:47,380
(His plans never worked out as planned.)

1955
01:45:49,449 --> 01:45:53,350
(Outdoor players' arithmetic value
1,425,569.67)

1956
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:56,250
(Losing with a low value)

1957
01:45:56,659 --> 01:46:01,760
(Consecutive losses even led
to Jin Hyeong's expulsion.)

1958
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:04,729
(Sighing)

1959
01:46:04,729 --> 01:46:06,300
(I hate this.)

1960
01:46:06,869 --> 01:46:09,329
I felt a lot of pressure,
and I got a little worried.

1961
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,600
But I worked hard despite that...

1962
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,140
to make sure my determination
didn't waver.

1963
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:19,279
(Deathmatch against YunB)

1964
01:46:19,609 --> 01:46:23,979
(He gained points in special categories
with an overpowering presence.)

1965
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:26,550
(Lee Jin Hyeong wins by forfeit.)

1966
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:30,420
(Even at the Deathmatch
the following day,)

1967
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,829
(he won with a perfect score.)

1968
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:38,399
(The final match of Bloody Game 2...)

1969
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:39,930
(will now begin.)

1970
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:43,340
(He beat Dex to be the final winner.)

1971
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:46,670
I felt like this was a chance
to prove myself,

1972
01:46:47,069 --> 01:46:49,210
so I believe this was
a very meaningful opportunity.

1973
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:51,039
If I won, I really wanted to say this.

1974
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,939
I had a great time playing this game.

1975
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:58,149
To me, Bloody Game...

1976
01:46:58,149 --> 01:46:59,819
was something I loved and hated.

1977
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,949
Even after being on Bloody Game 1,

1978
01:47:01,949 --> 01:47:04,319
I felt I was a really bad fit
for this kind of show,

1979
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:06,590
and that I was really bad
at using my head.

1980
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:08,090
But when I heard there was
a Bloody Game 2,

1981
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:11,630
I wanted to join and show people
the sides of me that I hadn't before.

1982
01:47:11,729 --> 01:47:14,930
I wanted to make up for what
I couldn't achieve last time.

1983
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:16,899
But when I ended up in the wild
right away,

1984
01:47:16,899 --> 01:47:18,569
I told myself I knew
it would turn out this way.

1985
01:47:18,569 --> 01:47:21,210
(Dex was sent to the Survival Zone
outside on his first day.)

1986
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,380
(Even my clothes, I want to rip them up.)

1987
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:25,210
(They stink so much.)

1988
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:33,149
(Even in the inhospitable environment,
he didn't hold back physically.)

1989
01:47:35,289 --> 01:47:39,020
(The Day of Ambush)

1990
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,890
(Hitting)

1991
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:43,090
(He got through Ha Seung Jin
for a successful ambush.)

1992
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,729
I was nominated for Deathmatches
more than anyone else,

1993
01:47:46,729 --> 01:47:49,729
and played several rounds.

1994
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:51,699
(I will now reveal the results
of the nominations.)

1995
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:57,140
(Dex was nominated to play
in the Deathmatch numerous times.)

1996
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:00,079
(How many times have I been chosen?)

1997
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:02,579
(His first Deathmatch)

1998
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:03,920
I27.

1999
01:48:04,119 --> 01:48:05,350
(That is correct.)

2000
01:48:05,449 --> 01:48:06,550
S13.

2001
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:07,550
(That is correct.)

2002
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:09,689
(He won against Fujii Mina.)

2003
01:48:09,689 --> 01:48:12,859
(His second Deathmatch)

2004
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,590
(I got it.)

2005
01:48:14,829 --> 01:48:15,829
(I got it.)

2006
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:18,060
(Dex has the right answer.)

2007
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:21,770
(The Deathmatch survivor was Dex.)

2008
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:22,899
Thank you.

2009
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:25,369
I survived and went all the way to finals.

2010
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:27,010
How did I get so far?

2011
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:29,810
I was amazed and impressed with myself.

2012
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:33,109
Even though I couldn't win
against my opponent in the finals,

2013
01:48:33,109 --> 01:48:35,680
and think it's a shame
that I came in second,

2014
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:39,420
I think beating Jin Ho and coming in
second in the overall game...

2015
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,520
is a great honor for me.

2016
01:48:42,619 --> 01:48:45,659
I think this might be a greater honor
than placing first.

2017
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:47,329
If there's a Bloody Game 7,

2018
01:48:47,329 --> 01:48:51,060
I'll aim for first again then.

2019
01:48:51,159 --> 01:48:52,500
This was Dex.

2020
