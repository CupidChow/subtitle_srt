1
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,710
Bloody Game is over.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,519
After the fierce competition,
the 14 players have left...

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,519
the Bloody Mansion.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,789
Today, we will forget
about the cutthroat competition...

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,329
and watch the various cutaway scenes
of the players.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,239
(1. The taste of properly cooked beef)

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,109
- What's that?
- Hang on.

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,810
(Phantom Casino is now open.)

9
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,850
Let's go.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,719
Jin Ho, Phantom Casino is open.

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,619
- What?
- The casino is open.

12
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,119
- Is it open?
- Yes.

13
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,859
- Let's go.
- Okay.

14
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,630
- Okay. Let's go.
- Nice.

15
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,729
Hello.

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,640
Hello. Welcome to Phantom Casino.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
What's this?

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,579
We should order these first.

19
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,150
All right. First, we will have beef.

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,319
Yes. You ordered 1kg of beef
with 10 coins.

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,159
This is the gambling money for you guys.

22
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,230
(They get 10 coins each.)

23
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,489
I'd like to exchange this.

24
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
Here are ten coins.

25
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,469
Would you like to play today's game?

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,370
Today's game is Tai Sai.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,969
Tai Sai is a game where you place
your bets on what you think...

29
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:42,870
will show face up on two dice
or the combination.

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,079
And you win the dividend
based on the results of the dice.

31
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,549
Players may place their bets
on any numbers and combinations...

32
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,650
on the betting board.

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,719
Single Die is a bet where the two dice...

34
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,849
come up with the same number.

35
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,060
Pair Dice is a bet...

36
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,590
where you select
the combination of two numbers.

37
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,390
Odd and Even is a bet
that a total of the two dice...

38
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,099
will be either even or odd numbers.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,270
The Butler will put the dice
in the shaker and shake them.

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,370
Then she will announce
each number of the two dice...

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,000
or the total of the numbers.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,110
If the players' bet matches
with the result of the dice,

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,240
the players win.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,180
They will win the dividend
by multiplying the number of coins bet...

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,949
by the dividend rate.

46
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,750
If players lose,

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,979
they lose all the coins bet.

48
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,490
Now, you may make a bet...

49
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,860
by placing your coins
on the betting board.

50
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,360
I examined the betting board.

51
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,789
And I figured...

52
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:40,969
all the bets but Odd and Even were...

53
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,699
games of odds.

54
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,699
It's a game
that's unfavorable to the players...

55
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,639
unless there are some tricks or patterns.

56
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,370
So I thought
it would be to my advantage...

57
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,939
to bet only on Odd and Even.

58
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,150
Are we supposed to use our brains?
No, right?

59
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,180
- This is all about luck.
- Still, you can think of your chances.

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,090
Okay. I'm in.

61
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,819
- Hang on.
- Place your coin on the betting board...

62
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,819
- You want to go all in?
- Yes.

63
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,090
Are you crazy? You can take your time
and exchange the coins.

64
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,689
This is a gamble, after all.

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,060
I'll go all in. I bet on Odd.

66
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,129
You bet ten coins on Odd.

67
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,199
- Is that correct?
- Let's go. Yes.

68
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,400
The game will now start.

69
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,939
We went through a lot
to get the ten coins, but how could he...

70
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,210
I knew the moment he caught the chicken.
I realized...

71
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,409
that he was a total nutcase.

72
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,949
I placed a bet hoping for a jackpot.

73
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:35,090
This is scary.

74
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,060
- The numbers of the dice are 4 and 4.
- Oh, no.

75
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,360
You have lost the bet.

76
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
It's Even.

77
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,930
- You're not allowed to gamble now.
- You've lost the coins bet.

78
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,639
I thought to myself,

79
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,240
"I'm glad that we purchased things first."

80
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,139
I kept trying to rationalize my actions.

81
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,280
Gosh, this is so harsh.

82
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,050
Player Hong Jin Ho bets
three coins on Even.

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,759
- We should just get this over with.
- Let's do that.

84
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,699
The numbers of the dice are 6 and 4.

85
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,339
You have won the bet.

86
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,370
You get six coins.

87
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,310
Player Hong Jin Ho bets
five coins on Even.

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,379
Yes.

89
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,750
Let's go. Don't give up.

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,220
- What's important is invincible spirits.
- What's important is invincible spirits.

91
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,259
The numbers of the dice are 6 and 6.

92
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,199
Yes.

93
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
You have won the bet.

94
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,529
Based on the dividend rate,
you get ten coins.

95
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,970
You're on a roll.

96
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,009
I thought I got the hang of it
sooner than I expected.

97
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,639
So I decided to gamble.

98
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,480
- That's it. Let's go.
- Let's go.

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,649
Player Hong Jin Ho bets ten coins on Even.

100
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,589
Let's go. It's time.

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,490
(What's the result of his bet on Even?)

102
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,529
Yes.

103
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,569
You have won the bet.

104
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,810
It's the multiplication rule.

105
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,810
I kept doubling my bet.

106
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,839
If I bet 5 coins and win, I bet 10 coins.
And it becomes 20 coins.

107
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,879
That was my strategy for the game.

108
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,480
- The ace is different.
- He's different.

109
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,019
(Hong Jin Ho bets on Even again.)

110
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,160
Let's go!

111
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,189
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

112
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,860
Player Hong Jin Ho bets 20 coins on Even.

113
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,029
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

114
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,540
(Hong Jin Ho bet 20 coins on Even.)

115
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,250
(What's the result?)

116
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,879
My gosh.

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,250
Oh, dear.

118
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,889
- Nice.
- The numbers of the dice are 2 and 6.

119
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,500
Player Hong Jin Ho has won the bet.

120
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,100
My goodness.

121
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,670
Here are 40 coins.

122
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,610
I guess it was the momentum.

123
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,410
I tried to read my own patterns...

124
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,610
and find the right timing
to make things big.

125
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,910
I was waiting for the right time.

126
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,149
And when the time came, I bet on Even.

127
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,290
When it comes to poker,

128
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,089
Hong Jin Ho has no rival.

129
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,959
It doesn't matter
if it's about luck or not.

130
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,189
Jin Ho has his own plans.

131
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,259
Nice.

132
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,430
I think we should make off now.

133
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,699
I want to give it a shot as well.

134
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,170
Just give me ten coins.

135
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:12,670
Thank you.

136
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,139
Dex seemed depressed.

137
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,480
I wanted to give him another chance
so he'd learn what it feels like to win.

138
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,839
I gave him ten coins.

139
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,480
Let me try.

140
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Player Dex bets ten coins.

141
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,019
But he bet all ten coins again right away.

142
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,259
I don't think I made the wrong choice.

143
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,959
I did the math and made my bet
based on probability.

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,769
(Dex bets 10 coins on Even.)

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,639
I bet it's even.

146
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,980
- Darn it.
- The numbers of the dice are 5 and 6.

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,980
This is so upsetting. I'm so furious.

148
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,949
I got all worked up.

149
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,879
I was there to play a game,

150
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,120
but I just kept losing money.

151
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,160
Am I supposed to do only manual labor?

152
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,120
You have no gift for gambling.

153
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,060
- You're terrible at it.
- Seriously.

154
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,529
You're not allowed to go
to Las Vegas and Gangwon Province.

155
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,629
Why am I so bad at gambling?

156
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,339
I'm terrible at it.

157
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,439
- What?
- It's here.

158
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,610
Something's here.

159
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,250
- Seriously, this is...
- This is it.

160
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,620
I guess we got something.

161
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,590
Is it meat?

162
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,190
This is crazy. The meat is different
from what we had yesterday.

163
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,259
- Did we get a good one?
- Really?

164
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,590
It's good.

165
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,259
- Let's cook it right away.
- Wait. We should turn up the fire.

166
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,929
Let's make it big.

167
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,269
This is an important moment.

168
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,039
Are we cooking the beef here?

169
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,669
Yes. On the tray.

170
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,009
We can use this.

171
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,269
(They found a frying pan substitute
earlier that day.)

172
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,710
This can be a frying pan.

173
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,710
Place the meat now.

174
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,720
- It sounds great.
- My gosh.

175
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,190
I can't believe I'm hearing
the sizzling sound here.

176
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,659
Yesterday, I think we were a little...

177
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,330
We ate like barbarians.

178
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,529
(They cooked beef
in a wild way on the previous night.)

179
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,539
(They chewed on the meat just to survive.)

180
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,950
(But today, they are cooking beef
in a way where the juices are retained.)

181
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,580
Try this. These two pieces.

182
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,720
- Okay.
- Why? What is it?

183
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,320
They are from one piece,
so they must be juicy.

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,419
I think it's well-cooked.

185
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,990
- Is it?
- Yes, it's done.

186
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:49,529
Try it.

187
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,860
- The edge?
- Yes, from the edge.

188
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,570
Not that one. Try this one instead.

189
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,279
This is really...
Even if I eat expensive beef...

190
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,809
at a fancy restaurant
when I go back to Korea,

191
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,950
it won't taste as good as this.

192
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,059
It was darn good.

193
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,269
Today's meat...

194
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,809
- is so juicy.
- I know.

195
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,679
- Seriously.
- This is different.

196
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,679
This is happiness.

197
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,149
It was as good
as a Michelin-starred restaurant food.

198
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,419
When we cooked on a skewer,
the juice came out of it a lot.

199
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,059
So I just ate it to survive.

200
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,960
But today, we had the sliced ones.

201
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,500
(Gulping)

202
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,159
We had a steak...

203
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,600
that was perfectly pan-seared.

204
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,279
Those who didn't try it
would never know what it was like.

205
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,539
Thank you for the food.

206
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,129
It tastes even better
because of what we had yesterday.

207
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:34,830
- Right.
- I agree.

208
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,440
This tastes like real beef.

209
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,500
I know.

210
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,269
I can eat this every day.

211
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,279
- Right?
- Yes.

212
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,409
We were like strangers until yesterday.

213
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,179
Right.

214
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,220
But we built up a strong bond
with the meat.

215
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,450
This is the power of meat.

216
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,690
I really liked the food.

217
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,019
I liked it too.

218
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,059
(2. Dex's challenge goes on.)

219
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,529
- So this is the place.
- Yes.

220
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,659
- Hello. What is this place?
- What? Is this a lottery?

221
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,100
- It's a lottery.
- I think we should guess numbers.

222
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,529
It's a game of chance again.

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,269
- Hello.
- Let's do this.

224
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,370
Hello.

225
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,269
- First off...
- Would you exchange ingredients...

226
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,610
- with coins?
- Yes.

227
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,710
Let's weigh one
and see how much it weighs.

228
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,279
(Papayas they picked from trees)

229
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,610
It's not over 1kg.

230
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,679
It's a little less than 1kg.

231
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,950
I bet they are way over 1kg.

232
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,350
- It's done.
- Done. Let's get ten.

233
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,820
- Let's get ten each then.
- Okay.

234
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,419
- It makes 1kg.
- That's perfect.

235
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,590
- It's done. It's ten.
- This is enough.

236
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,990
- I bet it will make 1kg.
- It's done.

237
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,259
All right then.

238
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,590
(They have a total of 82 coins.)

239
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,929
- One each?
- Yes.

240
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,399
We want...

241
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,669
to buy one frying pan.

242
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,870
Two tents.

243
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,740
And lastly, we will buy five blankets.

244
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,399
Do we not need any food?

245
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,769
We don't have money to buy food.

246
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,879
We don't have money for food.

247
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,379
- We have to make some money.
- Yes.

248
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,580
Player Shin Hyun Ji.

249
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,250
Will you participate in today's game?

250
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,279
Yes.

251
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,720
Today's game is Speed Kino.

252
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,419
Speed Kino is a game...

253
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,259
where you pick 5 numbers from 1 to 22.

254
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,090
And you receive dividends
based on the numbers...

255
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,389
that match the ten lottery numbers.

256
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,629
If 1 or 2 numbers match,

257
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:12,730
you lose your bet.

258
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,100
All coins used to bet will be gone.

259
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,799
If three numbers match,

260
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,940
you get your coins back.

261
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,909
- If four numbers match,
- It's too hard.

262
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,870
you get three times the coins used to bet.

263
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,539
If all five numbers match,

264
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,980
you get ten times the coins used to bet.

265
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,649
- It's either 3 times or 10 times.
- If all numbers don't match,

266
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,750
you get your coins back.

267
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,990
So 1 or 2 matching numbers
are the worst case.

268
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,289
Even those who are bad
at gambling can play this game.

269
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,330
- Right.
- It's okay.

270
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,929
Pick five numbers and turn them in...

271
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,899
with the coins you want to bet.

272
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:47,929
Okay.

273
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,629
How much should I bet?

274
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,500
It doesn't have to be a lot.

275
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,840
You need to feel things out first.

276
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,279
- This is a game of chance.
- It's like a lottery.

277
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,480
I'm not good at lotteries.

278
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,080
(Shin Hyun Ji bets 2 coins.)

279
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,049
Player Shin Hyun Ji bets two coins...

280
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,919
on numbers 2, 7, 12, 17, and 22.

281
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,820
- She bets two coins.
- I picked the numbers in a row.

282
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,259
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

283
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,360
It's like the answer sheet
of a school exam.

284
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,629
- Right.
- This works.

285
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,029
When you're not sure,
choose numbers in a row.

286
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,299
- Right.
- All right then.

287
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,970
The draw will now start.

288
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,269
Were you a special ed student?

289
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,840
- What?
- Gosh.

290
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,269
Is it 30?

291
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,509
- No.
- The first number.

292
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,570
- Is it 22?
- The number...

293
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,480
- I got it right.
- is 22.

294
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:34,179
(Shin Hyun Ji got 22 right.)

295
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,980
How should I check the numbers?
Circle them?

296
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,250
- Just circle them.
- Like grading a paper?

297
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,919
But 1 or 2 matching numbers are bad.

298
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,120
You should get all the numbers right.

299
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,919
I'm nervous.

300
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,690
The 2nd number is 20.

301
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,320
But there will be ten numbers.

302
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,230
This is worth a shot.

303
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,889
This is thrilling. I'm feeling
the rush of adrenaline.

304
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,730
- What is it? Is it 10?
- The 3rd number...

305
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,730
is six.

306
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,399
- Darn it.
- That's so close.

307
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,399
- It's okay.
- This is fun.

308
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,210
My gosh.

309
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,710
The next number is 16.

310
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,279
I got 17. It's wrong.

311
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,309
The fifth number...

312
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,350
is eight.

313
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,049
You're doomed.

314
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,220
We got 6 and 8...

315
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,549
- when she picked seven?
- We're doomed.

316
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,250
It was going well earlier.

317
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,460
This is a random game.
We have two more numbers left.

318
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,259
The 6th number is 4.

319
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,059
This is driving me crazy. Next, please.

320
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,559
The next number...

321
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,259
is 14.

322
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,600
This isn't working.

323
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,070
- The rest of the numbers...
- We have three more to go.

324
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,169
I should get two more numbers right.

325
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,940
If you get two more right,
you just get your coins back.

326
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,269
If three numbers match,
you get your coin back.

327
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,639
It's 12.

328
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,340
- It's done.
- I have one more to go.

329
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,179
- The next number is 12.
- Yes.

330
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,009
- One more to go.
- One more, and I get my coins back.

331
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,549
- How many coins did you bet?
- Two.

332
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,750
- Two.
- Two? Okay.

333
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,120
It's not bad.

334
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,220
- What?
- Is it ten?

335
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,389
It's 11.

336
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,090
Please make sure to draw number two.

337
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,629
You can do this.

338
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,029
Let's go.

339
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,159
- What is it?
- Two balls came out.

340
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,230
The last number...

341
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,169
- is 21.
- Darn it.

342
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,269
- I'm losing my coins, right?
- You lost them.

343
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,039
Player Shin Hyun Ji has lost the bet.

344
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,210
All coins used to bet are gone.

345
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,509
- Dex, you give it a shot.
- This is fun.

346
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,549
- We might hit the jackpot today.
- I'll exchange this for ten coins.

347
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,779
This is fun.

348
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,620
I picked the numbers
that are in the middle.

349
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,980
That's scientific.

350
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,159
- Nine.
- They are mixed a lot.

351
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,220
The first number...

352
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,990
- is 20.
- Is it 20? Okay.

353
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,360
- Did you get it right?
- One.

354
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,960
- It's 11.
- You got it.

355
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,730
- Okay.
- You have momentum now.

356
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,059
You'll probably get one more.

357
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,330
- We still have many numbers left.
- Right.

358
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,929
Number one.

359
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,000
Number 17.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,070
- Number 16.
- Gosh, I chose number 12.

361
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,669
Number 14.

362
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,470
- Is it 14?
- The 9th number.

363
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,340
We have two more to go.
We have to get one more number right...

364
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,210
- to get the coins back.
- Right, that'll break even.

365
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,679
This isn't easy.

366
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,379
I'll announce the last number.

367
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,450
It's...

368
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,019
- number 21.
- Gosh.

369
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,789
- Oh, no.
- It's a dud.

370
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,059
We lost the coins again?

371
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,220
(Disappointed)

372
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,960
Would you like to try it?
Do you want me to go first?

373
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,559
Do you want to go first?

374
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,259
As soon as I saw it,
I figured it was a lottery.

375
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,869
I should feel it out and be careful.

376
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,230
I gave it a shot.

377
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,269
I think this is a blessing
from my ancestors.

378
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,170
- Your ancestors?
- I'm just following my hand.

379
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,339
Number 14.

380
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,869
Darn it.

381
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,210
Does this stochastically make sense?

382
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,710
Number two.

383
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,509
Gosh, is it number ten?

384
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,019
We all lost.

385
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,019
(The hidden players lost
one after another.)

386
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,079
It's not working.

387
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,920
- It's over.
- It's over.

388
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,319
I bet three coins,

389
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,720
but I got only two numbers right.

390
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,690
Actually, you can't...

391
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,730
win a gamble every time.

392
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,930
It's not like I'm a deity.

393
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,730
If I calculated the probability
and got all five numbers right,

394
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,170
I would also win
the first prize in the lottery.

395
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,670
It was a game of chance.

396
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,839
Dex, do you want to give it a shot?

397
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,009
I'm out.

398
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,769
Hyun Ji, let's bet seven coins
on these numbers.

399
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,579
- Shall we?
- Yes. This game takes a long time,

400
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:53,680
- so it's hard.
- Okay.

401
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,650
Two, four, six, and eight.

402
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,920
I want to see Dex win.

403
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,579
- I know.
- Me too. I also want to see myself win.

404
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,619
Dex has never won his bet...

405
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,420
at Phantom Casino before.

406
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:05,819
He kept losing.

407
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,759
To be honest, I can't say I'm confident.

408
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm not sure if I can win,

409
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,769
but I always dream
of making a fortune in one stroke.

410
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:17,329
Considering the flow of the game,
I felt like he would lose.

411
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,200
But this is why people are
addicted to gambling.

412
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,539
"I just need to win once. Just this once."

413
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:26,009
At the last minute, Dex and Hyun Ji...

414
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,150
bet a big amount.

415
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:29,910
It was a whopping eight coins.

416
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,079
It's 8L of water.

417
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,920
- I'm so desperate.
- You're desperate.

418
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,250
I want to win.

419
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,890
Trust your instincts.

420
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,490
Dex has been analyzing
the patterns scientifically.

421
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,259
- Really?
- He picked the numbers...

422
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,890
in the middle.

423
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,799
- That was meaningless, though.
- Right.

424
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,029
I'll just...

425
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,970
Player Dex bet eight coins...

426
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,839
on numbers 4, 8, 11, 12, and 18.

427
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,109
- Are they the numbers...
- He bet...

428
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,170
that came out a lot?

429
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,910
eight coins.

430
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,009
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

431
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,410
Let's do this.

432
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,480
The draw will now start.

433
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:03,880
Let's go.

434
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:06,950
The first number...

435
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,490
is 14.

436
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,849
I wish it didn't have
number one in the front.

437
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,519
This is just the beginning.

438
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,259
The second number.

439
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,970
- It's number four.
- Gosh.

440
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,069
Good.

441
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,799
- Stay calm.
- Okay.

442
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,769
- Don't behave rashly.
- Right.

443
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,539
Let's go.

444
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,980
- The next number...
- Five.

445
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,079
is 12.

446
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,779
Good. I have a good feeling.

447
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,880
- That's it.
- He got 2 out of 3.

448
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,250
Stay calm.

449
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,450
He got two numbers in a row.

450
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:44,690
It never happened.

451
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,890
The fourth number...

452
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,789
is 17.

453
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,960
- Gosh, I picked 18. That was close.
- So close.

454
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,829
The next number...

455
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,329
is six.

456
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,400
Eight.

457
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,740
Wasn't it eight?

458
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,109
- She can't wait.
- The next number is eight.

459
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,579
- It's done. Okay.
- Nice.

460
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
There's no way back now.

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,109
- There's no way back.
- You have to get all the numbers right.

462
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,180
Match them all.

463
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,579
- The seventh number.
- Eighteen!

464
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,279
- It's...
- Isn't it 18?

465
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,549
- number 16.
- I thought it was 18.

466
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,390
My goodness.

467
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,220
The next number is one.

468
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,859
Two more to go?

469
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,160
We just need one more.

470
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,759
Let's make it a triple.

471
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,960
The next number...

472
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,730
is seven.

473
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,230
It always comes out.

474
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,640
- Why is number seven being so tactless?
- Seven...

475
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,069
I'll draw the last number.

476
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,609
(If 4 numbers match,
they get 3 times the coins used to bet.)

477
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Get on it.

478
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,450
Get on it.

479
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,579
I'm glad that we didn't lose.

480
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,720
- What?
- Number 11.

481
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,089
Three times.

482
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,920
- So we earned coins, right?
- Well done.

483
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,460
- Nice.
- Nice.

484
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,160
- Trust your instincts.
- Well done.

485
00:20:58,329 --> 00:20:59,400
Good job.

486
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,400
After coming to the Survival Zone,

487
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,970
I had never made money at the casino.

488
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,140
It was my first time making
this much money.

489
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,410
So I was surprised.

490
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:11,039
Jackpot.
He had the winning number like magic.

491
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,410
When he made money with the last number,

492
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,150
I forgot about how we lost money before.

493
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,220
Besides, we didn't lose money.
We earned more money with that.

494
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,190
This was a personal win for Dex.
And the fact that he managed...

495
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:23,650
to win money with a new game...

496
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,259
brought us a lot of benefits in many ways.

497
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,490
Let's buy things right away.

498
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,660
- Let's buy what we need.
- Let's buy them and go.

499
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,400
We have food
and four bottles of water here.

500
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,630
Okay. First of all, we need 1kg of pork.

501
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,099
We need 5L of water.

502
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,240
We'll order one more bottle of water.

503
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,940
Give us a toothbrush and toothpaste.

504
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,380
- Three cigarettes. One each.
- Okay.

505
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,579
Hyun Ji, have a can of Coke.

506
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,180
- A can of Coke.
- Yes, drink Coke.

507
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,250
We'll buy a camping chair.

508
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,950
- That's ten coins.
- We're a big family now.

509
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,019
Yes. That's it.

510
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,049
- Is that it?
- Yes.

511
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,619
- We'll wrap up here.
- Yes.

512
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,529
- We had fun.
- We had a good day today.

513
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,160
You won money in the last round.
So we didn't lose money.

514
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,230
- That's a relief.
- We didn't lose money.

515
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,859
- We bought a lot of things today.
- We spent all the coins today. Right?

516
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,869
- But we have food now.
- Yes.

517
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,099
- I just spent them all.
- Yes.

518
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,369
- There's no point in having a few coins.
- Yes. There's no point.

519
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,500
- We can bring more food here tomorrow.
- Let's get a lot of food tomorrow.

520
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,970
We can pick the fruit off the tree.

521
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,380
We made money by the sweat of our brows.

522
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,809
Trying to win money through gambling
instead of working hard...

523
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,880
is wrong.

524
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,779
By the way, we keep sweating, though.

525
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,779
(Chuckling)

526
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,789
- Even when we stay still, we're sweaty.
- To be honest,

527
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,319
my clothes are always wet from sweat.

528
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,460
Since we got pork, should we start a fire?

529
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:41,670
Show us. The savior of fire.

530
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,900
- This is the only thing I did today.
- It's growing.

531
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,009
All right. I can see it getting big.

532
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,269
It's really coming back.

533
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
I got it.

534
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,309
You did it.

535
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,349
When we bought them...

536
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:57,710
Hey, our stuff must be here.

537
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,150
It's here. I need someone
to help me carry this.

538
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,650
- Sure.
- What is it?

539
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,490
There must be a lot.
It must be the blankets.

540
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,660
Did they deliver everything at once?

541
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,890
- There's no handle.
- Okay.

542
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,130
Two tents. Three blankets.

543
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,200
- They gave us pork right away. Right?
- Yes.

544
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,369
That must be the pork belly!

545
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,670
- I guess.
- Awesome.

546
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,940
It's been a while since I had pork belly.

547
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,240
We got the fire going just now. Perfect.

548
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,140
Great. This is perfect.

549
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,380
This is crazy.

550
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,240
The coating on the frying pan is tight.

551
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,279
This is awesome.

552
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,910
Wait. What's this?
Is this frozen pork belly?

553
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,049
- I love frozen pork belly.
- Frozen pork belly in Bali.

554
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,349
Let's put about eight pieces in the pan.
Let's keep putting in meat.

555
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,690
- Sure.
- Yes.

556
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:42,859
(Golden brown)

557
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,930
Thank you for the food.

558
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,400
It's so hot.
How did you put it in your mouth?

559
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,700
Having food in that situation...

560
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,839
It's making me salivate all of a sudden.

561
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:58,309
Everything would have tasted good then.

562
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,549
It's hot.

563
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,920
Can I really sit here?

564
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,380
- Yes. You should sit.
- Thank you.

565
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,589
People who move around a lot
should sit here.

566
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,390
We could grill and crispen the pork.

567
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,460
After that,

568
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,130
we had built a suite in the camping area.

569
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,269
When we saw the food, it felt great.

570
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,400
A bite of the food tasted so divine.

571
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,170
It was a good choice to buy pork today.

572
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,970
Hey, the firepower is at its peak now.

573
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,640
I feel so happy.

574
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,220
Try this, Hyun Ji.

575
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,549
- Really?
- Yes.

576
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,650
- There's no space.
- Shake off the oil a bit.

577
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,160
Next. The second-best piece.

578
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,259
Take it.

579
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:50,789
All right. Let's see.

580
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,099
Let's eat it up again.

581
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,930
(Dex, the master chef,
shares the frozen pork belly.)

582
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,130
I told them we should order pork.

583
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,200
And everyone enjoyed it.
So it felt rewarding.

584
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,740
Actually, I didn't like meat before.

585
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,140
But having the meat here...

586
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,450
was equivalent
to Peter Luger Steak House in New York.

587
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,880
Nothing could hold a candle
to what we had today.

588
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,019
It was that tasty. It tasted divine.

589
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,819
Anyway, it was really good.

590
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,119
The food was great.

591
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,559
Just thinking about it now
makes me salivate.

592
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,430
The pork I had...

593
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,259
won't be forgettable. I really enjoyed it.

594
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,769
(Outdoor Team gets kicked out
of the mansion and goes to the casino.)

595
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:31,869
Over there.

596
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,140
- This is the place.
- I see the dealer.

597
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,109
It's a real casino.

598
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

599
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,539
- Welcome to Phantom Casino.
- Hello.

600
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,579
This is the place.

601
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,619
We can spend money here.

602
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,650
How can we get the coins?

603
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,089
Remember the food we got earlier?
We can either use that...

604
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,960
or find food from the wild.

605
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,660
Other than water,
we can bring food here...

606
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,500
to exchange it for coins.

607
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,170
Should we go and check now?
But it's pretty far.

608
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,940
- Let's bring everything in a box at once.
- Okay.

609
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,170
Let's bring the box.

610
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,170
Let's go and catch a bat.

611
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,769
I hope we can find a huge coconut.

612
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,509
(It's hard to see as it's dark.)

613
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,349
- Did you find anything?
- No.

614
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,089
Gosh. They threw out
leftover food like this?

615
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,819
I found the potatoes they threw out.

616
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,660
Here.

617
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,029
Good job, Mina.

618
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,660
- Let's take it. Yes.
- The inside of the potato is weird.

619
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,730
- This one.
- Boiled eggs.

620
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:37,670
We were going to gather the food
they threw out...

621
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:42,039
and use that to our advantage
at Phantom Casino.

622
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,069
- We got a lot of food.
- Yes, we did.

623
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,279
- How much do you think it will weigh?
- At least over 1kg.

624
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,440
- Really?
- It's over 1kg.

625
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:48,809
I thought it was a mouse.

626
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,410
(They come back with a box full of food.)

627
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,480
Hello.

628
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,380
KNUCKS. Weigh the coconut first.

629
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,650
- Okay.
- What's the weight?

630
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:56,990
That's 200g.

631
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,059
Let's get two coins with this.

632
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,789
The food weighs 210g.

633
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,759
I will give you two coins for the food.

634
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,759
- Nice.
- We brought that.

635
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,369
- This is really heavy.
- How much does it weigh?

636
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,630
- It's 500g.
- Gosh. Awesome.

637
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,700
Put more food then.

638
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,440
- What's the weight?
- Hold on. It's 800g.

639
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,769
- It's 800g? Precisely?
- Yes.

640
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,410
We were able to gather some coins
after picking up some food.

641
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,750
I thought that
we'd be able to buy some stuff.

642
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,480
Shouldn't you be taking the lead now,
Sung Joo?

643
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,579
- Try it.
- Go ahead.

644
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,390
- Let's use one coin to test it out.
- Let's do it.

645
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,819
We'll play the game with one coin.

646
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:32,190
The game is called Real Time.

647
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,730
The goal of Real Time is to stop the timer
exactly after ten seconds.

648
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,259
The closer you get to ten seconds,

649
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,259
the more money you'll earn.

650
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,799
To participate in the game,
you must choose 1 of the 2 methods.

651
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,640
Based on the chosen methods,
the dividend rate will change.

652
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,410
I either look at the timer...

653
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,640
- or don't look at it. Right?
- Right.

654
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
I'll do it while looking at the timer.

655
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,809
All right. Player Hyun Sung Joo,
you bet one coin...

656
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:56,710
- and chose to look at the timer.
- Yes.

657
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,980
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

658
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,819
The timer will start
when you press the button in front of you.

659
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:06,390
(He's nervous about trying it
for the first time.)

660
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,069
It went 0.07 seconds more.

661
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,279
- It went 0.07 seconds more.
- That was close.

662
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,440
We got this close on our first try,

663
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,579
- so this is doable.
- It's not bad.

664
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:29,880
- Right. It's not bad.
- Yes.

665
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
You stopped the timer at 10.07 seconds.

666
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,019
Therefore, you failed to win any coins.

667
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,990
You will lose the coin you bet.

668
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,190
- We have to stop it before 10.05 seconds.
- Does anyone want to try it?

669
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,220
- I want to try it.
- Will you go?

670
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,900
Pi, you bet one coin
and chose to look at the timer.

671
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,930
- Good luck.
- I'll start.

672
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,210
- Gosh. I was too late. Darn it.
- That was close.

673
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,309
Player Pi, you failed to win any coins.

674
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,450
You will lose the coin you bet.

675
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,950
- I think I know how to play this.
- Let me tell you the result.

676
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,789
It wasn't based on pure luck.

677
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,890
I was able to win coins
as long as I stayed focused.

678
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,190
So I was confident.

679
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,160
- We should try a bit more times.
- I'll keep going.

680
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,809
Now.

681
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,539
(She wins coins only after two times.)

682
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,180
Let's keep going.

683
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,109
I thought
we might have a shot at this game.

684
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,450
At that moment, Pi looked very reliable.

685
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,750
Pi found patterns.

686
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,519
She knew that she had to let it reach...

687
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,990
nine seconds, and then press the button
after counting to four.

688
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,420
She found the pattern quickly.

689
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,359
I saw that she was good
at games like this.

690
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,359
You successfully won the bet.

691
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,829
I will give you two coins.

692
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,329
You bet one coin.

693
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,809
Okay.

694
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,279
You successfully won the bet.

695
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,309
- I will give you four coins.
- Nice.

696
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,809
You bet two coins.

697
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,450
You successfully won the bet.

698
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,119
- I will give you four coins.
- Okay.

699
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,049
"It's do or die."

700
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:18,720
Why? Because I was confident in this game.

701
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,259
She's going all-in here. That's dangerous.

702
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,829
(Did she succeed again?)

703
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,079
(Screaming)

704
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,640
You did it.

705
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:44,650
I didn't know she could do it.

706
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,680
I thought she was getting carried away.

707
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,150
But she did it.

708
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,750
So everyone screamed.

709
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,920
I was really relieved that she did it.

710
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,559
It didn't look easy.

711
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,660
But she suddenly did it.

712
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,359
It was amazing. And getting more money...

713
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,000
made me happy too.

714
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,700
You stopped the timer...

715
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,269
- exactly at ten seconds.
- That was crazy.

716
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:08,940
- You killed it.
- You successfully won the bet.

717
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,009
- Amazing.
- "I did it."

718
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,940
"I finally did it."

719
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,579
That's how it felt.

720
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,940
What should we do?

721
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,609
Do we need toothbrushes, toothpaste,
and soap for tomorrow?

722
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,250
- Toothbrushes and toothpaste?
- Yes.

723
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,579
We will need soap.

724
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,289
Don't you want six of that?

725
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,450
- The mattresses?
- Yes.

726
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,990
- We can sleep comfortably. It'll be fun.
- I don't need it.

727
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,390
- Let me try it with this.
- I don't need it either.

728
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,990
- Sure. Go ahead.
- You don't need mattresses?

729
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,700
- I'll try it.
- Player Pi.

730
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,660
When did she start?

731
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,900
She's an addict now.

732
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,640
"This is why gambling is scary."

733
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,200
"This is how you
ruin yourself and your family."

734
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:44,269
Once you're hooked like that,
even the Almighty can't stop you.

735
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,579
I just thought, "Do whatever you want."

736
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,609
So I didn't give it much thought.

737
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,009
- It's okay.
- Good.

738
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,279
- You didn't lose money.
- You didn't lose money.

739
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,119
She doesn't need a tent.
She just needs the casino.

740
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,450
- I will tell you the result.
- She won't go to sleep.

741
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,920
Based on the dividend rate,

742
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,319
I will give you one coin.

743
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,319
(Laughing)

744
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,490
- She's starting right away.
- Will you bet one coin?

745
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:04,730
- The timer will begin when you press it.
- Seriously.

746
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,829
She was feeling too confident.

747
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,799
So she kept using the coins
as if she was possessed or something.

748
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,470
As I was watching her, I thought,
"This is why gambling is dangerous."

749
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,509
This is why going to casinos
can be dangerous.

750
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,910
I wanted to share this with everyone.

751
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,279
Okay. Stop?

752
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,279
- Okay. I'll stop.
- Okay.

753
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,380
We'll need 5L of water...

754
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,250
just to wash up, not to drink it.

755
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,349
They'll give us drinking water
once a day...

756
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,289
- like they did today.
- Everyone will get 1L of water each.

757
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:32,319
- We need 12 coins for 6L of water.
- We need to brush our teeth and wash up.

758
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,960
We should buy one bottle each.

759
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,259
As Pandora's box is open,

760
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,589
you must double the prices
you see on the menu...

761
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,829
- to buy the items.
- Here too?

762
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:41,859
(Shocked)

763
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,769
You shouldn't have opened it.

764
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,099
- No?
- You should have just used it.

765
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,410
(KNUCKS opened Pandora's box
at the mansion.)

766
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,210
- No way.
- That's awful.

767
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,680
- You made it worse for everyone.
- So the prices are doubled?

768
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,809
- What is it?
- I'm awful?

769
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,079
- You made our life harder.
- Hey.

770
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,819
I'll start trolling now.

771
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:05,690
I didn't think that Pandora's box
wouldn't affect the Survival Zone.

772
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,119
But when I heard the prices were doubled,

773
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,900
I thought to myself that
I was trolling even to the end.

774
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,759
"Oh, Father."

775
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,569
That crossed my mind.

776
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,170
Aren't we getting 1L of water each?

777
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,500
- We're getting 1L each. So it's 12 coins.
- Is it 2L?

778
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,369
- We need 12 coins?
- Let's spend the coins.

779
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:24,269
You spent 12 coins to buy 6L of water.

780
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,039
We will deliver the water...

781
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,980
- as soon as it's ready.
- We should keep the coins for now.

782
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,049
- Okay. Keep them.
- Yes.

783
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:31,279
- Hey. Can you...
- Yes.

784
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,920
- hold on to them?
- Me?

785
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,980
The coins?

786
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,279
- I'll hold on to them.
- Okay.

787
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,119
You can't gamble them away.

788
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,190
I won't.

789
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,220
What if I end up gambling them away
after saying that?

790
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,259
Hurry up and count them.

791
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,359
- It's open.
- It's open.

792
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,599
- Let's go.
- It's open.

793
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,630
- I knew it.
- I see her.

794
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

795
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,930
We brought our seed money.

796
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,839
Hello. Welcome to Phantom Casino.

797
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,509
Put the food on top of the plate.

798
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,940
- It's over 1kg, right?
- We're pretty good now.

799
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,450
I only peeled the skin. I didn't open it.

800
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,779
- We have more.
- We can just do this.

801
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,049
- This is incredible.
- We did it.

802
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,119
All of them weigh over 1kg each.

803
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,219
Which player will participate?

804
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,059
- You can go first.
- Sure.

805
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,389
I will.

806
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,030
Today's game is Tai Sai.

807
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,329
In Tai Sai, you first predict the numbers
on two dice or the combination of them.

808
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,030
Then based on the result of the numbers,
you will take the dividend.

809
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,139
"I will need a lot of luck."

810
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:31,010
When you're supposed to guess
between odd or even, there's a board.

811
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,880
It shows how many times
even or odd numbers came out.

812
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,849
You take the board into account
when you make guesses.

813
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,079
But there wasn't a board here.

814
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,250
I thought that I could only win
if luck was on my side.

815
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,320
(She bets 2 coins on Odd.)

816
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,719
Why did we lose today?

817
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,889
(The last round of Number Change)

818
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,730
(They were going to either play
3 and 4 or 4 and 7.)

819
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,559
(They lost after playing 4 and 7.)

820
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,000
Three and four. Okay.

821
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,599
Should we go with 3 and 4?

822
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:59,239
I'll go with 3 and 4.

823
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:02,769
I will place a bet here.

824
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,440
Then we will begin the game.

825
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,119
(What's the result of her first bet?)

826
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,650
The numbers on the dice are 3 and 5.

827
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:20,420
What were the numbers?

828
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,659
Your Single Die bet failed.

829
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,329
And your Pair Dice bet failed.

830
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,699
Your odd-even bet failed.

831
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,800
You will lose all the coins you bet.

832
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,639
Cut your hand off and never come back.

833
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,440
Come on.

834
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,070
- It was my first round. Don't say that.
- Will you keep playing?

835
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,510
The thing is,

836
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,210
when she goes to the casino,

837
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,880
her eyes gleam.

838
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,280
They start to shine.

839
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,820
A lot of people lose all of their money
when they get hooked on gambling.

840
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:49,619
(Humming)

841
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:51,590
Probability-wise, that's a good move.

842
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,820
You think so?
I don't think it's good probability-wise.

843
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,260
(Pondering)

844
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,099
It's better to bet on Odd and Even
instead of other numbers.

845
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,699
You bet five coins on Odd and Even.

846
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,699
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

847
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,070
The game will begin now.

848
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,409
You got this.

849
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,150
The numbers on the dice are 2 and 6.

850
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,389
Your Odd and Even bet failed.

851
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:28,820
You will lose all the coins you bet.

852
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,989
(She lost 9 coins
in a short amount of time.)

853
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:31,090
Let me try it.

854
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,329
(Jin Hyeong tries it
as he can't bear watching her lose.)

855
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:36,030
It's all about probability.

856
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:44,840
(Jin Hyeong plays every game
based on probability.)

857
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,340
I can't do anything here.

858
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,409
I usually look at the board to play this.

859
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,619
(Chuckling)

860
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:59,860
I see. This is how you play.
Oh, no. It'll fall.

861
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,860
You really shouldn't gamble in real life.

862
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,860
You bet a coin on Double Five
for your Single Die bet.

863
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,369
You bet a coin on 1 and 6
and 2 and 3 each...

864
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,300
for your Pair Dice bet.

865
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,699
You bet one coin on Odd.

866
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,809
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

867
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,639
The game will begin.

868
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,380
Shake it for a long time.

869
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,550
Please.

870
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,079
Oh, I thought we had it.

871
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,619
That's an odd number.

872
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,690
The numbers on the dice are 4 and 5.

873
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,690
(She's playing Alkkagi.)

874
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,800
- Okay.
- This one.

875
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,670
I think it will work.

876
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,099
It's 2 and 6.

877
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,170
It's 2 and 6?

878
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,280
(Concerned)

879
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,010
Let's toss the coin and decide.

880
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,809
Toss it and check for heads or tails.

881
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,050
You didn't decide which sides
will be heads or tails.

882
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,590
We tried that earlier,
and the result wasn't good.

883
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,719
- Really?
- Stop.

884
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,400
(Lady Luck wasn't on their side today.)

885
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,429
Or how about we only bet
on odd or even numbers?

886
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:16,900
We can do that.

887
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,269
You should try it too.

888
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,869
Yes. It's not a bad idea...

889
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:22,369
- to check your luck today before we go.
- My luck today?

890
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,010
Can I bet a lot of coins then?

891
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,710
- A lot?
- Can I?

892
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,309
How many coins?

893
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,050
- Give me a big one.
- What?

894
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,849
You trust me, right?

895
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:31,880
Okay.

896
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,820
You know that life is full of odd numbers.
Right?

897
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,090
Player Ha Seung Jin,
for your Odd and Even bet,

898
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,559
you placed ten coins
in the odd-number section.

899
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,730
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

900
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,730
The game will begin.

901
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Please.

902
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,329
Please.

903
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,780
(They will win 10 coins
if it's an odd number.)

904
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,050
(His bet was successful.)

905
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,079
- Nice.
- Nice.

906
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,119
- Okay.
- I will tell you the result.

907
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,619
- Nice.
- The numbers are 1 and 4.

908
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:13,760
Player Ha Seung Jin,

909
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,730
your Odd and Even bet was successful.

910
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,630
Based on the dividend rate,

911
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,800
- I will give you 20 coins.
- Gosh.

912
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:21,429
Nice.

913
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:22,769
You won't have to go.

914
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,230
- It will.
- Trust your guts.

915
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,070
- Okay.
- Let's go.

916
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:28,340
(She bets 30 coins
with the gained momentum.)

917
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,769
- Will you place a bet?
- Yes.

918
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,170
The game will begin now.

919
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,210
- I won't look.
- That's a lot of coins.

920
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,980
- You need to hit the jackpot once.
- I won't look.

921
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,409
In life, you only need one jackpot.

922
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:36,980
In life, you only need one jackpot.

923
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,119
- Please.
- Oh, my.

924
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,750
- In life, you only need one jackpot.
- I can't watch this.

925
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,719
(Pi's bet was successful.)

926
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,989
- Okay.
- Great job.

927
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,630
- You did it.
- Good job.

928
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,889
I did it!

929
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:51,960
Player Pi.

930
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,659
- Your Odd and Even bet was successful.
- It sounds different.

931
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,170
It's so easy to make money.

932
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,369
If we bet 100 coins and win,

933
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:00,739
we'll have 200 coins.

934
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,139
(Tempted)

935
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,949
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

936
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,280
Wait.

937
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,650
Oh, my.

938
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,150
This is how people lose all of their money
when they become addicted to gambling.

939
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,219
Right.

940
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,090
Eight. Nine.

941
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,730
- How many coins do we have?
- We have 98.

942
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,889
- We have 98 coins?
- Should we bet 2 coins...

943
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,190
to have 100 coins in total?

944
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,860
Then we should go to the mansion.
What do you say?

945
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,059
- Okay.
- We'll win more coins.

946
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,400
We'll go and battle it out.

947
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Win more coins.

948
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,199
Let's check the dungeon first.

949
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,670
(They leave after asking to win more coins
to sneak into the mansion.)

950
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,539
Player Lee Jin Hyeong, you bet...

951
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,280
four coins on an even number
for your Odd and Even bet.

952
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,940
The game will begin.

953
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,179
I'm not sleepy anymore.

954
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,179
You scolded me for gambling too much.

955
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,820
- Gosh.
- The numbers are 4 and 5.

956
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,289
Player Lee Jin Hyeong,

957
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:54,289
your Odd and Even bet failed.

958
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:56,760
You will lose all the coins you bet.

959
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,230
- Should we break that?
- Oh, no.

960
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,900
- Break what?
- This.

961
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,199
We can win more coins and replace them.

962
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,869
- You want to break that?
- No. Wait.

963
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,440
No one will know
if you win coins and put them back.

964
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:08,769
Let's go all in. What do you say?

965
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,510
If you want that, it's better
to place coins on the Single Die bet.

966
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,780
It's only a coin.

967
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,610
The coins will go up tenfold.

968
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,610
If you keep going at it,
you're bound to win once.

969
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,610
Really?

970
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,380
You bet one coin each...

971
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,380
on Double 1, Double 2, Double 3,

972
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,820
Double 4, Double 5, and Double 6...

973
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,519
for your Single Die bet.

974
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,329
We never got doubles, right?

975
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,929
- We'll get them now.
- Of course.

976
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,269
The numbers on the dice are 1 and 4.

977
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,039
Should we try it one more time?

978
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,340
- Okay.
- Just one more time.

979
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,309
- The numbers on the dice are 1 and 4.
- We'll get it.

980
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,019
You will lose all the coins you bet.

981
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:56,190
This is infuriating.

982
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,150
This is going to work.

983
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,159
This usually works.

984
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,559
- Pi, is that your final bet?
- Yes.

985
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,800
- The numbers on the dice are 3 and 6.
- You're awful at this.

986
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,000
Seven, eight, nine. Even.

987
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,369
You have bet ten coins
on the even number section.

988
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:17,309
(Becoming irrational)

989
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,050
The numbers on the dice are 1 and 6.

990
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,650
You have lost all the coins you bet.

991
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,719
What are you doing, Jin Hyeong?

992
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,849
Turn around.

993
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:31,420
(Betting on an even number again)

994
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,519
Did I get it?

995
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,030
The numbers on the dice are 2 and 3.

996
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,360
You have bet on an even number,
and you failed.

997
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,159
You will lose all the coins you bet.

998
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,929
This is how people lose all of their money
when they become addicted to gambling.

999
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,110
This is a secret.

1000
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:54,179
How are we going to explain to them
that we lost the money?

1001
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,480
What should we do?
This is driving me crazy.

1002
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,420
Odd. Even.

1003
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,889
Pi, you have bet...

1004
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,960
fifty coins on an odd number.

1005
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,429
She's losing her mind.

1006
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:15,260
- What did you say?
- You've lost it.

1007
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,869
- She's a gambling addict.
- I feel like throwing up.

1008
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,869
"How is she confident enough
to bet 50 coins?"

1009
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,039
"Will we lose all our coins..."

1010
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,880
"and go home empty-handed?"

1011
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,710
The game will begin.

1012
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,789
I honestly can't watch this.

1013
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,329
The numbers on the dice are 1 and 4.

1014
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:51,900
(She won the bet.)

1015
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:57,610
Nice!

1016
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,840
- You're given 100 coins.
- Nice!

1017
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
(She restored the loss in one game.)

1018
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,349
I thought, "She's the one."

1019
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,750
"She'll do anything she sets her mind to."

1020
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:09,920
I thought, "Finally.
I saved face before my teammates."

1021
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,150
I was thrilled.

1022
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,320
- Should we be rational and stop?
- Yes. Stop.

1023
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,360
Let's be normal...

1024
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,289
- and not be an addict.
- This is it.

1025
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,329
- Okay.
- It's perfect.

1026
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:18,860
- We have so many we can buy.
- We can buy all of them.

1027
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,659
I don't need that.

1028
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,469
Let me get a can of Coke and a cigarette.

1029
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,500
I don't need anything else.

1030
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,869
It's good that we won a round
before we lost all the coins.

1031
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,739
Should I play one last round?

1032
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:34,739
- If...
- If I'm being honest, you might win.

1033
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,679
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

1034
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,110
- So, you're that type.
- I think you'll make it.

1035
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:41,949
Let's win all the coins...

1036
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,820
and use free orders...

1037
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,889
to eat 20 coins' worth of ramyeon.

1038
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:46,889
Right.

1039
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,760
- Should we do that?
- Yes.

1040
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,659
(Her heart palpitates.)

1041
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,769
You're betting all of it?

1042
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,769
We might as well go all in.
It's go big or go home.

1043
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,170
Bet on a number that means a lot to you.

1044
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,840
A number that means a lot to me?
It's three.

1045
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,940
Go.

1046
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,750
Ten coins are too many.

1047
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,380
What do you think?

1048
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,550
Is that what you're here for?

1049
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,550
Only to win 60 coins?

1050
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,289
- Pi,
- Start praying.

1051
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,730
you have bet...

1052
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,059
a hundred coins on an odd number.
Is it correct?

1053
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,059
Yes.

1054
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,969
The game will begin.

1055
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,869
(The biggest bet ever at Phantom Casino)

1056
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,239
(Shutting her eyes tightly)

1057
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:44,679
(They bet their whole night
on an odd number.)

1058
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,190
- Yes!
- Yes!

1059
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,530
(Pi has won the 100-coin bet.)

1060
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,900
I will tell you the result of the game.

1061
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,400
- Gosh.
- Pi has bet on an odd number...

1062
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,070
and won.

1063
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,000
According to the dividend rate,

1064
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,969
you are given 200 coins.

1065
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:12,940
How are you so good at this?

1066
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,079
"Let's trust my gut today."

1067
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,679
"If I make it once,"

1068
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,880
"my team will live a comfortable life."

1069
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,150
"Though we're in the jungle,
we might make it more romantic..."

1070
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,550
"with a few glasses of alcohol
before going to bed."

1071
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,519
- One can of Coke, two liters of water.
- Two liters.

1072
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,730
And a mosquito repellent incense.
A pair of gloves.

1073
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,230
Three mattresses. Two blankets.

1074
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,059
And a kilogram of lychee.

1075
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,599
Like, "Pick everything you want!
They're on me."

1076
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,070
That was how I felt.

1077
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:43,739
Moreover, KNUCKS and Seung Jin...

1078
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,269
went to work for us.

1079
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,340
So, I wanted them to be more comfortable
when they returned.

1080
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,409
As a team that lost the match,

1081
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,849
it would have taken a toll on us
if we had lost the money as well.

1082
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:57,289
But Pi did...

1083
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:00,489
a very important job of motivating us.

1084
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,260
So, I'm extremely grateful.

1085
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,460
(They return to the Survival Zone,
feeling reassured.)

1086
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,000
When will the infiltrators come back?

1087
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,670
(5. During a Deathmatch,
what goes on in the mansion?)

1088
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,269
As a player who was voted
to be an elimination candidate,

1089
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,480
- Jin Ho will go first.
- Okay.

1090
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:23,949
It would be funny
if they both got eliminated.

1091
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,179
Then, Mina and Ji Min will return.

1092
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,150
Hyun Ji came to offer me a deal
out of nowhere.

1093
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,190
What was the deal?

1094
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,920
When she goes to the Deathmatch,

1095
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,559
she won't pick me.

1096
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:41,429
And if I go to the Deathmatch,
I won't pick her.

1097
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,099
(During the voting period earlier)

1098
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,199
- Pi.
- Yes?

1099
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,769
We need to survive, right?

1100
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,239
I don't ask for much.

1101
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,679
Even if I place last,

1102
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,480
I'll never pick you as my match.

1103
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:00,449
- For the Deathmatch?
- Yes.

1104
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,150
If you're willing to do the same,

1105
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,019
I'll do that. What do you say?

1106
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,429
- Do you have a lot of money?
- Why?

1107
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,929
If you have some to spare,

1108
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,429
can you give me 10,000 dollars?

1109
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,199
I'm kind of broke right now.

1110
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,269
Oh, you are...

1111
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,010
Shouldn't we come up
with some new terms for that?

1112
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,010
Yes, so...

1113
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,710
I just wanted to know
if you were open to it.

1114
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:31,780
- If you have...
- Be honest?

1115
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,320
- No lies?
- No.

1116
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:38,320
Then, I don't see a reason not to take it.

1117
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,690
Okay. Good.

1118
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,659
I asked her
if she could give me 10,000 dollars.

1119
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,530
I should ask her the same.

1120
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,929
Let's go and ask her for 20,000 dollars.

1121
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,059
You were paying attention
to come up with our game plan,

1122
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,829
so I wanted to find something
that I could do.

1123
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,239
And this was the only one
I could think of.

1124
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,969
It's good enough. We got 10,000 dollars.

1125
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:03,309
(Hyun Ji and Xitsuh get late-night meals.)

1126
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,650
You were coming so slowly
that I thought you were Jin Ho.

1127
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,090
- Is Pi here?
- Yes.

1128
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,730
- I got you water.
- Thank you. Wait.

1129
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,289
We could all eat here.

1130
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,530
- Yes, let's all eat here.
- Sure.

1131
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,159
- Where are our shower gowns?
- I got it.

1132
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,800
Probably in there.

1133
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,130
We should spread something out.

1134
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,199
Thanks for keeping your word tonight.

1135
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,469
Thanks for the food.

1136
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:32,940
- No.
- What food?

1137
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,909
- Oh, 10,000 dollars?
- Right.

1138
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,280
That and the 1.5 points.

1139
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,579
We're left with eight players
after the Deathmatch, right?

1140
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,349
- Yes.
- We started with ten people.

1141
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,019
- Eleven.
- Yes, eleven.

1142
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,789
But one of us went home on the first day.

1143
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,289
- That was me.
- I know.

1144
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,389
But you're glad to be back, aren't you?

1145
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,659
I am glad,
but I started at a disadvantage.

1146
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,530
So many disadvantages.

1147
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,469
I went in,
and they were all staring at me weirdly.

1148
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,099
They were suspicious of me.

1149
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,170
When you first returned?

1150
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:06,480
Yes! They were like,
"Did you get rid of Xitsuh?" Darn it.

1151
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,340
I was eating nasi goreng
back at the hotel.

1152
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:12,409
- But you survived.
- Exactly.

1153
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:13,780
You survived long enough.

1154
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,849
You're in the top eight already.

1155
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,320
I should shower.

1156
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,190
Shower?

1157
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,960
Shouldn't we go back up
when they announce the result?

1158
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,190
Do we have to wear the same clothes?

1159
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,699
- No, that doesn't matter.
- That's fine.

1160
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:28,730
- Really?
- Yes.

1161
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,000
I wore something else yesterday.

1162
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,769
- That doesn't matter.
- I need to get changed too.

1163
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:35,840
Last night, I took a shower
and wore completely different clothes.

1164
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Good.

1165
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,039
- What?
- What?

1166
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,840
You were staring at me.

1167
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,750
People say that I glare at them
when I just look at them.

1168
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,280
- So it's not so...
- I guess we all do here.

1169
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,289
Doesn't she look
like a real model from here?

1170
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:54,019
It's amazing that you realize that now.

1171
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,860
Do I look like a real rapper here?

1172
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,190
No.

1173
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,699
Okay. Sorry. I disappointed you.

1174
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:05,530
You look like a real computer, Jin Hyeong.

1175
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,170
A bit broken computer.

1176
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:13,679
They've got pretty good chemistry as well.

1177
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:17,880
- Throw it away.
- Yes, ma'am.

1178
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,679
I feel like there's no absolute best...

1179
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,750
when it comes to Deathmatches.

1180
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,349
Yurisa was rated so highly,

1181
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,960
- and she lost.
- But Jin Ho's a bit different.

1182
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,829
I've never seen a player as perfect...

1183
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:33,260
as Jin Ho until now.

1184
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:36,829
I honestly thought
that I was pretty good...

1185
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,570
in all types of games.

1186
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,340
But before I even tell Jin Ho, he's...

1187
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,309
- He's got it all figured out.
- Normally.

1188
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:44,809
I'm like, "He's got it all figured out."

1189
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:48,210
I go and tell him, "Jin Ho, this is bad!
There's a loophole!"

1190
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,210
"What is it?" "It goes like this."

1191
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,449
- "Oh, that?"
- "Yes, I thought about that."

1192
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:53,820
"Don't worry, Xitsuh.
I've thought of that already."

1193
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,679
I say, "Okay," and go away.

1194
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,949
I go back and say,
"Jin Ho, there's another loophole!"

1195
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,760
He goes, "But this is
so unlikely to happen."

1196
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,590
"I thought about it,
but I doubt it'll happen."

1197
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,489
I'm like, "Okay."

1198
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,860
He uses me like a spell checker
to review his strategy.

1199
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,260
He creates a game plan...

1200
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,900
and tells me to find loopholes...

1201
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,900
while he looks for one himself.

1202
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,739
However disadvantageous we are
in the game, he can make it work.

1203
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:17,670
People like us normally understand
the game...

1204
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,010
after a simulation or an explanation.

1205
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,510
But these guys think
of all the possibilities...

1206
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,179
when they announce the game.

1207
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,409
Yes, we do.

1208
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,550
Already.

1209
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,889
No matter how hard I try, I can't win.

1210
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,460
Where are Seung Jin and YunB?
Are they downstairs?

1211
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,260
They're probably smoking heavily,

1212
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,460
going, "We're doomed."

1213
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,159
(Seung Jin is deep in thought.)

1214
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,099
The chapter of the team battle...

1215
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,929
between the Indoor and Outdoor Teams
is over.

1216
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,369
Starting today,
we have to shuffle the deck.

1217
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,139
We have to stop playing
as Indoor Team and Outdoor Team.

1218
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:54,079
This will be a chance to create
new alliances.

1219
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,550
This is...

1220
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,550
Jin Ho's first Deathmatch...

1221
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,980
- The very first one.
- Yes.

1222
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,050
The first appearance of the Four Emperors.

1223
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,250
- That was insane.
- Yes.

1224
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,650
Who was the other one than Big Mom?

1225
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:08,619
- Kaidou.
- He's Kaidou.

1226
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,329
I think KNUCKS is...

1227
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,030
A strong character.

1228
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,530
Yes. A former admiral.
One of the big guys.

1229
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,630
- But he's inactive.
- Then...

1230
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,969
Because he was disqualified
on the Day of Ambush.

1231
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,570
Then, he should be Aokiji.

1232
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,639
- He's Aokiji!
- It has to be Aokiji.

1233
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:25,739
- Yes, Aokiji.
- Yes.

1234
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:27,710
He's weaker than before,

1235
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,179
but he's still got power.

1236
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:32,150
So, it will be decided
whether Aokiji will return or not.

1237
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,619
If Jin Ho loses tonight,

1238
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,280
that's going to be huge.

1239
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,920
- Absolutely.
- One of the Four Emperors...

1240
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:40,860
He's going to the prison of Impel Down.

1241
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,329
Definitely. He's going to be locked up.

1242
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,460
Has YunB told you...

1243
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,030
why he was joining that team?

1244
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,000
Did he say something like,

1245
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,139
"The Outdoor Team seemed so strong..."

1246
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,940
"that I decided it was better
to join them."

1247
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,840
- I think it was something like that.
- Right?

1248
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,010
I've been telling you guys, but the reason
I was sensitive yesterday was...

1249
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,579
because I was confused...

1250
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:05,550
whether he was pretending
or actually betraying us.

1251
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:09,119
Jin Ho was like, "We'll see what he does."

1252
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,150
But I couldn't just stand idle
and watch him...

1253
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,989
if he was trying to get rid of us.

1254
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:16,219
But Jin Ho usually...

1255
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:18,590
- "Just let him be."
- Exactly.

1256
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,860
Well, we could watch him, but...

1257
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,260
We might find a way to stop him,

1258
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,030
but if we don't do it now,
it could be very bad for us.

1259
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,440
He acted like he was
cooperating with us...

1260
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,699
and came up with their own plan...

1261
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,570
to keep ruining our plan.

1262
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:33,510
As if it was a mistake.

1263
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,679
- That means YunB is playing well.
- Right.

1264
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,750
But I was curious about that.
I had no clue...

1265
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,619
that there was a dungeon.

1266
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,190
On the Day of Ambush,

1267
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:48,190
- did you know where the symbols were?
- Yes.

1268
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,789
Really? Did they tell you?

1269
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,690
- No, we figured it out.
- How?

1270
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,630
We knew about the two symbols.

1271
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,329
The one on the second floor,
and another one in the main hall.

1272
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,039
I thought that what I saw in the main hall
would be one of the symbols.

1273
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,099
(YunB smoothly joins them.)

1274
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:03,739
Because it looked just like the symbol
on our rule book.

1275
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,239
And it was a triangle.

1276
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,840
I'm sleepy now that I ate.

1277
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,079
- Food coma?
- Food coma.

1278
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,480
- I'm so drowsy.
- It's more like sodium coma.

1279
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,820
When will I ever get to eat...

1280
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,519
so much ramyeon in my life?

1281
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:19,750
I'm rather happy
that I get to eat ramyeon every day.

1282
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:21,219
This is your only chance.

1283
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:22,789
It's ramyeon without a guilty conscience.

1284
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:23,889
Right.

1285
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:26,800
Do models have a set weight?

1286
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,000
No.

1287
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,559
- Now...
- It's free.

1288
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,099
- Nowadays, it's all about how you look.
- They don't regulate that now.

1289
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:32,599
They probably do, don't they?

1290
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:34,639
Not so much lately.

1291
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,969
There are many plus-size models
these days, so...

1292
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:38,210
Oh, right.

1293
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,510
As long as you can wear them...

1294
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,179
They won't hire you if you're too skinny.

1295
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,179
Right.

1296
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:47,250
In France,
if your body mass index is too low...

1297
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,880
When we work in France,

1298
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,750
we have to submit
physical exam results every six months.

1299
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,349
Oh, you have to submit the result?

1300
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,920
We have to get a signed document
from an actual doctor.

1301
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,190
- It's mandatory.
- Yes.

1302
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,659
- It's...
- It's the law.

1303
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,630
- It's the law?
- Yes, they have the law for it.

1304
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,869
- Your BMI can't be too low.
- No.

1305
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:05,969
Body mass index.

1306
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:08,599
So, we sometimes eat some food
before we get a checkup.

1307
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:09,670
You eat on purpose.

1308
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,110
Or we beg the doctor...

1309
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,340
- to give us a pass.
- You beg the doctor.

1310
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,340
You have to beg.

1311
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,110
It's hard to gain weight so suddenly...

1312
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,110
- Right.
- when you only have a few days.

1313
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,480
My BMI is pretty low too.

1314
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,380
- You're really skinny.
- I am skinny.

1315
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,519
I'm 182cm and 67kg.

1316
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:26,550
Gosh. That's so skinny.

1317
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,320
Do you think I can be a model?

1318
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:32,230
Models are 188cm and 65kg
or something like that.

1319
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,730
- Or 66 to 67kg.
- Oh, no.

1320
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,900
- When they're 188cm tall?
- A friend of mine...

1321
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,239
is 192cm tall. When he was the skinniest,

1322
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,000
he weighed 58kg.
So, he got exempted from military service.

1323
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,039
He was too skinny to serve.

1324
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,639
Can he even walk?

1325
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:48,840
No idea.
But he's been skinny all his life,

1326
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,349
so he has no problem with it.

1327
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,750
- He got used to it.
- He just can't gain weight.

1328
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,750
All players,
please gather in the main hall.

1329
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,090
(The players don't know
how the Deathmatch ended.)

1330
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,190
- Good work, Jin Ho.
- Thanks.

1331
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,389
The game was pretty tough.

1332
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,630
Seriously? If it was tough for you...

1333
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:10,199
No.

1334
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:11,369
(Nervous)

1335
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,039
- Good work.
- Thanks for waiting.

1336
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,469
- It took longer than I thought.
- It took so long.

1337
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,840
- Very much.
- Was it prolonged?

1338
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,179
We'll see.

1339
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,980
(6. The scene-stealers of the mansion)

1340
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,760
Oh, my.

1341
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,760
(Sound asleep)

1342
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,829
They're so calm.

1343
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:44,269
It's so hot that they melted.

1344
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:48,769
They're not that afraid of people.

1345
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:50,000
I guess they grew up here.

1346
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:51,909
Only one kitten is here.

1347
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:54,739
I guess so. Where are your other babies?

1348
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,550
(Peeking)

1349
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,679
(You scared me.)

1350
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,519
(This cat family in the mansion.)

1351
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,059
(They normally sleep on the dryer.)

1352
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,699
How do they look so cute when they sleep?

1353
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:20,539
(Staring)

1354
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:22,840
What side dishes do we need? Kimchi?

1355
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,769
(KNUCKS can't hear him.)

1356
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
- Maybe we should...
- You're so cute.

1357
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,579
(Holding)

1358
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,750
(Happy)

1359
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:44,329
My back hurts,
but I still have to pet you.

1360
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,630
Are you okay?

1361
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,099
I'll be okay.

1362
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:49,599
No, is your heart okay
after seeing something so adorable?

1363
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,599
No, I don't think so. I'm about to cry.

1364
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,099
- Hey!
- Do you remember me?

1365
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:56,940
Who is he?

1366
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,670
I'm back with a strange lady, right?

1367
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,809
It's so adorable.

1368
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,639
How cute.

1369
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,050
Throw me the kitten punch.

1370
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:08,849
Wait, she just stays there?
She ran away from me earlier.

1371
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:11,889
You probably smell like a predator to her.

1372
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:12,889
Exactly.

1373
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,519
(Letting his guard down)

1374
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,829
(The cats in the mansion are loved
by everyone.)

1375
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:30,510
I'm usually scared of cats,
but this one is so cute.

1376
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,739
It's a baby kitten.

1377
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,539
All babies are cute.

1378
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,510
(My baby's adorable, isn't she?)

1379
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,179
(Contemplating)

1380
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,190
The cats are so cute.
Maybe we should steal their cats.

1381
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:48,960
Come here. Come here, kitty.

1382
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,289
(Looking away)

1383
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,559
(Trying to get their attention)

1384
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,139
(Desperate)

1385
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,010
Oh, dear.

1386
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:11,550
Come on.

1387
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,079
(Kidnapping)

1388
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,820
Play with me.

1389
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,860
You're not going anywhere.

1390
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,230
(Let's take a look.)

1391
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,159
(Patting)

1392
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,500
Did you get some milk?

1393
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:38,869
What do you have on your face?
Let me see that.

1394
01:00:40,579 --> 01:00:42,579
Xitsuh, can you kidnap that cat
and bring it here?

1395
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,980
(He looks for a cat
as soon as he wakes up.)

1396
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,980
Meow.

1397
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:49,079
Come here, sweetheart.

1398
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,289
You have a leopard's face.

1399
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,289
(Taking the sleep out of its eyes)

1400
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,030
There.

1401
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:03,000
(Dancing)

1402
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:09,699
(He's lost in it.)

1403
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,780
(How Jin Ho gets his energy every morning)

1404
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,079
You're so cute. It's your aunt.

1405
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,650
Where were you last night? I missed you.

1406
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:24,820
Where were you?

1407
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,750
Who annoyed you?

1408
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:29,789
Do you want to go see Mommy?

1409
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,090
There, there.

1410
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,260
(Kissing)

1411
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,269
There's your mom. There you go.

1412
