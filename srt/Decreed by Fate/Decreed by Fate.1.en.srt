00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:02,960
Cheers.

178
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,560
Look.

179
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,660
How can a girl be like this?

180
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,790
This is ridiculous.

181
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,680
How inappropriate!

182
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,790
What are you looking at?

183
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,530
If you look at her again, I'll dig your eyeballs out to be my snack.

184
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,330
This is how wine should be drunk,

185
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,480
right?

186
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,240
Here.

187
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,430
It's my pleasure to meet you.

188
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,560
But

189
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,150
judging from your accent,

190
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,050
you are not from the capital?

191
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,570
I haven't been back to the capital for a long time.

192
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,030
I just came back recently.

193
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,740
It feels so good today.

194
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,590
We beat them up so easily.

195
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,410
It's rare to see

196
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,960
someone so good at kung fu like you.

197
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,400
It's rare to see

198
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,570
someone so beautiful and righteous like you, too.

199
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,860
Young master.

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,330
Which sect are you from?

201
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,390
Who is your master?

202
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,090
How long have you been learning these moves?

203
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,110
Lady,

204
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,420
I finally found you.

205
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,590
Lady.

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,220
Oh no.

207
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,610
Why is he here?

208
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,080
I...

209
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,680
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,760
I have something to do.

211
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,220
Let's meet some other day.

212
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,440
Lady.

213
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,910
Princess,

214
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,680
you are already 20 years old.

215
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,580
The ladies in the capital of your age

216
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,630
are all married.

217
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,280
I don't have to get married.

218
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,610
If I marry the wrong person,

219
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,630
I might as well hang myself to death.

220
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,920
How could you marry the wrong person?

221
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,400
You have no idea.

222
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,820
I saw an old ministry councillor today.

223
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,880
-Princess, -He...

224
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,800
don't change the subject.

225
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,880
Marriage has been arranged by parents and matchmakers since ancient times.

226
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,340
And yes,

227
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,440
you are different.

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,570
You have to choose someone you like.

229
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,030
Fine.

230
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,130
I agreed to that.

231
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,180
Well...

232
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,890
But

233
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,700
I found so many good-looking young masters for you.

234
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,550
Why don't you like any of them?

235
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,270
It's just after I saw them,

236
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,160
I didn't like them.

237
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,370
What can I do?

238
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,520
This time, it's Jia Youcai, ranking the third in the imperial examination.

239
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,150
I won't go.

240
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,370
A scholar again.

241
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:30,920
Boring.

242
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,610
My Lord.

243
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,200
My Lady.

244
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,340
I'm incompetent.

245
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,070
I didn't take good care of princess.

246
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,490
My heart hurts.

247
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,380
I'm going with you.

248
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,780
Ling.

249
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,370
How is she?

250
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,410
I took her to the matchmaker

251
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,400
and helped her report to the court.

252
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,240
That's good.

253
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,550
Look.

254
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,070
It's better not to marry than marrying the wrong person.

255
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,010
Princess,

256
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,800
I saw

257
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,090
Butler Lv is still outside.

258
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,480
That's all he cares about all day long.

259
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,410
He keeps his eyes on me all the time.

260
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,260
Who is it this time?

261
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,240
Jia Youcai.

262
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,890
I heard that he's the new Number Three Scholar.

263
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,090
Have you heard of him?

264
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,840
Jia Youcai?

265
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,430
Princess,

266
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,810
you can't marry him.

267
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,130
You know him?

268
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,080
He flirts with girls everywhere

269
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,500
and has a bad character.

270
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,190
Besides,

271
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,570
just because he knows some literature,

272
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,510
he even wrote his affairs with the girls into articles

273
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,280
and sold them for money.

274
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,200
So dirty.

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,960
Yes.

276
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,690
The girls' reputation has been ruined.

277
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,290
They can't even get married.

278
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,640
I wonder what he did

279
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,800
to trick Butler Lv.

280
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,280
I'll tell him the truth.

281
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,310
He won't force you

282
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,360
anymore.

283
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,870
Ling.

284
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,690
You agree to meet?

285
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,350
I'll arrange it right away.

286
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,760
I want to meet this afternoon.

287
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,810
I won't wait if he's late.

288
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,440
Besides,

289
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,610
I'll choose the place to meet.

290
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,850
Okay.

291
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,280
[Jiaofang]

292
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,360
Jiaofang,

293
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,090
a place full of good-looking men and musicians.

294
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,160
[Jiaofang]

295
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,650
A woman who frequently comes here cannot be a good lady.

296
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,640
Plus, Scholar Jia writes good articles.

297
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,290
No one will bother me again.

298
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,140
I'm such a genius.

299
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,130
Guys, I'm coming.

300
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,330
Come on in.

301
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,270
This lady is mine.

302
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,200
You can't compete with me.

303
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,360
Lady, pick me!

304
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,920
Come on.

305
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,420
[Jiaofang]

306
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,430
[Jiaofang]

307
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,380
Where are they?

308
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,840
Please come with me, young master.

309
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,100
I've prepared herbal baths for you in the inner courtyard.

310
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,890
Why did you choose Jiaofang?

311
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,110
You just came back to the capital.

312
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,370
There's something you don't know.

313
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,380
Bath houses are always crowded.

314
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,970
I'm afraid it'll attract people's attention.

315
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,110
I've dispelled all the musicians here

316
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,970
so that they won't see you

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,010
or disturb you.

318
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,920
That's very thoughtful of you.

319
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,400
Is anyone there?

320
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,140
Is anyone there?

321
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,400
Please.

322
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,250
Your favorite pine powder is ready.

323
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,810
Do you need me to sprinkle it on your clothes?

324
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,670
I'll leave now.

325
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,870
There seems to be someone here.

326
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,610
Smells good.

327
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,470
Beauty bathing

328
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,440
is like this.

329
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:09,890
You...

330
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,900
What are you doing?

331
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,400
Take your hands off.

332
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,990
Take your hands off first.

333
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,080
Wow.

334
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,190
I have an idea.

335
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,300
That's it.

336
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,510
If you act well, you can get a raise.

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,640
Do you come here often?

338
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,700
It's my first time.

339
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,819
No.

340
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,800
Obviously,

341
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,970
I'm a regular.

342
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,700
Why do you want others to think

343
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,300
you are loose and amorous?

344
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,099
Since I haven't met a good man,

345
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
I'd rather not be disturbed.

346
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,430
What if your lover in the future

347
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,319
misunderstands you?

348
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,839
Truth can't be false.

349
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,099
And the false can't be true.

350
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,319
If he's my lover,

351
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,620
how could he not

352
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,740
tell such a trivial matter?

353
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,590
It's an earner.

354
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,700
Have you thought it through?

355
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,450
If so...

356
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,810
Hello?

357
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,910
Such a bad temper.

358
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:51,680
But

359
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,360
based on his look,

360
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,620
he must be a top star.

361
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,120
No wonder he has strong personalities.

362
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,120
But Jia Youcai will be here soon.

363
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,860
What should I do?

364
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,370
I am

365
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,210
Jia Youcai.

366
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,770
The new scholar.

367
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,910
I've heard a lot about you, Princess.

368
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,750
Now that I see you,

369
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,300
you are really beautiful.

370
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,840
Oh.

371
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,300
Sit down.

372
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,650
Why are you so polite?

373
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,940
I am from

374
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,070
a general's family.

375
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,300
I don't care so much about the manners.

376
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,700
Do you care, Scholar Jia?

377
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,880
No.

378
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,480
Princess, you don't care about trifles.

379
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,280
I like

380
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,960
your personalities.

381
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't call me princess outside.

382
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,370
Come on.

383
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,550
Let's drink.

384
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,940
Drinking manners bring out true personalities.

385
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,410
Such a small cup.

386
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,070
I'm worried about your personalities.

387
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,360
You are a good drinker.

388
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,120
I admire you.

389
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,930
Scholar Jia.

390
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,330
Do you know the drinker's wager game?

391
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,130
Lady,

392
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,440
you play the drinker's wager game?

393
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,420
I don't know how to do housework or needlework.

394
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,300
But I'm good at drinker's wager game,

395
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,720
dice,

396
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,270
Chinese dominoes,

397
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,400
almost everything.

398
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,260
What?

399
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,570
Can't girls play this?

400
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,720
That's not true.

401
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,400
I'm delightfully surprised

402
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,700
that you know these.

403
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,990
I just want to find

404
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,340
such a talented,

405
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,160
versatile,

406
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,640
and interesting girl.

407
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,840
Praising me for this?

408
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
This guy is really hard to deal with.

409
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,980
O lute, play music bright.

410
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,960
For the bride sweet and slender!

411
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,310
The beautiful music

412
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,150
with your beautiful face,

413
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,330
it's such a perfect match.

414
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,610
I've fallen for you for a long time, princess.

415
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,210
I miss you so much that I can't sleep or eat well.

416
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,110
I wonder if you would like to...

417
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,070
You once swore by my pillow

418
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,210
to grow old together with me.

419
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
Is it

420
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
a joke?

421
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,790
By the pillow?

422
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,460
I've already committed to you.

423
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,670
The sweet words in your bedroom...

424
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,900
are they

425
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,790
all fake?

426
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,600
Hello?

427
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,990
Pretty boy.

428
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,950
Who are you?

429
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,930
He's mad at me.

430
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,890
Don't be afraid.

431
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,620
Why are you scolding him?

432
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,190
Let's go.

433
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
All these years,

434
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,870
you've been playing at Jiaofang every night.

435
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,290
Over 30 musicians

436
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,230
have all served you.

437
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,860
-Over 30? -Over 30?

438
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,640
You like me the most.

439
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,450
But now,

440
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,770
you're talking about marriage with the mole man?

441
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,990
Sigh.

442
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,250
My heart...

443
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,610
That's enough.

444
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,870
30 is too much.

445
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,660
If you want to act, play something strong.

446
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,160
What's the use of an underplay?

447
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,760
It's all in the past.

448
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,070
I hope you don't mind, Scholar Jia.

449
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,810
No.

450
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,700
As long as you

451
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,840
won't keep in touch with these pretty boys

452
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,730
after the wedding.

453
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,180
I don't ask for much.

454
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,540
I just hope I can keep the lady company every day.

455
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,460
In this way,

456
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,560
I will be

457
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,280
satisfied.

458
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,430
My sweetheart,

459
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,660
I really don't want to leave you.

460
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,190
I believe Scholar Jia is broad-minded.

461
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,340
He won't hinder our pure relationship.

462
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,170
Please mind your business.

463
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,430
I have something to do.

464
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,630
I'll leave now.

465
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,820
Scholar Jia, why are you leaving? Let's talk more.

466
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,310
Done.

467
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,470
Not a penny less than what we agreed on.

468
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,110
This female Zhang Fei is really irritating.

469
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,650
If it weren't for the title of a nominal princess,

470
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,290
easy to control without her parents,

471
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,950
I won't waste my time with you.

472
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,020
Wait and see.

473
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,480
Say whatever you want.

474
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,470
Princess,

475
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,110
are you determined not to get married?

476
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,300
Not really.

477
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,280
I always think

478
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,010
parents' and matchmakers' words are important,

479
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,740
but it should to be like what my parents had.

480
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,800
It's more important to love and understand each other.

481
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,650
No one in the capital

482
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,000
can meet your standards.

483
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,440
Not necessarily.

484
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,530
I met two extraordinary men in the capital today.

485
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,120
Which families are they from?

486
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll send someone to ask around.

487
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,010
I forgot to ask their names.

488
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,100
But one of them should be a courtesan of Jiaofang.

489
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,380
A courtesan of Jiaofang?

490
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:15,850
Then,

491
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,950
which one do you like more?

492
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,810
If both of them can be mine...

493
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,070
Princess,

494
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,580
a woman cannot serve two husbands.

495
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,190
Since ancient times, men have had several wives and concubines.

496
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,620
Why a woman can only serve one husband?

497
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,680
Isn't that unfair?

498
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,100
Princess,

499
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,990
I don't understand what you say sometimes.

500
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,630
But I believe

501
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,480
what you think and say

502
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,740
is definitely right.

503
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,630
OK, Ling.

504
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,390
I was just joking.

505
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,410
But

506
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,130
if I were a man,

507
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,300
I would definitely marry you.

508
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,770
[Nasty and lousy, little snob]

509
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,360
Isn't this the new scholar?

510
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,470
What is this about?

511
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,350
I heard

512
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,200
it was done by the princess of Lord Lian's Mansion.

513
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,460
Yesterday, Scholar Jia proposed

514
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,590
and offended the princess.

515
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,600
Look, today...

516
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,520
Look at Scholar Jia.

517
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,070
He could have offended anyone else rather than her.

518
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,070
This is terrible.

519
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,730
The female Zhang Fei is so cruel.

520
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,120
Scholar Jia is handsome.

521
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,670
He deserves so much more

522
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,060
than a jinx like her.

523
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,340
What is she dissatisfied with?

524
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,220
I didn't do it.

525
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,280
I haven't been out since I came back yesterday.

526
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,170
Ask Ling if you don't believe me.

527
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,420
What's the point of it?

528
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,460
Everyone in the capital thinks you did it.

529
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,510
This is great.

530
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,540
No one dares to propose anymore.

531
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,690
My lord, my lady.

532
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,630
What should I do?

533
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,040
It doesn't matter.

534
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,100
Then I won't get married.

535
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,500
You don't need to arrange anymore.

536
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,430
And I'll stay with you forever.

537
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,430
How great is that.

538
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,670
Here comes the imperial edict.

539
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,500
By the order of the Emperor,

540
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,440
Princess Ye Rong'er is quiet and elegant,

541
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,080
gentle and gorgeous.

542
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,690
She's betrothed to Marquis Jing'an, Yin Sishen.

543
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,160
Please pick a good date to get married.

544
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,300
Period.

545
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,810
What?

546
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,660
Marriage granted to Yin Sishen?
