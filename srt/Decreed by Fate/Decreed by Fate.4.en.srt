When did it become a human-eating forest?

176
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,590
Exactly.

177
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,100
No.

178
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,030
The forest eats humans.

179
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,210
If you go in there, you'll go crazy.

180
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,430
You might even die.

181
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,320
They say it's a human-eating forest where you'll never come back from.

182
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,040
Nonsense.

183
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,000
Get out!

184
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,790
Never come back...

185
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:56,770
Trot!

186
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,780
Whoa!

187
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,370
Whoa!

188
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,020
Where am I?

189
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,650
Keep walking straight

190
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,850
and you'll get there.

191
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,970
Why is it raining?

192
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,780
It rains a lot here.

193
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,700
It often rains.

194
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,960
Let's go.

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,050
Hey!

196
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,350
Don't go.

197
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,820
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

198
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,620
I didn't ask her to go.

199
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,640
But what if something bad happens to the tumor...

200
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,590
I'll be even happier then.

201
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,690
She always goes against me.

202
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Damn Zheng Lin.

203
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,000
What a bad idea he came up with.

204
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,490
Tumor,

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,590
I've done my best.

206
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,070
Good luck to you.

207
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Director Liu.

208
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,240
The flowers in Boqing Hall are blooming well.

209
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,630
People should

210
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,640
work out often.

211
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,250
Work out.

212
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,990
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

213
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,990
I'll leave you be.

214
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,870
Sir, what are you doing?

215
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,270
What took you so long?

216
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm taking out the trash.

217
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,960
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

218
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,550
Let's go.

219
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,090
Sir,

220
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,070
you've been waiting for me to take out the trash?

221
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,120
Cut the crap.

222
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,340
Why would someone live here?

223
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,640
I really don't understand them.

224
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,920
Wenren Jing.

225
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,630
Take this order.

226
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,130
I can't let Lu Tingxiao underestimate me.

227
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,710
Director Lu.

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Where's Jing?

229
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,980
She went to Jinxiu House to learn embroidery from a master.

230
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,480
Then...

231
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,650
She said she wouldn't have dinner with us.

232
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,580
Where am I?

233
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,380
How can I get out?

234
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,870
Did I come here just now?

235
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,970
Rong.

236
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,750
Dad.

237
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,180
Is it you?

238
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,840
Is it really you?

239
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,440
Rong.

240
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,620
Rong.

241
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,720
Good.

242
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,660
Dad.

243
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,550
Where are you going?

244
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,130
I'm going to the battlefield to kill the enemy.

245
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,480
Dad.

246
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,530
Don't go.

247
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,550
Don't leave me.

248
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,470
Dad.

249
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,980
Dad!

250
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,770
Rong.

251
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,950
Come here to dad.

252
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,540
Dad.

253
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,910
I knew you were still alive.

254
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,950
They all told me that you were dead.

255
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,730
I know you won't leave me alone.

256
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,510
I haven't got the stars

257
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,680
you wanted.

258
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,690
Rong.

259
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,250
Come here to dad.

260
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,040
Dad.

261
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,990
Dad.

262
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,340
I don't want the stars.

263
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,740
I don't want the stars.

264
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,680
I just want you to come back.

265
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,570
Please.

266
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,560
Please come back.

267
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,580
Dad.

268
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,850
Dad.

269
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,380
I won't be willful anymore.

270
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,540
Dad.

271
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,520
Please come back.

272
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,500
They all bullied me.

273
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,560
They said I don't have parents.

274
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,640
I miss you so much.

275
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,360
Dad.

276
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,750
Dad.

277
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,340
Dad!

278
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,100
Trot!

279
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,720
Whoa!

280
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:35,990
Oh no.

281
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,680
The miasma is poisonous.

282
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,350
Jing!

283
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,600
Jing!

284
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,000
Jing!

285
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,390
Jing!

286
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,420
Jing!

287
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,650
Dad!

288
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,750
Dad!

289
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,849
Jing.

290
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,450
Lu Tingxiao!

291
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,170
Don't close it.

292
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,880
Time's up.

293
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,760
You can only leave until tomorrow.

294
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,770
My sister hasn't come back yet.

295
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,770
I have to find her.

296
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,960
Whoever breaks in through the city gate

297
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,819
will be killed.

298
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,950
What are you doing?

299
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,380
Officer.

300
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,520
Sorry.

301
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,099
Sorry.

302
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,619
May I have a word with you?

303
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,050
-What are you...
-Let's talk aside.

304
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,599
Officer.

305
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,950
Something is wrong with her brain.

306
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,710
Sorry, officer.

307
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,220
What are you talking about?

308
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,280
What are you doing?

309
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
She's got something wrong with her.

310
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,380
Get off!

311
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,300
Okay.

312
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,430
Get off!

313
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,200
Goodbye, officer.

314
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,850
Are you crazy?

315
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,030
Didn't you hear that they will kill you if you break in through the city gate?

316
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,660
Come on.

317
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,050
It hurts.

318
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,820
You followed me?

319
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,120
How is that possible?

320
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,750
Although we are competitors,

321
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,560
I won't let you die in vain.

322
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,580
Let go of me!

323
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,180
My sister left the city today

324
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,780
but she hasn't come back yet.

325
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,580
She may be hanging out somewhere

326
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,090
or forget the time.

327
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,070
Besides,

328
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,120
that tumor

329
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,750
is very cunning.

330
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,170
You...

331
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,160
I mean

332
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,800
she should be all good.

333
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,940
Right?

334
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,600
I took the order without telling him

335
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,980
and now I'm in danger.

336
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,590
I didn't expect him to save me in the end.

337
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,730
Are you hungry?

338
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,600
No.

339
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,390
Come here and have some food.

340
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,740
Hello?

341
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,440
You...

342
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,620
What are you doing?

343
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,760
What are you doing?

344
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,200
There you go.

345
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,970
It smells good.

346
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,950
Eat slowly.

347
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,950
Don't choke on it.

348
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,770
There you go.

349
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,540
Why did you turn your head?

350
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,810
Nothing.

351
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,030
Just to stay calm.

352
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,560
Anyway, I'll take water as wine.

353
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,940
Thank you for saving me.

354
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,220
Seems like we have to spend the night here.

355
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,020
It's so foggy.

356
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,630
There are no stars at all.

357
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,600
I can't tell the direction at all.

358
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,640
It's the best without stars.

359
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,150
I hate stars.

360
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,910
What?

361
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:12,800
Nothing.

362
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,650
It's none of your business.

363
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,550
I'll do it myself.

364
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,830
Thank you.

365
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,970
I'm gonna sleep now.

366
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,050
Let me make it clear.

367
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,280
Let's do it this way.

368
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,180
Don't cross this line.

369
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,660
What?

370
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,930
Are you afraid I'll take advantage of you?

371
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,480
No.

372
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,030
I'm afraid I'll take advantage of you.

373
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,780
I'll sleep here.

374
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,730
Don't overthink.

375
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,800
If she doesn't come back tomorrow,

376
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,470
call the police.

377
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:25,730
Yes.

378
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,870
What are you doing?

379
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,000
Damn it!

380
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,710
How dare you humiliate me!

381
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,020
Someone broke into the house.

382
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,230
-Mind your own business. -Beat him!

383
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,630
It seems to be your house.

384
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,970
My house!

385
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,690
[Matchmaker Street]

386
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,630
Beat him!

387
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,940
This is the place.

388
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,300
Why is there no one?

389
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,170
I didn't come to the wrong place.

390
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,070
Liu Zhan.

391
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
If you don't come out,

392
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,140
I'll beat him to death.

393
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,940
Are you crazy?

394
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,150
Why would I go out with so many people out there?

395
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,780
Liu Shan.

396
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,090
I wish you good luck.

397
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,560
Do whatever you want.

398
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,550
Don't you dare lay a finger on my Young Master!

399
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,570
Young Master!

400
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,120
Young Master, don't come back!

401
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,470
I'll beat you to death!

402
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,140
Fine.

403
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,860
I'll grant your wish.

404
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,080
Beat him to death!

405
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,420
Stop!

406
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,910
You thieves!

407
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,000
We are no foes.

408
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,610
Why did you hit my family?

409
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,390
I'm looking for Liu Zhan.

410
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,050
Who are you?

411
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,110
I...

412
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,960
I am...

413
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,690
A passenger.

414
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,520
Go on.

415
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,620
Young Master.

416
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,350
How dare you fool me?

417
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,760
Stop!

418
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,320
Who are you?

419
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,450
Excuse me.

420
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,270
Do you know Wenren Jing?

421
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,230
-Who are you? -Who are you?

422
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,440
Listen.

423
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,170
My name is Liu Zhan.

424
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,690
I live in the Yinshu Pavilion.

425
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,810
I'll wait for you to destroy my family.

426
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,580
Please go on.

427
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,550
Young Master!

428
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,910
Young Master!

429
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,730
Beat him!

430
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,730
Beat him to death!

431
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,310
Go to hell!

432
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,110
Young Master.

433
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,870
Wenren Ling.

434
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,920
Run!

435
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,140
Leave me alone.

436
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,940
Let's go together.

437
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,780
Wenren Ling?

438
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,380
Wenren Jing.

439
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,080
It turns out we all live on the same street.

440
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,540
Let's go.

441
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,600
Go call the police.

442
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
You saved me once.

443
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,650
I've paid you back.

444
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,990
Stop!

445
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,060
Let go of him!

446
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,070
Zhang Jiu.

447
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,670
Zhang Jiu.

448
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,550
They hit me.

449
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,660
Everyone,

450
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,790
I apologize on behalf of Master Hong.

451
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,100
The Hongs will pay for your medical expenses.

452
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,110
Our Young Master is young and playful.

453
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,080
Please forgive him.

454
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,310
It has nothing to do with the medical expenses.

455
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,740
Look how you have beaten her.

456
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,460
How dare you talk nonsense here?

457
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,010
I...

458
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,950
Young Master.

459
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,340
His Lordship wants you to go back now.

460
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,300
Let's go.

461
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,480
Wait and see.

462
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,800
Thank you, sir!

463
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,220
Thank you, sir.

464
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,410
If it weren't you,

465
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,810
Ling

466
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,820
and I...

467
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,080
-You're welcome. -Will be beaten to death.

468
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Don't mention it.

469
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,690
Goodbye.

470
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,570
Sir.

471
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,040
Young Master.

472
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,290
How did you get into our Boqing Hall?

473
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,730
I was doing justice.

474
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,040
How will I do it

475
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,210
if I can't get in?

476
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:32,970
Young Master.

477
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,060
Let's go back.

478
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,990
Young Master.

479
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,730
Let's go.

480
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,120
Go.

481
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,370
Be careful.

482
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,250
Sir, stop looking.

483
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,280
Come here and apply the medicine.

484
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,550
Good.

485
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,490
Dad.

486
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,010
Dad.

487
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,320
Dad.

488
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,290
I was...

489
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,470
Brat.

490
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,570
You're always doing nothing.

491
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,470
You're ruining my reputation.

492
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,970
You'll be targeted sooner or later if you keep doing this.

493
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,500
Even Mr. Wang Yizhi will be implicated by you.

494
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,550
Understand?

495
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,510
But...

496
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:36,930
Dad.

497
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,110
He...

498
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,500
What's wrong with him?

499
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,350
Listen.

500
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,780
If you don't get married and start a business,

501
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,090
just stay at home.

502
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,240
I won't leave you even a piece of brick or tile,

503
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,380
let along the Hong's heritage.

504
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,030
Master Hong, you're exaggerating.

505
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,630
Young Master is still young.

506
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,180
You just need to teach him a little bit.

507
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,310
Why are you so angry?

508
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,340
Well,

509
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,190
Young Master has come of age.

510
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,820
Maybe after getting married,

511
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,280
he'll become more mature.

512
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,520
What do you say, Young Master Hong?

513
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,490
Yes.

514
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,490
Dad.

515
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,130
That's what I meant.

516
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,520
Dad.

517
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,510
You flirt with girls all day.

518
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,820
Dad.

519
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm not flirting with girls.

520
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,300
I...

521
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,110
I really like a girl.

522
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm just afraid that you will look down on her.

523
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,090
So

524
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,560
I didn't dare tell you.

525
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,070
Really?

526
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,830
Yes.

527
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,130
Who is she?

528
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,530
Dad...

529
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,180
She is the daughter of the Qus, Qu Liuyun,

530
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,790
who lives in the southern city.

531
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,740
She is from a good family,

532
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,150
gentle and virtuous,

533
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,340
but only from a humble background.

534
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,690
I'm afraid you won't agree.

535
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,000
So,

536
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,680
as long as you agree,

537
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,120
I can get married tomorrow.

538
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,130
Brat.

539
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,710
You don't even know the bride-price and engagement etiquette?

540
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,560
Tomorrow,

541
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,210
I'll find some reliable matchmakers

542
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,870
to get Qu Liuyun's horoscope.

543
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,410
If you dare lie to me...

544
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,210
Dad.

545
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,170
Don't bother.

546
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,940
I happen to know a matchmaker friend.

547
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,740
He's one of the best in Pingyang.

548
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,920
As long as you agree,

549
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,380
I'll go find him tomorrow.

550
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,610
You can go now.

551
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,110
Go get Wanyi.

552
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,570
Yes.

553
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,060
Wanyi.

554
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,530
Are you

555
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,540
feeling better?

556
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,640
Thank you for taking care of me.

557
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,150
I think

558
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,920
it's just a cold.

559
00:30:59,390 --> 00:30:59,990
Come here.

560
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,860
Let me introduce you

561
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,410
to one of your old friends.
