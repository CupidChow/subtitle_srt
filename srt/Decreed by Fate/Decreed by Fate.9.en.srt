He ran away?

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,640
Did you ask the nosey parker

6
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,900
who asked about Lan Que's whereabouts?

7
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,620
They are missing.

Darn it.

9
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,630
Young master, you asked me to protect Jing in secret.

10
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,100
But I was too late

11
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,039
and it almost led to a disaster.

Is she okay?

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,670
Has she seen the doctor?

14
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,060
She was just shocked.

15
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:58,820
Nothing serious.

How is Fang Xianxun?

23

I want to check on him.

24

Chairman was more seriously drowned than you.

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,300
But fortunately, he's skilled at kung fu.

26

He's all right now.

27

do you think I should treat Fang Xianxun better?

Sister,

33
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,910
do you like Chairman Fang?

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,930
Since he protected me with his life,

35
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,400
I will put him in my heart.

36
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,070
Are you feeling better?

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,090
Why do you care so much about me?

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,610

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,410
I should thank you.

42

For what?

43
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,140
I heard from Yan Wu that

44

you saved Jing.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,340
It's my business to save my master.

46

What?

47
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,750
Are you afraid that I'm on the upper hand now?

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,070
Sorry to bother you.

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,289
Hey.

144
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,010
Start dancing!

145
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,000
Let them dance.

146
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,770
Dance!

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,400
Please.

154
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,070
have some soup.

155
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,350
Master,

156
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,830
you are so nice to me today.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,560
I will treat you like this from now on.

158

Jing,

159
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,970
I want soup, too.

160
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,180
Go ahead.

161
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,980
There's such a big pot of soup.

162
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,780
No one stopped you.

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,010
I don't want to drink now.

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,320
Director Liu.

165
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,470
Your identity of Yugou

can't be known by the officer, right?

167
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,400
Since both officers are here today,

168
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,710
I have something to report.

169
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,670
Please uphold justice for the matchmakers in Pingyang.

170
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,680
The matchmaker halls should arrange marriages.

171
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,790
But those unrelated, unmarried men and women in Boqing Hall

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,740
stay under the same roof, making a mess in Pingyang.

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,000
What a mess!

174
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,110
What a mess?

175
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,890
Who was it wearing revealing clothes and parading while tied this afternoon?

176
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,900
Exactly.

177
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,080
There's nothing new.

178
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,550
You can hear what I'm thinking?

179
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,270
We've been together for so many days.

180
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,330
Our minds have established connection.

181
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,100
Rumor has it that

182
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,210
a woman is serving two men

183
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,090
in Boqing Hall,

184
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,310
and they do all dirty things, lewdly.

185
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,780
Everyone is talking about it.

186
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,930
This behavior has greatly affected the reputation of the matchmakers in Pingyang.

187
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,450
Affected our reputation!

188
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,290
Officer Song.

189
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,500
It's all your fault.

190
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,160
Please uphold justice for the matchmakers in Pingyang.

191
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,620
The group licentiousness.

192
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,620
Is it true?

193
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Hahaha.

194
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,100
Say it.

195
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,710
Today is the matchmaker party.

196
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,110
We'll talk about other things some other time.

197
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,830
Officer Song.

198
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,140
Officer Li is also here today.

199
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,830
It's been a long time since Pingyang started suffering from Boqing Hall.

200
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,940
Please make a decision today, officers.

201
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,050
How could matchmakers in Pingyang be so rude?

202
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,830
Such licentiousness can't only be settled by shutting the hall down.

203
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,810
Today, I'm going to rectify it

204
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,670
and give you all an explanation.

205
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:01,850
So wise, Your Excellency.

206
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,230
He who has a mind to beat his dog

207
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,990
will easily find his stick.

208
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,960
The lies were made up so viciously.

209
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,060
Not only do you want to kill me,

210
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,410
but also taint my reputation.

211
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,750
I...

212
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,430
Master.

213
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,290
I will pretend to be sick.

214
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,680
You two, carry me away.

215
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,110
Officer Li, look.

216
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,250
It's not that I'm talking nonsense.

217
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,930
The licentious relationship between these three

218
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,980
is obvious.

219
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,250
Don't you dare talk nonsense again!

220
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,160
Who dares to make up stories about my wife again?

221
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,920
Don't blame me

222
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,430
for being merciless.

223
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,740
This Tumor

224
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,130
is your wife?

225
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,960
What are you doing?

226
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,050
A matter of expediency.

227
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,890
Say yes.

228
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,090
Yes.

229
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,900
You are the tumor.

230
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,880
Fine.

231
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,720
Honey.

232
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,440
Miss Tumor...

233
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,350
Miss Jing, you really dare to admit it.

234
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,950
Then,

235
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,460
what are you two doing

236
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,720
with Chairman Fang?

237
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,510
None of your business.

238
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,440
Brother-in-law,

239
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,050
don't listen to these people's nonsense.

240
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,270
Let's go.

241
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,000
You say you are a couple and that's it?

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,840
You even made up a brother-in-law.

243
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,340
You can't leave.

244
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,730
You're just prattling on.

245
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,930
Chairman Fang,

246
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,180
what do you think?

247
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,050
Can't you see my sister fainted because of you?

248
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,110
Who dares to talk nonsense today?

249
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,790
Who dares to make trouble?

250
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,780
Sister.

251
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,630
Are you okay?

252
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,210
Brother.

253
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,560
Honey.

254
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,970
My chest hurts.

255
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,230
I...

256
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:32,910
I...

257
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,450
Her injury is urgent.

258
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,090
Send Miss Jing back to rest.

259
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,890
It's a matter of life and death.

260
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,400
We'll talk about other things later.

261
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,190
I'll get even with you later.

262
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,990
-Dismiss. -Don't leave if you dare.

263
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,870
Let's go.

264
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,530
Who?

265
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,440
I knew you would come.

266
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,290
Where's Lan Que?

267
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,990
You won't want to know.

268
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,849
What will you do to Mr. Xue?

269
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,270
It depends on you.

270
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,860
As long as you are loyal to Chonglou,

271
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,800
I promise that your beloved Xue

272
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,740
will be alive.

273
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,520
Lan Que is here.

274
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,250
Do you want to check on her?

275
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,930
[Memorial tablet of Lan Que]

276
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,080
You killed her?

277
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,900
Are you sure you want to kill me?

278
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,390
You promise you won't hurt Mr. Xue?

279
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,160
Those who are poisoned by love poison

280
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,050
will die in the end

281
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,410
even if you don't meet for a lifetime.

282
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,240
Even if I let you go,

283
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,380
have you ever thought

284
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,980
what it would be like

285
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,830
when you are poisoned to death in front of him?

286
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,060
Keep an eye on her.

287
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,020
Yes.

288
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,210
Honey.

289
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,730
I was so scared today.

290
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,790
Those people humiliated me like this.

291
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,100
Does your chest still hurt?

292
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,010
It won't hurt if you touch it.

293
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,770
OK.

294
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,190
Let me touch it.

295
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,890
Director Lu, you are really smart.

296
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,170
If you don't want to fail at the last minute, keep acting.

297
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,840
Honey,

298
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,060
let's drink more.

299
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,160
Honey,

300
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
what are you doing?

301
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,020
Drink.

302
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,240
I don't drink.

303
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,630
I don't care.

304
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,650
Honey.

305
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,960
It's getting late.

306
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,640
Let's rest early.

307
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,790
What do you want now?

308
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,520
If we don't act it out,

309
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,040
how would those two outside the window buy it?

310
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,580
I don't care.

311
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,720
If you're drunk, go to bed.

312
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,400
Honey,

313
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,800
do I have to feed it to your mouth to drink?

314
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,560
What are you smiling about?

315
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,610
What did you hear?

316
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,590
I heard her calling him honey.

317
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,440
Can this prove that they are a real couple?

318
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,450
You're so naive.

319
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,750
You would fall for just a few words.

320
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,390
Then how to prove it?

321
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,660
My ears

322
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,670
exist

323
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,770
for real things.

324
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,290
If I don't get something real tonight,

325
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll make them get punished even more severely tomorrow.

326
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,580
What?

327
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,370
So exciting.

328
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,740
We've been married for so long.

329
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,130
What is with the sexy tricks?

330
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,430
Why are you not ashamed?

331
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,080
Look.

332
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,210
You broke the chair.

333
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,820
What are you doing?

334
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,530
Honey, please don't.

335
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,340
Let go of me!

336
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,950
-This is too real. -No!

337
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,670
Honey.

338
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,890
Let go of me!

339
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,990
Let's go.

340
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,550
What are you doing?

341
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,390
-Let's go. -Let go of me.

342
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,910
Am I stupid?

343
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,880
Why did I tell them about Liu Zhan's eavesdropping?

344
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,030
I should let Liu Zhan reveal that they are a fake couple.

345
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,130
Good for you, Lu Tingxiao.

346
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,270
What brother-in-law?

347
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,790
Now I'm pushed so far away.

348
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760

00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,650
Keep drinking.

523
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:34,990
Sir.

524
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,660
Take care.

525
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,930
Sir, madam,

526
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,020
we're closing.

527
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,080
A little longer.

528
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,870
A little longer.

529
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,090
OK.

530
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,050
Master.

531
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,770
Tomorrow

532
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,740
is the matchmaker meeting.

533
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,180
Do you want to go together?

534
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,200
Why should we go to the matchmaker meeting?

535
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
It must be crowded.

536
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,350
No.

537
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,450
Think about it.

538
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,880
What kind of people will go to the matchmaker meeting?

539
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,860
Those who pray for marriage.

540
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,520
Good for you.

541
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,110
You're indeed my disciple.

542
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,790
You've excelled your master.

543
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:15,640
Let's drink.

544
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,610
Here.

545
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,780
Let's go home after this.

546
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,260
Go back?

547
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,910
Let's stay longer.

548
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,100
What's wrong?

549
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,830
Are you in a bad mood?

550
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,560
Lu Tingxiao

551
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,780
upsetted you

552
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,130
again?

553
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,540
Actually...

554
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,220
Be careful.

555
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,700
Disciple.

556
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,370
Jing.

557
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,070
Lu Tingxiao.
