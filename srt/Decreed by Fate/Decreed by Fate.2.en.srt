But many girls have gone missing in Pingyang these days.

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,090
It seems this is a premeditated organization.

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,530
I'll send more people to investigate it.

She always brags that women should be independent and do business.

Her character is bad and methods are evil.

222
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,680
It is unprecedented.

It's called combining.

Why is Pingyang Newspaper so popular?

236
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,880
It's all because they combine well.

237

with so many people here?

526
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,300
Master.

527
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

528
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,960
My disciple,

529
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,230
can you help me again?

530
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,380
Since Master asked for it,

531
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,730
I will

532
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,910
do anything.

533
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,860

Get her!

Catch her!

536
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,580
I didn't expect my disciple to be so fit.

537
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,310
It's a pity that I didn't take more look.

How can we get out?

It's so embarrassing.

Where did this girl come from?

544
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,000
So pretty.

I've been waiting for you.

So what?

550
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,390
You don't like men?

Do you dare to tell me your name?

I'll destroy your whole family!

Yes.

579

Of course.

Speaking of director,

three months ago, you and your sister

609
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,260
claimed that the director was the first-class matchmaker

Why does Lu Tingxiao

613
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,650
-never show up? -I don't think he's here.

or...

Lu Tingxiao is just a cover?

621

That's right.

622
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,020

647
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,420
Seriously.

Besides,

649

you can't get away.

664

Sister, we can't let the government know.
