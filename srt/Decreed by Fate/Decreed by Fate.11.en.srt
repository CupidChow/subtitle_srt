00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,660
I found that they would send the women out of the city at midnight.

5
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,580
Just wait.

6
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,370
Hurry!

7
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,200
Stop!

Curfew outside the city.

9
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,740
Who allowed you to open the city gate?

10
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,260
This is brocade for the palace.

11
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,050
It was made urgently.

12
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,360
The county magistrate has asked to send it to the capital as soon as possible.

13
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,829
This is the pass document.

Since you have the document,

16

open the box.

17
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,150
After we check it,

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,240
you can leave the city.

19
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,960
You are the traitor.

20
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Leave now!

21
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,910
Arrest him!

22
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,800
Stop!

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,860
Yan Wu!

24
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,790
Don't chase him.

25
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,970
Save people first.

26
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,350
Don't move.

27
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,019
-Don't move. -Yes.

28
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,570
Behave yourself.

29
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,270
It's you.

30
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,800
Hong Yuanshan planned all of this.

31
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,730
Please spare my life.

32
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,780
Sure.

33
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,010
Swallow this.

34
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,520
Then I'll spare your life.

37
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,740
Be careful.

38
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,520
Be careful.

39
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,620
Cousin.

40
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,210
How are you?

41
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,260
Are you okay?

42
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,460
The rest of them are settled.

43
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,010
They'll be sent home tomorrow.

44
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,820
You finally found her.

45
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,060
It's not that simple.

46
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,830
These guys might have

47
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,300
sent these girls to the North Kingdom,

48
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,190
and trained them to be assassins

49
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,870
so that they could marry key officials of the North Kingdom.

50
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,980
They're quite ambitious.

51
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,170
Send her home as soon as possible.

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
I'll make a further observation.

53
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,650
Yes.

54
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,300
Don't kill me.

55
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,810
Don't kill me.

56

-Wanyi. -Don't kill me!

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,740
Don't be afraid.

59
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,540
You're safe now.

60
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,430
The doctor has been sent away.

61
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,160
He said she was fine.

62
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,120
She'll recover after resting for a few days.

63
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,130
Yan Wu,

64
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:30,930
take care of her.

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,190
Yes.

66
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,580
Jing.

67
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,650
Go take care of her.

68
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,120
I'll cook something for her.

69
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,140
Actually,

70
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,080
she is the girl on the portrait, isn't she?

71
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,760
Yes.

72
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,290
You came all the way to Pingyang from the capital

73
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,340
just to find her?

74
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,100
Yes.

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,940
Actually...

76
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,190
I'm not that petty.

77
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,710
She suffered so much.

78
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,600
It was normal to hug you when she was scared.

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
That girl

80
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
is my cousin.

81
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,640
My uncle

82
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,740
asked me to find her.

83
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,580
Don't get me wrong.

84
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,910
I have no other thoughts about her.

85
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,380
In a few days,

86
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,020
I'll ask Yan Wu to send her back to the capital.

87
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,340
Why did you explain so much?

88
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,020
I didn't ask.

89
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,300
Whether you ask or not,

90
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,650
I will tell you.

91
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,460
Because my heart

92
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,430
is with you.

93
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,220
She was terrified.

94
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,530
I’ll bring her a bowl of hot soup.

95
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,420
Jing,

96
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,680
you're not angry, aren't you?

97
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,890
I said I'm not that petty.

98
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,990
Remember to change the dressing later.

99
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,140
The wound is cracked.

100
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,580
I believe my wound will heal soon.

101
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,980
Don't fight before you recover.

102
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,790
Otherwise, your wound won't heal.

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,010
That's exactly what I want.

104
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,810
In this way,

105
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,660
you can apply medicine for me every day.

106
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,010
Shut up!

107
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,960
Jing.

108
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,350
Why are your hands so cold?

109
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,870
Don't interrupt.

110
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,790
My name is not Wenren Jing.

111
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,240
So what?

112
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,670
Don't you mind if I lied?

113
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,190
You also know

114
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,790
my name isn't Lu Tingxiao, don't you?

115
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,970
Do you mind?

116
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm actually Ye Rong'er, the daughter of Lord Lian.

117
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,530
I ran away to open a matchmaker hall in Pingyang

118
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,760
for my own divorce lawsuit.

119
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,630
No one dared to handle my divorce case as the emperor granted the marriage.

120
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,220
I could only do it myself.

121
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,410
And then?

122
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,020
And then...

123
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,000
I want to ask if you mind that I once got married.

124
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,310
If so,

125
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,120
from now on,

126
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,050
I won't pester you anymore.

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,610
What if I say I don't mind?

128
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,920
From now on,

129
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,640
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

130
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
But

131
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,970
I hate being cheated.

132
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,320
So I hope you won't lie to me.

133
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,860
Okay.

134
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,500
I won't lie to you.

135
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,280
In the future,

136
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,490
I won't trust anyone

137
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,340
but you.

138
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,190
Otherwise, I'll be struck by the lightening...

139
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,730
So you remember all the words I said

140
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,320
by the river that day?

141
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,190
Of course.

142
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,170
I've kept them in my mind.

143
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,710
Jing,

144
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,150
Actually, my identity...

145
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:46,750
Jing.

146
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,270
Jing!

147
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,280
Jing, what’s wrong?

148
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,690
All the doctors in Pingyang can't tell what disease she's got.

149
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,040
What happened to my sister?

150
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,800
Jing.

151
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,770
Please be fine.

152
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,950
Why does it look like...

153
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,540
Like what?

154
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,770
It's like the love poison.

155
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,620
Love poison?

156
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:11,910
Yes.

157
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
For those who are got poisoned by it,

158
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,820
every time they get emotional because of love,

159
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,160
the poison will go deeper.

160
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,720
At first, they just feel cold from time to time.

161
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,290
Then they'll look pale, and their eyebrows will get frosty.

162
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,420
They will faint from time to time.

163
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,180
In the end,

164
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,330
the love poison will enter the heart,

165
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,090
and they'll die as if they were frozen to death.

166
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,150
Faint easily.

167
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,960
Jing is in danger now.

168
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,050
Wanyi.

169
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,650
How did you know this poison?

170
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,450
When I was in the Baihua Brothel,

171
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,670
I was also poisoned by it.

172
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,610
This has something to do with the Hong family.

173
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,540
Ling,

174
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,720
take good care of her.

175
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay.

176
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,360
Hong Yuanshan that bastard!

177
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,860
[Hong's Mansion]

178
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,680
Hurry up!

179
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,440
Hurry up!

180
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,820
Hurry up.

181
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,060
Behave yourself.

182
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,470
I'm walking.

183
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,850
This way.

184
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,640
Go!

185
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,080
Don't push!

186
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,670
Go!

187
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,830
Lu Tingxiao.

188
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,850
No matter how much I like you,

189
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,150
if you're still calling other man's name,

190
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,160
I won't respond to you.

191
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,530
Lu Tingxiao!

192
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,900
Lu Tingxiao!

193
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Enough.

194
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,100
I'm Lu Tingxiao.

195
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:33,980
Sleep well.

196
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,230
How is it?

197
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,340
Hong Yuanshan disappeared.

198
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,470
I'll go check on Jing.

199
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,900
Director Lu.

200
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,470
Love poison can hurt when she get emotional.

201
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,120
As long as she gets emotional for love, it will kill her.

202
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,390
Before we find the antidote,

203
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,290
you'd better not meet my sister.

204
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,730
There's an extra bottle of wine.

205
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,790
Do you want some?

206
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,530
Ling is right.

207
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,730
I'd better not show up in front of her.

208
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,390
You want to leave the Boqing Hall?

209
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,050
Wanyi said

210
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,110
according to Jing's current symptoms, she can hold on for some days.

211
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,810
But as long as we get intimate, the poison will attack.

212
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,760
If I leave,

213
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,110
she can live for some more days.

214
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,870
And I can go find the antidote.

215
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,600
What's your plan?

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,840
I've checked.

217
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,740
Qin Yiyi is from the West Kingdom.

218
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,180
I've sent someone to check

219
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,410
the exit record of each city.

220
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,800
No matter what the cost is,

221
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,730
I will find her.

222
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,920
Okay.

223
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,440
I'll go to Baihua Brothel

224
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,830
to find out the truth of Wang Yizhi.

225
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,320
Fang Xianxun.

226
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,960
Can I trust you?

227
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,200
Director Lu, if you have a question,

228
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,180
why don't you make it clear?

229
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,050
The Yugou Token

230
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,650
was found by Jing among our clothes.

231
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,310
It's mine.

232
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,020
Don't you have anything to explain?

233
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,790
You know this token.

234
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,590
And you could mobilize the guards as well

235
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,110
to save those women.

236
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,370
Have I ever asked you for an explanation?

237
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,100
Fine.

238
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,570
I trust you.

239
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,040
I won't ask it anymore.

240
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,400
Whether we are enemies or friends in the future,

241
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,080
I will die without regret.

242
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,640
But the situation is different now.

243
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,500
If Jing gets hurt,

244
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,190
I won't let you get away with you.

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,940
If anything happens to her,

246
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,090
I'll prepare a coffin for you.

247
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,020
Okay.

248
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,550
Fang Xianxun,

249
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,780
can I ask you for a favor?

250
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,670
It's my job to look after her.

251
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm not entrusted by you.

252
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,080
Aren't you afraid

253
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,590
I'll take her away?

254
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,890
You...

255
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
You are a righteous man clearly.

256
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,440
Why do you always pretend to be a bad guy?

257
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,190
Don't try to get close to me.

258
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,589
I'm not a kind person as you think.

259
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,940
I might stab you in the back.

260
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,569
Please take care of Jing.

261
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,700
But

262
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,260
if you wear a mask for too long,

263
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,480
it'll be stuck to your face.

264
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,740
Goodbye.

265
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,450
Hey!

266
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,790
If she asks about you tomorrow,

267
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,760
what should I say?

268
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,230
That's your business.

269
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,930
It's strange. Why did my eyebrows turn white?

270
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,700
Cover it.

271
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,720
When did I fall asleep last night?

272
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,820
I feel like I slept for a long time.

273
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,420
Lu Tingxiao,

274
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,150
you usually drink tea or read books for leisure.

275
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,120
Your horizon is not broad enough.

276
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,720
How about I take you to the Lantern Festival in a few days?

277
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,270
No.

278
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,790
It's too rude.

279
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,330
Mr. Lu,

280
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,090
there will be a lantern festival in a few days.

281
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,190
Do you want to...

282
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,920
Too pretentious.

283
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,330
Director Lu,

284
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,480
let's go to the Lantern Festival to distribute leaflets and get some business.

285
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,120
Good, Lu Tingxiao.

286
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,550
Where did you go so early in the morning?

287
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,280
Dear disciple.

288
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,670
Have you seen Lu Tingxiao?

289
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,410
No.

290
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,010
Sister.

291
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,690
Who are you angry with?

292
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,540
I'm not angry.

293
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm cutting the vegetables for you.

294
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,690
Where's Lu Tingxiao?

295
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,670
I don't know.

296
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,280
You just woke up.

297
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,650
How about

298
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,790
sitting there for a rest?

299
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,880
No need.

300
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,320
I'm full of energy now.

301
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,210
If you need to kill chicken or fish, leave it to me.

302
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,830
I can also kill people.

303
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,800
My lord.

304
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,970
Come in.

305
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,660
My lord.

306
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,550
How is it going?

307
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,230
Hong Yuanshan

308
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,450
was caught.

309
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,590
Oh?

310
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,990
The girls we abducted

311
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,250
have all been taken away.

312
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,930
I'm worried Hong Yuanshan

313
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,570
will reveal the secret that we trained female killers

314
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,630
and asked them to infiltrate into

315
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,800
the South Kingdom.

316
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,930
Don't let him have the chance to tell anyone.

317
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,470
Yes.

318
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,670
Once our organization is exposed,

319
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,530
both the North and South Kingdoms will not let us off.

320
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,030
I'm afraid Lin Xie

321
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,520
[Lin Xie has got to Pingyang. Be cautious.]

322
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,970
is up to no good.

323
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,690
Lin Xie.

324
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,550
General Wuchang of the North Kingdom.

325
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,400
You look terrified.

326
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,130
They haven't taken any action till now.

327
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,820
It means Lin Xie doesn't know that I'm the master of Chonglou.

328
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,080
Or...

329
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,440
I'm not sure.

330
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,140
So,

331
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,780
the troops around Hong's Mansion

332
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,950
belong to Lin Xie.

333
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,480
He shouldn't have brought troops to the South Kingdom.

334
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,960
Anyway,

335
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,350
he came for us.

336
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,700
Fortunately,

337
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,040
you made Hong Yuanshan become the scapegoat.

338
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,890
In that case,

339
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,440
should we leave now?

340
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,700
Fool.

341
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,810
If we withdraw now,

342
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,080
it's like confessing everything

343
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,760
and admitting we're guilty?

344
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,940
Yes.

345
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,170
Lu Tingxiao.

346
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,100
I saw you.

347
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,230
Come out.
