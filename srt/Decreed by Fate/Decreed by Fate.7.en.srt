They said I had a gift for being an actress.

The princess doesn't have to take the blame for her childhood jokes.

348
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,660
I've heard from old people in my family

349
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,820
people will become stars in the sky after they die.

350
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,220
They will see the ones

351
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,660
they miss in the sky.

352
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,620
I hope what you said is true.

353
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,940
It's just a fantasy.

354
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,340
But if the princess knows someone comforts her like this,

355
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,780
she will be very happy.

356

This is not okay.

No.

That's enough.

What have I done wrong?

384
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,410
Applying medicine on a man in the middle of the night.

385

Do you think I want to do this?

But I can't.

389
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,820
It's just a scratch.

390
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,410
You're a man. Don't pout at me.

I'm not acting it.

Don't you care about it?

I've checked.

403
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,380
They had poison in their teeth.

404
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,300
They committed suicide at the critical moment.

405
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,690
How cruel.

406
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,380
They must be a gang of outlaws.

407
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,810
But I don't know

what their real purpose was.

How could you talk to your savior like that?

413

I came to apply medicine for you in the middle of the night.

414

Why do you hold hands

415

with each other all the time?

416
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,450
We're not holding hands with each other.

We're entangled by a strange vine.

That's easy.

Got a cold?

521
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,700
It's you.

522
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,050
Dear husband.

523
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,020
Master.

524
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,140
A woman cannot serve two husbands.

525
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,570
Kiss!

526
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,340
Master, you got the wrong direction.

527
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,380
-If you keep talking nonsense, I'll... -I'm here.

528
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,260
I just want her to call me her husband. It's none of your business.

529
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,700
All beautiful men are my husbands.

530
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,300
[Wedding]

531
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,900
First of all,

532
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,980
this is the wedding of the three of us.

533
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,380
First, bow to heaven and earth.

534
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,140
Second, bow to your parents.

535
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,330
Bow to each other.

536
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,980
Why do you bow with him first?

537
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,580
Stop.

538
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,530
Listen to me.

539
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,130
This is how the three of us live.

540
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,900
Ah.

541
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,420
This is how the three of us bathe.

542
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,260
It's a bit embarrassing,

543
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,940
but I can only accept it.
