5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,070
Constable Zhang.

6
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
So you're from Chonglou.

7
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,510
Tell your master.

8
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,950
Watch his son.

9
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,430
Waiter.

10
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,330
Yes, sir.

11
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,390
Three people?

12
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,040
Check out.

13
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,220
Yes, sir.

14
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,350
We've pretty much bought everything the princess likes.

15
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,850
Let's go back.

16
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,660
The General's Palace must not be as comfortable as home.

17
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,010
-Besides, she may not be used to the stuff here. -Top one desserts.

18
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,700
This is her favorite.

19
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,590
-There you go. -This one.

20
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,920
Take care of the princess when you're with her.

21
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,810
Especially don't let her drink plum wine.

22
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,750
Otherwise,

23
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,160
she...

24
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,730
She's going to get drunk again.

25
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,700
This is good.

26
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,900
Take this one.

27
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,610
I'll beat you to death.

28
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,240
Stop!

29
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,890
Brat.

30
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,520
How dare you help this dog from the North Kingdom?

31
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
So what?

32
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,350
Don't you feel ashamed as adults

33
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,180
to bully such a child?

34
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,100
Come on.

35
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,740
Take it.

36
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,130
Thank you.

37
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,230
Thank you.

38
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,110
Aren't you in Pingyang?

39
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,410
Why are you here?

40
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,070
Yan Wu.

41
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,210
You are from the North Kingdom?

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,890
So what?

43
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,540
I didn't say anything.

44
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,420
Why do we divide the North Kingdom

45
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,940
from the South Kingdom?

46
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,750
Since you're from the North Kingdom,

47
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,340
why do you follow Director Lu?

48
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,730
Is he also from the North Kingdom?

49
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,050
During the war between the South and the North,

50
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,070
my parents

51
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,430
were both dead.

52
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,050
He saw that I was lonely,

53
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,690
so he kept me with him.

54
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,020
Well,

55
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,250
I have something to do.

56
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,750
Goodbye, Miss Ling.

57
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,940
Director Liu seems to have changed his attitude towards Boqing Hall recently.

58
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,210
Do you feel sympathy for Wenren Jing?

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,030
Who cares about that tumor Wenren Jing?

60
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,659
Then it must be the other one.

61
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,920
You…

62
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,960
There are even more reasons to kick Boqing Hall out of Pingyang.

63
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,160
What do you mean?

64
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,170
Think about it.

65
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,980
If Boqing Hall is gone,

66
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,670
Wenren Ling will have nowhere to go.

67
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,090
By then...

68
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,380
Wonderful.

69
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,860
Then I'll save her

70
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,340
and invite her over to my Yinshu Pavilion.

71
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,110
That's killing two birds with one stone.

72
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,640
Director Liu is really smart.

73
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,230
Okay.

74
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,770
The first step of the plan,

75
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,730
catch adultery in Boqing Hall.

76
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,440
Master,

77
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,159
have we been too idle recently?

78
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,800
Is there anything serious?

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,300
Yes.

80
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,200
Don't forget to attend the matchmaker party tomorrow night, Master.

81
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,390
Director Zheng has reminded me several times.

82
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,560
Well.

83
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,700
Who will hold it this year?

84
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,920
It's the newly opened Boqing Hall.

85
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,780
Master.

86
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,900
What's wrong?

87
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,630
Nothing.

88
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,240
My heart ached

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,670
when hearing the words of Boqing Hall.

90
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,810
Is there anything else?

91
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,580
Master will return to the capital in one month.

92
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm really worried by that time people will...

93
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,590
I'll return to the capital in one month.

94
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,320
I hope everything goes smoothly.

95
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,050
Lord Song.

96
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,890
Yes?

97
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
Your hands...

98
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,740
That's not the point.

99
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,810
Please help us find a widow named Zhu Xiuchun.

100
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,980
She lived in Pingyang ten years ago.

101
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,130
Now she is missing.

102
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,280
Who is Zhu Xiuchun?

103
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,780
She is Lan Que's biological mother.

104
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,409
I'm a matchmaker,

105
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,310
same as you guys.

106
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,010
I'm really not good at these things.

107
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,890
Call the police.

108
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,990
This is a strange thing.

109
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,570
It's not appropriate to report it to the police.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,740
So you mean...

111
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,240
We want you to check the household register

112
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,730
to see if she is still in Pingyang.

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,590
Lord Song has been in a good relationship with the county government.

114
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,620
It makes things easier if you ask them.

115
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,050
Since you're so determined,

116
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,270
do you have something on me?

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,370
We don't know that Lord Song has helped someone forge his identity.

118
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,190
We also don't know that you hid information for others.

119
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,320
Then you should enjoy your twilight years in peace.

120
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,350
Are you threatening me?

121
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,240
Yes.

122
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,610
Don't touch me.

123
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,780
Lord Song.

124
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,820
I want a divorce!

125
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,490
What nonsense are you talking about?

126
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,630
It's obviously I am divorcing you.

127
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,480
Lord Song has something urgent to do.

128
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,030
We're more professional for divorce.

129
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:37,679
Lord Song.

130
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,520
Come back soon.

131
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,010
Alas.

132
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,020
See you.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,340
Didn't Chairman Fang say

134
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,380
"Seven Out" doesn't apply to me.

135
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm divorcing peacefully,

136
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,550
not only from the husband's side.

137
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,950
You just want to get more property.

138
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
I'll never agree.

139
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,230
Let's go to Boqing Hall to hold a divorce ceremony.

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,630
No way!

141
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,830
They finally left.

142
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,880
Love

143
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,380
is too tiring.

144
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,000
Director Lu, they've left.

145
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,800
Stop pretending.

146
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,110
Behave yourself.

147
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
It doesn't look appropriate.

148
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,290
Sit down.

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,550
Get me a grape.

150
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,190
Wipe it.

151
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,550
Tea.

152
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,760
I never thought

153
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,940
it would be this hard

154
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
to be served by handsome men.

155
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,720
I can't even go to the toilet.

156
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,900
It's hard for us, too.

157
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,030
Though we still have one hand free,

158
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,420
we can't go either.

159
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,230
I found what you wanted.

160
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,540
[Zhu Xiuchun]

161
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,160
This is hard to find.

162
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,330
If I hadn't invited the magistrate for tea,

163
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,970
well, I wouldn't have...

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,720
We should all thank the magistrate, right?

165
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,320
Yes.

166
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,160
Ouch.

167
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,820
Master.

168
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,040
Master.

169
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,420
My heart ached again.

170
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:17,930
Alas.

171
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,430
Sit down.

172
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,960
What's going on?

173
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,810
Are you entangled by my earth vine?

174
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,210
How can we untie this earth vine?

175
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,220
It will be untied when it should be.

176
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,410
Where is the person I asked you to find?

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,310
She's dead.

178
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,330
You lied to me.

179
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,230
Why would we lie to you?

180
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,070
It's written clearly on the paper

181
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,210
that she hung himself.

184

They said as long as I stayed in the North Kingdom,

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,890
they would guarantee my mother's safety.

186
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,290
I could come back to visit her after I succeeded.

187
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm finally back.

188
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,860
Have they been

189
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,170
lying to me?

190
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,300
Let me ask you.

191
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,150
Is Chonglou a spy agency of the North Kingdom?

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,370
Who else do you have in Pingyang?

193
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,590
I am gonna kill them!

194
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,240
Hey!

195
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,840
Untie the earth vine!

196
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,860
Go after her.

197
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,590
Go to Pingyang.

198
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
We have to untie this quickly.

199
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,350
When we were walking on the street,

200
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,360
everyone was looking at us as if we were monsters.

201
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,380
I just want to know

when I can go to the toilet.

look at me.

205
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,970
Look at Director Lu then.

206
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,750
How come we can endure this

207
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,950
but you can't?

208
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,460
Hey.

210
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
Can you stay still?

211
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,830
We knew it!

212
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,720
We caught you.

213
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,090
Chairman Fang,

214
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,990
Excuse us.

215
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,840
A chairman, a director,

216
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,060
and a matchmaker.

217
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,770
What an eyesore.

218
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,050
The three of you are doing the strapping again.

219
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,560
How shameless you are.

220
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,330
Shameless!

221
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,800
What's wrong with you two?

222
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,600
Boring.

223
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,150
Get out!

224
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,750
What a pity!

225
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,060
Let's drag them to the street.

226
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,270
Let the people in Pingyang see how promiscuous Boqing Hall is.

227
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,630
Don't come forward!

228
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,220
What are you doing?

229
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,560
-Stay back! -How can we get out?

230
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,570
Take off your hands.

-Take off your hands! -Get out!

232
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,010
I want it.

233

No.

234
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Why is it untied?

235
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,070
What?

236
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:47,960

refer to 24 hours.

240
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,460
It will be untied in 24 hours.

241
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,950
Who said we were promiscuous?

242

No.

No.

244
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,420
You misunderstood.

245
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,000
You said you would drag us to the street

246
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,710
and let people watch us.

247
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
Did you say that?

248
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,260
No.

249
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,950
I didn't say anything.

250
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,920
Shall we let them see this?

251
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,350
OK.

252
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,810

-Come and play a new game!
-We caught them committing adultery.

Bah! You fool!

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,900

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,720
Is Qin Yiyi crazy?

264
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,160
She's entangled in a mess with a poor scholar.

265
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,680
Yiyi loves talents.

266
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,610
I heard that the scholar is knowledgeable.

267
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,290
Maybe he'll pass the official examination someday.

268
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,020
That's something to fool those poor scholars.

269

How many of them can pass the official examination?

270
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,420
It's better to be a concubine for someone who's rich and powerful.

271
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,090
Yiyi said those rich and powerful people only treat prostitutes as toys.

272
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,190
They won't treat them seriously.

273

Yiyi. Yiyi.

You sound like you are close to her.

275

Why didn't she introduce you to more clients?

276
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,750
This is what Yiyi's clients gave me.

277

Try it.

278

All you know is eating.

282

When you're as fat as a pig, no client will come to you.

283
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,070
You never plan for yourself.

284
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,120
I don't have to work if no client comes to me.

285

Isn't it good?

-Go. -Let go of me.

What do you mean?

319

Although his father, Master Hong, kept a low profile,

320
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,520
everyone knows that the Hongs is very rich in Pingyang.

He wants to marry her as a concubine.

Who is the officer?

332
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,210
I don't care.

All I want is Qin Yiyi.

Aren't you engaged?

335
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,370
What?

336
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,070
Didn't your father teach you well?

337
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,780
I knew you sent Wang Zhen to my house to tell on me.

338
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,760
My father is a good man.

339
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,070
Even if he listens to you,

340
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,250
I won't.

341

Who let you in?

343
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,610
I let her in.

344
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,970
Let me pour you some wine.

345
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,590
Have a seat.

346
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,490
What's your name?

347
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,930
You can call me Qingqing, Mr. Hong.

348
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,750
What's so good about Qin Yiyi?

349
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,180
She's always like a piece of wood.

350
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,770
She only knows how to piss off people.

351
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,220
You're right.

352
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,110
Send the gorgeous girl to my house.

353
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,040
What's wrong?

354
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,820
We'll talk about

355
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,860
Qin Yiyi later.

356
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,600
I want her.

357
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,870
Let's go now.

358
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,780
Let's go.

359
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,290
Master Wang.

360
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,100
I'll take good care of Mr. Hong.

361
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,350
-I'm going to live a good life. -Qingqing, where are you going?

362
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,320
You should have cared more about me.

363
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,070
Take off your hands.

364
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,880
-What's going on? -Let's go.

365
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,430
Qingqing.

366
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,520
Another reckless guy.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,350
[Boqing Hall]

368
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,810
Yan Wu.

369
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,780
Sir,

370
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,420
you're back.

371
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,980
Did you bring back the stuff?

372
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,270
Yes.

373
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,660
I put them in the woodshed for now.

374
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay.

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,550
I heard some news when I went back this time.

376
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,170
I heard that the Governor of Lin State was punished because he was connected to the North Kingdom.

377
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,050
His whole family was executed.

378
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,940
But strangely,

379
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,720
the concubine he just married to a few months ago

380
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,770
disappeared mysteriously.

381
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,880
The richest man of the capital, He Wansan, seems to get involved, too.

382
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,090
His whole family was exiled.

383
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,020
Similarly,

384
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,820
one of his concubines disappeared mysteriously.

385
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,290
I heard

386
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,230
these two concubines seem to know martial arts.

387
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,360
It's confirmed that

388
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,550
they all came from Chonglou.

389
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,870
By the way,

390
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,980
find out who Fang Xianxun is.

391
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,390
Something is wrong with him.

392
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,620
Yes.

393
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,340
The people I sent to follow

394
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,600
lost the target

395
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,310
when they came nearby.

396
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,460
Send more men

397
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,640
to search this area carefully.

398
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,700
Yes.

399
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,890
Be careful.

400
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,050
Excuse me,

401
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,190
have you seen a girl in blue clothes

402
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,280
with a scar on her face?

403
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,160
No.

404
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,050
Miss,

405
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,020
have you seen someone...

406
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,520
-No. -Sir.

407
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:21,980
A bowl of sugar water.

408
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,490
Okay.

409
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,690
My disciple.

410
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,330
You said you wanted to find Lan Que.

411
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,060
Now you're sitting here drinking sugar water.

412
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,940
What do you mean?

413
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,070
Well,

414
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,750
We've been busy all day.

415
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,190
This is for you.

416
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,890
This is good.

417
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,630
Find him quickly.

418
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,520
We still need to prepare the matchmaker party in two days.

419
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,170
We'll find him.

420
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,360
But how long are you going to keep searching like this?

421
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,180
We need to find someone who's well-informed

422
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,530
and hangs around on the street all day long.

423
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,130
For example...

424
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,290
Oh.

425
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,940
The news will be explosive if I write it out today.

426
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,580
Hi, you two nosey parkers,

427
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,920
how have you been?

428
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
How's everything going?

429
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,330
Oh.

430
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,970
It's you, Miss Jing.

431
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,760
Well,

432
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,320
last time, we wrote about you like that.

433
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,620
We didn't mean it.

434
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,440
We didn't want to write anything about Miss Jing.

435
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,480
Director Liu forced us to write like that.

436
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,450
That's right.

437
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,570
Take off your hands.

438
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,990
Are you asking about the corpse found in this morning?

439
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,790
No.

440
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,920
A female body was found by the riverside this morning.

441
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,800
There were wounds all over her body.

442
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,740
She got strangled on her neck.

443
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,300
But then again...

444
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Wringing the neck from the back

445
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,900
is a usual trick that assassins from the North Kingdom would use.

446
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,960
The body was found naked.

447
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,640
The government has blocked the passage of the message.

448
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,250
They just put a portrait on the city gate and called on her family to identify her.

449
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,980
Well...

450
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:07,440
Well...

451
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,370
Hey.

452
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,250
You want to leave?

453
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,170
No, no, no. Look.

454
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,930
Guys,

455
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,480
I've told you the news.

456
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,370
Can we leave now?

457
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,350
Of course...

458
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,690
No.

459
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,750
We're not asking about the body.

460
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,800
You just talked about it voluntarily.

461
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,720
You...

462
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,360
I want to ask

463
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,340
whether you've heard of a girl named Lan Que.

464
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,430
Miss Lan?

465
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,660
Yes, I know her.

466
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,740
Master Hong.

467
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,290
What's wrong?

468
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,210
Master Hong.

469
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,760
As Wang Yizhi said,

470
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,360
we've been targeted recently.

471
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,190
Tell them to be careful.

472
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,960
Don't let anyone catch us.

473
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,200
It's a servant from the Eastern City.

474
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,670
But he's very skilled at martial arts.

475
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,010
I'm no match for him.

476
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,600
I was...

477
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,180
Wang Yizhi is targeting at Young Master.

478
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,980
I'm afraid he'll harm Young Master.

479
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,850
Wang Yizhi is cunning.

480
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,770
What about the girl who was brought back from the Baihua Brothel?

481
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,070
We've handled it.

482
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,460
She was thrown to the riverside outside the city.

483
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,160
Alas.

484
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,750
Sorry.

485
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,470
Sorry.

486
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,910
Sister, I'm back.

487
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,560
Butler Lv asked me to bring you a lot of things.

488
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,730
Where is he?

489
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,450
This is the place the nosey parkers mentioned.

490
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,420
Master.

491
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,100
Be careful.

492
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,700
No wonder it's hard to find her

493
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,840
since she hides in such a remote place.

494
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,510
Miss Lan Que.

495
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,820
Stop hiding.

496
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,030
We're here to help you.

497
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,920
Watch out for the trap.

498
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:28,980
Master.

499
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,940
Are you alright?

500
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,470
Help!

501
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,390
Help!

502
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,440
Master, don't move.

503
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,700
Hold the cage.

504
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,920
Keep breathing.

505
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,810
No.

506
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,280
If I were outside the cage,

507
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,840
-I might be able to open this iron cage. -I can't swim.

508
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,050
But now I'm inside.

509
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,240
-I can't use my full power. -The water is rising too fast.

510
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,580
What are you doing?

511
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,970
Give me a hug.

512
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,760
At this time,

513
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,980
you still have the mood to joke?

514
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Master, listen to me.

515
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,890
My feet got stuck.

516
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,040
If the water keeps going up, we'll all be dead.

517
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,310
I'll hold you up.

518
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,900
You hold on to the cage.

519
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,930
Hang in there. You might be able to wait until someone comes to save you.

520
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,650
Where do you get stuck? I'll untie it.

521
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,540
Left foot or right foot?

522
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,710
Are you hurt?

523
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,150
You can't swim.

524
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,740
Don't go down there.

525
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,550
Besides,

526
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,620
it might be okay.

527
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,810
No.

528
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,570
-I have to go down there and untie you. -Master!

529
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,500
-Let go of me! -Master!

530
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,920
-Wenren Jing! -Let go of me!

531
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,680
Look at me.

532
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,140
I've been alone for more than ten years.

533
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,330
I thought I was free.

534
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,290
After I met you, I found these years were so boring.

535
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,780
After today,

536
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,050
I'll take a position in your heart.

537
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,090
You won't forget me even when you get married.

538
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,280
I'm such a selfish person.

539
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
Shut up!

540
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,310
Shut up!

541
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,530
Get up!

542
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,620
Get up.

543
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,610
It's a deal.

544
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,940
Don't forget me.

545
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,250
My disciple.

546
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:05,760
My disciple.

547
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,190
Get up.

548
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,610
Fang Xianxun.

549
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,670
Fang Xianxun!

550
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,730
Help!

551
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,890
Help us!
