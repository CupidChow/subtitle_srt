00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,510
Suddenly talking about the general,

350
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,460
it scared me.

351
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:32,960
Sister.

352
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,780
I'll wash it.

353
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,110
Okay.

354
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,260
What is this?

355
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,620
Let me see.

356
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,860
Isn't this

357
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,220
Yugou Token?

358
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,590
Is it the informant organization that master was ordered to set up?

359
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,180
Yes.

360
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,260
The informant organization made a lot of contributions.

361
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,790
But many clues were lost after my father died.

362
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,900
The current leader is called

363
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,140
Qin Zhao,

364
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,600
nicknamed Princess Xiangxiang.

365
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
He's good at disguise and kung fu

366
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,260
and always acts mysteriously.

367
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,520
Princess Xiangxiang.

368
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,580
Is that a girl?

369
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,600
We don't know how he got the nickname.

370
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,500
That means

371
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,020
one of the two drunk people

372
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,540
could be Qin Zhao?

373
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,060
Not necessarily,

374
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
but one of them must be from Yugou's.

375
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,740
You don't know.

376
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,860
Lu Tingxiao was drunk

377
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,170
and said he was a general.

378
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,370
Fang Xianxun also said he was a general.

379
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,160
Although they were drunk, I was worried.

380
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,540
Which clothes did it drop out of?

381
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,870
I didn't see it clearly.

382
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,740
How about this?

383
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,070
Ling,

384
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,860
go back to the capital secretly

385
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,660
and see what's going on with Yin Sishen.

386
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:47,990
Okay.

387
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,780
Liu Zhan,

388
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,740
you're the most outstanding and promising.

389
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,460
Don't be distracted by that witch.

390
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,060
Don't be distracted by that witch.

391
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,500
Young master, have some snacks.

392
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,180
Miss Ling.

393
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,460
Miss Ling.

394
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,400
You finally understand my feelings.

395
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,770
Let go.

396
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,180
Let go!

397
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,560
What are you doing?

398
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,340
Young master.

399
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,180
Miss Ling.

400
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,980
Young master.

401
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,180
Young master.

402
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,170
Young master.

403
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,690
It's me.

404
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,740
Young master.

405
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,820
Young master.

406
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,140
-My eyes. -What's wrong?

407
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,730
My eyes.

408
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,100
-My eyes. -My eyes.

409
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,580
My eyes.

410
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,730
My eyes!

411
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,300
Wait here, Young master.

412
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,940
I'll get a doctor.

413
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,400
My eyes.

414
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,050
My eyes.

415
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,220
My eyes.

416
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,620
Director Liu,

417
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,300
please let me go.

418
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,220
I've been here for hours.

419
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,540
You can't leave.

420
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,510
You haven't cured my eyes.

421
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,620
Your eyes are perfectly fine.

422
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,380
Why are you making things difficult for me?

423
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,230
Impossible.

424
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,820
I can be the No.1 matchmaker in Pingyang

425
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,530
thanks to my eyes.

426
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,900
In the crowd of people,

427
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,540
I can see good matches with just a glance.

428
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,140
But now,

429
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,650
I actually find someone who has always been annoying very pleasing.

430
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,620
There must be something wrong with my eyes.

431
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,690
Take a look.

432
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,740
My eyes.

433
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,660
Oh.

434
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,990
I'm not good at this.

435
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,620
I can't cure you.

436
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,240
Well.

437
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,800
Please find someone else.

438
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,540
Doctor Li.

439
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,150
What happened to my young master?

440
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,820
His eyes are fine.

441
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,260
What?

442
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,250
What's wrong?

443
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,980
What's wrong with me?

444
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,780
Why are my eyes broken?

445
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,860
Father,

446
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,970
I haven't honored my ancestors yet.

447
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,860
I can't accept it.

448
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,270
So, as long as they are beautiful,

449
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,220
two men together can be pleasant to watch.

450
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,430
Let's get down to business.

451
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,700
How should we verify it?

452
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,320
In terms of kung fu,

453
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,140
they are almost the same.

454
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,060
Good at disguise.

455
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,380
Disguise.

456
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,540
I guess not.

457
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,210
It smells good.

458
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,970
I was wondering why a man's nickname is Princess Xiangxiang.

459
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,340
Could it be...

460
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,300
Lu Tingxiao,

461
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,930
you're hiding quite well.

462
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,260
It hurts.

463
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,840
Does it still hurt?

464
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:12,940
Yes.

465
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,700
Director Lu.

466
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,100
Don't you have anything to say to me?

467
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,640
About what?

468
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,500
Let me ask you again.

469
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,540
Are you Lu Tingxiao?

470
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,830
Didn't I tell you last time?

471
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,580
No.

472
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,660
Then who are you?

473
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,740
You are Qin Zhao,

474
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,180
right?

475
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,620
Why do you have this?

476
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,860
It fell from your coat.

477
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,750
You are really Qin Zhao.

478
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,900
What secret mission did you come to Pingyang for?

479
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,620
Since it's a secret mission,

480
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,750
how could I tell you?

481
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,300
No wonder you look so kind.

482
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,980
So you are Qin Zhao.

483
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,500
You know me?

484
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
We have some connections.

485
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,500
Did Lord Lian teach you how to disguise?

486
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,980
What kind of mission did he assign you?

487
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,060
Were you close?

488
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,310
Do you have a way to defeat the enemy with one move?

489
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,620
Disguise.

490
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,430
Lan Que also knows how to disguise.

491
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,620
But Lan Que is from Chonglou.

492
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,380
This jade token and Chonglou...

493
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,820
Chonglou.

494
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,790
Director Lu.

495
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,780
Tell me about Lan Que.

496
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,780
What?

497
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,900
My head aches.

498
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,260
Yes.

499
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,060
Someone!

500
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,940
Someone!

501
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,690
Someone!

502
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,580
Could Lu Tingxiao

503
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,220
clear Boqing Hall out when I was drunk?

504
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,810
Atishoo!

505
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,480
Do you know her?

506
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,600
You are from Chonglou.

507
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,910
Where did you take these girls?

508
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,790
Miss Lan Que,

509
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,730
I saw you pleading for Qu Liuyun and her mother that day.

510
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,930
You're not a villain.

511
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,980
All the women's families are anxious.

512
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,060
Can you help them?

513
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,260
Find a widow named Zhu Xiuchun in Pingyang.

514
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,360
Bring her to me.

515
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,980
When I see her,

516
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,550
I will tell you everything.

517
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,500
Hey.

518
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,160
Qu Liuyun is in danger.

519
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,100
After that,

520
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,340
burn down the house.
