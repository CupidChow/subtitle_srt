No.

37
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,930
Because

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
he's gonna go back to the capital with me

39

He'll get tired of you after a while.

Once the passion has subsided,

50

Can you stop scaring me with a knife?

177
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,070
She is indeed poisoned by the love poison.

178
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,460
And the poison has entered her heart.

179
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,140
Even if she doesn't see her lover, she won't live long.

180
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,670
Then give her the antidote.

181
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,950
Antidote?

182
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,010
There is no antidote.

183
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,940
What did you say?

184
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,620
Yet I have a way to solve it.

185
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,840
But it's hard to find the materials.

186
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,390
It can only control the poison temporarily.

187
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,200
We'll get you whatever you need.

188
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,050
The ten-thousand-year ginseng and the heartless herb.

189
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,560
They are both hard to be found.

190
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,360
Ten-thousand-year ginseng...

191
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,600
Where can we find the ten-thousand-year ginseng?

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,560
That's why I said

193
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
it's hard to get them.

194
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,480
Is the heartless herb

195
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,970
the legendary one that grows in the Western Poison Forest?

196
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,910
Brat,

197
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,110
you really know a lot.

198
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,390
That's the one.

199
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,150
However,

200
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,200
no one ever got out of the Poison Forest alive.

201
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,420
How can we find them?

202
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,400
Why has no one ever got out of there alive?

203
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,610
You have no idea

204
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,910
how extremely scary that Poison Forest is.

205
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,110
Basically, you get in but never get out.

206
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,370
They all know that the heartless herb is precious.

207
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,540
Some have tried to get it.

208
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,520
But it is in the deepest part of the Poison Forest

209
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,820
where is full with various poisonous insects, herbs,

210
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,750
and poisonous snakes and pythons.

211
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,800
Don't go there,

212
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,090
or you'll lose your lives for nothing.

213
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,890
Besides that,

214
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,490
is there any other way to detoxify?

215
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,810
I'm hungry.

216
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,070
Give me some good wine and dishes.

217
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,400
I might remember something when I'm full.

218
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,840
Where is

219
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,390
my Young Master?

220
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,480
He's dead.

221
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,340
I'll kill you if you keep talking nonsense.

222
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm not talking nonsense.

223
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,860
How did he die?

224
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,790
He got poisoned.

225
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,160
Wang Yizhi, how dare you lie to me?

226
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,590
Chief Feng.

227
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,690
What happened?

228
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,540
Wang Yizhi

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,260
was kidnapped.

230
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,250
I'll go get the doctor.

231
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,040
Flowers match the beauty.

232
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,640
-Even the Wanbao Shop doesn't have the ginseng. -Ling, long time no see.

233
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,700
Where can I find this precious stuff?

234
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,430
Should we go back to the capital?

235
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,840
-We might find it there. -I picked this rose.

236
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,810
Specially for Ling.

237
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,690
Ling.

238
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,950
God bless my sister. I hope she will stay safe and healthy.

239
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,880
Do you like it?

240
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,500
It hurts.

241
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,340
Director Liu.

242
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
My shoulder is dislocated.

243
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,530
Why are you here?

244
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,930
It hurts.

245
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,160
Young Master.

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,710
I'd better call a doctor.

247
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,240
It hurts.

248
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,570
Look over there.

249
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,040
Young Master.

250
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,840
It hurts.

251
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,010
It hurts so much.

252
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,720
It's done.

253
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,770
Try to move it.

254
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,770
No, it's not okay.

255
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
It's dislocated.

256
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,600
I can't move.

257
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,340
What are you doing?

258
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,250
You...

259
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,110
Don't throw it.

260
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,020
This is my treasure.

261
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,700
Young Master.

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,460
You're recovered now.

263
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,660
It doesn't hurt anymore.

264
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,590
It doesn't hurt anymore.

265
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,830
Ling.

266
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,890
You're really good at it.

267
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,800
Let me treat you

268
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,490
to a meal at Jufu Restaurant.

269
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,090
You're welcome.

270
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,970
I have something to do.

271
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,600
See you.

272
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,320
You don't like it?

273
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
Tea House?

274
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,670
Lanyue Pavilion?

275
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,970
You like Lanyue Pavilion?

276
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,100
Director Liu, you are knowledgeable.

277
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,430
Do you know where I can find the ten-thousand-year ginseng?

278
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,140
Director Zheng.

279
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,640
Please.

280
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,730
Tell me.

281
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,710
Why did you invite me here?

282
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,120
Director Zheng.

283
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,570
How's it going with you?

284
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,510
Just cut to the chase.

285
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,400
Earlier,

286
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,430
I heard you brag that there was a ten-thousand-year ginseng at your home

287
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,890
and no one appreciated it.

288
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,510
Is it true?

289
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,820
Of course.

290
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,730
What do you mean by 'brag'?

291
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,130
Go to the capital and ask around.

292
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,070
What those nobles have

293
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
are merely the one-thousand-year ginsengs.

294
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,140
In terms of the ten-thousand-year ginseng,

295
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,470
I'm afraid I'm the only one in the world...

296
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,630
Director Zheng,

297
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,240
do you really have the ten-thousand-year ginseng?

298
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,170
Why did ask if you don't believe me?

299
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,220
I do.

300
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,190
I believe you.

301
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
I'm just curious.

302
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,170
How did you get

303
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,030
the ten-thousand-year ginseng?

304
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,040
None of your business.

305
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,290
Why are you here?

306
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,180
Director Zheng,

307
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,100
can you sell it to me?

308
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,160
I need it urgently.

309
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,920
It is said that ginseng is a life-saving medicine.

310
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,930
Why do you want it?

311
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,610
I...

312
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,210
She said it's for urgent use.

313
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,680
It's useless even if you keep it.

314
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,660
How about

315
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,870
you offer a price?

316
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,980
I haven't seen your tumor recently.

317
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,250
Did Wenren Jing

318
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,040
have some incurable disease?

319
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,270
I was right.

320
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,240
No way will I give you

321
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,690
the ten-thousand-year ginseng.

322
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,200
Wouldn't it be a win-win situation if Wenren Jing dies?

323
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,800
Let's not talk about this anymore.

324
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,330
Goodbye.

325
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,350
You...

326
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,020
Wait.

327
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,080
Director Zheng.

328
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,920
It's true that

329
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,490
Wenren Jing is annoying.

330
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,940
But

331
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,340
it's a matter of life.

332
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,100
Let's not

333
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,990
be so heartless.

334
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,800
Liu Zhan,

335
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,990
this is a good move.

336
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,930
You knew I wouldn't care about the tumor.

337
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,770
You deliberately do her a favor at this time.

338
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,300
After Boqing Hall is gone

339
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,710
and Wenren Jing dies,

340
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,840
all the people have to go with you.

341
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,640
That's wonderful.

342
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,860
Hey.

343
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,500
Don't talk nonsense.

344
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,230
Ling.

345
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,290
It's not like what he said.

346
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,980
I really want to help you.

347
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,520

There's a lantern show tonight.

353
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,090
Do you feel like hanging out?

354
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,000
Stop pulling a long face.

Look at all the lights.

It's interesting.

357
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,740
Cheer up.

358

It's more fun to watch the oil lamp at home.

No.

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,020

Otherwise, how can we face my sister?

382
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,730
Why did you treat Jing like this after I left?

383

I'm warning you.

got any better lately?

I thought everything would be fine

after Director Lu found a miracle doctor.

396

In the end,

397
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,360
the doctor used him to test the poison.

No one knows how poisonous the love poison is.

399
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,250
Will it get worse when she sees my face?

400
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Or

401
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,320
if I wear a mask,

402
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
can it alleviate her love for me?

403
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,460
Lu,

404
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,110
just analyze the situation,

405
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,240

Yes.

409

It's easier for me to chop you off.

410

You don't even need the antidote to the love poison.

413
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,870
It's not a good idea

for us to stay outside.

Will you only shut up after your skin is peeled?

423
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Why didn't you say anything?

Never.

436
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,140

445
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,570
Do something.

446
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,140
Ling, did you take part in their idea?

447
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,940
No.

448
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,080

449
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,940
I just came back from Lin State a few days ago.

450
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,270
I know nothing about it.

Explain what?

457
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,090
Are you trying to say

458
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,030
I have an incurable disease,

459
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,160
and you can only cure me if you hide from me?

It smells good.

496

Let's grill it for a little longer.

497
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,080
You cooked the roasted chicken for me last time.

498
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,430
I'll cook the grilled fish for you this time as a return.

There's no need to mention “return” between us.

Are you upset?

502
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,350
It's my bad.

503
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,890
I won't mention it again.

504
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,260
Jing,

505
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,280
why do you suddenly speak so cautiously?

506
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,560
I don't know why.

507
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,040
Recently, I just feel that life is too short and fast.

508
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,320
If I don't tell you about my feelings,

509
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,320
or if we don't do some things, it'll be too late one day.

510
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,830
Everything will be fine.

511
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,660
You're still comforting me.

512
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,320
I should be the one to comfort you.

513
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,310
Why did you say so?

514
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,970
Are you hiding something from me?

515
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,170
It seems that she doesn't know the truth yet.

516
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,900
That's good.

517
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,780
Jing.

518
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,840
If that's the case,

519
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,470
what are you going to do?

520
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,980
We can face it together.

521
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,120
Nothing can't be solved.

522
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Trust me.

523
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,310
I'm sorry.

524
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,190
I left without saying anything.

525
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,340
I made you worry.

526
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,440
So no matter what happens,

527
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,040
you have to tell me the truth.

528
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,380
I don't want to see you sad.

529
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,400
Men are always so strange.

530
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,670
You left without a word.

531
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,270
Shouldn't I feel bad?

532
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,670
If I were in trouble,

533
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,310
would you leave me and give up on me?

534
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,170
You wouldn't. Neither would I.

535
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,210
I know there are many difficulties in this world.

536
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,870
But as long as we are together,

537
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,770
I believe everything

538
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,850
will be solved smoothly.

539
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,010
Lu Tingxiao, you promised me

540
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,350
you won't lie to me.

541
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,660
What's wrong?

542
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:08,830
Jing.

543
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,740
I used to think I knew you well.

544
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,530
But now I think it's not enough.

545
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,490
Although I don't know what happened to you,

546
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,100
but if you don't want to talk about it,

547
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,500
I can also not mention it.

548
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,190
But no matter what it is,

549
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,640
I want to face it with you.

550
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,360
What is this?

551
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,230
Don't move.

552
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,840
[Let's eat osmanthus cakes together.]

553
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,780
Let's eat osmanthus cakes together,

554
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,250
eat candied haws together,

555
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,390
swing together,

556
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,020
ride horses together,

557
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,150
fly kites together,

558
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,670
and kiss until we fly.

559
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,820
What is this?

560
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,730
Nothing.

561
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,790
The fish is burnt.

562
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,270
I see.

563
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,970
These things should be what Jing wants to do with me.

564
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,700
Yes.

565
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,920
What's wrong?

566
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,180
I have a bad memory.

567
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,240
I'll write it down.

568
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,040
Laugh if you want.

569
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,340
I'm serious.

570
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,860
Jing.

571
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Why would I laugh?

572
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,040
I also have a lot of things I want to do with you.

573
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,040
Then,

574
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,810
I'll write down everything we like to do together.

575
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,770
Let's do them one by one.

576
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,680
How's that?

577
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,420
Great.

578
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,780
[Ling, please take the ten-thousand-year ginseng.]

579
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,000
Ling, please take the ten-thousand-year ginseng.

580
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,710
[Yinshu Pavilion]

581
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,990
The second on the wish list.

582
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,120
Fly kites together.

583
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,510
Hurry up.

584
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,370
The kite is flying so high.

585
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,310
Wait for me.

586
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,020
The kite fell down.

587
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,840
Let's make a bigger one later.

588
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,320
If you like this one,

589
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm gonna find it for you now.

590
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,770
Lu Tingxiao,

591
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,630
let's get married.

592
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,660
How can a woman propose?

593
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,160
Of course it's because she meets someone she loves very much.

594
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,980
It doesn't matter who proposes first.

595
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,470
Will you?

596
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,620
I do.

597
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,710
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

598
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,440
These flowers are simple.

599
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,140
I hope you don't mind.

600
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,720
But I've plucked up enough courage to ask you.

601
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,230
Do you like it?

602
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,230
Fool.

603
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,340
I like everything you give me.

604
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,150
If you don't treat me well,

605
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,340
I will divorce you.

606
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,920
My dear wife,

607
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,600
I won't give you this chance.

608
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,250
We still have a lot to do on your wish list.
