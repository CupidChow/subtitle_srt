How do you know the direction?

I've checked this morning.

6
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,660
Ant nests usually face the south.

7
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,140
Moss usually grows on the north side of the rock.

8
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,250
The trees are smooth on the south side,

9
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,420
and rough on the north side.

10

He can't speak.

138
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,620
You don't have to say anything if you can't.

139
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,820
Let me say something first.

140
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,340

141

Meanwhile,

143
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,820
OK.

144

Director Lu, have some of the vegetables.

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,220
Chairman Fang.

178
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,890
-I have a favor to ask... -Young master.

179
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,500
I found the person you asked me to find.

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,540
Is it alright?

181
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,460
Lu Tingxiao is so weird.

182
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,940
Yes, it's alright.

183
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,060
-He's all mysterious and stuff. -I know.

184
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,090
Thank you.

185
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,180
Goodbye.

186
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,570
Goodbye.

187
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,740
Goodbye.

188
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,820
Master.

189
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,540
Disciple.

190
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,700
I thought you are a swordsman based on your kung fu.

191
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,900
I didn't expect you to be the chairman of Pingyang Matchmaker Society.

192
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,140
I'll count on you from now on.

193
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,460
How can you say that?

194
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,580
How many drinks do you owe me?

195
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,660
We have to drink them one by one today.

196
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,490
Our director has a bad temper.

197
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,140
Please forgive him.

198
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
I can see that he has a bad temper.

199
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,220
Do you want me to teach him a lesson?

200
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,420
No need.

201
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,660
With my intelligence, I won't suffer.

202
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,180
But he has a few orders.

203
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,940
I want to...

204
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,820
You are ambitious.

205
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,260
You want to become a top-class matchmaker by these orders, right?

206
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,580
Yes, that's what I mean.

207
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,100
That's right.

208
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,530
Who am I?

209
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,500
Come with me.

210
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,180
Right.

211
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,210
You're the chairman.

212
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,340
You must have a lot more orders than me.

213
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,020
Wait for me.

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,250
[Yinshu Pavilion]

215
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,300
Young master, you gave Hong Zhong, the hot potato,

216
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,340
to the new chairman of the Matchmaker Society.

217
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,660
If he screws it up,

218
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,900
won't we get blamed by both sides?

219
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,140
You don't need to tell me.

220
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,220
-Do I not know it myself? -Young master.

221
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,420
Put it down.

222
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,500
Tell me,

223
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
what else can I do?

224
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,620
I can't screw it up myself.

225
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,740
Who should I hand it over to?

226
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,380
Boqing Hall or Zheng Lin?

227
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,580
They are not stupid.

228
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,600
Only the new chairman of the Matchmaker Society knows nothing.

229
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,260
Besides,

230
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,940
on the bright side,

231
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,580
if the chairman of the Matchmaker Society can't handle it,

232
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,770
it's not my fault.

233
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,620
But

234
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,870
Mr. Hong Zhong doesn't seem reasonable.

235
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,820
Shut up!

236
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,850
Or I'll beat you.

237
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,380
Are you afraid of the brothel?

238
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,300
-I'm only afraid that the girls are not pretty enough. -Take care.

239
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,690
We don't receive women here in Baihua Brothel.

240
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,460
You are a man dressed like a woman?

241
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,140
Sorry about that.

242
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,330
Everyone who comes here has a hobby.

243
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,370
Girls,

244
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,340
come welcome the guests.

245
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,020
Coming.

246
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,180
Give me the best private room

247
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,020
and the best wine.

248
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,580
No problem.

249
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,700
So this is the legendary courtesan of the West Kingdom?

250
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,780
Amazing.

251
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,180
Every twinkle and smile of her can be so impressive.

252
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,460
I thought girls like to envy,

253
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,140
but you are different.

254
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,180
Prejudice.

255
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,340
She's so beautiful.

256
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,180
I can't admire her enough,

257
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,900
why would I be jealous?

258
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,500
But you,

259
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,010
you don't even look at

260
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,940
such a beautiful courtesan.

261
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
You have no taste.

262
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,420
I just think you look much more beautiful than the courtesan.

263
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,530
You have an extraordinary taste.

264
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,540
Just like me.

265
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,020
But,

266
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,940
are we here to watch the dance?

267
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,180
Please have a seat, Miss.

268
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,890
Have a seat.

269
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,260
Wow.

270
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,860
Your hands are so tender.

271
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,580
How do you take care of them?

272
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,820
You must be joking, Miss.

273
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,500
Your hands are tender.

274
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,130
Both of ours are tender.

275
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,580
Miss, try our wine.

276
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,940
Okay.

277
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Drink with me.

278
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,060
Okay.

279
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,900
I'll drink with you.

280
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,260
Come on.

281
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,620
Liu Zhan said

282
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,380
Hong Zhong is here every day.

283
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,460
Why didn't I see him?

284
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,020
Liu Zhan?

285
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,140
I'll take my leave.

286
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,940
I don't want to get involved with that villain.

287
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,900
Miss.

288
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,140
I thought you would be happy after taking over Liu Zhan's order.

289
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,160
It seems that I was given the cold shoulder.

290
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,500
I, Wenren Jing, never do such despicable things.

291
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,500
Tell me in detail.

292
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,660
Good.

293
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,330
Good.

294
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,650
Good.

295
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,700
Qin Yiyi.

296
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,340
Miss Yiyi.

297
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,300
Master.

298
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,900
Lan Que,

299
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,140
do something for me.

300
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,580
Yes.

301
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,460
Miss Yiyi,

302
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,940
do you know how much I've spent on you?

303
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,940
She said she's only an entertainer, not a prostitute.

304
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,560
Do you really think I'm stupid?

305
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,620
Mr. Hong,

306
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,340
That's my promise with Mr. Wang.

308
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,610
How about I give you one more dance

309
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,740
as an apology?

310
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,860
How's that?

311
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,940
Did you hear that?

312
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,460
She wants to dismiss me with just one dance?

313
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,130
Fine.

314
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,420
Then,

315
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,620
how about a strip dance for everyone?

316
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,000
Great.

317
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,460
Waiter.

318
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,900
-You won't intervene? -Take it off.

319
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:34,900
If you don’t,

320
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
-I'll take it off for you. -His father is a famous philanthropist in Pingyang.

321
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,700
I have to show him some respect.

322
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,500
-Besides, as long as he doesn't go too far, -Stop!

323
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,400
-let him be. -Come on, Miss Yiyi.

324
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,860
Isn't that too far?

325
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,570
Stop!

326
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,140
Come on!

327
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,460
This is Hong Zhong?

328
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,040
Master.

329
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,660
Chairman Fang.

330
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,940
Hong Zhong, the son of the philanthropist, Mr. Hong.

331
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,020
He wants to marry Miss Qu.

332
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,380
Please, do the matchmaking for him.

333
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,780
Take it off,

334
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,220
and we are even.

335
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,860
Take it off!

336
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,500
Stop it!

337
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,650
Who was it?

338
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,210
Who shouted?

339
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,260
Me.

340
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,540
And me.

341
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,020
Who are you idiots?

342
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,580
Mr. Hong.

343
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,500
Mr. Hong.

344
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,260
Look carefully.

345
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
Who hit me?

346
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,290
What the hell?

347
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't even feel like drinking.

348
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,020
What are you looking at?

349
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,860
Beat them!

350
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,580
Beat them!

351
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,260
Disciple.

352
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:41,780
Go!

353
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,740
Miss.

354
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,210
Oh.

355
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,740
Are you okay?

356
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,810
Enough.

357
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,540
Stop...

358
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,060
Miss.

359
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,260
Thank you.

360
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,300
I haven't introduced myself.

361
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,540
I'm Wenren Jing,

362
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,940
specializing in matchmaking and divorce.

363
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,740
Matchmaking and divorce?

364
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,380
Yes.

365
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,700
Not only men can initiate marriage and divorce,

366
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,570
but also women.

367
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,380
You don't have to take things as they come,

368
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,460
and you don't have to wait until you are divorced to leave him.

369
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,900
But I'm also willing to

370
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,330
enable a good match.

371
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,420
No wonder you look so extraordinary.

372
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,140
You do have something more than ordinary girls.

373
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,860
What's that?

374
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,540
It's freedom and courage.

375
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,390
Master.

376
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,380
I'll take my leave.

377
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
I'll come back here to boost you some other day.

378
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,540
Is he the one you mentioned?

379
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,380
To be honest,

380
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,100
I just knew it myself.

381
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,780
We need to introduce such a beautiful girl

382
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,820
to this bastard.

383
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,580
Isn't this jeopardizing her?

384
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,380
So you mean...

385
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,620
It's better to break up ten bad marriages

386
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,660
than enabling a bad marriage.

387
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,980
If such a good girl falls into his hands,

388
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,580
it would be a severe sin.

389
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,330
However,

390
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,260
I heard that most of them who live in the south of the city are poor.

391
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,420
Why would a playboy like Hong Zhong

392
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,500
want to marry a poor girl?

393
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,060
There's something fishy about this.

394
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,700
We can only ask him ourselves.

395
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,660
Okay.

396
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,930
How long are you going to sleep?

397
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,660
Mr. Hong, you're awake.

398
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,340
Don't move.

399
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,780
Why do I feel like I got beaten up in my dream?

400
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,250
No way.

401
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,300
We've been guarding you, Mr. Hong.

402
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,740
No one could have beaten you.

403
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,540
Who are you?

404
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,810
This is the matchmaker from Boqing Hall,

405
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,260
a good friend of Director Liu.

406
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,140
Director Liu asked me

407
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,500
to deal with the marriage between Mr. Hong and Miss Qu.

408
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,340
How dare Liu Zhan let others handle it?

409
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,020
You are wrong.

410
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,100
This is the chairman of Pingyang Matchmaker Society.

411
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,500
With his help,

412
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,140
nothing could possibly go wrong with your marriage.

413
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,140
Are you new here?

414
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,420
Yes.

415
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
He looks familiar.

416
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,530
What do you think, Mr. Hong?

417
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,090
Fine.

418
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,780
Chairman it is.

419
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,780
As long as you get it done.

420
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,820
Don't waste time.

421
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,260
Get Qu Liuyun married to me.

422
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,090
Otherwise, I can't inherit the old man's property.

423
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,660
And neither of you can get paid.

424
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,330
I see.

425
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,660
Did I say something...

426
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,580
No, no.

427
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,690
We'll do it now.

428
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,820
He looks familiar.

429
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,060
I must have seen him somewhere.

430
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,140
So Hong Zhong has to get married first

431
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,340
to inherit the family business, right?

432
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,260
So he found Qu Liuyun, quiet and obedient,

433
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,580
who matches his fate.

434
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,540
But him being like this,

435
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,980
if Miss Qu marries him, there can't be anything good.

436
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,040
I also think it would be a disaster for her.

437
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,030
Why don't we not help Hong Zhong?

438
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,810
No. We should go.

439
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,140
Of course we should.

440
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,260
And we need to do it well.

441
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,740
Well, master,

442
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,460
how does Director Lu treat you?

443
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,460
He treats me so well

444
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,700
that I have to do all kinds of dirty work.

445
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,780
He said that when God is about to grant someone great responsibility, he would first frustrate his/her spirit and will.

446
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,180
I've suffered,

447
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,690
but he didn't grant me great responsibility.

448
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,500
Isn't that despicable?

449
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
I'm relieved then.

450
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,540
He bullied me,

451
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,220
and you feel relieved?

452
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,860
Is this how you care for your master?

453
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,690
It's my fault.

454
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,260
Let's go.

455
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,900
I'll buy your favorite osmanthus cakes to apologize to you.

456
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,620
You know I like osmanthus cakes.

457
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:08,980
Three.

458
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,010
-Four. -Okay.

459
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,140
I also want this one,

460
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,020
from the Zhang's.

461
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,100
Young master.

462
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,780
What are you doing?

463
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,500
I just came back.

464
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,140
You've been strolling for 15 minutes.

465
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,860
If you keep doing that, our threshold will be...

466
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,730
You've been staring at me for 15 minutes?

467
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,740
Do you have nothing to do?

468
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,500
-You're slacking off. -No.

469
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,420
You have no work?

470
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,290
Does it hurt?

471
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,100
Yes.

472
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,780
Why are you so careless?

473
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,460
It won't hurt if you hit me gently.

474
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,900
She saved me yesterday,

475
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,740
but she wouldn't even greet me today.

476
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,780
So annoying.

477
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,980
What's wrong with him?

478
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,380
Young master. Young master.

479
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,220
Excuse me, are you Miss Qu Liuyun?

480
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,380
Who are you?

481
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,700
We are matchmakers from Boqing Hall.

482
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,620
We're here to propose on behalf of Mr. Hong Zhong.

483
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,700
Sorry.

484
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,460
My mother is still sick.

485
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,170
I'm afraid she'll infect you,

486
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,660
so I can only let you sit outside.

487
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,940
It's fine.

488
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,460
Have you heard of Mr. Hong Zhong?

489
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,580
Are you talking about the son of Master Hong?

490
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,460
Yes.

491
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,540
I wonder if...

492
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,140
I do.

493
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,700
Are you sure?

494
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,500
Hong Zhong is a lecher.

495
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,140
He's a chairwarmer

496
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,620
and he idles around.

497
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,660
He bullies both men and women,

498
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,810
and always causes trouble.

499
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,900
He's definitely not a good match for me.

500
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,720
Miss...

501
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,460
Is that what you want to say, Miss?

502
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,380
Yes.

503
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,060
Didn't you come here to propose for him?

504
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,580
Why are you counting his shortcomings in front of me?

505
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,180
In other words,

506
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,450
you know Hong Zhong well,

507
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,030
but you still want to marry him.

508
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,610
My mother is severely sick.

509
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,260
All these years, we've spent all the money we have.

510
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,980
If I can marry into the Hong family,

511
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,700
my mother's illness will be cured.

512
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,770
We don't have to live in a room with a leak anymore.

513
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,090
Thank you for your kindness.

514
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,740
But I've made up my mind.

515
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,020
You can leave now.

516
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,020
Miss Qu, you're right.

517
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,420
But if you marry Hong Zhong, your life will be...

518
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,620
We understand what you mean, Miss Qu.

519
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,540
We'll tell the Hong family to prepare the betrothal gifts.

520
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,660
Thank you.

521
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,590
Miss Qu.

522
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,750
Hey.

523
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,340
Where's your dog, Miss Qu?

524
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,500
It died of illness a few days ago.

525
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,500
Let's go.

526
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,900
-I haven't finished yet. -Let's go.

527
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,820
Don't pull me.

528
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,810
-What are you doing? -Let's go.

529
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,420
-I haven't finished yet. -She doesn't welcome us.

530
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:07,690
You...

531
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,420
Let's go.

532
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,780
Officer,

533
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,980
please give me a few more days.

534
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,810
I will pay you back.

535
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,540
I will.

536
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,660
Where is the girl who was with you?

537
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,330
What girl?

538
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:29,900
I don't know her.

539
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,100
I sold her.

540
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,210
Where?

541
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,490
Stop!

542
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,210
Tell me.

543
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,380
Where did you sell her?

544
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,090
Chonglou.

545
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,300
What's going on?

546
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,780
Qu Liuyun is weird.

547
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,610
Right.

548
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,290
Who would risk her life's happiness?

549
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,420
No.

550
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,670
She has a thick callus only those who practice swordsmanship have.

551
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,060
And while she was talking,

552
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,710
her mom coughed a lot.

553
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,210
-She didn't care at all. -Miss.

554
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,700
Her dog chain

555
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,820
is a slipknot,

556
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,180
but it was cut by someone.

557
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,990
That means she doesn't have a dog.

558
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,960
That is to say,

559
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,180
Qu Liuyun is not weird.

560
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,100
She is not Qu Liuyun at all.

561
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,500
The real Qu Liuyun may be in danger.

562
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,700
Let's go and have a look.

563
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,700
Don't starve all day long.

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,780
I'm warning you.

565
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,780
Live until the wedding is over,

566
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,610
or I'll kill Qu Liuyun

567
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,700
and let you reunite in the Netherworld.

568
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,500
Isn't she Qu Liuyun?

569
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,860
She looks exactly like her.

570
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,060
Master.

571
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,820
Hush.

572
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,900
She looks exactly like the painting.

573
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,740
How could she not be her?

574
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,380
Could it be...

575
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,980
Follow her out.

576
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,380
After I finish the task,

577
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,860
you must let her go.

578
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,300
What?

579
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,330
You think you are qualified to negotiate with me?

580
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,970
Should I call you Qu Liuyun

581
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,460
or Lan Que?

582
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,380
Master only asked me to pretend to be Qu Liuyun and marry Hong Zhong.

583
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,860
He didn't ask me to kill them.

584
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,060
You have no right to bargain with me.

585
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,220
Lan Que,

586
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,180
you've killed a lot of people, haven't you?

587
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,290
At this moment, you suddenly have sympathy.

588
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,100
Or is it that

589
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,740
seeing the mother and daughter

590
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,100
reminded you of the time when your mother sold you to Chonglou?

591
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,430
You said I could see my mother when I came back.

592
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,070
Where is she?

593
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,250
-Qu Liuyun is still alive. -When things are done,

594
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,660
-Save her first. -you'll see her.

595
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,380
I'll distract them.

596
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,860
Okay.

597
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,690
After him!

598
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,580
Miss.

599
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm here to save you.
