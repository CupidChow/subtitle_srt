[Episode 10]

4
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,090
What's wrong?

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,810
Are you in a bad mood?

6
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,590
Did Lu Tingxiao

7
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,759
make you

8
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,150
upset you again?

9
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
Actually...

10
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,200
Be careful.

11
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,680
My disciple.

12
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,389
Jing.

13
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,260
Lu Tingxiao.

14
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,690
Thank you, doctor.

15
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,350
Fortunately, it didn't hurt the organs.

16
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,610
But he lost a lot of blood.

17
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,620
He still needs to rest in bed for a few days.

18
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,760
This prescription replenishes blood and energy.

19
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,520
Three times a day.

20
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,910
The powder needs to be changed every day.

21
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,300
Thank you, doctor.

22
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,740
Please wake up.

23
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,970
I'm not used to it

24
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,900
when no one squabbles with me.

25
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,230
Why did you kill her?

26
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,630
She should die since she sent the letter for you.

27
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,360
If you don't want Mr. Xue to die,

28
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,210
let Wenren Jing take the love poison.

29
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,710
Why do you want to poison her with love poison?

30
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,610
Since Wenren Jing is so interested in Chonglou,

31
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
why don't you make her one of you?

32
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,660
Besides,

33
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,890
if no one replaces you,

34
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,920
what are you going to do with you and your Mr. Xue?

35
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,240
Are you sure

36
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,710
you will let us go if we poison her with love poison?

37
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,910
After she enters Chonglou,

38
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,589
I'll grant your wish.

39
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,670
Jing.

40
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,480
You're awake.

41
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,659
Does your wound still hurt?

42
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,630
Jing.

43
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,850
Are you okay?

44
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm fine.

45
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,870
How about you?

46
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,770
I'm fine.

47
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,280
That's good.

48
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,420
Otherwise, I owe you too much.

49
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,600
It hurts.

50
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,390
How do you feel besides pain?

51
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,840
I feel dizzy

52
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,810
and my limbs are weak.

53
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,740
Take a good rest.

54
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,040
Tell me if you need anything.

55
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,440
I want some water.

56
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,410
Okay.

57
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,210
I'll pour it for you.

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,450
I want to eat

59
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,540
the osmanthus cakes

60
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,920
from Jufu Restaurant.

61
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,650
I'll ask Ling to buy some for you.

62
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,030
This pillow

63
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,710
is uncomfortable to lean on.

64
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,140
Coming.

65
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,500
Do you feel better?

66
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,140
This is good.

67
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,690
Here.

68
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,870
Jing.

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,060
Are you not mad at me anymore?

70
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,710
That's different.

71
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,350
We'll talk about it when you're fully recovered.

72
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,400
Young Master.

73
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,080
Young Master.

74
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,010
You're finally awake.

75
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,280
Young Master.

76
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,870
I'm so worried about you.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,010
Look at your face.

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,580
Young Master.

79
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,580
Take the medicine then.

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,340
No.

81
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,670
Jing.

82
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,890
It's all your fault.

83
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,360
You should know

84
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,370
our young master has never been hurt for all the years.

85
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,460
Because of you,

86
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,390
our young master is hurt.

87
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,250
You have to take responsibility.

88
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,470
Well...

89
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,640
Fine.

90
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,070
I'll take responsibility.

91
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,700
Yan Wu.

92
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,500
Stop crying.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,090
OK?

94
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:36,970
Sure.

95
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,420
Let your young master take the medicine first.

96
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,560
-Okay? -You feed him.

97
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,100
Flowers!

98
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,060
Fresh flowers.

99
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,110
Are you blind?

100
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,560
I'll take the flowers.

101
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,870
Mr. Lu.

102
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,590
Take it well.

103
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,680
Okay.

104
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,370
You haven't paid yet.

105
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,430
Do you want to die?

106
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,910
Who dares to ask me, Lu San, for money on this street?

107
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,930
Do you believe I'll smash your stall?

108
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,440
Mr. Lu, please.

109
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,200
The small business

110
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,210
is hard to do.

111
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,010
Cut the crap.

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,100
I will take it.

113
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,610
Sir.

114
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,140
Lu, right?

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,360
Lu?

116
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,190
Lu is good.

117
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,780
Lu.

118
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,580
Lu is good.

119
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,630
It's nice to have the surname Lu.

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,630
Lu.

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,430
That's great.

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Great.

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,670
I have nothing against you.

124
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,640
Why did you hit me?

125
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,730
As long as your surname is Lu,

126
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,000
you have a grudge against me.

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,900
My Lu means road,

128
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,280
not land.

129
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,920
I don't care.

130
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,180
You can have all other surnames,

131
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,440
but Lu.

132
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,620
You can even tell the difference?

133
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,530
Give it to me.

134
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,880
I'll take

135
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,590
this flower.

136
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,520
Lu is so nice.

137
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,240
Young Master,

138
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,290
have some porridge.

139
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,710
It tastes terrible.

140
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,340
Pour it away.

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,260
Young Master.

142
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,730
If you don't eat properly,

143
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,080
I'll tell Jing

144
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,100
your wound is not that serious.

145
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,830
How did you know?

146
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,850
You've fought for years.

147
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,280
A scratch is nothing.

148
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,870
Not to mention they were just a few gangsters.

149
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,090
How could they hurt you?

150
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,270
And it's the kind of wound looking serious

151
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,370
but precisely avoiding organs.

152
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,920
I'm exhausted from lying in bed these days.

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,310
I don't understand

154
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,580
why you have to make yourself suffer.

155
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,040
Hush.

156
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,370
How is my porridge?

157
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:13,960
Jing.

158
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,380
He...

159
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,850
Wow.

160
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,950
Even such simple porridge

161
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,550
can be so delicous.

162
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,220
Jing,

163
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
you are so talented.

164
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,140
It's my first time.

165
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,070
-One more. -I was worried it didn't taste good.

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,580
You're not comforting me, are you?

167
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,430
One more bowl.

168
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,440
Well...

169
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
Didn't you say...

170
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,160
Go.

171
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,000
Go!

172
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,470
Jing.

173
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,520
What happened to your hand?

174
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,360
Nothing.

175
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,830
I just scalded myself.

176
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm inexperienced.

177
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,760
Come here.

178
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,210

528
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,170
chairman of the Matchmaker Society of Pingyang.

529
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,570
I’m Wenren Jing, from Boqing Hall.

530
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,500
Today,

531
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,480
it's my blessing

532
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,990
to meet you.

533
00:29:59,330 --> 00:29:59,620
Here.

534
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,380
Please come in.

535
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,660
[Hong's Mansion]

536
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,590
Sorry to bother you.

537
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,020
Please don't mind.

538
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Of course not.

539
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,710
You're my guests.

540
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,190
Thank you for saving my life.

541
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,830
I didn't expect

542
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,040
there is such a master

543
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,560
among matchmakers.

544
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,030
My ancestors practiced kung fu.

545
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,130
But my father still hoped that

546
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,430
I can do something other than fighting and killing.

547
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,330
Director Lu is skilled in kung fu.

548
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,480
It's a waste of your talent to be a matchmaker.

549
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,020
By the way,

550
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,620
there are many

551
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,790
missing girls lately.

552
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,810
Have you heard about it, Master Hong?

553
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,260
No.

554
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,350
Master.

555
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,490
I need to go to the toilet.

556
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,500
What a coincidence.

557
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,930
I want to go, too.

558
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,660
I will

559
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,000
see you off.

560
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,150
Haven't you found Young Master yet?

561
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,000
Master.

562
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,550
There is no news about Young Master yet.

563
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,050
Send the people out tonight.

564
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,810
We can't wait any longer.

565
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,850
Is anyone here?

566
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,870
Is anyone there?

567
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,380
Is anyone there?

568
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,210
What?

569
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,190
Are you not going to call for help?

570
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,990
You're doing something else again, aren't you?

571
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,510
My stomach hurts.

572
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,400
I have diarrhea.

573
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,750
Can I go out for a while?

574
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,890
You've been locked up for so long and you still don't behave.

575
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,080
Bro.

576
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,130
I...

577
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,110
I have a piece of jade on me.

578
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,380
Just let me out for a while.

579
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,060
You're good at hiding.

580
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,990
If it's not a good one,

581
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,130
I won't forgive you.

582
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,260
Useless!

583
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,530
Feed them with this

584
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,670
and put them in the box of cloth.

585
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,970
At midnight tonight,

586
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,730
get out of the city.

587
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,610
Yes.
