Is Lu Tingxiao, the first-class matchmaker,

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,730
pretending to be a Jiaofang musician in the capital,

178
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,930
or is the Jiaofang musician pretending to be Lu Tingxiao?

179
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,880
It gives me such a headache.

180

your skin is white as snow.

183
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,270
It looks more delicate in a close distance.

184

Of course I said no.

Why did you open a matchmaker hall in Pingyang in my name?

264

To solve the divorce case for myself.

Lord Song said

266
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,330
no one could handle my divorce case in the world.

267
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,920
I can only become a top-class matchmaker

268
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,050
and do it for myself.

269
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,740
I'm asking

270
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,470
why you used my name.

271
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,650
Because it requires the name of a top-class matchmaker to open the hall.

272
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,320
Because you are famous.

273

Because you're mysterious at your whereabouts.

274

If I had used Liu Zhan's name,

275
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,660
he would have exposed me the next day.

Lord Song said you opened the hall in my name

and caused a mess in Pingyang.

280

But I can't tell you the details.

Why do you only accept divorce cases?

287

To become a top-class matchmaker,

There are so few divorce cases.

It's not good for you.

291
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,680
Because I married a heartless man who has two faces.

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,830
Bai Jia had showed up.

348
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,700
Play chess with me.

349
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,440
How much have we earned in the past three months?

350
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
Not a penny,

351
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,260
and we've nearly spent all the money taken with us from the mansion.

352
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,010
How come?

353
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,780
We took so many divorce cases.

354
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,500
We should at least make some money.

355
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,050
For the Zhou family's divorce case last time,

356
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,110
you broke so many antique jewelries.

357
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,210
You can't even compensate all of them.

358
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,010
And the rent and daily expenses of the Boqing Hall.

359
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,410
If this continues,

360
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,570
we won't have enough money to eat.

361
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,040
I will pay attention to this.

362
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,180
I'll try not to let this happen again.

363
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,730
You still have doubts?

364
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,300
I tried the lie test method my father had taught me.

365
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,020
He must be Lu Tingxiao.

366
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,590
Although he answered the questions fluently,

367
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,690
I'm always worried that he's up to something.

368
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm going to keep an eye on him all night,

369
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,600
to see what he's up to.

370
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,080
You should go and rest.

371
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,510
I'll keep an eye on him.

372
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,900
I don't have time to clean other rooms today.

373
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,500
You stay here for the night.

374
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,310
Let's go.

375
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,030
Yes.

376
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,020
Are you okay?

377
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,550
Yes.

378
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,290
Let's go.

379
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,920
Okay.

380
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
Interesting.

381
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,550
Someone seems to be watching the same thing as us.

382
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,890
They're hiding movements.

383
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,080
I can't tell if they're friends or enemies.

384
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,840
There's only one reason for hiding movements.

385
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
It's easy to recognize them.

386
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,690
We both hided our movements in the fight.

387
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,350
Can't tell who was the winner.

388
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,630
If we had not hided it,

389
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,310
I'm afraid it wouldn't be that simple.

390
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,910
So you think they are friends,

391
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,640
not enemies.

392
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,110
Not enemies.

393
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,820
If they were enemies,

394
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,300
they didn't need to hide it, and could have used the finishing move.

395
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,560
But whether they're friends

396
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,620
remains question.

397
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,280
That was close.

398
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,830
How did you know there was an ambush in Bai Jia's house?

399
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,880
Something is wrong with the dust in the room.

400
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,060
Someone must be on the beam,

401
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,870
and must have been in ambush for a long time.

402
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,540
Yes.

403
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,420
Then why did we pretend to leave before going in?

404
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,740
How could you know how many people were on the beam?

405
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,040
If you don't know the strength of your enemies,

406
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,340
don't alert them.

407
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,620
You are wise.

408
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,850
But the clue is broken.

409
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,950
Where should we find him next?

410
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,100
What does Bai Jia usually do?

411
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,640
Well,

412
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,740
I've looked into it.

413
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,950
He's just a gambler.

414
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,450
Where would a gambler go?

415
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,970
I see.

416
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,450
Of course gamblers go to the gambling house

417
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,420
And pawnshops, too.

418
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,520
Yes.

419
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,430
Go to sleep.

420
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,770
Thanks for your hard work today.

421
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,820
It's not hard work

422
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,740
as long as I'm with you.

423
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,580
One day,

424
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,840
I will become someone as powerful as you.

425
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,910
Go to sleep.

426
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,010
Yes.

427
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,820
Is Wenren Jing here?

428
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,810
Not necessarily.

429
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,070
It depends on what you want to see her for.

430
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,050
Mrs. Ma.

431
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,170
You look different today.

432
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,220
After I've got rid of that bastard,

433
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,620
I surely feel different.

434
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,670
Then why are you here today?

435
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,870
Of course I'm here to return the reward.

436
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,610
I've heard your director is back.

437
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,810
Rumor has it that he is a handsome and talented man.

438
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,410
He's kind of pretty and talented,

439
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,340
but his character is not very good.

440
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,740
Jing.

441
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,170
Do we have a guest?

442
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,660
Director Lu.

443
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,470
I've heard that the director of the Boqing Hall is both pretty and talented.

444
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,130
You are indeed extraordinary as I saw you today.

445
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,190
I'm flattered.

446
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,980
Thank you for helping me with the divorce.

447
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,500
It's just a small reward.

448
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,350
Mrs. Ma,

449
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,030
I helped you, right?

450
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:58,880
Yan Wu.

451
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,580
You're welcome.

452
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
I hope in the future, Mrs. Ma...

453
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,140
Oh, no.

454
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,570
I can't call you Mrs. Ma anymore.

455
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,030
What should we call her?

456
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,950
My maiden name is Gao.

457
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,580
Nickname,

458
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,930
Yuanyuan.

459
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,730
Gao...

460
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,820
Yuanyuan.

461
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,900
After the divorce, we should call the woman by her original name.

462
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,760
I hope you can choose another person, Miss Yuanyuan.

463
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,020
Our Boqing Hall will do our best to serve you.

464
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,710
Thank you, Director Lu.

465
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,900
Let's talk in details.

466
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,780
Please.

467
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,050
Jing.

468
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,270
Make some tea.

469
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,010
Yes, Director.

470
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,840
You're welcome.

471
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,480
A top-class matchmaker is really different.

472
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,570
My cousin's

473
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,550
and nieces' birth dates will be all given to you.

474
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,400
Director Lu got three orders just by a few words.

475
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,500
If he lets you handle them,

476
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,020
you'll be one step closer to be a top-class matchmaker.

477
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,500
Don't you know one should refuse to eat the food handed out in contempt?

478
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,970
Even if I should starve to death,

479
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,970
I wouldn't beg Lu Tingxiao for help.

480
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,220
That's my sister.

481
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,320
You have guts.

482
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,210
What are you doing?

483
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,900
Nothing.

484
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,470
I just think Director Lu

485
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,730
looks very kind today.

486
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,430
Just get to the point.

487
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,720
Nothing.

488
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,980
Well,

489
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,620
could you let me handle

490
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,050
the three orders from Mrs. Ma?

491
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,980
I promise I will complete the task.

492
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,610
Don't you

493
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,010
only want divorce cases?

494
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,340
How about

495
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,910
making me happy?

496
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
And I'll let you do it.

497
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,760
What do you think?

498
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,690
What do you want?

499
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,150
[Yinshu Pavilion]

500
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,050
I'm one step closer

501
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,050
to be a top-class matchmaker again.

502
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,090
Young master.

503
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,140
[Zheng]

504
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,540
Why are you panicking?

505
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,010
I'm not.

506
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,740
What?

507
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,670
The new chairman will arrive tomorrow noon.

508
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,840
The new chairman will arrive tomorrow noon.

509
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,610
Great.

510
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,260
We have to prepare in advance

511
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,790
and take the opportunity.

512
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,960
Don't let those of the Boqing Hall know about this.

513
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,320
Are you stupid?

514
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,420
The reason why Boqing Hall could be opened

515
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,430
must have something to do with that Lord Song.

516
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,560
How could I not know?

517
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,880
If they come,

518
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,320
we'll suffer.

519
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,630
Don't say anything discouraging.

520
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,640
Alright.

521
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,030
I like cleanliness.

522
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm happy when it's clean.

523
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,770
Why should I do this?

524
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,540
I was fooled by Lu.

525
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,240
This is my room and my bed.

526
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,090
On what ground could he ask me to leave as soon as he came?

527
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,490
And he ordered me around.

528
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,670
Just leave if you've finished cleaning.

529
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,930
I'm going to take a nap.

530
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,400
You should go out.

531
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,910
This is my bed.

532
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,850
It's mine now.

533
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,400
Get out.

534
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,620
I...

535
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,080
just...

536
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,250
don't.

537
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,790
Get down.

538
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,310
Get down!

539
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,820
Don't think you can do whatever you want as the director.

540
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,350
I'm not scared of you at all.

541
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,650
What are you doing?

542
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,150
You...

543
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,920
Are you scared?

544
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,610
I'm not scared.

545
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,580
Go.

546
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,170
No.
