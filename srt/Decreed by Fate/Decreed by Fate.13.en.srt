4
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,380
Doctor Yue,

5
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,140
Director Lu should be fine, right?

6
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,370
He's all right.

7
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,460
If you're worried,

8
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,140
go to the back mountain and dig some wild ginseng

9
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,140
for him to eat.

10
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,860
Hey!

11
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,600
Doctor Yue.

12
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,540
Ginseng.

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,080
It seems to be a way.

14
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,430
General.

15
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,980
You're seriously injured.

16
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,870
And you are still going out?

17
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm just a wretch.

18
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,570
I don't want to bother you, general.

19
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,060
Chief Feng,

20
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,180
don't you have anything to say to me?

21
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,500
You're seriously injured.

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll send someone to replace you.

23
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,530
My apologies.

24
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,660

Ask Lin Xie

27
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,800
to kill Yin Sishen of Boqing Hall right away.

28
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,220
You could have been more careful.

29
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,880
Lu Tingxiao was the one to intercept the letter.

30
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,750
Yes.

31
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,310
General, you're right.

32

General.

34
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,180
The new emperor has sent a supervisor here.

35
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,640
He will arrive in ten days.

36
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,220
If you don't kill Yin Sishen,

37
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,060
you will die.

38
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,370
In that case,

39
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,100
should I thank you for this?

40
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,530
You don't have to worry about killing Yin Sishen.

41
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,990
I'll leave it to you.

42
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,760
A spy reported that

43
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,820
General Yin Sishen has blocked all the main roads at the city gate.

44
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,220
Leaving the city without the general's order is forbidden.

45
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,300
Why did Yin Sishen show up in Pingyang?

46
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,090
Not sure yet.

47
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,100
But according to the news from the North Kingdom,

48
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,410
General Yin seems to have some unclear relationship

49
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,330
with Wenren Jing of Boqing Hall.

50
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,960
It's her again.

51
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,700

She wants to find some wild ginseng for you.

Given her condition,

56
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,520
how could you let her go out alone?

57
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,140
Why is he so grumpy?

58
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,490

59
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,020

that you tease me like this?

I couldn't see anyone else.

No.

156

It's just that my body is still cold.

157

Could it be that

158

I got the incurable illness?

159
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020

161

So I found the miracle-working doctor, Yue Liweng,

163
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,100
to detoxify you.

164

I will

165
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,540
find a way to cure you.

166
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,040
Jing, why are you smiling?

167

174

It was my fault running away from the marriage.

175
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Don't hurt him.

176
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,990
On escaping,

177
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
I'll apologize to you and the Yin's.

178
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,020
Lu Tingxiao doesn't know anything.

179
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,880
Don't hurt him.

180
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,900
So

181
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,980
you've already fallen in love with him?

182
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,540
Yes.

183
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,900
He is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

184
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,840
No matter what,

185
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,190
I won't let you hurt him.

186
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,740
Fang Xianxun?

187
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,420
Stop it.

188
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,300
If you keep talking about this,

189
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,500
I'll be really sad.

190
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,410
We'll talk about other things later.

191
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,430
Let's get out of here first.

192
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,410
[Boqing Hall]

193
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,900
Ling.

194
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,869
Is master awake?

195
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,420
I've checked on her several times.

196
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,550
She's still asleep.

197
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,020
She knew she was poisoned by love poison.

198
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,530
She must be greatly shocked.

199
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,500
Who told you to say that?

200
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,230
You bastard!

201

Ling.

202
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,460
My head aches.

203
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,940
Why are there so many people?

204
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,800
Is there water?

205
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,260
It's you.

206
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,290
Why are you here in Pingyang?

207
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,140
Ling.

208
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,820
This is the young warrior I met in the capital I told you about.

209
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,180
I'm Wenren Jing.

210
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,840
I haven't asked your name yet.

211
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,500
You're really good at kung fu.

212
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
Who's your master?

213
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,300
What?

214
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,710
What are you talking about?

215
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,660
Jing.

216
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,140
What's wrong?

217
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,580
Aren't you the courtesan of Jiaofang in the capital?

218
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,710
Why are you here?

219
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,940
What did you call me?

220
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,970
Courtesan of Jiaofang.

221
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,770
What's wrong?

222
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,340
I want to ask

223
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,560
why are you all here in my Boqing Hall?

224
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:48,950
Jing.

225
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,430
How long have you been in Pingyang?

226
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,240
Who allowed you to call me so intimately?

227
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
Miss Wenren Jing,

228
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,510
how long have you been in Pingyang?

229
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,620
Why is he so strange?

230
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,690
He keeps asking how long we've been in Pingyang.

231
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,490
Is he from the General's Palace?

232
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,930
Sister,

233
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,370
do you remember what we said we'd do today?

234
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,140
What?

235
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,780
We're going to get the seal from Lord Song.

236
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,420
What?

237
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,980
Don't ask me.

238
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,340
I've never been poisoned by love poison.

239
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,700
How would I know what would it be like when it takes effect?

240
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,420
Getting the seal was something we did when we first arrived in Pingyang.

241
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,300
Sister said we are going today.

242
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,470
I don't think she remembers

243
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,550
anything that happened recently.

244
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,780
So love poison will cause amnesia.

245
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,540
Write it down.

246
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,940
Brat.

247
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,620
Let them untie me.

248
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,880
I want to write it down.

249
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,460
Let me ask you.

250
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,860
Since the love poison is triggered by love,

251
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,790
then if she doesn't remember who she loves...

252
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,260
Right.

253
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,860
If she doesn't remember,

254
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,710
will it inhibit the poison?

255
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
That makes sense.

256
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,500
Love poison leads to amnesia.

257
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,160
If you forget, there will be no more love poison.

258
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,780
I see.

259
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,610
I can't take the risk.

260
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,920
I'd better set out early to find Heartless Herb.

261
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,140
Master.

262
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,510
Where are you going?

263
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,720
To get the seal from Lord Song.

264
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,580
Miss Ling said you should have a good rest.

265
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,660
She'll get the seal.

266
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,790
You don't need to go.

267
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,220
What?

268
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,540
Why didn't she tell me?

269
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,330
We were disturbed by Butler Lv last time we drank.

270
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,530
Why don't we go again?

271
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,780
Let's go.

272
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,700
Is this your first time in Pingyang, disciple?

273
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,340
I have to show you around.

274
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,820
Take a look.

275
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,740
The new color arrived.

276
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,940
Come here, disciple.

277
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
The color of the cloth is beautiful.

278
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,230
It suits you.

279
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,440
I'll buy it for you.

280
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,700
Thank you for saving my life last time.

281
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,580
I'll take this one.

282
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Okay.

283
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,140
Here's the deposit.

284
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,580
Send it to Boqing Hall for me.

285
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:24,980
Okay.

286
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,900

287
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,990
I'll buy you some osmanthus cakes.

[Baihua Pavilion]

289
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,820
Disciple,

290
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,080
you've been depressed today.

291
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,670
Now you're finally happy.

292
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,350
Come again if you like it.

293
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,900
It's because I finally got something figured out.

294
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,500
What is it?

295
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,540
Have you been to the West Kingdom, master?

296
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,640
Would you like to take a trip there

297
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,100
with me?

298
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,210
Young master,

299
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,980
the luggage is ready.

300
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,700
Okay.

301

Yan Wu

303
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,050
has told me

304
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,590
about Heartless Herb.

305
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,860
I've decided to go to the West Kingdom to find Heartless Herb.

306
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,800
I'll give it a try as long as there's a chance.

307
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,430
Since you've made up your mind,

308
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,800
I won't try to stop you.

309
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,180
But can you at least say goodbye to my sister before you leave?

310
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,740
No need.

311
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,020
To her,

312
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,700
now I'm just

313
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760

Somewhere I need to go.

You scarcely come to Pingyang,

Why don't you stay longer?

Since Mr. Lu has decided to leave,

320
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,660
he must have something important to do.

321
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,790
Let him go first.

Make yourselves at home.

It's an honor to attend your birthday banquet.

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

332
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,820

335
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,860
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,190
I can't keep my word.

337
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,740
I feel like old friends with you even though we just met.

338
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,140
Stay here longer in Boqing Hall.

339
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,560
I'll show you around in Pingyang.

340

Here.

341
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,260
By the way,

342
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,940
the boss said there are good birthday fruits.

343
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,600
I'll get it.

344

You guys eat first.

345
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,650
Leave now.

What are you doing?

347
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,820
The longer you stay here,

348
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,320
the more unfavorable it is to her.

349
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,530
Chairman Fang,

350
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,140
can't you permit me the time for a peach?

351
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,540
What is a peach

352
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,180
compared to her life?

353
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,970
Fang Xianxun,

354
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,060
do you know something?

355
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,340
Why do you sound like

356
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,940
if Director Lu is here,

357
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,180
her poison will absolutely take effect?

358
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,020
I don't know.

359
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,420
I only know that you must get away from her

360
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,120
so that she can be safe.

361
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Tell me clearly.

362
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Listen.

363
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,110
She didn't lose her memory at all.

364
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,410
-What? -What?

365
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,380
It's all for you.

366
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,180
Can't you see?

367
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,500
Get lost!

368
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,900
Sister.

369
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,640
Why are you doing this?

370
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm sorry, everyone.

371
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,920
I pretended to have lost my memory because I was afraid that Lu Tingxiao would leave.

372
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,480
How did you find out, disciple?

373
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,620
You saw that Baihua Pavilion was closed

374
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,500
[Baihua Pavilion]

375
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,820
and guarded by soldiers.

376
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,270
You didn't even ask.

377
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,370
What do you think?

378
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,560
Good observation.

379
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,040
Good observation.

380
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,620
Don't be angry, okay?

381
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,810
I didn't mean to do that.

382
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm mad at myself.

383
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,980
I'm angry that I didn't realize it earlier.

384
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,540
Please stay and rest in Boqing Hall.

385
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,900
Don't go, okay?

386
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,460
What's wrong?

387
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,460
Sister.

388
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,590
Feeling cold again?

389
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,150
I'm fine.

390
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,320
[Boqing Hall]

391
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,580
Young master.

392
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,790
Everything is ready. We can set out anytime.

393
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,540
But the guards at the gate said someone rode a horse out of the city,

394
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,340
heading west.

395
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,450
To the west?

396
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,750
Is it Wang Yizhi?

397
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,060
Forgive me for being bold.

398
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,380
According to the guards,

399
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,440
it's very likely to be Chairman Fang.

400
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,610
General's Command is a serious matter.

401
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,470
Should we get Chairman Fang back?

402
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,900
General Command

403
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,580
was given by me.

404
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,780
You said

405
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,780
he can be trusted.

406
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,320
So I thought...

407
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,630
It's not your fault.

408
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Young master, are we still going to the West Kingdom for Heartless Herb?

409
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,790
Jing needs someone to take care of her.

410
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,820
Wait for news from Chairman Fang.

411
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,420
Yes.

412
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,330
[Boqing Hall]

413
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,290
She has been too deeply in love these days.

414
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,620
I'm afraid it'll only be two or three days.

415
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,830
Doctor Yue,

416
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,960
unless we get the Heartless Herb,

417
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,880
or there's no other way to detoxify the love poison?

418
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,820
Lu Tingxiao.

419
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,820
At least we still have two or three days.

420
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,900
Actually, there is another way to save her.

421
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,140
What is it?

422
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,660
What do you need me to prepare?

423
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,720
I'll get ready now.

424
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,900
No problem.

425
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,500
But you need to be the efficacy-enhancing ingredient.

426
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,140
-Yes. -No.

427
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,710
Absolutely not.

428
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,780
Using him as the efficacy-enhancing ingredient

429
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,040
is not taking his life.

430
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,820
Still no.

431
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,460
You almost killed him

432
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,410
when you tricked him into testing the medicine.

433
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,820
It must be a trap

434
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,060
saying you'll detoxify me.

435
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,460
What?

436
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,040
Can't I be forgetful given my age?

437
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,300
Believe it or not.
