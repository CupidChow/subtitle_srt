00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:39,780
Honey.

5
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,500
Let's return to the capital as soon as possible.

6
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,360
I have something important to do.

7
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,360
We're not in a hurry to return to the capital, aren't we?

8
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,259
You said you were in a hurry to divorce General Yin

9
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,250
and be with me officially.

10
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,020
Why aren't you in a hurry now?

11
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,850
You are so fickle.

12
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,770
Lu Tingxiao,

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,340
I'm not finished with you lying to me.

14
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,600
Why are you still calling me Lu Tingxiao?

15
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,300
Shouldn't you call me husband?

16
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:23,860
Hey.

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,940
Stop being lovey-dovey.

18
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,700
There are many people at the door.

19
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,050
Ling almost can't handle it.

20
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,060
Come out and take a look.

21

I'll go help.

I'll go first.

Ah, bummer.

26
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm not cheating. Why am I so nervous?

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,980
General Yin, open the door!

28
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,850
General Yin!

29

General Yin.

34
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,270
I finally found you.

35
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,790
I didn't recognize you before.

36
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,260
I didn't know General Yin has come to Pingyang.

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,340
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,170
General, you're so generous.

39
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
You'll forgive me for my ignorance,

40
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,910
won't you, General Yin?

41
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,940
Unfortunately, I'm a narrow-minded

42
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,180
and vengeful rat.

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,760
I am the rat.

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm here to apologize.

45
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,250
Please forgive me, General Yin and Mrs. Yin.

46
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,980
Her Ladyship was poisoned and needed the ten-thousand-year ginseng.

47
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,310
You took the chance to hack Director Liu's Yinshu Pavilion,

48
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,270
and said you would be happy if Her Ladyship died.

49

How can a villain like you

50

as Marquis Jing'an,

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,980
if you target me, a civilian,

55
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,610
wouldn't it be a little...

56
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,190
Yes, General.

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,550
This will make you look a little petty.

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,400

59

Of course.

You can't have it.

How about

76
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,130
I exchange something else for it?

77

Okay.

Have I ever been afraid of anything?

I just ran away without clearly understanding the situation

110

After all, I forced you to marry me at the beginning,

But that day,

141
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,770
when we got rid of Qin Zhao's spy and helped Fang Xianxun to cheat,

142
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,840
why did you happen to have a fake deployment map with you?

143
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,450
It's the real one.

144
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
I knew it.

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,100
What?

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,280
It's real.

147
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,450
If we couldn't muddle through with a fake one,

148
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,310
Lin Xie would have been dead meat.

149
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,100
No wonder you were in such a hurry to go back to the capital.

150
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,560
You were bold!

151
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,240
It was a real one indeed.

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,550
But since I returned to the capital, I've been working on redeployment.

153
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,010
I haven't finished it yet.

154
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,370
But it can help Lin Xie beat the rap.

155
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,810
That was close.

156
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,160
God bless.

157
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,490
What do you think the disciple is doing now?

158
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,770
Could you not mention him?

159
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,670
It's annoying.

160
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,060
I didn't expect you to be so cute when you're jealous.

161
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,090
Stop saying men are cute.

162
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,690
It sounds like humiliation.

163
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,660
But I just think you're cute.

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,350
OK.

165
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,730
Then I'll be cute.

166
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,750

174
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,870
so I knew you are still here.

175
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,350
I'm just curious why you're still here.

176
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,760
I like the name of Boqing Hall.

177
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,270
Now it's closed.

178
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,070
I'm really not willing to leave.

179
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,270
It's not easy for me to meet a few people who get along with me.

180
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,030
And now,

181
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,620
we're going to part soon.

182
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,750
Let's go our separate ways from now on.

183
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,200
I hope your relationship can last forever.

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,930
Although I still think love is harmful.

185
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,240
People who become heartless all because they got hurt by deep love.

186
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,240
But I'm willing to be hurt 10,000 times because of the sweetness of love.

187
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,590
Me, too.

188
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,740
Stop provoking me.

189
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,120
I'll leave Boqing Hall to you for now.

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,770
Remember to come back to see me.

191
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,700
Well, I could go to see her.

192
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,520
[Pingyang]

193
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,330
[Capital]

194
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,150
[Yin Mansion]

195
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,500
Father. Mother.

196
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,800
I've brought her back.

197
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Lord Yin.

198
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,740
Mrs. Yin.

199
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,290
I...

200
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,270
Kneel down!

201
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,130
How rude you are!

202
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,220
You're already married.

203
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,610
How dare you still call us Lord Yin and Mrs. Yin,

204
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,870
and call yourself I!

205
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,940
You make the Yins feel ashamed.

206
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,660
Where have you been these days?

207
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,440
Who did you hang out with?

208
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,200
You ran away from wedding at such a young age.

209
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,710
You have no sense of responsibility.

210
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,360
How can you be a good hostess of the family in the future?

211
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,620
I tried so hard to bring you back this time

212
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,410
to give you a chance to explain.

213
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,430
Do you think you are someone honorable

214
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,770
and we don't dare to touch you?

215
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm gonna abuse you,

216
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,270
torture you,

217
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,530
and make you miserable

218
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,680
and regret what you did that day.

219
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,900
Yin Sishen,

220
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,130
you said you would love me and protect me forever.

221
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,150
Go away.

222
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,670
My cousin will only be with me forever.

223
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,010
Who do you think you are?

224
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,910
How dare you do this to him?

225
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,770
Apologize now!

226
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,270
Apologize!

227
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,100
Apologize!

228
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,920
It's my fault for running away from wedding.

229
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,250
So I mustered up courage

230
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,090
to apologize to you

231
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,480
sincerely.

232
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,290
Stop scolding me.

233
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,960
Rong'er.

234
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,180
Rong'er.

235
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,580
What's wrong?

236
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,840
Nothing.

237
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,400
Why don't we come back a few days later?

238
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,220
Don't be scared.

239
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,230
My parents are easygoing.

240
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,010
But it must be hard for your parents

241
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,750
to understand me running away from wedding.

242
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,920
I believe my parents will understand.

243
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,760
Really?

244
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,770
Then they will allow us a few days more before we come back.

245
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,450
Young Madam.

246
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,620
Mr. Yin and Mrs. Yin are waiting in the front hall.

247
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,880
How about another day?

248
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,780
I'll go back and get changed.

249
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,830
Father.

250
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,620
Mother.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm back.

252
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,040
Rong'er.

253
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,700
Mrs. Yin looks kind.

254
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,300
She doesn't look like a difficult person.

255
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,860
Lord Yin.

256
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,000
Mrs. Yin.

257
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,420
Oh no.

258
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,440
Father.

259
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,610
Mother.

260
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,390
Serve the tea.

261
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,500
Mother, here's the tea.

262
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,430
If you're not used to it,

263
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,890
you could call me Mrs. Yin.

264
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,720
You could change the form of address after you get used to it.

265
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,780
Thank you, mother.

266
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,770
We heard you're coming back today.

267
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,500
Look how happy His Lordship is.

268
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,410
Where did you see that?

269
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,940
Your father doesn't seem easygoing.

270
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,400
Father.

271
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Have some tea.

272
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,410
Father.

273
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:40,910
I...

274
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,420
You must be tired from the journey.

275
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,680
Go back and rest.

276
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,040
Come on.

277
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,420
Wipe it.

278
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,010
I knew everything would go wrong today.

279
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,150
I shouldn't have come.

280
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,990
It would have been better if we hadn't come back.

281
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,340
Now it's all screwed up.

282
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,280
You want to run away again?

283
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,260
This is what my mother specially prepared for you.

284
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
She's afraid you would feel hungry.

285
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,080
I am anxious now.

286
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,210
How am I supposed to have the appetite?

287
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,420
It's a shame since my mother has prepared osmanthus cakes specially for you.

288
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,620
If you don't want it, I'll throw it away.

289
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,680
I'll eat it.

290
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,680
It's so delicious.

291
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,450
How did mother know I like osmanthus cakes?

292
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,260
Maybe mother and son are connected by heart.

293
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,460
What are you doing?

294
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,400
These are red dates, peanuts, longans, and lotus seeds.

295
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,510
It's a wish for babies.

296
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,230
What do you think this reminds me to do?

297
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,750
Today is not the wedding night.

298
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,880
Think about it.

299
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,570
I ruined my wedding night by myself.

300
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,460
I didn't even take a close look at the wedding ceremony that day.

301
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,960
All I was thinking is to run away.

302
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,060
I'm the silliest in the world.

303
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,750
It's him.

304
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,490
[Health and Wealth]

305
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,670
Young Master.

306
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,720
Mrs. Yin asked Young Madam to go to the Buddha Hall.

307
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,080
I'll just kneel down if she gets angry.

308
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,230
I'll apologize first before she gets angry.

309
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,230
It should be fine.

310
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,060
Believe in yourself.

311
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,060
You can do it.

312
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,020
Is Rong'er here?

313
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,680
Yes, mother.

314
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm here.

315
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Bodhisattva, please bless her.

316
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,990
Bless this child to be safe and sound.

317
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,320
Rong'er.

318
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,450
Oh no, she's going to teach me a lesson.

319
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,720
Bodhisattva,

320
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,430
this is the child for whom I prayed for your blessing day and night.

321
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,700
Now that she's back safely,

322
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,230
I brought her here

323
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,250
to thank you, Bodhisattva.

324
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,160
Amitabha.

325
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,740
Mother.

326
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,060
Come here.

327
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,770
Kid,

328
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,070
you've suffered a lot.

329
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,980
Mother.

330
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,180
I was irresponsible to run away from the wedding

331
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
and caused you to be criticized.

332
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,700
Why don't you blame me?

333
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,890
Your parents died early.

334
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,020
You had no one to rely on.

335
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,980
You must have seen through the world.

336
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,720
It's normal for you to feel insecure inside.

337
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,460
If it were an ordinary woman who's married to the Yins,

338
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,620
why would she run away from the wedding?

339
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,070
I just figured you're an independent girl.

340
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,350
I'm ashamed.

341
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,310
I was willful back then.

342
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,860
I didn't think too much.

343
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,870
It's good that you're back.

344
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,370
My mother died in a hard labor.

345
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,840
I've never seen her face.

346
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,170
My father told me that she was a gentle girl with personality.

347
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,680
I think

348
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,370
if she were alive,

349
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,690
she would be like you.

350
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,260
You're a good child.

351
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,750
Good girl.

352
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,490
If I do anything wrong in the future,

353
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,840
please teach me.

354
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,130
I'll try my best to learn.

355
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Where is Rong'er?

356
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,560
She's with your mother.

357
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,560
Father.

358
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,160
I have a request.

359
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,240
Go ahead.

360
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,110
This is inappropriate.

361
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,810
I wish that you and mother could help me.

362
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,130
You leave me with no choice.

363
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,210
Let's make it a deal.

364
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,180
Only today.

365
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,170
Thank you, father.

366
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,400
Father.

367
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,220
Don't laugh.

368
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,030
I didn't laugh.

369
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,820
I saw it.

370
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,190
My lord.

371
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,580
Mrs. Yin.

372
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,000
Where do you think that bastard general

373
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,610
has taken the princess to?

374
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,130
I'm the only one

375
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,770
to finish all the dishes.

376
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,920
Can you finish all on your own?

377
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,290
What's wrong?

378
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,690
You can't recognize me?

379
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,550
Your Highness.

380
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
Your Highness.

381
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,840
Butler Lv.

382
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:29,960
Mrs. Yin.

383
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,090
Have you recovered?

384
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:31,920
Mrs. Yin.

385
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,290
Long time no see.

386
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,020
The capital.

387
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,890
Mrs. Yin.

388
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,810
Even the air of the familiar place is sweet.

389
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,600
Hello.

390
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,720
I, Ye Rong'er, am back.

391
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,290
Rong'er.

392
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,570
Why are you here?

393
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,330
It's not easy for you to come back.

394
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,590
You should spend more time with your parents.

395
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,920
I'll take a walk myself.

396
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,150
Honey, you're generous.

397
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,790
But I insisted on following you.

398
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,450
If you run into any bad people,

399
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,160
I can protect you at any time.

400
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,460
Thank you, General Yin.

401
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,390
You're welcome.

402
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,120
This is my duty as a husband.

403
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
By the way, honey,

404
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,320
I have something to do.

405
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,780
Yan Wu.

406
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,110
Yes.

407
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,760
Take a walk with Her Ladyship.

408
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,100
Okay.

409
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
I don't need company.

410
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,290
I won't be bullied.

411
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm afraid you'll bully others.

412
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,760
Hey.

413
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,150
Young Master.

414
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,280
Isn't he the one from Yinshu Pavilion?

415
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,700
Liu Zhan.

416
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,450
Yan Wu.

417
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,920
Take a walk with Her Ladyship.

418
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,840
I have to go.

419
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,240
Yan Wu, let's go that way.

420
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,410
Let's go.

421
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,840
Sister.

422
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,330
Why are you here?

423
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,480
Pingyang is too small.

424
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,840
I want to do business in the capital.

425
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,810
Have you found a place?

426
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,450
No hurry.

427
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,710
I want to see

428
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,100
where you live first.

429
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,290
Well,

430
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,630
will you leave?

431
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,550
Will you leave?

432
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,910
I want to be with you forever.

433
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,360
Ewww.

434
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,760
I'm having goose bumps.

435
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,240
Ewww.

436
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,670
[Fly Away]

437
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,260
Madam, please get in.

438
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,340
Aren't you going back?

439
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,730
The general has assigned me to do something else.

440
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,320
Goodbye.

441
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,510
[Fly Away]

442
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,430
-Then why did he hang out with me for so long? -Madam.

443
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,990
-Madam, please come with us.

444
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,530
Why?

445
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,880
I...

446
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
I didn't say anything bad about General Yin.

447
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,540
Madam, please.

448
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,960
What are you doing?

449
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,680
I didn't expect

450
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,100
you really copied the wedding night.

451
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,490
I want to give you everything you want.

452
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,540
I've sent away everyone.

453
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,460
There are only the two of us at home today.

454
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,530
We haven't drunk the wedding wine.

455
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

456
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,410
I'll be shy.

457
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,200
Although I saw this scene before,

458
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,450
but once again,

459
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,900
I still couldn't help falling in love with you.

460
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,640
It seems that General Yin not only has great military skills,

461
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,950
but also is good at saying sweet words.

462
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,240
Our old bed can't be fixed in a moment.

463
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,710
Let me show you our new bed.

464
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,570
Do you think we'll be married

465
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
in the next life?

466
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,180
My dear wife,

467
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,190
that sounds like something you asked in the previous life.

468
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,860
When did you become so glib-tongued?

469
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,120
I don't care.

470
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,220
We must be together forever.

471

Tell the troops to stand by outside the city.

474
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,340
We're going to set out immediately.

475
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,630
Yes.

476
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,180
Why does this happen now?

477
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,890
How should I explain to her?

478
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,610
There's nothing to explain.

479
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,750
Trot!
