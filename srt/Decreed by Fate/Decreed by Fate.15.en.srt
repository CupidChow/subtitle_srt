[Episode 15]

4
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,280
What are you doing?

5
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,850
How could you fight under this circumstance?

6
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,100
Doctor Yue.

7
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,660
Hurry up.

8
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,289
Take a look at them.

9
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,220
You two brats.

10
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,580
I just can't leave you here unguarded.

11
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,340
Come on.

12
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,490
Hand.

13
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,090
Your hand.

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Give me your hand.

15
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,150
My medical skills are really good.

16
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,400
The toxins in your bodies have almost been cleared.

17
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,780
But the poison has hurt your meridians.

18
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,690
Although you are much stronger than ordinary people,

19
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,020
I guess you need to rest for a few more days.

20
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,820
What?

21
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,340
He got poisoned, too?

22
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,320
Doctor Yue transferred the love poison in my body to him.

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,230
Thanks to your Heartless Herb, he escaped death.

24
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,140
I went to and back from West Kingdom's Poison Forest,

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,740
and saved this man in the end?

26
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,200
Thank you.

27
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,970
Don't thank me.

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,890
If you want to thank me, get pricked for a thousand times in the Poison Forest.

29
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,970
We're even now.

30
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,810
OK.

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,640
Yue Liweng,

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,690
what other poison do you have?

33
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,420
Use it on him.

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,860
You...

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,060
So that I can go find the antidote.

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,680
All right.

37
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,060
You two are so noisy.

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,380
I'm so happy to see both of you

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,900
being this energetic.

40
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,350
Alright.

41
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,860
Girl,

42
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,790
let the two wounded men take a rest.

43
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,060
Jing,

44
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,250
can you ask him to move his feet?

45
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,980
They've occupied so much room on the bed.

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,860
He traveled for three days day and night nonstop.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,260
His inner thighs are swollen.

48
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,580
He's still applying medicine every day.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,910
Please understand him.

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,770
I'll get you some food.

51
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,860
Apply medicine on your thighs.

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,120
Who helped you with it?

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,060
Me, of course.

54
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,610
Who else?

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,290
You...

56
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,900
Thank you.

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,260
You were in a coma, and didn't know

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,610
how serious the wounds on your thighs were.

59
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,780
I almost couldn't take off your pants.

60
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,290
You've suffered a lot.

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,880
Then...

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,500
There's nothing wrong with the important part.

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,700
You're quite strong.

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,430
It's worth practicing Kung Fu.

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,790
You're strong.

66
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,329
Umbrella.

67
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,340
Pendant.

68
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,470
Come and have a look.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,410
Take a look.

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,310
The pendant.

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,850
This umbrella is different from others.

72
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,500
The green one is good.

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,260
This color is very nice.

74
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,450
It's the latest.

75
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,250
Take a look.

76
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,540
Young Master.

77
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Stop touching it.

78
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,500
It's been a few days since we last met,

79
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,760
and there's dust on it.

80
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,310
Don't know how to cherish it at all.

81
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,430
Take this.

82
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,920
You've sacrificed so much this time.

83
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Miss Ling must feel so touched that she will marry you.

84
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,980
Right?

85
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,120
I said one can hardly expect to achieve his goal without making sacrifices.

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,520
Is there any other color?

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,270
This pink one is good.

88
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,260
But the price is too high.

89
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,740
Zheng Lin is so evil.

90
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,900
So evil.

91
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,980
Director Liu.

92
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,360
Umbrella.

93
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,260
Come and take a look at the umbrellas, sir.

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,420
Miss Ling.

95
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:58,930
No need.

96
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,660
Where have you been these days?

97
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,420
I...

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,220
Come and see the umbrellas.

99
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,690
I...

100
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,540
I closed the restaurant for recuperation.

101
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,050
Well,

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,700
I've just come out for a walk.

103
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,940
For a walk.

104
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,920
Zheng Lin told me everything.

105
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,100
Umbrella.

106
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,380
He has such a big mouth.

107
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,350
Thank you for your help.

108
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,800
You're so kind.

109
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,740
I...

110
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,300
Look at the umbrellas, Miss.

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,060
-I'll repay you by marrying you? -I'll repay you by marrying you?

112
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,460
I'll help you get the Yinshu Pavilion back.

113
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,020
Please rest assured.

114
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,980
Since you want to repay me by marrying me,

115
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,220
I won't let you down.

116
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,920
What are you doing?

117
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,260
No.

118
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,380
It's fine if I don't get it back.

119
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,860
There might be another way to repay me.

120
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,580
Do you want me to marry you?

121
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,460
I have something else to do.

122
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,659
I have to go.

123
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,020
What's wrong, young master?

124
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,380
I don't know.

125
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,220
I feel so scared.

126
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,500
Young Master, are you impotent?

127
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,540
You're impotent.

128
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,390
Let me show you if I'm impotent.

129
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,560
Is it possible that

130
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,930
Director Liu didn't mean that?

131
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,540
Let go.

132
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,820
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,140
You really are a gentleman.

134
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,820
Stop pretending to be asleep.

135
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,880
Take the medicine.

136
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,690
Can I be spared from taking the medicine?

137
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,900
No.

138
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,740
Doctor Yue has said

139
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,870
you have to drink all these medicines.

140
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,810
Look. I've recovered.

141
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,140
General Yin

142
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,800
is afraid of taking medicine?

143
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,420
This medicine tastes so bitter.

144
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,659
This medicine is so good.

145
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,790
I want to drink more.

146
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,470
The medicine is so good.

147
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,300
I want it, too.

148
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,710
You're everywhere.

149
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Let me feed you, okay?

150
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,580
Ah.

151
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,540
Alright, disciple.

152
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,740
Stick your mouth out.

153
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,370
I'll take you to change the dressing.

154
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:08,830
Come on.

155
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,540
[Order]

156
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,790
[Order]

157
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,180
My dear disciple,

158
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,900
wait for a while here.

159
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,300
I'll go find Doctor Yue.

160
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,240
Master.

161
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,440
You have someone you love,

162
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,540
so you even avoid being alone with your disciple?

163
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
My dear disciple,

164
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,419
why do you always look restless after you came back this time?

165
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,470
I'm fine.

166
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,080
As long as you two are safe, it's good.

167
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,470
After this catastrophe, I just feel many obsessions in life are meaningless.

168
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,960
How about this?

169
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,590
When you both recover,

170
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,890
the three of us go for a trip?

171
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,820
Maybe you're willing to travel with me,

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,540
but someone doesn't like it.

173
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,950
I'm fine with it.

174
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,900
If someone likes to follow us,

175
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,560
I don't have to drive him away.

176
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm going back

177
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,140
in a few days.

178
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,600
Stewed noodles are so delicious.

179
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,220
Jing,

180
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,060
I want to ask you a question.

181
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,590
Go ahead.

182
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,540
What do you think of Fang Xianxun?

183
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,530
He is highly skilled in Kung Fu,

184
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,570
handsome,

185
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,700
and kind of valiant.

186
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,860
Although he is good,

187
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,420
but I just like you.

188
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,470
I want to know what you think of his character.

189
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,020
I've already regarded him as my family.

190
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,660
Why do you suddenly ask this?

191
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,880
The Yugou Token you found that day

192
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,460
belongs to Fang Xianxun.

193
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,580
I wanted to ask you when you get better.

194
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,060
So you mean

195
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,380
Fang Xianxun worked for my father?

196
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,780
He is General Wuchang from the North Kingdom, Lin Xie.

197
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,740
Although we found the Yugou Token from him,

198
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,770
it may not be his.

199
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,040
What if he has surrendered to the North Kingdom?

200
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,440
Besides, Lord Lian has been dead for so long.

201
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,780
I'm sorry, Jing.

202
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,180
As the Nation-protecting General of the Southern Kingdom,

203
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,340
I can only think about the worst.

204
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,390
If he is sent by the North Kingdom as a risky strategy,

205
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,990
once he gets our trust,

206
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,600
the consequences will be unimaginable.

207
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,340
If he knows we suspect him,

208
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,380
he would be so sad.

209
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,810
Yes.

210
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,670
That's why I didn't dare to ask him.

211
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,630
I could only observe his movements from the dark.

212
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,340
Although he risked his life to save you this time,

213
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,400
and returned the General's Command,

214
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,300
and I don't want to suspect him anymore,

215
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,050
but...

216
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,700
Actually,

217
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,140
you also hope Fang Xianxun really worked for my father.

218
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,660
Right?

219
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,780
I hope he's someone we can trust.

220
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,550
And I hope he can trust us that much.

221
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,890
If he does anything strange,

222
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,750
I will not tolerate him.

223
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,780
Jing.

224
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,820
Let’s go.

225
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,540
Boss.

226
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,420
Okay.

227
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,830
Come here often.

228
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,900
Sometimes I think

229
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,060
if you are the director of the Boqing Hall,

230
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,390
and Fang Xianxun is the chairman of the Matchmaker Society,

231
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,790
while Ling and I are the matchmakers who fight a battle of

232
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,850
wits and courage with Liu Zhan and Song Zhisu every day,

233
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,260
it'll be great for us

234
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,460
to live a normal life.

235
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,700
Am I right?

236
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:10,860
Yes.

237
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,500
Jing.

238
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,420
I have something to do.

239
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,350
You get in first.

240
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,350
I'll go with you.

241
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,300
Go back and make some tea for me.

242
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
I'll be back soon.

243
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,760
Just go.

244
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
You always ask me to make tea.

245
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,660
It makes me think I'm good at making tea.

246
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,260
Come out.

247
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,270
Director Lu.

248
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,040
What are you doing?

249
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,820
Lord Song.

250
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,060
How dared you send someone to follow me!

251
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,700
You misunderstood, Director Lu.

252
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,250
I asked him to go buy some food.

253
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,780
Did you offend Director Lu?

254
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,900
Qin Zhao,

255
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,980
where did you take Lord Song?

256
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,740
Thank Director Lu for not killing you.

257
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,130
Thank you, Director Lu.

258
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,590
Get out!

259
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,430
It seems that my disguise as Song Zhisu has been exposed.

260
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,640
Recently, my disguise skills have gone backwards.

261
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,420
You're so free.

262
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,890
You even have time to care about me.

263
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,780
Don't mind it.

264
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,510
Director Lu.

265
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,140
It's all official business.

266
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,990
For Wang Yizhi's thing, I have asked Yan Wu to send it to the capital.

267
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,210
You can just sit there and enjoy the fruits of our work.

268
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,940
What are you doing in Pingyang?

269
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,870
What a coincidence.

270
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,380
His Majesty also wants to know why General Yin came to Pingyang.

271
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,340
I will report to His Majesty in private why I came to Pingyang.

272
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,400
None of your business.

273
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,540
As the general of the South Kingdom, I appeared in Pingyang.

274
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,140
General Lin Xie of the North Kingdom also appeared in Pingyang at this time.

275
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,340
Could it be a coincidence?

276
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,780
It looks like General Yin has known Lin Xie is in Pingyang.

277
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,220
I secretly followed the spy from the North Kingdom.

278
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,350
I followed the clues

279
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,380
to catch Lin Xie.

280
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,230
How could I not know?

281
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,260
I just wanted to catch a bigger fish,

282
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,350
That's why I didn't act rashly.

283
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,660
Really?

284
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,630
I must have misunderstood.

285
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,700
I thought you were close to the North Kingdom.

286
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,980
Qin Zhao,

287
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,180
don’t think I dare not fight you because you are sent by His Majesty.

288
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,980
My father-in-law died in the North Kingdom.

289
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,020
What kind of friendship can I have with the North Kingdom?

290
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,480
I will never forgive them.

291
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,020
Fine.

292
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,450
General Yin, accept the edict.

293
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,710
[Imperial Edict]

294
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,900
By God's will,

295
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,940
His Majesty ordered

296
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,260
Marquis Jing'an, Yin Sishen, to assist Qin Zhao in capturing Lin Xie of the North Kingdom.

297
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Act without fail.

298
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,780
General Yin.

299
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

300
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,150
General Yin,

301
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,980
you must help me.

302
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,820
I'll take revenge for my father-in-law.

303
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,350
I don't need to help anyone.

304
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,860
Your style is to take advantage of others.

305
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,900
The benefits are all yours.

306
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,350
Goodbye.

307
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,870
General Yin,

308
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,180
I hope you can get this done as soon as possible

309
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,110
so that I can return to the capital to see His Majesty.

310
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,570
Lord Qin,

311
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,130
why do we need Marquis Jing'an's help?

312
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,000
Come on.

313
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,280
Can you defeat him?

314
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,210
No.

315
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,940
Neither can I.

316
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,020
Can you defeat General Lin Xie?

317
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,340
No.

318
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,800
It's good to make them fight with each other.

319
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,580
Your Excellency is wise.

320
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,340
Cheers.

321
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,890
Cheers.

322
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,790
It's been a long time since I had a drink so happily like tonight.

323
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,300
It's a meteor.

324
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,940
My father said

325
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,050
everything I say to a shooting star will come true.

326
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,830
I hope I can help Director Liu get the Yinshu Pavilion back as soon as possible.

327
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,660
Lu Tingxiao.

328
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,520
What about you?

329
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,380
I hope the country will be prosperous,

330
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,040
and there will be no more wars.

331
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,960
What about Doctor Yue?

332
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,900
I don't believe your childish stuff.

333
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,260
Just say a wish.

334
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,620
I'll give you a Beggar's Chicken as the reward.

335
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,460
Beggar's Chicken?

336
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,120
You have to keep your promise.

337
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,900
I hope all of you will suffer from love

338
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,050
and never get rid of it.

339
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,579
Leave all the leisure to me.

340
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,780
What about you, dear disciple?

341
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,280
Come on.

342
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,780
I...

343
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,849
I have nothing to say.

344
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,849
It smells so good.

345
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,670
This is the best moment.

346
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,460
Say a wish.

347
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Let's drink.

348
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,400
Let's get drunk today.

349
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,740
Who cares what will happen tomorrow?

350
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,980
Let's drink. Come on.

351
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,740
There is some Immortal Drunk in the kitchen's cellar I've collected privately.

352
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,100
Lu Tingxiao, come with me to get it.

353
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,500
Let's get drunk tonight.

354
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,100
Hurry up.

355
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,420
Go.

356
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,740
Take more.

357
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,120
Hurry back.

358
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,260
His Majesty ordered us to assist General Lin in assassinating Yin Sishen.

359
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,700
Action.

360
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,140
Yes.

361

Wow.

364
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,930
It looks good.

365
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,940
I've hidden it for a long time.

366
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,100
I was going to drink it when I become a top-class matchmaker.

367
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
The wine is very strong.

368
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,030
I'm happy today.

369
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,340
Let's drink it all up.

370

It smells so good.

371
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,860
You can't drink good wine with a cup.

372
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,500
Ling, go get some big bowls.

373
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,460
Okay.

374
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,380
Why didn't you bring them with you?

375
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
How troublesome.

376

It smells good.

377
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,020
No hurry.

378
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,300
Drink slowly.

379
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,780
It's mine.

380

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,020
What a pity.

385
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,980
I have clothes to change in my room.

386
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
Go get one for him.

387
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,220
I'll fetch it.

388
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,860
Sit down.

389
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,800
No need.

390
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,770
I'm not used to

Your clothes are wet.

Wait for me.

402

Don't drink it secretly.

We'll wait for you.

404
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,980
Actually, I can drink all of this alone.

405
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,370
Do you believe it?

406
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:07,860

just trust me.

Okay.

Report the situation here to Lord Qin now.

423

425

Your king ordered you to kill me.

It's hard for you to endure it till now.

429

If I hadn't been poisoned,

430
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
you would have been dead by my sword.

What did you take in my room?

432

Give it to me.

I risked my life to save you.

434

You really let me down.

We don't care if you're from North Kingdom.

438

How can you treat us like this?

439
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,270
I've done so much for you,

440
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,430
and only got your words that you don't care.

441
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,910
What have you done for me?

442
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,740
I treated you like my family.

443

It's just like what General Yin said.

444
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,380
Test you, and we'll know

You chose him in the end.

We can never be a family.

What do you mean?

476
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,010
I killed Lord Lian.

477

Do you really think I like you?

478
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
I wanted to let you fall in love with me

479
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,050
so that I could infiltrate into the South Kingdom with your power.

But I failed because of his appearance.

481
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,100
You treated the foe who had killed your father as your family.

482

What a joke.

No.

you were only 17 years old.

486

Yes.

487
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,090
Who would suspect a teenager?

488
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,860
Lord Lian was still thinking about you before he died.

489

Fang Xianxun,

490

do you like me?

494
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,440
Have you been to the West Kingdom before?

495
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,450
Would you like to go with me?

496
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,220
Taking care of her is my business.

497
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm not entrusted to do it.

498
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,240
If anything happens to my master,

499
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll prepare a coffin for you.

Even if it's a corpse, we must bring it back to the North Kingdom to report to His Majesty.

What should we do?

506
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,220
He must be dead if he went down like that.

507
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,240
Go back and report.

00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,390
Sit down.

518
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,460
What's wrong?

519
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,210
Come here.

520
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,860
What?

521
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,310
How is it?

522
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,340
Hard to discover it, huh?

523
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,860
When the sword pierces you, touch it with this part

524
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,740
The sword comes out from the back.

525
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,140
It's like being pierced.

526
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,620
The blood pack is inside.

527
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,880
The effect looks real. I won't cheat you.

528
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,260
See you.

529
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,780
Cut the crap.

530
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,610
We have to use this special soft sword.

531
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,500
Send it out quickly.

532
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,230
Give it to me.

533
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,820
Sister.

534
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:02,910
Rong'er.

535
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,210
See you.

536
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,570
Found it!

537
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,230
Over there.

538
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,990
General Lin.

539
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,940
You failed to kill Yin Sishen.

540
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,140
How will you explain to His Majesty?

541
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,500
If His Majesty knows

542
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,980
I've got something more important,

543
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,440
[Deployment Map of the South Kingdom]

544
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,020
Deployment map of the South Kingdom?

545
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,680
Do you think he'll forgive me?

546
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,830
General Lin, please go back to the North Kingdom and report to His Majesty.

547
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,460
Are you still worried about him?

548
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,220
You're back.

549
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,060
How is it?

550
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,220
I found this in the grass.

551
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,600
I think he left it in the forest after he went ashore.

552
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,140
Great!

553
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,380
God bless him.

554
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,820
I hope he can be safe.

555
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,340
I also want him to be healthy and live a long life.

556
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,220
You didn't say anything nice when he was here.

557
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,940
You still care about him.

558
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,350
You men are also double-faced.

559
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,100
No.

560
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,700
I just don't want my wife

561
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,630
to worry about other man every day.

562
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,340
I've had enough during this period.

563
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,060
Dear,

564
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,780
let's return to the capital as soon as possible.

565
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,640
I have something important to do.

566
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,910
We don't have to return to the capital in such a hurry, right?

567
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,540
Weren't you in a hurry to go back and divorce General Yin

568
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,540
so as to be with me rightfully?

569
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,140
Why aren't you in a hurry now?

570
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,150
You're so fickle, dear.

571
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,060
Lu Tingxiao,

572
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,560
I haven't settled this with you.

573
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,880
Why are you still calling me Lu Tingxiao?

574
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,580
Shouldn't you call me husband?

575
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,140
Hey.

576
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,220
Stop being lovey-dovey.

577
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,980
There are many people at the door.

578
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,220
Miss Ling can't hold on any longer.
