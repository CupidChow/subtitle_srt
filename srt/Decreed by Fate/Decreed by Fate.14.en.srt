This is called Soul-restoring Powder.

5
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,979
It can transfer the love poison into the lover's body

6
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,420
and let you bear the pain of love poison for her.

7
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,300
Are you willing to take it?

8
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,740
Yes.

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,840
But I want to know

10
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,380
how long do I have left after the poison comes in my body?

11

You were already very weak during the test.

12
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,759
After the blood transfusion,

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,290
it must be more dangerous than her condition.

14
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,990
If the love poison is transferred,

15
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,620
will she be safe?

16
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,580
Of course.

Doctor Yue,

19

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,460
you mustn't tell her about this.

21

I don't know if we can meet again.

27

I told His Majesty I wanted to marry you.

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
It was a shame that

34

on the wedding day,

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,630
I was scared for the first time.

36
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,900
I was afraid that all happiness was a dream.

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,270
No matter what happens,

38

Holding your hands,

we'll grow old together.

42

This is what soldiers say to encourage each other on the battlefield.

Second, bow to your parents.

I've been saying it to you countless times in my heart.

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,700
I wonder what Director Lu likes about her.

176
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,730
Exactly.

177
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,100
She doesn't deserve Director Lu at all.

178
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,590
Put the flower on for me.

179
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,470
Okay.

180
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,180
What's wrong?

181
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,710
Hurry up.

182
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,780
You...

183
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,820
Am I wrong?

184
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,780
I'm shy.

185
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,100
-But since it's something you like, -I'm so mad.

186
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,760
I'll write it down on the list.

187
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:01,930
By the way,

188
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,900
we need to buy some osmanthus cakes.

189
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,060
I want you to buy it for me.

190
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,500
Okay.

191
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
You go back first.

192
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,010
I'll go buy it now.

193
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,100
Wait for me.

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,570
It's

195
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,780
so annoying.

196
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,100
Something happened to Jing.

197
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,620
Director Lu.

198
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
We meet again.

199
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,820
Jing.

200
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,270
Are you alright?

201
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm fine.

202
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,540
Director Lu.

203
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,880
I've heard a lot about you.

204
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,970
Wang Yizhi.

205
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,860
Let's put the romance aside for now.

206
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,940
Let's talk.

207
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,630
I should call you

208
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,980
General Yin.

209
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,580
Give General Yin a seat.

210
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,620
Behave yourself.

211
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,780
What?

212
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,190
Don't you people in Boqing Hall

213
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,100
know he's Yin Sishen?

214
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,900
Jing,

215
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,390
I wanted to tell you.

216
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,440
General Yin didn't come to Pingyang alone this time

217
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,180
only for this crazy girl, right?

218
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,900
You're right.

219
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,820
I did it for her.

220
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,620
Let her go now.

221
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,590
I'll talk to you.

222
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,480
Wang Yizhi.

223
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,380
Since you know he is General Yin,

224
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,100
how dare you act recklessly?

225
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,030
Looks like Miss Jing knows about this.

226
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,230
Since you know he is Yin Sishen,

227
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,940
do you know he has a wife in the capital?

228
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,860
Although he pretends to care about you now,

229
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,500
he is

230
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,900
just acting.

231
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,220
Jing.

232
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,740
Wang Yizhi.

233
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,140
I think you know too little.

234
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,610
If you knew more,

235
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,360
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

236
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,710
I advise you to let us go.

237
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,940
General Yin might give you a way out.

238
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,380
Now the South Kingdom wants to arrest me,

239
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,940
and the North Kingdom wants to kill me.

240
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,020
How can I survive?

241
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,780
Yue Liweng,

242
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,230
The only way to survive...

243
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,180
The only way to survive is that General Yin helps you.

244
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,260
He's the Marquis Jing'an, protecting the kingdom.

245
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,650
He is the one who controls the laws of the South Kingdom.

246
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,110
Only he can keep you alive.

247
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,500
You have to make a choice, dead or alive.

248
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,510
You're sharp-tongued.

249
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,400
Wang Yizhi.

250
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,710
What are you doing?

251
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,460
Stop!

252
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,910
Lu Tingxiao!

253
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,140
Wang Yizhi!

254
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,940
Let her go.

255
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,580
Love Poison?

256
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,080
You are also poisoned by love poison?

257
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,420
Why are you poisoned?

258
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,660
Let her go.

259
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,240
Doctor Yue.

260
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,180
Didn't you say you only used him as the efficacy-enhancing ingredient?

261
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,340
Why was he poisoned?

262
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,340
Jing.

263
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,220
Shut up!

264
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,080
I'm asking him.

265
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,370
Behave yourself.

266
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,540
You bastard!

267
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,240
Who asked you to make the decision for me?

268
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,540
I want to die with you.

269
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,500
Fool.

270
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,970
I want you to live.

271
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,660
Shut up!

272
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,020
Live.

273
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Wang Zhen is here.

274
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,260
Give me the General's Command.

275
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,620
Yin Sishen.

276
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,380
I've given you a chance.

277
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,050
You didn't want it.

278
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,060
Wang Yizhi.

279
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,300
Don't touch her!

280
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,660
Save Jing!

281
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,740
Go!

282
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,940
You?

283
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,900
And me.

284
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,160
Master.

285
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,910
Take the sword.

286
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,910
My disciple.

287
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,380
Sister.

288
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,630
Are you okay?

289
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,740
Hey!

290
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm here.

291
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,380
Two dying people

292
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,260
dare to come to die?

293
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,600
We are here to kill you.

294
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,580
Fine.

295
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,340
I'll grant your wish today.

296
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,460
Hurry up.

297
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,830
Good timing.

298
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,620
-Ling, help! -Young Master.

299
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,940
Young Master, don't go.

300
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,420
Go! Surround them all!

301
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Don't let anyone escape!

302
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,900
Go!

303
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,380
Sister!

304
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,040
Don't move.

305
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,070
Where is the list of the others?

306
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Once you enter Chonglou,

307
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,390
you will fight until death.

308
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,260
Bo-

309
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,900
qing

310
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,260
Hall.

311
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,550
Are you okay?

312
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:02,940
I'm fine.

313
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,510
My disciple.

314
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,740
Master.

315
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,180
Discipal.

316
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,310
Heartless Herb?

317
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
He really went to the Poison Forest?

318
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,580
[Order]

319
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,260
Here is the General's Command.

320
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,180
Open the city gate.

321
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,620
Yes.

322
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,800
Open the city gate.

323
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,860
What happened there?

324
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,480
Poison Forest?

325
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,190
There are more than 100 fatal poisons there.

326
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,970
It's a narrow escape to go there.

327
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,780
He really risked his life for me.

328
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,780
How is he now?

329
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,820
When he fought Wang Yizhi, he used his energy again.

330
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,320
It depends on his fate.

331
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,490
I'll do my best.

332
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,420
Doctor Yue,

333
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,060
please.

334
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,410
Please save him.

335
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,380
He can't die.

336
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,340
Or you can use me as the efficacy-enhancing ingredient

337
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,260
and let those poisonous snakes bite me.

338
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,580
I can eat

339
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,780
all kinds of poisons.

340
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,540
Please save him.

341
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,740
Please.

342
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,420
Girl.

343
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,650
Please get up.

344
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,360
Get up.

345
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,100
What you said

346
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,270
is useless to his injury.

347
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,900
We have to rely on him

348
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,050
to recover.

349
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,380
Let's wait and see if he can survive today.

350
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,540
Girl.

351
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,860
Where is Lu Tingxiao?

352
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,670
We have Heartless Herb.

353
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,060
Ling also found the ginseng of ten thousand years.

354
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,100
If the ratio of the main medicine and the ingredients is wrong,

355
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,340
the antidote will become poison immediately.

356
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,060
I need at least one or two days to make the antidote.

357
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,740
Miss Ling,

358
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,620
take it.

359
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,830
Go get the medicine.

360
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,060
No.

361
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,110
We need to find another doctor.

362
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,150
What?

363
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,780
You still don't believe me?

364
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,890
I told you if I cannot cure the poison,

365
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,660
then no one can cure it in the world.

366
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,980
He is the general of the South Kingdom.

367
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,890
If you find some ordinary doctors,

368
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,620
I'm afraid they can't even recognize the poison.

369
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,620
You know he's the general of the South Kingdom.

370
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,100
You know he can't be hurt.

371
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,170
How dare you transfer the love poison to him?

372
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,490
He begged me to transfer the love poison.

373
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,430
Lu Tingxiao!

374
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,220
Oh no.

375
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,880
He lost too much blood.

376
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
What should we do?

377
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,580
You used his blood during the poison transfer.

378
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,820
You can transfer some blood back to him.

379
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,860
But your body is also weak.

380
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Stop hesitating.

381
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,700
He gave me my life. I must save him.

382
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,540
Okay.

383
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,580
Okay.

384
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,620
This is lamb intestine and bamboo needle.

385
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,880
It can transfer your blood into his body.

386
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,740
You have such a strange method?

387
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,750
Little girl,

388
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,760
don't think I only know medicine.

389
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm also good at making traps.

390
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,980
What are these?

391
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,850
Don't break them.

392
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,340
You two must be safe.

393
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,740
How is it?

394
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,260
What?

395
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,540
Miss,

396
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,650
bring me the tray.

397
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,140
Alright.

398
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,340
Take them all over.

399
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,060
It's hot.

400
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,790
Give it to me.

401
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,500
My sister's body might not be alright to continue like this.

402
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,940
You will be fine.

403
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,780
Awake.

404
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,910
They're both awake.

405
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,620
I knew it.

406
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,110
Why are you here?

407
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,820
Shut up!

408
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,780
Lu Tingxiao.

409
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,070
Aren't you amazing?

410
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,990
How did you end up like this?

411
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,820
That useless Wang Yizhi

412
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,300
should have chopped you before he died.

413
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,410
Move your foot.

414
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,990
Lu Tingxiao!

415
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
I'll kill you!

416
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,020
Come on.

417
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,630
Don't you dare touch me.

418
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,120
What are you doing?

419
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,660
How dare you fight?

420
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:37,930
Doctor Yue.

421
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,500
Hurry up.

422
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,140
Check them.

423
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,050
You two brats.

424
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,420
We cannot leave for a moment.

425
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,180
Come on.

426
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,340
Hand.

427
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,250
Give me your hand.

428
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:44,780
Give me your hand.
