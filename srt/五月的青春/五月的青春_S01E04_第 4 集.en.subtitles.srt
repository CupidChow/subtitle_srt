1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,946
Her recovery is slow.

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,157
I can't say for sure
how long she'll hold out.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,492
Hui-tae, you'll be a great doctor.

4
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,704
I only accepted you as my son
because I believed you would prove useful.

5
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,623
Hui-tae!

6
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,127
Please save Seok-chul! Please!

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,777
You're up.

8
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,279
You should have some hangover soup.

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,906
Yes.

10
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,159
Where is Myeong-hee?

11
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,230
Myeong-hee.

12
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,275
I'm ready to be hurt.

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,366
Do you want to go out with me
until the end of May?

14
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,877
Let's talk later.

15
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,923
I'll give you my answer

16
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,467
when you're sober.

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,143
Ms. Kim.

18
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,813
The manager says to stop by before lunch
for a meeting.

19
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,690
Okay, I will.

20
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,568
By the way,

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,611
do you have a fever?

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,489
Your face looks a bit flushed.

23
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,370
Maybe it's my spring tan.

24
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,552
My goodness.

25
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,019
So everyone is available
next week, right?

26
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,187
You made such a big fuss in the morning,

27
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,315
so I thought it was about
something important.

28
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,441
It is important.

29
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,401
Everyone in Seoul
wants Gwangju's confirmation

30
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,112
and vice versa.
You're all just putting it off.

31
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,322
Anyway,

32
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,866
I'll give this date to those in Seoul.

33
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,286
What is your relationship with Ms. Jang?

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,206
She's neither your family nor your spouse.

35
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,460
Why are you putting in so much time,
money, and effort?

36
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,378
I have to say, I'm really curious.

37
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,179
I'd say, we're offender and victim.

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
Let's leave it at that.

39
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,310
One, two, one, two. Halt!

40
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,645
-One, two!
-One, two!

41
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,900
What are you doing?

42
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,570
I told you not to show
that you're a leftist nerd.

43
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,198
Private Kim Gyeong-su!

44
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,199
I wasn't

45
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,034
studying, sir.

46
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,577
Hand it over.

47
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,497
About, face!

48
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,374
You dimwit.

49
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,335
Must you always be one step behind?
You drive me crazy.

50
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,004
Here it is, sir.

51
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,720
My gosh. A letter?

52
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,391
Are you planning a secret rendezvous
with your comrades outside?

53
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,940
Even going forward, you're not allowed to

54
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,359
send letters or make any phone calls.

55
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,820
Answer me!

56
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,405
Yes, sir!

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,623
Yes, we'd like
to transfer patient Jang Seok-chul.

58
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,337
Right, we made the decision
with the risks in mind.

59
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,258
The hospital in Gwangju
can do it next week.

60
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,094
Two weeks?

61
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,390
Can we expedite it a little?

62
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,975
As you know,
the patient's current condition…

63
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,727
Aren't you going to have lunch?

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,687
-You go ahead.
-Okay.

65
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes, I'm aware.

66
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,408
Right, so…

67
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,827
That's why…

68
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,966
Yes. Please kindly look into it,
Professor.

69
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,099
Myeong-hee.

70
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,562
What brings you to the hospital?

71
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,815
I have a bad hangover.

72
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,485
I was hoping to
get some IV fluids in the ER.

73
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,237
It doesn't look like
that's why you're here.

74
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,656
What is it? Did something happen?

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,992
No, it's nothing.

76
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,496
I have to say, you're so mean.

77
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,873
Why didn't you wake me up
when you were heading out?

78
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,375
I can't believe you just left me there.

79
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,252
You were sound asleep.

80
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,172
If it's something to do
with the hospital, I could…

81
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,299
You didn't wake me up
because I was sound asleep?

82
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,887
Does it mean you peeked at me
when I was sleeping?

83
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,724
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,143
Anyone could see
that you were fast asleep.

85
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,231
Sure, all right.

86
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,361
I have a tutoring session later.
I'll see you at home.

87
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:50,034
It sounds like we live together,
doesn't it?

88
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,747
Nonsense.

89
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,667
Get going already.

90
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,506
See you later.

91
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,686
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

92
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,442
Oh, dear.

93
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,319
You talked about going abroad
since you first came.

94
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,196
Are you finally going?

95
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,867
You're aware that even if you submit
this resignation letter,

96
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,702
you have to work for a month, right?

97
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:37,248
I'll work extra hard until I leave,
so don't you worry.

98
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,923
Hello?

99
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,425
Hey, Myeong-hee.

100
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,636
Today? Sure, I have time.

101
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,763
Why?

102
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,974
Did Hwang Hui-tae bother you again?

103
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,313
I'm glad to hear that.
Do you want to come over after work?

104
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,780
Su-chan, aren't you going to work?

105
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,742
Auntie is coming over today.

106
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,785
Right.

107
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,456
I guess I'll have to meet Myeong-hee
somewhere else.

108
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,001
No need for that.

109
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,546
We have plenty of food at home.
Tell her to come over.

110
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,758
Gosh, I don't want to hear
Auntie's nagging.

111
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,178
She'll start nagging me now
since you'll be getting married soon.

112
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,096
Who says I'm getting married?

113
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,849
Aren't you about to? I'm sure I'm not.

114
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,978
Why? Did you two fight again?

115
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,069
I told you that you have the wrong number.
How many times is this already?

116
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,575
Ma'am, who was that?

117
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,495
The thing is,

118
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,373
someone keeps calling since this morning

119
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,792
asking if this is some kind
of publishing company.

120
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,794
Wait, I received that call too.

121
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,629
Wasn't it Jihye Publishing?

122
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,673
Oh, yes. You're right.

123
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,883
That…

124
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,805
-Gosh.
-My goodness, Su-ryeon.

125
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,683
Su-chan, I have to go somewhere.

126
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,935
What? I thought
Myeong-hee was coming over.

127
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,314
If she comes, tell her to wait in my room.

128
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,275
Wait a minute…

129
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,819
Hey, Su-ryeon!

130
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,999
Sir, I'm from Jihye Publishing.

131
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,511
Hey.

132
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,598
No one is coming after you,
so you can eat slowly.

133
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,601
Take off your shoes too.

134
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,109
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

135
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,154
I couldn't call anyone, not even my house.

136
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,451
Has anything been decided in Seoul?

137
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,873
They've decided to hold a full protest,
and the leaders will get together

138
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,667
on the ninth at Korea University
to set up a plan.

139
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,379
How are things at the university?

140
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,049
Pretty much the same.

141
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,594
We'll shift the focus
from government-funded professors

142
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,179
to demanding the withdrawal
of martial law.

143
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,514
We're still working closely
with Chosun University

144
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,810
and trying our best to fill your shoes,
so don't worry.

145
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,231
Won-seok, are you in there?

146
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,650
You have a call.

147
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,361
He says his name is Sang-min.

148
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,820
Sang-min?

149
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,199
Wait.

150
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,827
I never told her my name.

151
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,172
Won-seok, come out while I'm being nice.

152
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,803
What are you doing? Get out of here!

153
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,238
Why isn't she coming?

154
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,615
LEE JI-EUN, 22, EWHA WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

155
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,868
This young lady is the youngest daughter
of Baekwoon Textiles.

156
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,330
She may be young,
but I hear she's an elegant lady.

157
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,748
-Auntie.
-What?

158
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,418
I'm really not interested in blind dates.

159
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,504
Why you little…

160
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,048
You'll turn 30 soon!

161
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,300
If you keep living
as a lonely old bachelor,

162
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,802
you'll humiliate our family.

163
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,973
You should tie the knot before Su-ryeon
so people don't talk behind our backs.

164
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,308
Goodness, this is driving me crazy.

165
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,979
Hey, Myeong-hee. Are you leaving already?

166
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,105
Yes.

167
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,066
-I'd better get going.
-Hey.

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,570
Did you say you're Su-ryeon's friend?
Can you come and look at this with me?

169
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,238
Look at what?

170
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,574
Women are a better judge of women,
I tell you.

171
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,243
Why don't you come and have a seat?
Come on.

172
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,788
CHOI EUN-JI, 26
LEE JI-EUN, 22

173
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,167
Who do you think is the best candidate?

174
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,502
Number 1 is 26 years old.

175
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,921
She's the eldest daughter of a judge.

176
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,256
Number 2 is…

177
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,718
twenty-two years old.
The youngest of Baekwoon Textiles.

178
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,221
-Number 3 is 24…
-Auntie!

179
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,230
Who do you think you're yelling at?

180
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,400
Why don't you
choose someone yourself then?

181
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,197
Naive guys like you
always let cunning girls coax you

182
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,365
and end up bringing home the worst girls.

183
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,534
Auntie, you'd better go now.

184
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,703
Are you kicking me out right now?

185
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,956
I'll take care of myself,
so please mind your own business.

186
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,959
What? Hey, Su-chan,
how can you say that to me?

187
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,544
-Please just go.
-Let go.

188
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,631
Let go of me. I said, let go!

189
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,467
Am I a stranger to you? I'm your aunt!

190
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,636
Please! Go!

191
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,182
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,143
She's a very feisty woman.

193
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,063
She's just doing that
to find you a perfect match.

194
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,066
They all seemed like great candidates.

195
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,905
I bet your aunt
is going through so much for you

196
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,698
since you're so picky.

197
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,076
What? I'm not picky.

198
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,328
I just don't like blind dates.

199
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,582
It's not like someone
can meet their other half

200
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,001
based on some silly matchmaking cards.

201
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,799
I'll look around too.
There are plenty of girls around me.

202
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,510
What's your ideal type?

203
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,480
Someone who's like a wildflower, I guess?

204
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,404
Someone who never gives up on her dream
no matter how hard it is

205
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,241
and never complains about
having to devote herself to her family.

206
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,956
A strong person that says no
to a sheltered life.

207
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,925
That's you.

208
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,636
Aren't I right?

209
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,055
Your ideal type
is a female version of yourself.

210
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,267
Gosh, it'll be very hard
to find someone like that.

211
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,441
"IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME"
LOVE AND PEACE

212
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,166
Then who is Myeong-hee's favorite singer?

213
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,710
I'm not sure.

214
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,837
Bae In-sook?

215
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,130
Bae In-sook.

216
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,758
Then what is Myeong-hee's favorite snack?

217
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,053
Sweet bean jelly and butter bread?

218
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,555
Sweet red bean jelly and butter bread?

219
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,225
But what does this have to do with math?

220
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,898
It's a necessary step
to figure out your study pattern.

221
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,567
Your previous tutor
used to be Myeong-hee, right?

222
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,695
If you don't review your past,
you will never move forward.

223
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,450
Jin-a?

224
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,327
I have a new dream.

225
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,580
If I win an award
at the University Song Festival,

226
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,291
I want you to play my song
on the radio show

227
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,584
that you produce in the future.

228
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,629
And the DJ will say,

229
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,130
"This is the musician

230
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,466
that our producer discovered
before anyone else."

231
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,551
-Hui-tae.
-What do you think?

232
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,720
Will you help me achieve my dream?

233
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,644
Then will you help me achieve my dream?

234
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,731
Can you show me around Seoul
this summer break?

235
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,818
Show me TBC's broadcasting station
and your university!

236
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,911
If you promise you'll do
all the homework I give you.

237
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
I promise.

238
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,498
From here…

239
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,500
to here.

240
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,171
You want me to solve all these questions?

241
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,842
Yes. If you start now, you'll probably
be done in about two days.

242
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,051
You can do it!

243
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,138
-I can do it!
-Jin-a can do it! Repeat it three times!

244
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,432
-I can do it!
-I can do it!

245
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,283
1 P.M., VISIT SARANG ORPHANAGE

246
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,993
It's tomorrow.

247
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,891
They might be fake coughs, but you sound
like you're coughing up a lung.

248
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,810
Gosh…

249
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,773
Do you want to go have some butter bread
at the bakery?

250
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,318
Or listen to Bae In-sook
at the coffee shop?

251
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,197
We could also go to the bookstore
and read some poetry.

252
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,449
Who tutored who now?

253
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:04,249
So aren't you going to tell me
why you came to the hospital earlier?

254
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,089
Goodness. I said it's nothing.

255
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,758
You're being awfully suspicious.

256
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,428
You don't strike me as the secretive type.

257
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,015
So I wonder just what it is
you're keeping from me.

258
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,229
Give me an answer first,
and I'll tell you.

259
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,026
-An answer?
-Yes, an answer.

260
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,532
I've sobered up completely.

261
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,868
I'll give you my answer

262
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,454
when you're sober.

263
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,298
-Gosh.
-You should leave now.

264
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,468
Why? Are you still not ready
to give me an answer?

265
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,221
I have to study later,

266
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,641
and I'm pretty beat after my long shift.

267
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,769
Anyway, get going now.

268
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,980
All right. Are you free tomorrow?

269
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,190
-I don't.
-You're lying!

270
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,985
It's true.

271
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,486
I have somewhere to be.

272
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,779
I'll come with you.

273
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,323
You don't even know where.

274
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,993
What? Is it somewhere I can't go?

275
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,915
Suit yourself then.

276
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,458
Really? Are you sure?

277
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,752
Meet me at the bus stop at 11 a.m.

278
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,671
You volunteered to go.

279
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,507
Sure.

280
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,350
So I guess we meet again.

281
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,729
I never imagined I'd see you here though.

282
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,398
Eat first.

283
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,401
You'll need the energy for later.

284
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,237
I don't know anything.

285
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,827
If you mean about the wanted man
that you were with,

286
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,038
he got caught.

287
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,960
I guess you're very trusted by your gang.

288
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,713
He didn't doubt you even for a second.

289
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,133
Have you been spying on me?

290
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:23,805
Well, let's just say I'm interested
in my future daughter-in-law.

291
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,225
Who says I'm going to be
your daughter-in-law?

292
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,734
Do you remember the company,
Bongdeok Brewery?

293
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,277
About ten years ago,

294
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,780
they were number one
in the entire Honam region.

295
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,909
In an effort to expand
throughout the country,

296
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,162
the chairman made his daughter
marry a man in the KCIA,

297
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,747
but something went wrong.

298
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,040
Then, the company

299
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,918
went out of business
after a series of tax audits.

300
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,129
The son-in-law was demoted
to South Jeolla Province.

301
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,511
That's how things are in this field.

302
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,933
They never force you
into the direction they want you to go.

303
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,606
They just slowly bleed
those around you dry

304
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,441
until you go in the right direction.

305
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,239
But human nature is a funny thing.

306
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,575
As you remain quiet,

307
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,414
you feel like you're worse
than the one bleeding everyone dry.

308
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,542
So…

309
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,131
keep your mouth shut

310
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,092
as long as you want.

311
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,818
Right now,

312
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,613
your father must be busy
with the new factory.

313
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,658
So an engagement ceremony will do.

314
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,746
Also,

315
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,000
this is my limit.

316
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,045
Make sure you don't cross the line again.

317
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,592
Get some sleep

318
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,927
or meditate if you like.

319
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,409
Hui-tae. Please save Seok-chul.

320
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,954
Hui-tae! Please save Seok-chul! Please!

321
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,040
Hui-tae!

322
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,628
Please save her.

323
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,049
I must be getting weak.

324
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,511
I'm even hearing things now.

325
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,056
Jeong-tae.

326
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,522
Jeong-tae, open the door.

327
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,698
I'm joining the camp.

328
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,123
Later. Later, okay?

329
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,542
Dad is on edge lately.

330
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,127
Later when?

331
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,713
I bet you'll make me quit track next year.

332
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,425
Stop acting like a little child.

333
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,927
Do you really want me to look
like a complete fool?

334
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,013
Why? You don't have to.

335
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,349
This is why people call you
a mistress behind you.

336
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,228
What?

337
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,069
Well…

338
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,488
I'm going to the bathroom.

339
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,137
Where is Jeong-tae?

340
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,473
Is he still in bed?

341
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,061
He's at school. He left early today.

342
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,731
This early? He's still in grade school.

343
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,198
He said he had to leave early
and do some homework.

344
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,532
Homework?

345
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,704
I saw him leave.

346
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,873
He doesn't have homework.

347
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,380
I just recommended a few books to him
that he should read before middle school.

348
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,637
-You recommended books to him?
-It wasn't a friendly recommendation.

349
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,932
I told him all the sports
could make him stupid,

350
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,184
and he rushed to the library right away.

351
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,687
He's still a little kid after all.

352
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,944
At home, maybe.

353
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,321
At his age, I was already earning my rent.

354
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,366
Hae-ryeong, you shouldn't be
so protective of him.

355
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,803
Myeong-hee!

356
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,693
Well, first off, some boiled eggs.

357
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,739
And some soda for when we get thirsty.

358
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:01,369
Last but not least,
your favorite, butter bread.

359
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,541
You don't even know where we're going.
Do you think this is a picnic?

360
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,961
It's a picnic whenever I'm with you.

361
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,299
Wait. What did you bring? Show me.

362
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,093
I didn't bring anything special.

363
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,306
Come on.
I see you packed a bunch of stuff.

364
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,393
-Show me.
-No.

365
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,811
No, because you hate me?

366
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,396
-No.
-Come on. Hand it over.

367
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,023
-I just…
-Let me see.

368
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,400
Look at this. It's so heavy.

369
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,074
Sweet red bean jelly.

370
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,952
Candy? My gosh.

371
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,288
What's this?

372
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,960
Herbal breath refresher?
Are you trying to quit smoking?

373
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,838
No, that's for…
Just in case I get car sick.

374
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,301
Oh, boy.

375
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,971
The more I get to know you,

376
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,182
the more I think
that you're like an old man.

377
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,975
Goodness. Give it back!

378
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,728
It's not like
you're all that sophisticated.

379
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,112
Grandpa Myeong-hee.

380
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,323
I shall peel an egg
for Grandpa Myeong-hee.

381
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,784
What? "Grandpa Myeong-hee"?

382
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,216
I have to say,

383
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,137
you're always so chipper, Hui-tae.

384
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,560
That sounded a little sarcastic.

385
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,980
No, it was a compliment.

386
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,482
Do I sound sarcastic when I talk?

387
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,902
No.

388
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,032
Here.

389
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,244
Where are we going anyway?

390
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,039
Tell me.

391
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,333
Come on, tell me!

392
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,296
Jae-young!

393
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,173
The witch is here!

394
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,218
Did they just call you a witch?

395
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,137
I gave them vaccination shots
last time I saw them.

396
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,764
Reverend Mother!

397
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,684
Myeong-hee!

398
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,436
SARANG ORPHANAGE

399
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,729
My gosh.

400
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,734
I thought you wouldn't be able to come.
Aren't you really busy at the moment?

401
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,943
No.

402
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,696
-How have you been?
-I've been well.

403
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,408
By the way, who is this young man?

404
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,120
This is…

405
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,252
-I'm Myeong-hee's…
-He's a doctor.

406
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,796
What?

407
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,381
My gosh, you're a doctor?

408
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,802
That's great. We have a few kids
who need to see a doctor.

409
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,887
No, I'm not yet…

410
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,307
He just got his medical license.
He's a rookie doctor.

411
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,269
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

412
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,707
Myeong-hee, I can't treat patients.

413
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,503
-I told you I haven't even graduated--
-You passed the medical licensing exam.

414
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,422
You only deferred your graduation
for the festival.

415
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,889
No. I really can't do this.

416
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,182
I'll do something else.

417
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,393
I can clean, carry heavy things…

418
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm good with kids too.

419
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,022
You don't have to treat them.
Just examine them.

420
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,358
I'm not asking you to do surgery
or anything.

421
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,902
Just examine the kids
to make sure they're all well.

422
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,988
You've done that much in school,
haven't you?

423
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,368
Well, I have a lot to do.

424
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,162
I trust you'll do a good job.

425
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,789
Gosh.

426
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,732
Let me listen to your tummy for a second.

427
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,737
You're all good.

428
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,913
Can you open your mouth? Open wide.

429
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,541
There you go. Look up. Good.

430
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,710
Stick it out even further.

431
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,588
This might sting a little.

432
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,435
-He'll get better soon.
-Thank you, Doctor.

433
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,448
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

434
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,625
Kids take twice as much energy
as grown-ups, right?

435
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,544
What…

436
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,547
Well…

437
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,679
Why are you more tired
when I did all the hard work?

438
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,306
Are you okay?

439
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,392
It looked like you were sweating a lot.

440
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,645
Well, that's because…

441
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,731
my blood sugar level dropped.

442
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,151
This is great.

443
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,948
I was debating whether I should
stuff myself with the grass or the soil.

444
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,118
It's like we communicate
through telepathy.

445
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,496
My energy level is shooting back up!

446
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,336
Just don't become a pediatrician
in the future.

447
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,299
I'll go and finish up some work.

448
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,510
-Stay here and rest up.
-I can help you.

449
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,638
Forget it. It's only some paperwork.

450
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,141
Enjoy the bread.

451
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,183
But…

452
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,781
Oh, dear.

453
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,373
Hi there.

454
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,960
We haven't met.

455
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,134
Do you want some?

456
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,597
Here you go.

457
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,143
Slow down.

458
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,272
By the way,

459
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,984
how do you know that good-looking doctor?

460
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,154
This is the first time
you've brought someone along

461
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,989
apart from Hye-gun and Seon-min.

462
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,413
For a nun, you sure are interested
in relationships between men and women.

463
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,791
I knew it.

464
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,834
So is it that kind of relationship?

465
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,338
That's not what I mean. What I mean is,

466
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,632
we're a man and a woman,
biologically speaking.

467
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,966
That's all.

468
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,096
Myeong-hee.

469
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,683
Something's wrong with the kid.

470
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,028
Young-mi.

471
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,864
Open your eyes. Young-mi.

472
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,956
Did you perhaps give her something to eat?

473
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,585
I gave her some bread.
The bread you gave me.

474
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,757
She has gastroenteritis
and is not allowed to eat.

475
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,307
It's okay. Goodness.

476
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,268
It's okay.

477
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,895
Keep going, Young-mi. Don't worry.

478
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,574
Hui-tae, it's okay.

479
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,871
Hui-tae.

480
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,207
Hui-tae!

481
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,751
Yes.

482
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,379
It's okay.

483
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,132
It's nothing serious. She's okay now.

484
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,766
I'll go get some water.

485
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,101
No, I'll go.

486
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,937
Sit down and get some rest.

487
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,272
I'll be right back.

488
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,889
Hey, wait!

489
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,351
Hey, can you please not do this
during exam season?

490
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,728
Just take him to the hospital.

491
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,648
You know I brought him here
because I can't do that.

492
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,622
Please be gentle.

493
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,793
You won't find a surgeon

494
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,129
who'd be gentler
even at a university hospital.

495
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,506
That's true.

496
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,883
He's the top student at our med school.

497
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,760
-We call him Hua Tuo.
-Hua Tuo, my foot.

498
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,179
I'll stitch your lips together.

499
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,974
Hua Tuo?
Is my specialty treating fugitives?

500
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,811
What if I get caught doing this
and get expelled?

501
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,896
Will you take responsibility
for my future?

502
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,025
Yes, I should.
I'll write lyrics while you compose songs.

503
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,736
We'll win first place
at the University Song Festival.

504
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,905
You troublemaker.

505
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,033
At this rate, we'll be dragged
to Namsan first.

506
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,290
Seriously! Stay still
while I'm stitching the wound.

507
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,543
-Careful. Watch your step.
-Thanks.

508
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,634
Hui-tae, you'll be a great doctor.

509
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,138
Go write some lyrics
for the song festival.

510
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,390
Don't use the night school
as an excuse to date.

511
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,350
Hey, what are you talking about?

512
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,227
You know what I'm talking about.

513
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,896
I can tell from the lyrics
you've been writing!

514
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,028
Hey.

515
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,448
Don't bring anyone else, please.

516
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,616
Thanks.

517
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,577
-Get going.
-Bye.

518
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,911
Bye.

519
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,350
Hey, do you realize what time it is?

520
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,186
Hui-tae.

521
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,855
Please save Seok-chul.

522
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,828
Her pulse is weak,

523
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,997
and she's lost a lot of blood.

524
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,999
You should take her to the hospital.

525
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,043
No, not the hospital.

526
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,254
I know you brought her to me
because you can't.

527
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,422
Darn it.

528
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,094
You know the small clinic down the street?

529
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,470
Knock on the door,
and someone will come out.

530
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,971
Tell them I sent you.
It's my friend's clinic.

531
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,223
Okay.

532
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,899
Hui-tae.

533
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,402
Save her.

534
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,446
You must save her, no matter what.

535
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,281
Okay. You need to hurry.

536
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,003
Darn it.

537
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,592
Gosh, this is crazy.

538
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,568
Stop!

539
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,905
-Let go! Let go of me!
-Stay still!

540
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,365
-Let go of me.
-Hey!

541
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,408
Cuff this punk.

542
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,913
Please…

543
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,542
Can someone please come
and help me? Anyone?

544
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,227
Hui-tae.

545
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,815
Hui-tae.

546
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,553
I'm not qualified to be a doctor.

547
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,227
I chose this path
because I wanted to treat the ill,

548
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,523
but everything I touch…

549
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,775
just breaks.

550
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,163
Maybe your heart is the one
that is broken.

551
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,794
You know,

552
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,672
we don't decide who lives or dies.

553
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,508
That decision is up to the Almighty.

554
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,845
All we can do is do our best
within the lines…

555
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,307
drawn by the Almighty.

556
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:49,066
And if I may share my opinion as someone

557
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,986
who's working in the same field,

558
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,739
I know for a fact…

559
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,494
that you'll be a great doctor.

560
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,541
You're beating yourself up like this
because you're a very responsible person.

561
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,378
And people like that are hard to come by.

562
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,096
I'm not being sarcastic.

563
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,373
There.

564
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,750
I can't believe you did this
knowing what's going on.

565
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,752
Aren't you ashamed to face your family?

566
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,463
I've never done anything to be ashamed of.

567
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,591
How could you say that after humiliating
me in front of your future father-in-law?

568
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,301
Dad.

569
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,223
I won't get married.

570
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,225
What? What are you talking about?

571
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,853
I just couldn't muster up the courage
to say this to you.

572
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,648
I have no interest in getting married

573
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,400
and getting involved
with that kind of family.

574
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,361
That family will help our business.

575
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,737
What?

576
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,324
The company is about to go bust,
so I couldn't turn down their offer.

577
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,326
All my enemies want my business
to go bust.

578
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,122
And my daughter jumps into flames
with gunpowder in her hand every time.

579
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,124
So what choice do I have?

580
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,875
Dad!

581
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,335
It's already decided.

582
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,339
Earlier today, your brother met
the investor they put us in touch with.

583
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,844
Technical partnerships are already
very common in other countries.

584
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,514
The construction for the factory
is expected to be completed soon.

585
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,015
So I'm certain we can start

586
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,685
selling the products
by the end of this year.

587
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,520
LEE SU-CHAN
CHANGHWA PHARMACEUTICALS

588
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,856
This isn't some kids' game.
We can't just back out

589
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,816
because we've now changed our minds.

590
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,651
With just one word,
he can make companies go bankrupt

591
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:38,861
and make people disappear.

592
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,322
You, of all people,
must know what Mr. Hwang is capable of.

593
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,075
Just get married.

594
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,454
I don't care if people criticize me
for selling off my daughter.

595
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,205
Our family

596
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,250
is already on the back of the tiger.
If we fall off,

597
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,587
we'll get eaten alive.

598
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,155
-What…
-I can go on my own from here.

599
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,033
Why? Let me go with you.
We're almost there anyway.

600
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,160
That's why I can go alone.

601
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,704
Jin-a might cause a fuss if she sees us.

602
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,124
She's probably busy
doing her homework right now.

603
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,876
I can go alone.

604
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,838
Okay then.

605
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,966
I enjoyed today's picnic, Myeong-hee.

606
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,176
Handshake?

607
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,562
Me too. Thank you for everything today.

608
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,244
Look back.

609
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,120
Look back.

610
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,415
Look back.

611
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,251
Look back…

612
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,670
Look back!

613
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,389
Hey!

614
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,474
Gosh.

615
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,603
I was wishing you'd look back.
Did you hear it?

616
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,692
I'll give you my answer…

617
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,944
tomorrow.

618
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,120
Can't you answer me today?

619
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,415
There's something I need to sort out.

620
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,793
I'll tell you tomorrow afternoon
after my shift.

621
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,878
Here.

622
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,532
HEAD OF ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATION,
HWANG GI-NAM

623
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,230
KIM MYEONG-HEE

624
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,734
FATHER, KIM HYEON-CHEOL

625
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,909
KIM HYEON-CHEOL, CHOI SUN-NYEO,
KIM MYEONG-SU

626
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,060
-Hello?
-Hey, Su-ryeon.

627
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,397
What happened the other day?
I couldn't reach you.

628
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,233
Hey, Myeong-hee.

629
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,319
Something suddenly came up that day.

630
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,115
What? Is it something serious?

631
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,743
No. It's not serious at all.

632
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,829
So, what's up?

633
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,209
Can I see you before I go to work later?

634
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,128
The thing is…

635
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,755
I have something to tell you.

636
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,265
Sorry, I don't have time today.

637
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,810
I have plans.

638
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,063
WATCH REPAIR

639
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,404
Can I get my watch repaired now?

640
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,116
You'll have to wait about 15 minutes.

641
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,326
Can't you look at mine first?

642
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,370
I just need a new battery.

643
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,038
Let me see it.

644
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,798
THE BLUE HOUSE

645
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,891
Look who it is.

646
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,726
Aren't you Hyeon-cheol?

647
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,021
How have you been?

648
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,690
Is your mother still alive?

649
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,741
Just tell me what you want.

650
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,328
There's no need to be so edgy.

651
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,538
I just came to get a new battery
and see you as well.

652
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,248
We're old neighborhood friends after all.

653
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,799
I see your daughter
is having a lot of fun lately.

654
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,010
Keep a good eye on your daughter.

655
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,595
She's not a kid anymore.

656
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,014
I won't go easy now.

657
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,028
You don't have to pay me.

658
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,161
I'll see you later.

659
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,799
Let me say it again.

660
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,469
The most important thing in track
is the line.

661
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:26,017
Especially when you run,
if you cross into another runner's track,

662
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,105
you may get disqualified
for deviating from your track.

663
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,025
Hence, do not trespass
into another runner's zone,

664
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:38,530
and always stay within your line
and run as fast as you can.

665
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,408
That's my main point.

666
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,828
-Can I help you?
- yes.

667
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,873
Is there a boy named Myeong-su here?

668
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,291
That's me.

669
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,961
Dad.

670
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,339
Be careful, you might fall down.

671
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,426
Why are you here?
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

672
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,510
No reason.

673
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,139
I missed my little bear, so I came early.

674
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,434
How is Myeong-hee doing?

675
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,852
She's doing fine.

676
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,147
Father, I shortened my record
by two seconds.

677
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,026
My coach told me that I can run
with the middle schooler next time.

678
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,485
Is that so?

679
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,196
Gosh, that's amazing, son.

680
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,949
Are you getting along well
with the other kids?

681
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,328
Well, almost all of them,
except for one guy.

682
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,501
Hey. Are you Myeong-su's friend?

683
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,965
Speak of the devil.

684
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,218
Man, that annoying jerk.

685
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,846
Don't say that to a friend.

686
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:53,104
Here. I bought plenty,
so share it with the others.

687
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,857
Wait, isn't this pulbbang?

688
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,234
Gosh, you didn't have to.

689
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,405
My goodness.
Where did you learn to say that?

690
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,741
You don't have to say that to me.

691
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,084
It's good.

692
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,169
Hey, let's go this way.

693
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,671
I told you!

694
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,423
I told you it's this way.

695
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,634
Come on, let's go.

696
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,220
-Hurry up, it's this way.
-Okay.

697
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,271
I'd better get going now.

698
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,107
Already?

699
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,277
You should come meet my coach
and the place I'm staying at.

700
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,489
It's okay, there's no need.

701
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,618
Your mom sent some clothes and underwear.

702
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,163
You should go now. Go on.

703
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,252
Go on.

704
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,462
Go on now.

705
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,403
Hey, isn't that pulbbang?

706
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,907
Let's go inside and eat it
before the others see us.

707
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,244
Shall I call Jeong-tae over?

708
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,127
Let's just keep it a secret.

709
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,102
Do it again! That's so funny.

710
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,768
I don't have time for bickering today.
Get straight to the point.

711
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,607
I met your father yesterday
at the Defense Security Command.

712
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,859
He tried to threaten me

713
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,112
into getting engaged to you.

714
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,325
That's my father's specialty. So?

715
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,956
Your family's getting involved
in my father's business.

716
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,999
Did you know that?

717
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,132
How would I have known?

718
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,010
Like I said,

719
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,389
we won't be able to back out
if things get serious.

720
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,852
So what's your plan?

721
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,898
My father's factory

722
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,734
will be built in a month.

723
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,533
Let's keep this up until then.

724
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,870
After that, I'll do as you say.

725
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,417
Once the factory is finished,

726
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,378
should we get engaged
so the factory runs smoothly

727
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,631
and even get married
until the business takes off?

728
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,091
I don't need your sarcasm.

729
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,010
This is driving me crazy as it is.

730
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,179
Fine. I'll be straightforward then.

731
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,221
I don't want to.

732
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,975
-You don't want to?
-No.

733
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,607
Then what about my father's business?
What about my family?

734
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,735
Look, don't put all the blame on me.

735
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,111
You started all this.

736
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,446
Hwang Hui-tae.

737
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:33,426
Let's tell the truth
and take responsibility equally.

738
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,096
We shouldn't cross the line
just to save ourselves now.

739
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,065
If you need someone
to beg for forgiveness with you,

740
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,775
call me.

741
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,883
Why did you do that?

742
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,054
I mean, earlier.

743
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,181
Why did you punch him?

744
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,477
Just because. I couldn't stand him.

745
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,647
You're impossible.

746
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,858
Didn't you hear
what the coach said earlier?

747
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,902
"Don't cross the line."

748
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,531
Why cross the line
and get yourself into a mess?

749
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,913
You must've missed
some of the stuff the coach said.

750
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,790
What?

751
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,918
In long-distance running,
it's okay to cross the line.

752
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,672
A good runner knows
just when to cross the line.

753
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,259
And we run 1,000m.

754
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,395
Eat them before you brush your teeth.

755
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,668
CASHIER

756
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,883
So you'll hire a private ambulance
to transfer Ms. Jang?

757
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,637
Yes. I already paid for it.

758
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,269
Then please make sure
she will be here on time.

759
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,395
RECEIPT

760
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,817
Is everything all set?

761
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,653
Yes, you're good to go.

762
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,616
RECEIPT

763
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,330
Hey, grunt. It's me again, Hui-tae.

764
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,626
Your dear Seok-chul
will be transferred to Gwangju soon.

765
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,545
So visit her in Gwangju if you miss her.

766
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,763
You see, if only you knew
how much trouble I went to,

767
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,598
you'd write me back immediately.

768
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,522
Her transfer
won't get you out of the military

769
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,858
or help her recover,

770
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,905
but I hope it'll help us all
finally take a step forward from that day.

771
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,950
FROM HWANG HUI-TAE
TO KIM GYEONG-SU

772
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,412
I'm finally ready to slowly walk forward

773
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,123
from the line I drew that day.

774
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,628
SAMYANG FLOWER SHOP

775
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,879
P.S.,

776
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,965
you once told me

777
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:03,302
that I wrote bad lyrics
because I didn't know love.

778
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,389
But I think I'm ready now.

779
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,850
There's someone who can help me.

780
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,334
Myeong-hee.

781
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,844
Hui-tae.

782
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,472
Yes?

783
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,311
Can you…

784
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,651
get engaged to Su-ryeon?

785
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,400
I thought I should tell you as soon
as possible to sort out the situation.

786
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,610
Hwang Hui-tae.

787
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,321
-You're not even saying hi now?
-I didn't have time to.

788
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,698
You can continue to see other women
even after you get married.

789
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,783
Just like my mother?

790
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,160
Hwang Gi-nam?
The Head of Anti-communist Investigation?

791
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,412
I just saw her picking out jewelry,
looking all happy.

792
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,997
I came to return a favor.

793
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,042
It's natural for siblings to receive gifts
when their sister or brother gets engaged.

794
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,669
-Hello, Su-chan.
-Hey, Hui-tae!

795
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,629
My goodness, you look like a movie star.

796
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,923
Myeong-hee. What are you doing here?
