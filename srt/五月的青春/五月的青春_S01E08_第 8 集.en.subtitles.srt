1
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,668
Dad, I need to use the restroom.

2
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,213
I'm

3
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,882
moving to Seoul

4
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,218
with Hwang Hui-tae.

5
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,721
I heard.

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,559
You're smiling?

7
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,312
Kim Myeong-hee.

8
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,814
How can you

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,525
smile at me right now?

10
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,319
Su-ryeon.

11
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,332
You must have a lot on your mind

12
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,252
now that you're actually leaving.

13
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,755
No.

14
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,886
Su-ryeon, you remind me of myself
when I was young.

15
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,395
If you let fear rule your life,

16
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,648
you'll be daunted by more and more things

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,526
to the point that you can't do anything.

18
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,071
And if that happens,
you'll become even more fearful.

19
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,848
When you get there,

20
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,059
don't get dragged into trouble.
Go straight home.

21
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,353
Okay.

22
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,775
You must've been uncomfortable
because of me.

23
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,943
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,030
No, not at all.

25
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,532
Take good care of Su-ryeon.

26
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,826
I will.

27
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,788
Goodness. I'm not on the verge of dying
or something.

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,624
What's with your faces?

29
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,167
Su-ryeon.

30
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,295
Are you sure you'll be okay?

31
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,007
Yes, of course!

32
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,886
Your troublemaker daughter
won't be around anymore,

33
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,639
so take care of your health, Dad.

34
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,488
Well…

35
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,368
I don't want to make you cringe,
so let's skip the hug.

36
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,912
I'll get going now.

37
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,751
Su-ryeon.

38
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,546
Come back anytime
if things don't work out.

39
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,947
SEOUL

40
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,011
I can't believe he left like this.

41
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,848
Hui-tae!

42
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,934
He had to go back to Seoul
because he lives there.

43
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,936
Did you think he'd live here forever?

44
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,398
Good grief. You're being ridiculous.

45
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,777
Are you sure
you don't want to head out with me?

46
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,947
I told you I'm not in the mood
to go anywhere!

47
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,745
What do you mean? Get ready for school!
You're not even in your uniform yet!

48
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,039
-No!
-Get moving!

49
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,585
You probably won't cry like that
when I die!

50
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,260
My goodness. She's crying
as if we lost our country again.

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,890
Myeong-hee, are you…

52
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,273
Hey, Myeong-hee. What are you doing?

53
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,984
Why are you washing the sheets so early?

54
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,194
What's up?

55
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,281
I have to visit my hometown for a few days
to take care of something.

56
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,659
Then leave your sheets out.
I'll wash them for you.

57
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,829
What? Okay. Thanks.

58
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,541
Right, can you look after Jin-a
while I'm gone…

59
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,544
-Sure thing. Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

60
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,928
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

61
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,554
Denounce media corruption!

62
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,473
-Denounce media corruption!
-Denounce media corruption!

63
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,974
End the unlawful firearms training!

64
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,810
-End the unlawful training!
-End the unlawful training!

65
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,562
-This is a democratic nation!
-This is a democratic nation!

66
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,065
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

67
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,112
-Until Mount Baekdu is worn away
-Until Mount Baekdu is worn away

68
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,490
-And the East Sea runs dry
-And the East Sea runs dry

69
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,869
-May the Lord protect
-May the Lord protect

70
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,164
-And preserve our country
-And preserve our country

71
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,085
-Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea
-Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea

72
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,921
-Such a splendid land
-Such a splendid land

73
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,721
END THE MARTIAL LAW

74
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,600
END THE MARTIAL LAW

75
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,768
PROTECT DEMOCRACY

76
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,605
-Guarded by her people
-Guarded by her people

77
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,900
-Ever may Korea stand
-Ever may Korea stand

78
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,279
-As the pine atop Namsan Peak
-As the pine atop Namsan Peak

79
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,866
-What are you doing?
-What?

80
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,785
Nothing.

81
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,832
We should walk a bit more to hail a cab.
Stick close to me.

82
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:41,210
-Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea
-Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea

83
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,672
-Such a splendid land
-Such a splendid land

00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,757
-Guarded by her people
-Guarded by her people

85
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,147
Come in.

86
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,316
Okay.

87
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,916
Why don't you have any stuff here?

88
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,002
It's practically an empty house.

89
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,004
I sold everything.

90
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,800
The bathroom is over there

91
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,512
and that's the storage room.

92
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,023
Hey.

93
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,442
Isn't today your overnight shift?

94
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,693
Why are you already here?

95
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,446
Well, I had nothing better to do

96
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,823
and I felt sorry
for skipping work last time.

97
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,078
Did you clean this whole room by yourself?

98
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,164
You didn't clean up
the supply room yet, right?

99
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,126
No. Not yet,
but it's too big to clean on your own.

100
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,712
Hey.

101
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,090
What…

102
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,217
What's with her?

103
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,013
Hey!

104
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,226
Sorry.

105
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,064
Are you going somewhere?

106
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,275
I have to go somewhere briefly.

107
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,819
-Why?
-What?

108
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,488
It's nothing.

109
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,376
Right. There's no food here.

110
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
There's a restaurant down the alley.

111
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,841
If you don't want to go alone,
you can order.

112
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,093
Order two servings if you need to.

113
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,723
I have money for food too.

114
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,266
Right.

115
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,186
I'll leave it here then.

116
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,731
Wait.

117
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,652
Never mind, see you later.

118
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,321
Okay.

119
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,751
KIM GYEONG-SU

120
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,216
Hey, that book you guys were reading…

121
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,801
SUBMIT A PETITION
TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESS

122
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,013
BOYCOTT ALL CLASSES

123
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,139
Hwang Hui-tae?

124
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,184
It's been a long time.

125
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,062
Yes.

126
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,523
What brings you here?

127
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,567
You have no business here.

128
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,073
I wanted to ask
if anyone has heard from Gyeong-su.

129
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,910
Can you reach him, by any chance?

130
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,164
Hey.

131
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,501
How dare you ask how Gyeong-su is doing?

132
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,671
I guess you can't.

133
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,259
Then good luck with your coverage.

134
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,262
By the way,

135
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,265
I haven't told anyone yet,

136
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,936
about what kind of person your dad is.

137
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,857
I'm still a reporter, you know.

138
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,568
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

139
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,946
Tell them.

140
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,614
What?

141
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,951
Tell them they'll turn out like Gyeong-su
if they get involved with me.

142
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,287
Tell them to stay away from me

143
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,749
if they don't want to ruin their lives.

144
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,128
Go ahead and spread the news.

145
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,570
Hello?

146
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,613
Hello?

147
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,408
Isn't this Hwang Hui-tae's number?

148
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,203
Yes, it is.

149
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,459
I'm glad.

150
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,879
He never answered,
so I was wondering if he moved.

151
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,422
Can I talk to Hui-tae?

152
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,384
He's not home at the moment.

153
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,677
Really?

154
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,013
Do you know where he is?

155
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,056
I'm not sure.

156
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,976
Then do you know when he'll be back?

157
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm not sure about that either.

158
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,401
May I ask who you are?
What's your relationship with Hui-tae?

159
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,657
I'm not sure.

160
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,039
I'll call back next time then.

161
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,549
Where have you been all day, you slacker?

162
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,219
Something came up at home.

163
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,348
Your family seems awfully busy
all the time.

164
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,226
The National Sports Festival
is less than a month away.

165
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,484
My brother went to Seoul today.

166
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,736
Hui-tae?

167
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,197
With my sister?

168
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,908
No. With his fiancee.

169
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,203
Then…

170
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,830
what about my sister?

171
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,502
He won't come to Gwangju anymore.

172
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,509
So they really did fight.

173
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,860
Gosh, you made this on your own?

174
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,736
You should've woken me up.

175
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,614
I can do the dishes.

176
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032
It's okay, I'll do it.

177
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,495
I have some business outside.
What about you?

178
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,206
Me?

179
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,500
I don't know.

180
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,967
I'll try to come back as soon as possible.

181
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,385
You should do…

182
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,638
what you have to do too.

183
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,559
Okay, I will.

184
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,978
Let's eat.

185
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,966
There's nothing left to do.

186
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,887
I'll call you later. Okay.

187
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,142
Send this to the judicial scrivener
and this to the accountant.

188
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,352
What about the papers
from the Medicines Agency?

189
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,145
Here.

190
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,857
By the way, the site manager asked
if you can visit the site today.

191
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,860
I need to go to the office today.

192
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,948
Then tell him I'll drop by
sometime tomorrow morning…

193
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,933
I thought I made it clear

194
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,686
that I refuse to accept
a joint management.

195
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,439
I'm just trying to help.

196
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,150
The situation has changed since last time.

197
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,694
Will you be able to handle
Changhwa Pharmaceuticals

198
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,112
on top of Changhwa Industrial?

199
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,364
All on your own?

200
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,366
If I need your help,

201
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,077
I'll ask you myself.

202
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,457
Must I make you ask for my help?

203
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,007
What about the favor
Su-ryeon asked of you?

204
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,593
Oh, that.

205
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,056
Do you mean her friend
going abroad to study?

206
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,063
I don't think it's time for you
to ask about some girl.

207
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,109
How can I trust and follow you

208
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,320
if you can't keep a promise
about one girl?

209
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,993
Well, the thing is,
it's actually not such a simple matter.

210
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,328
Then is a joint management
a simple matter?

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,336
Trust is developed

212
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,840
only when both sides
can put their faith in each other.

213
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,302
But it seems to me…

214
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,390
you're just trying to force me
to put my faith in you.

215
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,276
Gosh, I'm starving to death.

216
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,653
Look at how skinny my tummy looks.

217
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,116
I hope we can eat meat today.

218
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,118
My gosh.

219
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,579
Why are you looking at my tummy
and mentioning meat?

220
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,498
Myeong-su!

221
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,501
What? Myeong-hee!

222
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,256
Ta-da.

223
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,847
Here. Take some to your coach first.

224
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,892
You go. My sister brought it.

225
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,395
Little bear.

226
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,028
Hurry up and eat some
before Myeong-su comes back.

227
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,780
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

228
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,878
Here, Jeong-tae. Go ahead and dig in.

229
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,047
You should eat a lot
if you want to grow taller.

230
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,091
Come on.

231
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,688
Come on. How could you start without me?

232
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,774
Too bad. Come here and dig in.

233
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,985
Gosh, this is so good.

234
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,237
You didn't have to see me out.

235
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,989
You should get ready for training.

236
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,785
You brought fried chicken as you promised.

237
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,996
This is the least I can do.

238
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,498
Goodness.

239
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,003
My gosh.
Look at all this oil on your mouth.

240
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,468
Why did you and Hui-tae break up?

241
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,185
What are you talking about?

242
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,479
How could we break up
when we're just friends?

243
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,194
I even brought you chicken.
What are you pouting for?

244
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,698
I was hoping you and Hui-tae
would get married.

245
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,868
What? Get married?

246
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,828
Marriage is stronger than engagement.

247
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,373
Plus, if you got married,
you wouldn't go abroad.

248
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,303
All right. Maybe I should
give up on it, after all.

249
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,305
Give up on what?

250
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,099
Studying abroad.

251
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,143
Since my little bear
hates the idea so much,

252
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,770
I should probably forget about it.

253
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,897
You're teasing me, right?

254
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,899
I'm serious.

255
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,445
Maybe I should just go and watch you
compete in the Sports Festival.

256
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,948
When is it again?

257
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,743
Are you sure you're not fooling with me?
Are you really not going to study abroad?

258
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,370
Seriously?

259
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,664
Goodness.

260
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,295
"The student council
held an emergency meeting."

261
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,507
"They disbanded the meeting
after discussing for an hour and a half."

262
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,344
"They also persuaded
the student demonstrators

263
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,055
around Seoul Station to disperse
and go back to school."

264
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,558
Gosh, those darn cowards in Seoul.

265
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,603
What a way to lose momentum.

266
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,605
If they've backed down in Seoul,

267
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,399
will all our efforts go up in smoke?

268
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,735
Nothing's changed in Gwangju.

269
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,366
Kwan-hyun…

270
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,995
finished talking
to the police commissioner.

271
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,163
The police will cooperate

272
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,125
with today's torch protest.

273
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,714
I'm sure more citizens
will be participating today.

274
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,299
Let's hurry up and get prepared.

275
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,508
-Yes.
-Yes.

276
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,261
GUARANTEE WORKERS' RIGHTS!

277
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,140
RELEASE ALL PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE!

278
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,766
END THE MARTIAL LAW!

279
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
Goodness gracious.

280
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,521
Just smash it all, why don't you?

281
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,941
What is it? Are you angry about Seoul?

282
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,113
Do you know that Lee Su-ryeon
is in Seoul now?

283
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,407
She's in Seoul?

284
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,328
Did she protest at Seoul Station
yesterday?

285
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,081
It's not to protest,

286
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,625
but to get married to your friend,
Hwang Hui-tae.

287
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
What?

288
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,088
Who said that?

289
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,924
There are no secrets in this small town.

290
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,011
So she didn't even tell you?

291
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,434
What about Myeong-hee?

292
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,605
You were so harsh to Myeong-hee
and took Su-ryeon's side.

293
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,856
Now you're worried about her?

294
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,278
I don't know. I can't reach her.

295
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,240
I'm sure she's pretending
to be fine somewhere.

296
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,548
I'm sorry, Myeong-hee.
Have you been waiting long?

297
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,967
Not at all. I just got here.

298
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,887
I'm the one who asked to meet,

299
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,681
but I couldn't come on time
because something came up.

300
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,850
I'll have the same as her.

301
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,021
My gosh, why are you in such a hurry?

302
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,357
-Catch your breath first.
-Thanks.

303
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,576
So? Why did you want to see me?

304
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,081
Myeong-hee, your passport application
is being processed again.

305
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,500
My friend at Foreign Affairs
just confirmed it.

306
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,256
You don't have to worry
about my departure anymore.

307
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,758
I won't be able to leave this year anyway.

308
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,261
Actually, I asked around a bit.

309
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,097
The Catholic Foundation scholarship
isn't the only way.

310
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,642
-These are not the only options either.
-It's fine.

311
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,436
I still have to wait for my visa
after my passport.

312
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,273
If you don't want to go abroad,
you could study here.

313
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,983
I'll support you.

314
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,901
Starting with preparations for the exam…

315
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,027
Su-chan.

316
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,823
I'm really fine.

317
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,535
I'm not.

318
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,629
I was being nosy and…

319
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,550
Because of me, you…

320
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,309
Come on. How many times must I tell you?

321
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,519
It's not your fault.

322
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,647
If you keep trying to help me,
I'll only feel worse.

323
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,776
Myeong-hee.

324
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,113
Can't you just…

325
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,491
let me help you?

326
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,751
I can't stand this.

327
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,007
I'm doing this for my own good.

328
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,928
So can't you please let me help you?

329
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,148
You've already given me enough.

330
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,984
Even if you give me more,

331
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,528
my hands are already full.

332
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,824
Trust me, I'm really fine.

333
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,327
Don't worry about me.

334
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,408
We're good to go!

335
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,348
To Hyehwa-dong, please.

336
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,058
-It's a warm, sunny May day.
-Sure.

337
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,021
As we get started,
here is a song you might want to share

338
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,398
with someone as sweet as sunshine.

339
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,789
Wait. I requested this song.

340
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,376
I have no regrets.

341
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,088
But it's not like there's no pain
because we don't regret.

342
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,843
Even if we don't seem strong or happy,

343
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,430
I hope we can show each other everything.

344
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,773
I can sing for you sometime.

345
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,484
Can we meet again
before the flowers wither?

346
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,612
Then I'd love to.

347
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,615
Myeong-hee.

348
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:43,078
Do you want to go out with me
until the end of May?

349
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,798
I'm not okay.

350
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,676
I don't want this May to pass by
without you.

351
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,264
Welcome.

352
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,486
TROUBLING POLITICAL SITUATIONS
DUE TO PROTESTS

353
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,706
More than 100,000 took to the streets.

354
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,541
How could they tell us
to go back to school?

355
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,668
What is the council even thinking?

356
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,962
They don't want to
give the government an excuse.

357
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,672
They actually brought armored cars.

358
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,924
Weren't you scared?

359
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,095
Honestly, I was relieved
when we were told to disperse.

360
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,513
I didn't say I wasn't scared.

361
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,975
But no matter what,
there are things to get done.

362
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,810
-They must get done.
-Right?

363
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,020
Don't you agree?

364
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,359
Guys.

365
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,866
Hold on. Lee Su-ryeon?

366
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,534
Su-ryeon, is that you?

367
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,248
Sang-min?

368
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,003
My gosh, it really is you.
I can't believe it.

369
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,881
Did you come for
the Seoul Station protest yesterday?

370
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,718
-What?
-All the way from Gwangju?

371
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,555
If only there was someone like her
on the council.

372
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,182
Right, guys?

373
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,850
Are you here alone?

374
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,144
Come and sit with us. Come here.

375
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,980
No, thanks. I…

376
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,148
What is it?

377
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,692
Are you waiting for someone?

378
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,611
Hey, by any chance,

379
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,364
did Won-seok come here with you?

380
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,416
Sang-min, I'm sorry.

381
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,544
What?

382
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,633
HONAM BUILDING

383
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,228
Hey! Do you have a death wish?

384
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,063
Get out of the way!

385
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,872
You're home late.

386
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,875
I have to step out for a minute.

387
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,126
Where are you going?

388
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,129
I have something to do.

389
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,797
What is it that you have to do?

390
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,595
It's a personal matter. See you later.

391
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,846
Hwang Hui-tae.

392
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,308
Are you doing this to punish me?

393
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,643
What?

394
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,770
I know you are.

395
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,189
You blame me for everything.

396
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,319
That's why you're ignoring and avoiding me
to make me feel uncomfortable.

397
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,657
Let's talk when I get back.

398
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,700
Why?

399
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,828
Am I not even worth fighting anymore?

400
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,747
Just hit me or something.

401
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,000
Be sarcastic, yell,
or get angry like you used to.

402
00:31:59,083 --> 00:31:59,959
Then what?

403
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,464
What difference does it make?

404
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,302
"What difference does it make?"

405
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,598
What difference?

406
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,808
Then what about this?

407
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,896
If you keep avoiding me like this

408
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,898
and pretend I don't exist,
what difference does that make?

409
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,817
-I never avoided--
-You don't have to do this!

410
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,446
I know too.

411
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,367
I know everything is my fault.

412
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,495
I'm responsible for what happened
to both Myeong-hee and you.

413
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,872
I know it so well
that it's driving me crazy!

414
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,416
-So just insult me.
-Su-ryeon.

415
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,836
-Blame me. Get angry with me!
-Su-ryeon!

416
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,304
I've never blamed you for anything.

417
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,974
Ever.

418
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,395
Okay?

419
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,742
Let's go.

420
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,705
I have someone to introduce to you.

421
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,511
So she was the leader
of the labor union strike?

422
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,140
I didn't know you were so famous,

423
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,183
Seok-chul.

424
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,355
So the reason you came to Gwangju
in the first place

425
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,109
and went on that blind date was…

426
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,986
Yes.

427
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,116
She's being transferred tomorrow.

428
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,620
With the ambulance and everything,
there are many arrangements to make.

429
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,000
Ms. Jang Seok-chul's guardian?

430
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,838
-Stay here. I'll go sign some papers.
-Okay.

431
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,901
It looks like a child's hand, right?

432
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,739
Her hands are so thin that I sometimes
have trouble sticking needles in them.

433
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,535
I can't believe
such a petite woman did that.

434
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,122
The world is never going to change.

435
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,874
She sacrificed herself for nothing.

436
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,752
She should've known
how scary the world is.

437
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,754
I'm sure she was scared.

438
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,964
Pardon?

439
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,260
That's why what she did is…

440
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,055
even more remarkable.

441
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,058
She did what needed to be done

442
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,519
even though she was scared.

443
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,868
End the martial law!

444
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,287
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

445
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,832
Release the arrested students!

446
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,251
-Release the arrested students!
-Release the arrested students!

447
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,711
Guarantee farmers' rights!

448
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,756
-Guarantee farmers' rights!
-Guarantee farmers' rights!

449
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,592
Hey, there! Hold the torch up!

450
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,719
You'll burn the man's hair.

451
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,888
Yushin remnants, step down!

452
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,391
-Yushin remnants, step down!
-Yushin remnants, step down!

453
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,854
-Until Mount Baekdu is worn away
-Until Mount Baekdu is worn away

454
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,064
-And the East Sea runs dry
-And the East Sea runs dry

455
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
The rally is supposed to end today.

456
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,575
But to prevent it from recurring,
the leaders…

457
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,872
Not yet.

458
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,212
Hello, Defense Security Command.

459
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,756
Salute.

460
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
I'll be on my way immediately.

461
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,639
I've been urgently summoned
to the headquarters.

462
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,641
Stand by until I get back from Seoul.

463
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,108
Hey.

464
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,611
Hey, Hwang Hui-tae.

465
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,863
Hey!

466
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,034
What is it?

467
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,036
Wake up.

468
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,996
There's a place I want to go to.

469
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:53,127
Goodness. I thought
you wanted to go to some cool place.

470
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,380
You country bumpkins are so predictable.

471
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,593
You all want to check out the palaces,
Myeong-dong, Deoksu Palace. My goodness.

472
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,138
Look at you talking
as if you're not a country bumpkin.

473
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,057
I never said that.

474
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm actually enjoying this,

475
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,396
and that proves
I'm still a country bumpkin after all.

476
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,734
Hey, Country Bumpkin.

477
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,403
What?

478
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,866
You should

479
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,787
go back to Gwangju with Seok-chul.

480
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,045
I can't go back
until my father says that I can.

481
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,965
What's the real reason? Your father

482
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,551
or Myeong-hee?

483
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,600
Let's head back home.

484
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,893
If it's because

485
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,690
you're afraid Myeong-hee would be hurt,
just go back to Gwangju.

486
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,986
I said I won't.

487
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,239
Hey, Hwang Hui-tae!

488
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,121
She said she's scared.

489
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,332
Myeong-hee is scared of me.

490
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,840
Are you dumb?

491
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,426
Do you actually believe that?

492
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,555
Myeong-hee

493
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,016
is not scared of you.

494
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,185
She doesn't want you to get hurt.

495
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,855
She said that's what she's most afraid of.

496
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,943
What?

497
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,279
Your father is what?

498
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,656
What do you mean?

499
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,117
That's why

500
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,494
I wanted to apologize to you

501
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,664
before you left.

502
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,376
I guess we were on the same wavelength.

503
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,421
Why should you

504
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,674
apologize to me?

505
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,428
You know, that incident years ago.

506
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,723
I blamed you.

507
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,142
I'm sorry.

508
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,019
It wasn't your fault at all.

509
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,856
I guess I needed someone to blame.

510
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,699
Your friend here is such a loser.

511
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,409
Right?

512
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,497
What about Hwang Hui-tae?

513
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,832
Does he know about all this?

514
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,250
Did you tell him?

515
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,922
Myeong-hee!

516
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,466
-Will you suffer alone again…
-Su-ryeon.

517
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,678
If I stay with him,

518
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,432
both of our lives will be destroyed.

519
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,145
And if that happens,
he'll think it's all his fault,

520
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,566
just like you beat yourself up
for what happened to me.

521
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,332
So…

522
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,087
tell him on my behalf.

523
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,967
He doesn't have it in him
to destroy anyone.

524
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,143
So?

525
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,855
Are you afraid
Myeong-hee would ruin your life?

526
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,359
No, right?

527
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,530
She feels the same way.

528
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,868
So you're both okay with it.
Then what's the problem?

529
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,579
No.

530
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,708
Myeong-hee will be hurt in the end.

531
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,510
Seriously.

532
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,597
You guys are two peas in a pod.

533
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,142
Fine, you decide
whether you'll go back or not.

534
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,021
I'll be on my way now.

535
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,150
Let's part ways here.

536
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,028
They say couples always break up

537
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,197
if they walk along the Deoksu Palace
stonewall.

538
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,491
Hwang Hui-tae.

539
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,704
Let's not get dragged
into each other's lives again

540
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,750
and just wish each other
all the best. Okay?

541
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,555
HANSAENG HOSPITAL

542
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,228
Shouldn't you go to Gwangju
to oversee everything?

543
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,773
Just go with us. We can take
one guardian in the ambulance.

544
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,243
DATE: MAY 17, 1980
GUARDIAN: HWANG HUI-TAE

545
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,539
No, I'm not going.

546
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,832
Well, all right then.

547
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,585
I'll call you when we arrive in Gwangju.

548
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,255
-Please take good care of her.
-No problem.

549
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,228
Did she really say
she's no longer going abroad?

550
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,064
Maybe it's just something she said.

551
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,404
Did she seem okay?

552
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,618
All right.

553
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,870
Okay, good luck with the training.

554
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,997
Bye.

555
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,043
Gosh, you scared me!

556
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,045
Did you have to creep up on me like that?

557
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,298
What did you just say?

558
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,300
What?

559
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,469
What did you say? Going abroad?

560
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,017
She worked very hard for years
to prepare for it.

561
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,270
I heard she got accepted
to the school this time.

562
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,815
But the last time she was here,

563
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,569
she seemed distraught, so I think maybe…

564
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:38,907
ACCOUNT NUMBER
BALANCE

565
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,133
Gosh, when did this happen?

566
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,015
SEOUL

567
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,894
EMERGENCY ROOM

568
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,201
Please sign to confirm
that you've received her.

569
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,994
Sure.

570
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,165

GUARDIAN: HWANG HUI-TAE

573
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,609
RECEIVER: KIM MYEONG-HEE

574
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,162
Father.

575
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,542
Hey, Myeong-hee.

576
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,007
I'm sorry I keep changing my mind.

577
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,010
I know you suggested it to help me out.

578
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,388
Don't worry about it.

579
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,141
The scholarship program
chooses new recipients yearly.

580
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,809
You can apply again next year.

581
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,395
No.

582
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,605
I've decided

583
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,483
not to study abroad.

584
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,278
Did something happen?

585
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,239
Nothing happened.

586
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,077
I just don't want to go anymore.

587
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,248
My little brother is still very young.

588
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,252
And going abroad
won't solve all my problems.

589
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,298
After causing all the fuss…

590
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,341
I'm sorry.

591
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,969
I'm actually happy for you.

592
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,638
Pardon me?

593
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,600
Why did you want to study abroad?

594
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,519
You said you had no reason
to stay in this country

595
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,812
because nothing was keeping you here.

596
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,274
I'm assuming you changed your mind
and decided to stay

597
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,986
because you found a reason to stay.
Am I wrong?

598
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,292
I did find

599
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,962
one reason,

600
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,549
but it's gone now.

601
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,846
I can't even leave now,

602
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,807
but it's gone.

603
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,817
It's okay.

604
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,363
Whether you go abroad or not,

605
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,493
if a door closes,
another one always opens.

606
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,997
What if it doesn't?

607
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,625
I've lived my whole life

608
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,712
behind closed doors.

609
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,758
Even now,

610
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:29,054
it feels like every door around me
is closed, and I can't sleep

611
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,848
or even breathe.

612
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,906
It may seem dark at first,

613
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,993
but a door will open soon.

614
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,288
It will open for sure.

615
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,540
Myeong-hee.

616
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,501
I promise.

617
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,468
No.

618
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,060
I know.

619
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,813
I already heard

620
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,067
why you had no choice but to say no.

621
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,994
I know I shouldn't have come.

622
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,790
Whenever I think of you,

623
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,002
I know

624
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,173
that I'll eventually cause you pain.

625
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,140
But I want to be with you

626
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,478
and stay by your side.

627
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,783
Can I come closer, Myeong-hee?

628
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,675
Hello?

629
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,678
Hey, Hye-gun. It's me, Lee Su-ryeon.

630
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,098
Hey, Su-ryeon. What…

631
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,728
I heard your photo studio
is a hideout for runaways.

632
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,564
Do you have room for me too?

633
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,784
It's broken.

634
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,161
It's no use trying to tweak it.

635
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,289
Hold on.

636
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,296
I'm almost done.

637
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,602
Recently, Korea's second…

638
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,283
You could open up an electronics store
in the mountains someday.

639
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,911
An electronics store? That sounds nice.

640
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,583
My dream was to become
an engineering professor

641
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,167
until my mother fell ill.

642
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,714
Then you should get a doctorate degree
before you open an electronics store.

643
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,347
Whether I open an electronics store,
work at a construction site,

644
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,266
or stow away on a ship in Busan,

645
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,268
I'm fine with anything

646
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,271
as long as I'm with you.

647
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,996
When I was a kid,

648
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,373
I liked turning the dial like this

649
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,043
more than listening to the radio.

650
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:38,757
Whenever I turned the dial slowly
like this,

651
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:43,178
I sometimes heard
a faint signal that sounded unfamiliar.

652
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,514
That signal seemed

653
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,225
like me.

654
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,652
A signal that no one listened to

655
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,072
and floated around aimlessly
in the universe

656
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,492
with no sound or color.

657
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,006
Until you found me like this.

658
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,472
Me too.

659
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,601
Before I met you,

660
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,980
I couldn't hear anything.

661
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,672
You really don't have to be scared

662
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,550
of anything anymore.

663
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,792
Hey.

664
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,628
Maybe your friend died.

665
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,172
He should've already answered by now.

666
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,382
But someone else answered yesterday.

667
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,429
Just hang up and call him again tomorrow.

668
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,327
It's time.

669
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,912
Round them all up.

670
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,748
As of 2400 hours on May 17, 1980,

671
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,377
the emergency martial law is in effect

672
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,088
throughout the country.

673
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,673
Considering the recent movements
of North Korea

674
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,509
and the ongoing disturbances
in the country,

675
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,970
the nation is deemed to be
in an emergency state.

676
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,890
On these grounds, it has been decided

677
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,018
that the emergency martial law
is in effect nationwide

678
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,354
starting 2400 hours, May 17, 1980.

679
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,864
Hye-gun.

680
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,332
What?

681
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,118
-Why are you doing this?
-Drag them all off!

682
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,539
He made you start a rebellion, didn't he?

683
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,207
You promised you'd leave with me
in the morning.

684
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,793
Are you telling me
to leave my patients behind?

685
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,211
Yes, let's just go.

686
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,129
Even if you throw yourself
into that mayhem,

687
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,256
nothing's going to change.

688
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,049
There are things I can do.

689
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,135
He's been stabbed with a bayonet.
The other patients waiting outside…

690
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,554
Myeong-hee, get a saline drip started
and call Surgery.

691
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,556
-Hui-tae!
-Please go and get help!

692
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,141
Jin-a, please. Please come back, please.
