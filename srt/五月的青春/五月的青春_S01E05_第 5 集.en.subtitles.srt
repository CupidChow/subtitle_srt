1
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,657
So?

2
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,534
Did the talk with your father go well?

3
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,621
How dare you. Eyes down!

4
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,836
STATEMENT

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,964
You made and distributed
illegal propaganda leaflets.

6
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,759
You admit to planning
the whole thing on your own, right?

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,929
Yes.

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:01,519
LETTER OF WITHDRAWAL
KIM MYEONG-HEE

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,981
I never thought you, of all people,
would decide to drop out.

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,650
Are you sure
you won't regret this decision?

11
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,695
Yes.

12
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,453
For real. Just ask her. It's okay.

13
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,748
Myeong-hee.

14
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,417
Something came up with my family.

15
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,128
Can you cover my Saturday shift?

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,254
Sure.

17
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,148
You want me

18
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,443
to get engaged to Lee Su-ryeon?

19
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,988
Yes.

20
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,508
Why do you want me to get engaged?

21
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,930
I heard your family
is now involved in her family's business.

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,184
-If the factory doesn't get built--
-I'm not asking about Su-ryeon.

23
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,603
What's your reason?

24
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,569
Did you invest
in Changhwa Pharmaceuticals?

25
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,321
Then I'll understand.

26
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,368
To me, Su-ryeon
is as important as Gyeong-su is to you.

27
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,913
I encouraged her
when I should've stopped her if anything.

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,710
That's why things got all messed up.

29
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,045
If…

30
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,174
If anything bad happens to her family,

31
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,012
I'll beat myself up for it
for the rest of my life.

32
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,308
Are you sure you'll be okay

33
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,769
if I get engaged?

34
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,358
Yes.

35
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,497
All right.

36
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,334
-Bye.
-Wait.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,170
Hold on.

38
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,507
What?

39
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,968
Do you have something else to say?

40
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,728
This?

41
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,398
My dad asked me to pick up some flowers.

42
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,862
Goodnight then.

43
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,647
EMERGENCY ROOM

44
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,023
Gosh, I'm late.

45
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,568
What?

46
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,363
Hey, Su-ryeon.

47
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,324
You're still here?

48
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,743
What's going on?

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,872
I wanted to see you
even for just a moment.

50
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,126
I was actually wondering
if I should call you

51
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,211
and see you tonight even if it's late.

52
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,299
Why? Do you have to talk to me
about something?

53
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,052
The thing is…

54
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,976
I'm going to start seeing Hui-tae.

55
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,314
I thought I should tell you first.

56
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,862
Hey, Su-ryeon.

57
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,199
Are you all right? What's wrong?

58
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,785
What do I do?

59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,457
My family is in trouble.

60
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,301
Myeong-hee.

61
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,681
Can you please try to persuade Hui-tae?

62
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,311
You told me that he already said no.

63
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,938
How can I…

64
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,025
He may change his mind
if you ask him to do it.

65
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,486
Help me just this once.

66
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,823
Ask him for me. Please?

67
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,618
If I can't get engaged,

68
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,120
both my father and brother

69
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,123
will suffer because of me.

70
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,173
Please, Myeong-hee.

71
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,429
Please…

72
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,836
KYUNGSOO DAILY

73
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,385
DETAINED STUDENTS
TO BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY

74
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,727
Isn't it too early to be
interested in political affairs?

75
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,525
-Good morning.
-Hwang Hui-tae.

76
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,445
What brings you here?

77
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,781
I'm here to speak with your father
in person.

78
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,410
What do you need to
talk to my father about?

79
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,078
You know what it's about.

80
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,708
-I can come in, right?
-No, you can't.

81
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,919
I told you I'd take care of it.
Can't you just…

82
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,714
Look at you lovebirds
bickering with each other again.

83
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,263
You two have so much energy
even though it's still early.

84
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,933
Let's go inside. Have breakfast with us.

85
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,439
It's okay.

86
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,442
I'm here to speak with your father.

87
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,988
I'm sorry for stopping by unannounced
at this early hour.

88
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,326
I thought I should tell you as soon
as possible to sort out the situation.

89
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,331
Okay, what is it about?

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,335
This all began because of Su-ryeon,

91
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,256
so I was waiting for her to tell you
and Su-chan herself,

92
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,884
but it doesn't look
like it'll happen anytime soon.

93
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,968
So I'm here to do it myself.

94
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,679
Hwang Hui-tae, are you seriously…

95
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,641
We'd like to get engaged.

96
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,865
A little bit to the right.

97
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,034
A little more.

98
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,787
Pull down your chin a little.

99
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,830
No, not that much.

100
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,543
Are you sure you can do this?

101
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,087
Do you not trust me? That's it!

102
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,882
Yes, stay still. I'll take it now.

103
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,261
Hey, smile a little.

104
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,640
No, not a smirk.

105
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,185
As if you're thinking
about someone you love.

106
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,520
You know what I mean.

107
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,455
Lucky you for having a friend like me.

108
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,957
It would've taken you at least two days

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,376
even if you had gone
to every photo studio downtown.

110
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,711
Thanks a bunch!

111
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,966
Hold on. If you're applying
for a passport…

112
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,885
I suppose you can afford
a plane ticket now?

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,431
Su-ryeon.

114
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,933
Lee Su-ryeon? Did she lend you the money?

115
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,269
I thought you didn't want to ask
for a favor.

116
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,939
Well, that's how it turned out.

117
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,026
I guess she has a conscience.

118
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,485
I'm glad.

119
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,488
Don't even think of paying it back
and just use it.

120
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,032
Think of it as compensation.

121
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,367
Compensation for what?

122
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,911
You know, for what happened
in high school.

123
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,080
If you hadn't taken all the blame,

124
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,999
you wouldn't have to be
making a passport like this.

125
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,542
You would've gone
to a nice university here

126
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
and lived a proud life like her.

127
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,839
Why do you keep mentioning that?
Su-ryeon had nothing to do with that.

128
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,884
Okay, whatever you say.

129
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,054
Lady Su-ryeon had
nothing to do with it whatsoever

130
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,847
and it was all voluntary?

131
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,140
Hey, Seon-min.

132
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,684
Whatever. Just take this.

133
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,978
KIM MYEONG-HEE

134
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,986
It's just because I'm so frustrated.

135
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,531
You always pretend
to be strong and unfazed

136
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,868
but eventually end up taking all the blame
and giving everything away.

137
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,453
Don't you have any pride?

138
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,279
You're not even saying hi now?

139
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,711
I didn't have time to. I'm too busy
preparing for the engagement ceremony.

140
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,047
Hello.

141
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,176
I heard.

142
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,470
That you're getting engaged.

143
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,183
Thank you.

144
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,021
Instead of thanking me,

145
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,898
don't you have anything else to say?

146
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,654
I'm sorry for forcing you to do this.

147
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,791
Instead of saying "thank you"
or "I'm sorry",

148
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,836
I'm asking you how you really feel.

149
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,385
Like whether you feel happy or sad.

150
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,103
If you tell me to stop, I will.

151
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,980
I'll stop right away.

152
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,735
I'm going to leave soon anyway.

153
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,070
And you and Su-ryeon

154
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,406
will have to stay.

155
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,826
I don't want to cause trouble
just to be happy for a short while.

156
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,546
So this is how you hold yourself back.

157
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,966
What?

158
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,302
I'd better get going then.

159
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,179
I have a lesson.

160
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,951
Hui-tae. I already chose
the song we'll listen to today.

161
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,786
I don't listen to music when I study.

162
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,538
1979 TBC'S SONGS OF YOUTH

163
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,374
Come on. Music is what?

164
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,835
Sit down. We have a lot of work to do.

165
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,880
Come on.

166
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:04,301
You said I was destined
to be good at math.

167
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,263
Why don't we enjoy some nice music…

168
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,764
Gosh.

169
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,808
"Enjoy?"

170
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,146
Have you ever seen anyone enjoy
doing push-ups?

171
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,400
Math is like strengthening your muscles.
There is no shortcut. Got it?

172
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,528
The results depend
on how much effort you put in.

173
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,074
-Show me your homework then.
-Yes, sir.

174
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,425
MAY 10, 6.P.M.,GWANGJU PARK HOTEL

175
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,968
This week?

176
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,928
Gosh, isn't this a bit too soon?

177
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,598
And why did you reserve
such a fancy place?

178
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,891
It's not even a wedding.

179
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,103
Hey. Are you okay with this?

180
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,776
Anyway, the decision has been made,
so place an announcement in the paper.

181
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,321
And make some calls
to our relatives in advance.

182
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,823
-Go on then.
-Okay.

00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,274
You surprised me.

186
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,334
Are you testing me?

187
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,295
I really quit.

188
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,218
Lighter.

189
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,186
Here.

190
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,855
Where's the lighter I gave you last time?

191
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,609
it must be here somewhere.

192
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,824
This will work just as fine.
Shall I light you up?

I guess you have it in your blood too.

196
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,554
You know how my mom was.
I take after her, you know.

197
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,641
That may not be true,
seeing what you did today.

198
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,229
I'm glad you decided to get engaged.
Good job.

199
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,568
It was nothing.

200
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,113
Then…

201
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,617
You can continue to see other women
even after you get married.

202
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,083
What I mean is, don't mess up
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

203
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,045
just because of some petty emotions.

204
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,299
Just like my mother?

205
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,184
Good night, Dad.

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,842
Gosh. You surprised me.

213
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,552
-Hui-tae.
-Hello.

214
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,222
Why are you standing here?
You should wait inside.

215
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,932
Su-ryeon's going to need some time.

216
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,183
It's okay.

217
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,352
Are you going somewhere?

218
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,105
I'm going to Seoul today.

219
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,692
I heard you're going shopping
for wedding gifts and your outfits.

220
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,985
Yes.

221
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,905
I'm sending someone
who'll take good care of you,

222
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,283
so you don't have to worry.

223
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,912
"Take good care of us?"

224
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,249
Gosh, this is it.

225
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,630
Take a look at this baby. How pretty.

226
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,965
Gosh, auntie.

227
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,134
Did you excavate that
from the ground or what?

228
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,095
Can't we just choose something simple?

229
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,471
That's nonsense.

230
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,723
An engagement gift
should be this fancy at least.

231
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,102
Hui-tae? Take a look.

232
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,187
What do you think?

233
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,235
I think I saw that in an ancient tomb.

234
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,699
I mean, she looks like someone
from a royal family.

235
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,410
Do you really think so? Good.

236
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,744
Let's choose yours now.

237
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,831
-What?
-This bracelet.

238
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,124
-That's…
-Come on.

239
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,251
What do you think?

240
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,922
I feel like I've become a Buddha.

241
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,801
The thing is, my family is Christian.

242
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,387
This is truly unbelievable.

243
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,725
Even your picky tastes

244
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:48,103
are exactly alike. You know?

245
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,024
Auntie. Why don't you go home now?

246
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,443
We'll pick out some nice gifts on our own.

247
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,029
Yes. You need to pick out your hanbok too.

248
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,322
You must be busy.

249
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,032
I don't need a new hanbok.

250
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,618
I'm going to wear the one I already have.

251
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,913
Goodness, that's not okay.

252
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,207
Go and pick out a new one.

253
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,500
You should. We already let the store know.

254
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,543
Let's go.

255
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,630
Then let me take a look at just one more.

256
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,506
Excuse me.

257
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,926
Can you show us
the one with the rubies over there?

258
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,052
Sure.

259
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,976
-Auntie. Come on.
-Hold on.

260
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,437
This necklace would be perfect.

261
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,524
What do you think? Doesn't it look nice?

262
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,068
-It does.
-Right?

263
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,444
I'll get going now.

264
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,488
-Is this true?
-How could this be possible?

265
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,531
-No way.
-I'm sure it's true.

266
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,116
Seriously?

267
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,411
-Gosh.
-Unbelievable.

268
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,666
What's wrong? Did something happen again?

269
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,265
ENGAGEMENT
HWANG HUI-TAE AND LEE SU-RYEON

270
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,101
Su-ryeon is getting engaged to Hui-tae?

271
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,311
Hwang Gi-nam, the guy's father,

272
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,022
is the Head of Anti-communist
Investigation, right?

273
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,568
I knew something was wrong
when the elusive Won-seok got arrested.

274
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,530
Lee Su-ryeon was a mole.

275
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,990
Watch your mouth.

276
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,367
That's a groundless accusation.

277
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,538
Are you still defending Lee Su-ryeon?

278
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,040
Even after seeing this?

279
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,462
You never liked Su-ryeon anyway.

280
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,630
What?

281
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,716
Put your personal feelings aside.

282
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,427
It's like you're excited
to have an excuse to hate her.

283
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,595
No one is more excited
than Lee Su-ryeon right now.

284
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,016
I just saw her picking out jewelry,
looking all happy.

285
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,476
Jewelry? Where?

286
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,688
Gosh. I'm going to go over there
and see for myself.

287
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,481
-That sounds good.
-We should do that.

288
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,150
-Calm down, guys.
-Let's go.

289
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,484
What?

290
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,028
One to two months?

291
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,323
But I have to leave the country
next month.

292
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,203
You probably didn't know,
but it's not so easy to get a passport.

293
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,497
Usually, you need to wait
for one to two months.

294
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,374
It often takes even longer.

295
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,004
Is there any way to speed up the process?

296
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,008
Do you know anyone
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

297
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,512
Then there's nothing you can do.

298
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,854
Next.

299
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,024
What if I fail to leave the country

300
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,359
because I can't get a passport
after all the fuss?

301
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,695
I'm such an idiot.

302
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,201
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

303
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,535
Here.

304
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,704
Wait. Myeong-hee.

305
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,665
Hold on. Su-chan?

306
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,834
What are you doing here?

307
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,003
I came to apply for a passport.

308
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,713
What about you?

309
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,049
I had something to do
at the Medicines Agency

310
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,760
and thought I'd visit my friend
who works here.

311
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,056
You have a friend who works here?

312
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,141
Yes, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

313
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,729
You can find men's suits here
on the first floor

314
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,649
and women's dresses on the second floor.

315
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,111
Feel free to look around and let me know
if you'd like to try something on.

316
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,237
Okay.

317
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,542
What are you doing?

318
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,919
I'm looking at clothes.

319
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,338
Go pick out a dress for yourself instead.

320
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,882
Don't tell me

321
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,885
you think we're going to pick out
clothes for each other.

322
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,346
Well, fine.

323
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,057
Go and ask Myeong-hee
to persuade me again.

324
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,893
Who knows if I'll go along with it again?

325
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,771
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I want to do that with you?

326
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,151
Then go on upstairs.

327
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,611
You're a jerk.

328
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,159
I'll come back tomorrow with my brother.

329
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,535
Okay, sure.

330
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,758
Congratulations on your engagement.

331
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,891
Did you find any jewelry you like?

332
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,646
So you joined hands
with the dog of the military dictatorship?

333
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,149
You, Lee Su-ryeon,

334
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,610
of all people?

335
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,116
I don't know what to say.

336
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,410
-But…
-Forget it.

337
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,455
Did you rat on Won-seok?

338
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,499
I never did anything like that.

339
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,418
Do you expect us to believe you?

340
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,838
You were the only person
who was in touch with him.

341
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,010
There you are.

342
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,932
I'm sorry to interrupt the people's court,

343
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,267
but we have more to prepare
before our engagement.

344
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,185
Hey.

345
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,355
Can I take her away?

346
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,981
Who are you?

347
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,899
Me?

348
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,111
I'm her fiance and the son of
the Head of Anti-communist Investigation,

349
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,074
the puppy of the military dictatorship.

350
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,286
If you haven't found a job yet,

351
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,788
why not consider
the Defense Security Command?

352
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,956
What?

353
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,794
It's just that I think
you're really cut out for it.

354
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:50,715
You find a target, cook up a hypothesis,
and pretend it's a fact.

355
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,345
-That's what my father does all the time.
-What did you just say, punk?

356
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,682
There you go. I knew you'd grab me
by the collar.

357
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,891
Come here.

358
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,310
What? What are you doing?

359
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,354
Pretend we're friends.

360
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,981
If it looks like we're fighting…

361
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,066
You see the two cars over there?

362
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,737
You guys might get arrested.

363
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,748
Hey, let's go. Come on.

364
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,667
What? You're leaving?

365
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,003
Listen, fighters.

366
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:33,008
Come over on the weekend if you have time.
I'll prepare a really nice dinner!

367
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,438
Are we really being watched?

368
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,650
I don't know.

369
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,654
They want you to
pick out your dress today.

370
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,989
The fitting takes time.

371
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,657
Come on.

372
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,757
What are the odds of us
running into each other in Seoul?

373
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,966
At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
at that?

374
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,301
I know.

375
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,428
Without your help,

376
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,597
I would've had to forget
about studying abroad.

377
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,476
Is that so? Then I shouldn't have helped.

378
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,733
Anyway, your passport will be ready soon.

379
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,401
Just apply for your visa in time.

380
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,487
I don't have any friends at the embassy.

381
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,696
Okay.

382
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,741
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

383
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,535
Myeong-hee,
would you like something to eat?

384
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,746
We won't arrive until well past lunchtime.

385
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,748
Let me get you something.

386
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,209
Hold on. Are you trying to humiliate me?

387
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,252
Come on. Forget it.

388
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,837
I mean it. It's my treat.

389
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,131
Seriously. Don't do this.

390
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,551
This isn't enough.
Buy me something more expensive next time.

391
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,553
-Fine.
-Here.

392
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,847
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir?

393
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,521
-Can I get you something?
-Let me see. Some bread,

394
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,274
butter cookies, soda…

395
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,944
Here's your soda.

396
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,863
-I'll take eggs too.
-Sure.

397
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,200
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

398
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,964
I shall peel an egg
for Grandpa Myeong-hee.

399
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,299
What? "Grandpa Myeong-hee?"

400
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,860
Myeong-hee.

401
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,987
Thank you.

402
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,825
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

403
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,685
No.

404
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,356
It says here that Y is a natural number.

405
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,026
X is greater than 36,
and Y is a natural number.

406
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,277
So which quadrant is it?

407
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,617
The first quadrant.

408
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,911
Right, the first quadrant.

409
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,413
-Here.
-Hold on.

410
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,793
Where is the third quadrant?

411
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,718
Jin-a, didn't you learn this
in middle school?

412
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,970
I don't know!

413
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,724
My brain isn't functioning
as we've been doing this for three hours.

414
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,392
Sit up.

415
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,686
Come on.

416
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
At this rate, you can't go to Seoul
during your school break.

417
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,277
You said you wanted to check out TBC.

418
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,824
I should've just gone to Seoul
with Myeong-hee.

419
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,825
Seoul?

420
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,785
What's she doing in Seoul?

421
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,162
She went to the Capitol building
to get her passport made.

422
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,915
I should've tagged along
to see Gyeongbok Palace

423
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,750
and check out Seoul.

424
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,710
Are you going somewhere?

425
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,839
I'm going to Seoul today.

426
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,309
How will you solve functions
when you don't even know quadrants?

427
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,855
Open your book.

428
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,447
Thank you for the ride.

429
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,449
You helped me out so much all day today.

430
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,536
Come on. Your place
is on my way home anyway.

431
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,789
Thank you so much again.

432
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,708
I'll be sure to return the favor.

433
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,544
Get home safely.

434
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,837
All right. Good night.

435
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,136
Myeong-hee.

436
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,015
If you have some time tomorrow,

437
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,601
can you help me with something?

438
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,534
Hui-tae, what are you doing here?

439
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,872
Are you coming back from Seoul?

440
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,668
Yes.

441
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,211
With Su-chan?

442
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,839
How did you know?

443
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,635
You could've asked me to go with you.

444
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,472
How could I do that
knowing you're getting engaged?

445
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,640
Why not?

446
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,060
All you had to do was ask me,
but you didn't.

447
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,311
Look, this is…

448
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,979
All you had to do was ask.

449
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,692
-You know that I'm waiting for you--
-Exactly. So how can I, knowing that?

450
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,950
If we went to Seoul together,
what about your engagement?

451
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,203
What will you say to your family
as well as to Su-ryeon's?

452
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,332
What do you expect me to do
when there's nothing I can do?

453
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,501
Why do you say there's nothing you can do?

454
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,253
Do they have something on you?

455
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,130
Is someone threatening you?

456
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,883
-Hui-tae.
-No, right?

457
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,136
You just don't want to be a bad person.

458
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,101
Do you think I'm not afraid of anything?

459
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,021
You probably think I don't even care
what people think of me.

460
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,024
I'm trying to hold back
every single moment.

461
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,734
Because it's you.

462
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,654
Because I believed
you felt the same way about me.

463
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,034
We only have a month.

464
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,664
I don't even want to let
a day pass by like this.

465
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,754
I thought you were holding back too.

466
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,549
But I guess you're…

467
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,885
I guess you're okay.

468
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,098
I'm done writing letters to someone
who won't write me back.

469
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,554
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

470
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,641
What brings you by so late?

471
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,185
Well, here.

472
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,355
Can you give this to Su-ryeon?

473
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,193
What is this?

474
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,153
You can give it to her yourself.

475
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,198
Well, I'm not invited
to her engagement ceremony.

476
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,700
Plus…

477
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,870
She won't want to see me
because it'll be awkward.

478
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,836
DECLARATION OF DEMOCRACY

479
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,337
Su-ryeon wrote it.

480
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,675
She worked so hard on it,
so she should see how it turned out.

481
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,677
Make sure she gets it.

482
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,513
Hey.

483
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,230
So? What can I help you with today?

484
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,524
I need to borrow your fine taste.
Let's go.

485
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,943
We have many places to check out.

486
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,447
What about this?
This will go with everything.

487
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,073
Myeong-hee.

488
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,117
What's your shoe size?

489
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,786
It's 230mm. Why do you ask?

490
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,331
These happen to be 230mm.

491
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,793
Here. Try them on.

492
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,630
Why should I?
We're here to buy your shoes.

493
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,465
Well, this is just…

494
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,717
Just try them on.

495
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,177
Come on.

496
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,348
Here.

497
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,653
How pretty.

498
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,160
Myeong-hee.

499
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,498
This one. This too.

500
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,834
And this one too. Go try them on.

501
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,295
Why do you keep doing this?
Pick out things for yourself.

502
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,840
Goodness. Just go try them on.

503
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,093
Go on. We don't have time.

504
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,679
Hurry. Go.

505
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,639
-I'm really okay.
-Go on!

506
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,283
-Watch out.
-My gosh!

507
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,451
Gosh!

508
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,453
What's going on?

509
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,707
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

510
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,500
WATCH REPAIR

511
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,960
My goodness.

512
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,254
Those punks.

513
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,047
Are you all right?

514
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,882
-Gosh.
-Yes, I'm okay.

515
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
Goodness.

516
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,721
What's going on though?

517
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,764
It's obvious.

518
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,183
They're trying to catch the kids
who protested.

519
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,893
What a mess.

520
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,354
Goodness.

521
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,607
I see your daughter
is having a lot of fun lately.

522
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,193
Keep a good eye on your daughter.

523
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,029
She's not a kid anymore.

524
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,537
I thought we came
to pick out your clothes,

525
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,913
but these are all for me.

526
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,540
You're making me uncomfortable.

527
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,002
Just consider it as a gift for your help.
I'm choosing mine now.

528
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,338
I came to return a favor,

529
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,922
but I'm receiving more in return.

530
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,801
Come on, it's just a dress.
There's no need to say that.

531
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,598
Myeong-hee, you're like a sister
to Su-ryeon.

532
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,518
It's natural for siblings to receive gifts
when their sister or brother gets engaged.

533
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,397
How does this look?

534
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,901
It looks like a suit for a groom.

535
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,825
What about this?
This will look good on you.

536
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,578
I like it. It's nice and neat.

537
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,706
Ma'am, can I try this on?

538
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,042
There's someone
in the dressing room right now.

539
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,920
-Can you wait for a second?
-Sure.

540
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,525
Hey, Hui-tae!

541
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,568
Hello, Su-chan.

542
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,445
Did you come to get your suit fitted?

543
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,782
Gosh, what a great choice.

544
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,826
You look like a prince.

545
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,497
Are you going to try that on?

546
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,166
Yes. I'll go try this on.

547
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,334
Okay.

548
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,361
Hey, look at this.

549
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,574
It's so tight that I can't even breathe.

550
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,747
Myeong-hee.

551
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,375
What are you doing here?

552
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,880
Su-chan asked me
to help him pick out a suit.

553
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,842
Gosh, that looks perfect on you.

554
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,303
I wonder what the groom thinks about it.

555
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,478
It looks nice.

556
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,314
It's as if it were her own dress.

557
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,568
I told you it would look good.

558
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,996
Su-ryeon!

559
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,834
I never imagined seeing you in a dress.

560
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,671
Goodness, you both look amazing.

561
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,590
The perfect bride and groom.

562
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,384
Right. You're both tall too.

563
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,637
You look like foreign actors.

564
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,222
Don't you think?

565
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,894
Yes, they do.

566
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,270
Hui-tae.

567
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,648
You look like a movie star.

568
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,107
No way.

569
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,860
You look great too.

570
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,155
This? Myeong-hee chose this for me.

571
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,375
By the way, where are you two headed?

572
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,668
I'll give you a ride.

573
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,670
It's okay. We can take a cab.

574
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,505
We need to drop by a few places.

575
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,382
Hey, Su-ryeon.

576
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,467
Do you have time later?

577
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,469
Today?

578
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,639
Yes. I have something to give you.

579
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,643
I'm a bit busy today.

580
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,812
Myeong-hee.

581
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,482
Can we talk after the engagement ceremony?

582
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,944
Su-ryeon.

583
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,372
Okay, then.

584
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,214
We'll be off then. Drive safely.

585
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,133
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

586
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,397
Why is it pouring so suddenly?
My goodness.

587
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,986
Is anyone home?

588
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,614
Who is it?

589
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,242
Hello.

590
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,704
Is Myeong-hee here by any chance?

591
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,708
May I ask who you are?

592
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,422
What are you doing here?

593
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,179
I'm asking what you're doing here.

594
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,224
Do you still do this kind of stuff?

595
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,437
Give it to me. It's not what you think.

596
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,231
Give it to me! What are you…

597
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:23,280
You still haven't come to your senses
even after what happened?

598
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,868
Why do you care?

599
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,623
Why do you care
if I protest or set myself on fire?

600
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,041
Kim Myeong-hee!

601
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,253
I'm living just the way you want.

602
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,983
Dad.

603
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,528
Dad, something's wrong with this place.

604
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,197
All the others were released. Why am I…

605
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,573
No matter what,

606
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,951
just say "yes."

607
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,911
Dad, I really didn't do anything wrong.

608
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,829
How can I take the blame
for something I didn't do?

609
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,542
Just say yes to everything.

610
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,836
Say that everything is your fault.

611
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,839
Dad.

612
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,969
They have agreed to punish you
by making you drop out of school.

613
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,390
So live gratefully from now on.

614
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,357
Don't even breathe too loudly.

615
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,985
Live quietly.

616
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,409
Dad.

617
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,911
Just like you wanted,

618
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,456
I'm living quietly,
saying yes to everything.

619
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,960
I gave up everything in my life.

620
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,673
What more do you want me to do?

621
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,844
What more do you want from me?

622
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,345
By the way, how is an engagement ceremony
different from a wedding?

623
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,808
Don't they just promise to get married
at an engagement ceremony?

624
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,561
I thought that's what you do at a wedding.

625
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,939
I think an engagement ceremony
is like a preview of a wedding.

626
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,442
Anyway, only rich people seem to do it.

627
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,652
Right?

628
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,115
Whatever. Just go back to sleep.

629
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,577
Hey. Can you bring back
some good food for us?

630
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,746
Yes, you should.

631
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,207
What? Are you out of your mind?

632
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,042
How can I possibly bring back food
from the ceremony?

633
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,545
Hold on.

634
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,927
At least bring back
some rice cakes in this bag.

635
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,596
Are you guys beggars? Don't be ridiculous.

636
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,557
Get him!

637
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,270
-Stop it!
-Are you going to do it or not?

638
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,187
-Bring back some food!
-Get off me!

639
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,981
Are you going to do it?

640
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,066
-Promise that you will!
-Answer!

641
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,660
Are you okay?

642
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,290
You have a fever.
You should've taken the afternoon off.

643
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,583
I'm fine.

644
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,294
I'm getting off work soon anyway.

645
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,974
Thanks.

646
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,331
FROM ASSEMBLYMAN HAN SEOK-JUNG

647
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,917
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT,
HWANG HUI-TAE AND LEE SU-RYEON

648
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,460
This way, please.

649
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,586
FROM PRESIDENT YOON SOON-YOUNG
OF GYEONGJU GAS

650
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,547
Make way, please. This way, sir.

651
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,716
Hello.

652
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,845
Congratulations.

653
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,180
Couldn't your wife make it?

654
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,390
-She's helping out at the church.
-I see.

655
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,642
Please.

656
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,146
Thank you.

657
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,791
There you are.

658
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,877
Myeong-hee.

659
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,341
Come on. Don't cry.

660
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,510
You'll ruin your makeup.

661
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,307
By the way…

662
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,811
Here.

663
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,737
I'm sorry.

664
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,574
I should've taken better care of it.

665
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,867
It's all in pieces.

666
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,827
DECLARATION OF DEMOCRACY

667
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,203
This is…

668
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,039
It's from Hye-gun.

669
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,458
He said you should see the result
of your hard work.

670
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,057
The ceremony is starting soon.
Please get ready.

671
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,476
See you out there.

672
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,662
It's starting!

673
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,101
The engagement ceremony

674
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,939
of Hwang Hui-tae
and Lee Su-ryeon will begin shortly.

675
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,151
Please be seated.

676
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,278
Myeong-hee, sit here.

677
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,699
We're honored

678
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,912
to have you all as our guests
on this happy day.

679
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,830
We will now begin the engagement ceremony

680
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,917
of Mr. Hwang Gi-nam's eldest son,
Hwang Hui-tae,

681
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,964
and Mr. Lee Chang-geun's eldest daughter,
Lee Su-ryeon.

682
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,720
First,

683
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,682
the parents of the couple
will thank the guests.

684
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,350
Please give them a big hand.

685
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,318
Auntie. Why are you…

686
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,494
Thank you all for coming.

687
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,711
Now,

688
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:01,339
-it's time to welcome the couple.
-What was that?

689
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:07,554
Please give a warm round of applause
for the soon-to-be bride and groom!

690
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,887
You want me
to get engaged to Lee Su-ryeon?

691
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,849
Yes.

692
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,393
Are you sure you'll be okay

693
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,104
if I get engaged?

694
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,484
Yes.

695
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,393
Now, the soon-to-be bride and groom

696
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:42,440
will bow to the guests
to show their gratitude.

697
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,125
Sir, my son would like to thank you.

698
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,337
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

699
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,755
She's the daughter of Changhwa Industrial.

700
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,466
-I see.
-Enjoy your meal, sir.

701
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,592
Come this way.

702
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,303
Hello.

703
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,889
Thank you for coming.

704
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,641
Do you like the food?

705
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,018
-I love it.
-You should thank him.

706
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,571
I must be distracting you from your meal.
I shouldn't have made you sit next to me.

707
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:30,655
Don't…

708
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,449
Don't worry.

709
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,075
Do you want some more water?

710
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,744
-Excuse…
-It's fine. I'll get it myself.

711
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,496
Go and talk to your guests.

712
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,927
Gosh, why am I doing this?

713
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,150
I'm sorry.

714
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,571
No. I shouldn't have popped up
from behind.

715
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,823
Don't worry.

716
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,992
It's really fine.

717
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,202
Go and eat some more.

718
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,971
My, the groom is so good-looking.

719
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,973
She wouldn't need any wedding gifts!

720
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,350
I know.

721
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,353
Su-ryeon is such a lucky girl.

722
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,355
He's handsome,
and he's a doctor on top of that.

723
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,317
It's a mystery that he didn't get
snatched up sooner, you know?

724
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,069
-It is a mystery indeed.
-Right?

725
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,907
-He's so good-looking.
-Come on. Hurry.

726
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,534
My goodness.

727
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,539
-What a fine young man.
-I know. He's so handsome.

728
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,957
He really is.

729
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,683
Even the grasshoppers
aren't helping me today.

730
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,649
I look forward to May every year.

731
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,195
On a May night, even if you sing badly,

732
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,948
the grasshoppers help you out.

733
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,034
The grasshoppers?

734
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,785
Whenever I think of you, Myeong-hee,

735
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,455
I can't help but sing.

736
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,167
Myeong-hee.

737
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,921
Do you want to go out with me
just until the end of May?

738
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,411
Are you okay?

739
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,582
No.

740
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm not okay.

741
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,051
I don't want this May to pass by

742
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,680
without you.

743
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,023
Do you think you can beat me now
that you're grown up?

744
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,775
What if our family
or one of our guests saw you?

745
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,276
Why are you so angry?

746
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,237
You can't say that. You ran away
from your engagement ceremony.

747
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,073
Why did he drink so much?

748
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,283
-I'm off today and tomorrow.
-Then let's hang out the whole time.

749
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,660
What a coincidence.

750
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,704
I can't believe Hui-tae's brother
is your roommate, Myeong-su.

751
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,331
What is your relationship?

752
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,499
Joint management?

753
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,292
It's so the investors
can put their worries to rest.

754
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,838
Let's call off Su-ryeon's engagement.
Hwang Hui-tae is seeing someone else.
