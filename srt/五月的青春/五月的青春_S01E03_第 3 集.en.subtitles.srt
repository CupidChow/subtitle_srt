1
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,230
Leave them here.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,945
-That should go in the back seat.
-Yes, sir.

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,992
If you bribe someone like this,
you'll be caught right away.

4
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,204
I guess you could call this a bribe.

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,207
Today is your future
father-in-law's birthday.

6
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,500
What?

7
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,504
I'm grateful enough that
you came to wish me a happy birthday.

8
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,506
You really didn't have to bring anything.

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,010
Su-ryeon, get over here.

10
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,429
Mr. Hwang sent us this precious gift.

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,724
A gift? What gift?

12
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,727
And his son brought it
all the way here in person.

13
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,158
We must expel

14
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,119
all government-funded professors,
who have lived as parasites

15
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,081
of the Yushin dictatorship
from our sacred campus!

16
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,186
You must be surprised
that I showed up unannounced,

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,771
Su-ryeon.

18
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,541
Why are you standing around?
Come have a seat.

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,295
Guys, come have a seat.

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,881
Well, I should get going.

21
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,760
Why? Stay and eat with us.

22
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,097
No, you have a guest.

23
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,642
Are you uncomfortable?

24
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,311
No, I'm fine.

25
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,566
But Su-ryeon's friend can do
as she wishes.

26
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,236
I'll get going, then.

27
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,821
Myeong-hee!

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,241
Where are you going? Stay and eat with us.

29
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,827
-No, I should get going.
-Come on.

30
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,121
I bought a cake.

31
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,582
Just stay and eat with us.

32
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,918
Who might this be?

33
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,379
Su-chan.

34
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,008
This is Mr. Hwang's son.
I told you about him the other day.

35
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,927
The guy Su-ryeon has been seeing?

36
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,017
I'm Hwang Hui-tae.

37
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,353
Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,189
I'm Lee Su-chan, Su-ryeon's brother.

39
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,832
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday.

40
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,292
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

41
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,045
Let's eat. Eat up.

42
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,387
Goodness.

43
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,349
I'm sorry that all we did was put
an extra spoon on the table.

44
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,310
I would've gotten a hen
if you told us you were coming.

45
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,395
A hen? Please, Dad.

46
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,732
If you cooked a hen on top of this,
the table would collapse.

47
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,984
It's a humble spread,
but eat as much as you want.

48
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,319
-Please.
-Will do.

49
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,737
By the way, Hui-tae.

50
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,157
Su-ryeon is such a tomboy.
What do you like about her?

51
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,410
Don't say that you like everything
about her. That's such a cliche.

52
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,703
Why do you like her?

53
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,498
Well…

54
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,460
This place isn't open to just anyone.

55
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,504
Can we trust you?

56
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,177
She left a strong first impression on me.

57
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,268
Right away, she said we should go print
some anti-government flyers.

58
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,903
My gosh, you're really something.

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,029
Jeez.

60
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,701
Su-ryeon, what about you?
What do you like about him?

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,494
Are you losing your mind?

62
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,162
Why must you ask such a question?

63
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,956
I'm curious too.

64
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,959
I want to know
how you've felt about me until now.

65
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,217
The thing is…

66
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,937
Whatever, never mind. Let's just eat.

67
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,483
My gosh. It seems like
you really should get married soon.

68
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,111
I've never seen you get so shy.

69
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,364
I told you! It's really not like that.

70
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,659
Goodness, you and your temper.

71
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,708
You know them well, don't you?

72
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,001
What?

73
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,922
I meant the rice cake place
that you go often.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,384
I should order some rice cakes
for the grand opening.

75
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,762
Will they take good care of me
if I go alone?

76
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,348
Why don't I go there
and place the order for you?

77
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,892
It's very close to my house, you know.

78
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,769
Let's just go together then.

79
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,064
How about we meet there
before your shift tomorrow?

80
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,443
All right, then. Come on.

81
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,283
Dad, shall I tell them
to come back inside?

82
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,203
No, leave them alone. Don't ruin the mood.

83
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,388
I'll drop the honorifics
since we're the same age.

84
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,808
What kind of scheme brings you here?

85
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,017
Me?

86
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,394
I'm here to figure out your scheme.

87
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,148
What was your purpose
behind starting this ruse?

88
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,818
And what do you plan to do going forward?

89
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,327
My purpose and plan? It's simple.

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,997
I don't want to marry you.
Go ahead and reject me.

91
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,792
You need to gauge the situation better.

92
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm the one who has leverage over you.

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,548
Reject you? Why would I?
It'll be such a hassle.

94
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,259
All I need to do is tell our parents
what you did.

95
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,010
Go ahead then!

96
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,471
Why bother playing along?

97
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,933
I don't want to get Myeong-hee
into trouble.

98
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,395
Why are you bringing her up
all of a sudden?

99
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,730
She has nothing to do with you.

100
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,445
I like her, that's why.

101
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,446
What?

102
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,531
Who?

103
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,576
You like Myeong-hee?

104
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,744
Yes, I like Myeong-hee.
Got a problem with that?

105
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:39,167
Hey, I sent Myeong-hee there
to be rejected in my place.

106
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,380
Right. If getting rejected was your goal,
you should've come yourself.

107
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,884
Why did you have to send Myeong-hee
as your stand-in and complicate things?

108
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,344
You're being ridiculous.

109
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,805
I think you got the wrong idea.

110
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,141
Don't you dare hit on her.

111
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,978
Myeong-hee has no feelings for you
whatsoever.

112
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,563
In fact, she can't stand you.

113
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,689
Well…

114
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,775
I have a hard time believing you.

115
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,696
You don't seem all that interested
in other people's feelings.

116
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,617
Money is the reason she's been seeing you.

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,119
What?

118
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,915
Myeong-hee has been forcing herself
to see you to earn money.

119
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,338
Why?

120
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,966
Did you actually think
that she had feelings for you?

121
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,053
Yes.

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,642
What's with her suddenly?

123
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,645
Did you two
have a lover's quarrel or what?

124
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,608
Thank you so much for today.

125
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,027
And happy birthday, sir.

126
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,111
Thanks.

127
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,906
Gosh, I almost forgot.

128
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,033
I almost sent you home empty-handed.

129
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,034
Right.

130
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,203
We packed some food for you.
Wait right here.

131
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,538
It's okay.

132
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,134
Is your leg okay?

133
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,685
It's true that I missed you,
but I didn't expect to see you here.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,648
Hui-tae.

135
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,349
Then I'll see you again next time,
Myeong-hee.

136
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,769
Hui-tae, here.

137
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,896
Gosh, there was no need.

138
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,358
It's nothing much,
so no need to feel uncomfortable.

139
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,735
Okay, thank you.

140
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,945
-Drop by again next time.
-Sure.

141
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,953
Anyway, I'm afraid we'll have to maintain
this situation for the time being.

142
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,206
What? Do you mean you'll keep lying?

143
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,335
What do you mean? It's not a lie.

144
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,919
What I mean is,

145
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,173
we'll just continue not to tell the truth
for a while.

146
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,261
Whenever I tell my dad
I'm going to meet him,

147
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,972
he's totally okay with it
whether it's day or night.

148
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,641
If he's going to find out anyway,

149
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,478
why don't we get what we need out of it
and worry about the aftermath later?

150
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,147
My goodness, you're totally crazy!

151
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,108
What if things get out of hand?
What will you do then?

152
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,569
Gosh, I don't know.

153
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,156
Anyway, let's stop talking about that.

154
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,949
The thing is…

155
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,787
Myeong-hee, can I ask you something?

156
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,871
What?

157
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,082
Well…

158
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,668
Do you

159
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,088
like Hwang Hui-tae?

160
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,970
What are you talking about?

161
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,931
No way!

162
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,599
Right?

163
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,351
Okay, I'm glad to hear that.

164
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,939
I made it quite certain
that he won't hit on you anymore.

165
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,650
What did you say to him?

166
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,318
I told him you're meeting him
to make money

167
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,529
and you have
no feelings for him whatsoever.

168
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,532
Did you really say that?

169
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,616
Yes. Why?

170
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,285
It's the truth, isn't it?
You won't see him again anyway.

171
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,957
Are you seeing him again?

172
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,921
No.

173
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,137
TONIGHT AT 7 P.M.,
MUSIC CAFE HEE HEE NAK RAK

174
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,187
What is it?

175
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,857
Is something wrong?

176
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,693
You look like an antsy dog.

177
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,781
The thing is…

178
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,994
A friend of mine wants to see me.

179
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,872
But my best friend

180
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,999
hates that friend so much.

181
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,960
And she said
she won't hang out with us anymore.

182
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,712
Then don't meet that friend.

183
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,717
What if that friend keeps waiting,
thinking I'll show up?

184
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,762
Then meet secretly.

185
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,474
Then I'll be lying to my best friend.

186
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,018
Don't meet the first friend then.

187
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,896
-But…
-Man, whatever.

188
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,690
If you want to go, just go.
If you don't, don't.

189
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,525
What's gotten into you?

190
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,960
The DJ at this place is kind of ugly,

191
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,297
but he plays some amazing songs…

192
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,341
Hey, two o'clock, look.

193
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,425
Two o'clock?

194
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,978
He's gorgeous, isn't he?

195
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,152
-Hey, give me some lipstick.
-Lipstick?

196
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,112
What for?

197
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,657
Are you going to go talk to him?

198
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,242
Are you insane?

199
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,953
Only a woman with courage
gets the hot guy.

200
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,413
I'll go fix my makeup and go right over.

201
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,963
Myeong-hee.

202
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,892
It'll taste bad
if you keep stirring it like that.

203
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,270
That's how I like it.

204
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,366
Why did you ask to meet me?

205
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,789
I promised to play my song for you.

206
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,252
Were you waiting for me
all this time for that?

207
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,631
What about you then? Why did you come?

208
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,677
I came to apologize.

209
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,139
I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time.

210
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,145
Why are you apologizing?
You never deceived me.

211
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,273
Why didn't you say anything when you knew?

212
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,402
If I said something,
we wouldn't be able to meet.

213
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,533
I wanted to keep seeing you,
and I still do.

214
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,038
You want to keep meeting me?

215
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,498
Yes, I do.

216
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,878
I'm not the person you think I am.

217
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,504
I'm not the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial either.

218
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,632
I know. The cheeky nurse
from the ER, right?

219
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm the eldest daughter
of a penniless family,

220
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,933
and I dropped out of high school
and took the GED.

221
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,437
I was born out of wedlock.

222
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,856
My mom used to sing at nightclubs.

223
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,198
But what's the problem with that?

224
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,328
Thanks to our pasts, we turned out to be
strong and interesting people.

225
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,046
The truth is,

226
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,215
next month, I'm…

227
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,979
Hey!

228
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,071
Wait, lady.

229
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,619
That blouse looks very familiar.

230
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,084
Right, I know that face too.

231
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,088
But that person should be
studying in the library right now.

232
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,300
Myeong-hee, please don't tell Dad
about this.

233
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,863
Gosh.

234
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,701
Do you know Myeong-hee?

235
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,954
Yes.

236
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,554
It's my first time actually seeing
someone who goes to SNU.

237
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,348
May I hold your hand?

238
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,517
What are you doing?

239
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,810
Behave yourself.

240
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,650
Myeong-hee,
what's your relationship with Jin-a?

241
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,902
We live together.

242
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,238
-My dad owns some real estate.
-It's just a boarding house.

243
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,033
I see. A boarding house.

244
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,124
Jin-a, do you have a pen?

245
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,294
Shall I give you my pencil case?

246
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,838
If it's okay with you,
can you write down your number?

247
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,263
I'll write it with a permanent marker.

248
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,309
-What are you doing?
-What?

249
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,813
I just want to talk about music
with her someday

250
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,689
since we're both music fanatics.

251
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,651
By the way,

252
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,780
how do you and Myeong-hee know each other?

253
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,323
Well…

254
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,618
-Myeong-hee and I--
-Our bus is here.

255
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,411
Get up.

256
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,894
Hello?

257
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,355
It's you, Hui-tae.

258
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,818
Su-ryeon? You haven't met her?

259
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,320
I see.

260
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,699
So she said she had a date with me.

261
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,079
No. We do have a date.

262
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,081
All right. Have a great time.

263
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,010
Su-chan. Are you going somewhere?

264
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,262
I'm going to order rice cakes
for the opening ceremony.

265
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,514
I'm running late. I'll see you later.

266
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,896
-Have you been well?
-Hey, it's been a while.

267
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,189
Hold on.

268
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,440
Are you here to order rice cakes
for your wedding?

269
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,694
Our wedding? It's not like that.

270
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,530
What are you talking about?
It's for his opening ceremony.

271
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,824
Can you prepare them by tomorrow morning?

272
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,493
Tomorrow morning?
We're a bit backlogged here.

273
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,370
I don't think we can.

274
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,914
Come on.

275
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,000
You should never miss a customer
who's having an opening ceremony.

276
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,794
I brought him here
so he'd become your regular.

277
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,214
Have them ready by tomorrow morning, okay?

278
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,716
What are you going to order, anyway?

279
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,553
-First, some red-bean rice cakes.
-Red-bean rice cakes.

280
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,554
Hold on.

281
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,474
These red beans look a bit old.

282
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,686
-Do you have any newer batches?
-Jeez, they were delivered this morning.

283
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,564
Also, rice cakes made with old beans
taste better.

284
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,982
Don't use these.

285
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,486
Use the ones that you hid in the back.

286
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,112
They're all the same.

287
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,573
-Can we get a discount?
-Of course.

288
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,326
Su-chan, do you want to
have them delivered?

289
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,997
What? Yes, that sounds good.

290
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,338
If I'd come here alone,
my guests would've had

291
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,548
just one bite of rice cake each.

292
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,010
It's better to have too much.
It's a celebration.

293
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,763
Hold on. Shouldn't you eat before work?

294
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,766
-What do you want to eat?
-Don't worry. I'll eat at the hospital.

295
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,186
Come on. Let me buy you something nice.

296
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,690
Are there any good places around here?

297
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,737
WATCH REPAIR

298
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,708
You don't want ribs, do you?

299
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,464
-Let's go eat somewhere else.
-Should we do that?

300
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,350
What? Marriage?

301
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,271
It seems like the parents
are talking about it.

302
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,481
Hasn't Su-ryeon told you?

303
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,111
But they only just met.

304
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,279
Hey.

305
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:07,659
You can't believe the mighty Lee Su-ryeon
is getting married, can you?

306
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,205
I can't either.

307
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,751
I'm also worried that
they're rushing things a bit.

308
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,169
It doesn't feel right.

309
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,089
There also seem to be rumors
going around about the guy.

310
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,842
I wish Su-ryeon would be more careful.

311
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,970
What kind of rumors?

312
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,516
They're nothing serious,

313
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,354
but I would've preferred a guy
who grew up in a happy family.

314
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,149
I'm probably just being nosy.

315
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,616
Goodness. Like I said,
I'm just being nosy.

316
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,367
As long as they like each other,
who cares?

317
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,329
Don't you think the two of them
are quite similar?

318
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,499
A couple like that may quibble,
but they live happy lives.

319
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,586
Government-funded professors must resign!

320
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,672
-Resign!
-Resign!

321
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,341
Yushin remnants must resign!

322
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,511
-Resign!
-Resign!

323
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,012
Government-funded professors must resign!

324
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,764
-Resign!
-Resign!

325
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,432
-Resign!
-Resign!

326
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,477
My dear student democracy activists.

327
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:21,691
We should not be onlookers or bystanders.

328
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:27,739
We should be the leaders of the university
and the democracy movement!

329
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,325
Government-funded professors must resign!

330
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,743
-Resign!
-Resign!

331
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,204
Government-funded professors must resign!

332
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,039
-Lee Su-ryeon.
-Resign!

333
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,999
Government-funded professors must resign!

334
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,252
-Lee Su-ryeon.
-Resign!

335
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,212
Government-funded professors must resign!

336
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,714
-Hey!
-Resign!

337
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,685
What's this? What are you doing here?

338
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,980
What else? You and I have a date.

339
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,065
They have a date.

340
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,695
We'll talk later.

341
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,530
I don't have time
to deal with you right now.

342
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,116
Do you really have the right
to criticize government-funded professors?

343
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,117
What?

344
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,663
You want to reap the benefits
while avoiding the responsibilities?

345
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,668
Do they know that you're playing a hero

346
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,421
using the son of the Head
of Anti-communist Investigation?

347
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,465
-What's he saying?
-I'm not sure.

348
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,804
Get lost while I'm still being nice.

349
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,729
Gosh, seriously.

350
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:46,234
Hey, Hui-tae. What are you doing here?

351
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,072
So?

352
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,284
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of everyone?

353
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,339
Government-funded professors must resign!

354
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,132
-Resign!
-Resign!

355
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,509
Government-funded professors must resign!

356
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,386
-Resign!
-Gosh!

357
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,514
-No.
-Gosh!

358
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,521
-Myeong-hee.
-Myeong-hee.

359
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,526
What happened? You have a concussion?

360
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm totally fine,
but this jerk still dragged me here.

361
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,952
Gosh. She fell while fooling around
on the railing of the rooftop.

362
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,537
Hey, I only fell because you grabbed me.

363
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,206
Be quiet, both of you.

364
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,252
So? Did you get a CT scan?

365
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,296
Yes. Everything seems fine,

366
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,839
except for some minor symptoms
of a concussion.

367
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,885
Myeong-hee,
please make sure I can leave soon.

368
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,595
The protest must be
at its height right now.

369
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,347
Do you still want to play a hero?

370
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,309
Hey, no one will even notice
you're not there.

371
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,978
-What did you just say?
-Stop it.

372
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,437
Stop it, you two!

373
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,192
I'll go and ask if you can leave.

374
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,360
Wait here.

375
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,362
-Okay.
-You little…

376
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,363
Will you…

377
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,993
-Don't fight, okay?
-Okay.

378
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,788
Come on. Seriously.

379
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,374
Behave, okay?

380
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,209
Gosh.

381
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,756
-Stop it. I said, stop it.
-Let go.

382
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,174
Jeez!

383
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,595
-This is so dusty.
-Did you just hit me?

384
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,264
What? No, I didn't.

385
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,183
Don't you think the two of them
are quite similar?

386
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,894
A couple like that may quibble,
but they live happy lives.

387
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,689
-You really need to stop.
-Whatever.

388
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,648
-Hey.
-What?

389
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
-My patience has a limit.
-So?

390
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,486
EMERGENCY ROOM

391
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,786
Myeong-hee.

392
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,834
Well, I wasn't going to wait for you.

393
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,837
I just had some business
at the hospital and the timing…

394
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,130
Where is Su-ryeon?

395
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,466
I don't know. She went somewhere.

396
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,968
You're hungry, aren't you?

397
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,970
Let's go get something to eat first.

398
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,556
Then I'll sing you that song I wrote
as I promised.

399
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,690
I don't want that.

400
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,611
What do you mean?

401
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,363
You'll tell me
we should stop seeing each other.

402
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,405
I don't want that.

403
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,620
Did you know
that your fathers are discussing

404
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,122
your marriage?

405
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,334
Both you and Su-ryeon
have complicated problems to solve.

406
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,461
I don't want to make things any worse
for you guys.

407
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,755
Forget me and Su-ryeon.

408
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,298
What about you?

409
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:02,055
Tell me how you feel,
and I'll make everything simple.

410
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,938
I'm going abroad to study.

411
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,148
What?

412
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,901
That's what I was trying
to tell you yesterday.

413
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,529
I'm leaving in a month.

414
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,116
I only went on that blind date with you

415
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,785
to earn my airfare.

416
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,169
When will you come back?

417
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,592
My plan is to move there

418
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,428
permanently.

419
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,056
So let's not do anything
we'll regret later on.

420
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,517
Let's end this here.

421
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,812
So we can only remember the good things.

422
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,194
Wait, Myeong-hee.

423
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,621
I'm glad to have met you.

424
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,957
I really mean it.

425
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,463
A month?

426
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,884
At this point,
even that's pretty optimistic.

427
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,886
Her recovery is slow.

428
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,556
I can't say for sure
how long she'll hold out.

429
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,016
Can't she

430
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,978
still be transferred?

431
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,188
That's beside the point.

432
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,356
She's unconscious.

433
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,483
To her, it'll make no difference
whether she's in Seoul or Gwangju.

434
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,529
Don't you think it's selfish
to make her take this risk?

435
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,831
My gosh.

436
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,458
What is it now?

437
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,962
Why doesn't anything ever go my way?

438
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,430
Hey, be honest now.
Is everything really okay?

439
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,272
Think about this.

440
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,067
Let's say you just met the woman
of your dreams,

441
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,653
but she's going away for good in a month.

442
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,905
What would you do?

443
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,826
-Is Su-ryeon going somewhere?
-I'm not talking about her!

444
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,999
The woman of my dreams
who's going away for good?

445
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,586
I'd give up immediately.

446
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,463
Why?

447
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,216
I'd rather live with regrets
than miss her for the rest of my life.

448
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,927
I hate heartaches.

449
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,263
Just continue to live the way
you always have.

450
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,516
Isn't it your philosophy of life
to live lightheartedly?

451
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,646
That's when it's only about my life.

452
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,691
It's totally different
once another person's life is involved.

453
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,234
Goodness.

454
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,321
You've come a long way.

455
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,156
You care about another person now?

456
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,367
If you have a headache,

457
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,370
why not try the solution
from our high school days?

458
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,579
Here.

459
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,679
Goodness. You startled me.

460
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,224
-You're home late.
-Since when do you smoke?

461
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,810
Well, this is…

462
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,772
Go to bed early.
We have somewhere to be tomorrow.

463
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,983
Dad. Your lighter.

464
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,861
Keep it.
Make sure you carry it at all times.

465
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,671
So, Dad is going to bring more clothes
to the camp?

466
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,049
Yes, on the next market day.

467
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,095
Why don't you put on
the new shoes instead?

468
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,682
The shoelaces are a hassle.

469
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,852
They keep getting tangled if I tie them.

470
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,525
You wear worn-out shoes
because shoelaces are a hassle?

471
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,612
Put these on instead.

472
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:53,948
Come on.

473
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,952
I don't want to. I don't!

474
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,037
Little bear.

475
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,664
It's all over. I messed up.

476
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,710
All the kids are annoying
and I got on the wrong side of the coach.

477
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,971
When something is tangled,
just untangle it.

478
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,891
Untangle it carefully

479
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,268
and tie it nicely again.

480
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,065
If you leave it tangled, it's your loss.

481
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,318
Whether it's your shoelaces or training,

482
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,571
isn't running fast
the most important thing to you?

483
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,467
Jeong-tae, are you angry
you're not allowed to stay at the camp?

484
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,843
You know how Dad is.

485
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,262
He barely gave permission about
you missing school to train--

486
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,722
No, it's not like that.

487
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,100
I'll get going.

488
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,271
I'll come pick you up
before Dad gets off work.

489
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,689
Don't come to the camp.

490
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,150
Meet me here instead.

491
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,916
Guys, don't run.

492
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,002
-Joo-bin, you're in Room One.
-Yes, coach.

493
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,838
Kyung-jae, Room One.

494
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,967
-Gun-woo, Room One.
-Yes, coach.

495
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,053
Digestive Drink, Room Four. Work hard.

496
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,138
Yes, coach.

497
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,182
-Attention.
-Attention!

498
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,017
I can't hear you. Attention!

499
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:45,935
-Attention!
-Attention!

500
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,312
You have just three minutes.

501
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,356
Go to your rooms and unpack.

502
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,984
Change into training clothes
and get back here.

503
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,235
Ready.

504
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,994
Too slow. Hurry up!

505
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,328
-Yes, coach!
-Yes, coach!

506
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
Jeong-tae, are you in Room Four too?

507
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,264
It's just my luck.

508
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,808
Move.

509
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,896
You have one minute left!

510
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,315
There will be a penalty
for the one who comes last.

511
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,282
Guys, hurry.

512
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,704
Hey, Digestive Drink!

513
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,581
What?

514
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,082
Take it off. It's mine.

515
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,586
We all have the same uniform.
Why must you be so fussy?

516
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,712
Hand it over.

517
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,673
Hey, let go!

518
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,010
-Hand it over.
-I said, let go!

519
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,596
-This is mine.
-Hey, let go!

520
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,141
-Stay focused.
-Stay focused.

521
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,893
-Stay focused.
-Stay focused.

522
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,395
-Stay focused.
-Stay focused.

523
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,571
Hey, I can barely hear you.

524
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,281
Do you want to do ten more laps?

525
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,242
Stay focused.

526
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,369
Stay focused.

527
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,329
Stay focused.

528
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,539
Stay focused.

529
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,458
If you leave it tangled,

530
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,836
-it's your loss.
-Stay focused.

531
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,005
-Stay focused.
-Stay focused.

532
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,924
Stay focused.

533
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,592
Stay focused.

534
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,845
My gosh, Gyeongju Gas sent one too.

535
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,432
I know. There's limited space,
so it'd be better to leave them here.

536
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,518
-Yes, let's do that.
-That's right.

537
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,937
-Perfect.
-Su-chan. Everyone's here, right?

538
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,273
I'll get going then.

539
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,110
You brat! Where do you need to go?

540
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,071
You must stay until the end
as a member of the family!

541
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,657
Hey, Auntie is right.

542
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,951
What's going on? Do you have another date?

543
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,870
What? You have a date?

544
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,122
Why didn't you tell us?

545
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,709
My gosh, Mr. Kim! You made it!

546
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,168
-Thank you for coming.
-Hello.

547
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,170
Gosh, Mr. Hwang!

548
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,050
I'm sorry we're a little late.

549
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,806
Congratulations, Su-chan.

550
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,267
Gosh, thank you.

551
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,685
Can you take this?

552
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,854
Aren't you guys going on a date?

553
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,984
I guess you came to see her
because you couldn't wait.

554
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,611
Right.

555
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,906
My goodness.

556
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,868
You keep showering me
with such precious gifts.

557
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,872
You gave my son permission to marry
your daughter, your dearest treasure.

558
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,841
-Myeong-hee.
-Myeong-hee.

559
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,884
-What?
-My gosh.

560
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,969
I didn't know there would be
so many guests.

561
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,558
I had no idea.

562
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,396
My goodness,
you didn't have to bring anything.

563
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,987
Su-chan.

564
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,114
-Show Mr. Hwang around.
-Right.

565
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,283
I'll be right back. Wait here, okay?

566
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,244
Mr. Hwang, I'll give you a little tour.

567
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,954
This way, please.

568
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,211
Gosh, Su-ryeon.

569
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,089
Your husband-to-be is here.
Why are you standing around?

570
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,548
Go make some coffee for him.

571
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,759
Auntie, don't call him like that.

572
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,844
I'll make coffee.

573
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,179
Take a seat.

574
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,015
Yes, take a seat.

575
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,601
Enjoy the food, everyone.

576
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,897
Yes, thank you for coming.

577
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,525
CHANGHWA PHARMACEUTICALS AERIAL VIEW

578
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,489
You'll buy patented medicines
from other countries and manufacture them?

579
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,492
Will this be more profitable
than just importing them?

580
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,786
Yes, of course.

581
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,248
Being able to supply
such medicines on our own

582
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,960
without having to rely on importing them
will help strengthen our country.

583
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,755
You have such an admirable son.

584
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,551
Gosh, he has grand plans
but has a long way to go.

585
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,721
We underestimated
building a pharmaceutical factory.

586
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,141
It costs a fortune.

587
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,479
One of my in-laws is looking for
a company to invest in.

588
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,023
Shall I introduce you to him?

589
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,233
Pardon me?

590
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,278
We'd be grateful, but you don't have to.

591
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,864
This isn't some stranger's business.
We're a family now.

592
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,994
You're the brother
of my future daughter-in-law.

593
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,462
Make two cups of coffee for me.

594
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,422
-No sugar, please.
-Sure.

595
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,132
Hey.

596
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,677
Is that the guy?
Su-chan's future brother-in-law.

597
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,053
The one born out of wedlock.

598
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,225
He wasn't just born out of wedlock.
His mother was a courtesan.

599
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,770
My gosh, what is
Su-chan's family thinking?

600
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,898
I understand their daughter
is a troublemaker,

601
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,275
but how could they marry her off
to someone's illegitimate son?

602
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,486
Come on. I heard he's a med student.

603
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,987
And he's good-looking.

604
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,324
He'd better be.
His mother was a courtesan after all.

605
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,576
Keep it down. He'll hear you.

606
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,080
I was born out of wedlock.

607
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,001
But what's the problem with that?

608
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,796
Thanks to our pasts, we turned out
to be strong and interesting people.

609
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,471
My goodness.

610
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,016
If you let this year go by,
it'll be too late.

611
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,893
There's a right time for everything.

612
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,811
You won't be
an eligible bachelorette forever.

613
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,188
Why would you put it off?

614
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,024
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

615
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,860
-Stop it.
-Miss, are you a bookkeeper?

616
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,029
No, I'm Su-ryeon's friend.

617
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,074
My gosh.
You kept making coffee over there,

618
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,535
so I thought you worked at a coffee shop.

619
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,204
Don't get me wrong.
It's because you're pretty.

620
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,540
-Did you go to college together?
-Listen to me.

621
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,916
Do you have a boyfriend?

622
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,628
She's my guest.

623
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,008
Really?

624
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,845
Myeong-hee, let's go. I'll take you home.

625
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,764
Come on.

626
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,440
Enjoy the coffee.

627
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,028
I'm off.

628
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,410
We should get going too, ma'am.

629
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,203
-Shall we?
-Okay.

630
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,247
-See you.
-Okay, see you.

631
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,139
You should never force yourself to do
what you're not used to.

632
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,184
If I keep forcing myself like this,
I may actually fall ill.

633
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,644
Let's end this here.

634
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,271
What?

635
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,358
-Hey, you're also--
-I'll give you three days.

636
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,819
Whether you tell the truth or another lie,

637
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,030
do what it takes to deal with your family.

638
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,948
If we take this further,
we can't get out of it.

639
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,952
What if I say no?

640
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,831
Then I'll do whatever I want.

641
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,471
What? Med school?

642
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,932
Myeong-hee, I'm so impressed.

643
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,851
It's nothing impressive.

644
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,063
The med schools here only admit those
who will become doctors,

645
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,566
whereas everyone gets admitted in Germany,
but few survive.

646
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,152
I have to do a good job
once I start school.

647
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,154
People who are overly modest
can be annoying, you see.

648
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,034
So when do you leave?

649
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,828
In a month. That's the plan now.

650
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,748
What? In a month?

651
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,252
It all depends on the situation,
so it might change,

652
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,130
but that's the plan for now.

653
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,299
That's too soon…

654
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,094
I mean, that's soon.

655
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,638
A month will fly by.

656
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,851
What? You have gray hair.

657
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,270
What? I do?

658
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,147
Hold on. Let me pluck it.

659
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,284
Let's go, shall we?

660
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,304
Myeong-hee.

661
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,849
Hold him down.

662
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,520
You idiots.

663
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,274
I told you to interrogate him,
not butcher him.

664
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,193
Who will take responsibility
if things go south in this day and age?

665
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,486
We're sorry, sir.

666
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,824
Sir, please spare me.

667
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,242
Don't kill me!

668
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,245
Sit up!

669
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,499
Please, sir…
I really didn't do anything wrong.

670
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,002
-Please--
-Hey.

671
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,967
I really didn't do anything wrong!

672
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,470
I did nothing wrong!

673
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,555
Dad.

674
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,852
Please believe me! I didn't…

675
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,354
-I'm sorry, sir. We'll quickly…
-Forget it.

676
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,523
Have someone tail him.

677
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,818
The student council executive?
We're already on it.

678
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,861
No.

679
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,238
My son.

680
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,286
GWANGJU PEACE HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

681
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,081
My goodness, I'm in the main sector again.

682
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,836
It's already May.

683
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,005
Time really flies.

684
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,869
I'LL PASS THE EXAM THIS YEAR
NO MATTER WHAT!

685
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,750
Oh, right.

686
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:21,171
Darn, a year has passed already
but I can still smell my brother's stink.

687
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,423
Dad!

688
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,552
-Dad!
-What?

689
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,263
-Dad.
-What is it? I'm busy.

690
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,183
Can you give me some of those mothballs?
I need to get rid of that horrible stink.

691
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,644
I already put mothballs in that room
a long time ago.

692
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,187
-Seriously.
-Come on.

693
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,815
-I'm so busy. Goodness.
-Come on. Hurry.

694
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,530
Yes?

695
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,242
Yes, who is it?

696
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,877
Hui-tae?

697
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,380
How did you find where I live?

698
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,799
I mean, why are you here?

699
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,759
Myeong-hee. I…

700
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,804
Excuse me. Where is…

701
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,807
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

702
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,475
There are people in there.

703
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,770
I'm glad. I wanted to say hi to them.

704
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,564
Wait, Hui-tae.

705
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,816
Do you not remember what I said?

706
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:23,942
How can you…

707
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,154
Gosh, can you let go of me?

708
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,822
-Is he already here?
-Come on.

709
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,616
Hello.

710
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,125
No!

711
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,132
Hui-tae!

712
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,926
Mr. Hwang!

713
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,511
Gosh.

714
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,443
Have you lost your mind?
What did you do to our tutor?

715
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,696
What? Tutor?

716
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,367
Hui-tae is going to be my tutor
starting today.

717
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,702
Don't worry about it.

718
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,415
Wow, the taste is perfect.

719
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,362
Wait.

720
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,701
This belongs to my brother,
but it's all out of tune.

721
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,495
Do you want to tune it for me?

722
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,873
Later.

723
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,126
There we go.

724
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:11,508
First of all, let's take a look at this.

725
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,968
REPORT CARD, LEE JIN-A

726
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,429
Let's see.

727
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,349
Ethics, D, History, C,

728
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,559
Math, F.

729
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,146
Jin-a, what is your dream?

730
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,272
What?

731
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,066
My dream is to become a radio producer.

732
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,318
I want to produce a music show
like Forgotten Nights.

733
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,154
I see.

734
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,867
But Jin-a, you know what?

735
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,039
Do I have to be good at math
to be a producer?

736
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,376
No.

737
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,088
You're already destined
to be good at math.

738
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,341
-I am?
-Yes.

739
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,384
Listen.

740
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:58,013
Pythagoras, who is known for his theorem,
was the first to create a scale.

741
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,598
And the father of music, Bach,

742
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,058
composed songs
based on mathematical calculations.

743
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,894
Do you know what that means?

744
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,273
It means that math is music.

745
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,858
And music is math.

746
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,194
But the thing is, you are a music fanatic.

747
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,447
You've unknowingly mastered
the nature of numbers already,

748
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,991
and you're destined to be good at math.

749
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,868
Like me.

750
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,787
So?

751
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,247
Are you prepared to accept your destiny?

752
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,249
-Yes.
-Good.

753
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,960
-Get in there already.
-Why should I…

754
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,756
Go give Mr. Hwang some apples.

755
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,352
What is this?

756
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,436
An apple?

757
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,107
I was mistaken earlier.

758
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,862
Why didn't you tell me you were her tutor?

759
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,156
Is this really an apple?

760
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,245
I'm sorry.

761
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,832
I've washed your shirt, so don't worry.

762
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,501
It really is an apple.

763
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,256
Yes?

764
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,633
I'm sorry to interrupt.

765
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,594
Mr. Hwang, can you stay for dinner
after today's lesson?

766
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,639
Dinner?

767
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,934
I'd be happy to.

768
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,895
Here we go.

769
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,317
Do you drink?

770
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,863
I was waiting to open this
when my son gets discharged from the army.

771
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,364
Wait.

772
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,782
Gosh,

773
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,202
then you shouldn't open
such a precious thing.

774
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,163
-I'll go out and get some makgeolli.
-No need.

775
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,790
Oh, come on.

776
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,335
It's all right. You're like my son.

777
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,801
In that case,
I'll have just one glass, sir.

778
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,514
Do you even know what that's made of?

779
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,767
This is really…

780
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,147
Medicine. It's medicine.

781
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,857
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes, sir.

782
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,109
Thank you.

783
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,863
Let's clink glasses.

784
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,240
Cheers.

785
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,505
Do you know what I did for my wife?

786
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:42,510
I left my home
and started living with my in-laws.

787
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,431
Can you stop talking about that?

788
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,017
This is the third time already.

789
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,188
This story doesn't get old
even if I tell it ten times.

790
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,774
You can't listen to it
without shedding tears.

791
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,401
Get your handkerchief ready.

792
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:05,575
You know, I used to be quite popular
in my old neighborhood.

793
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,370
But you know what? After…

794
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,956
-Hui-tae, you should go now.
-I came here…

795
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,708
If he gets more drunk,
you'll never get out of here.

796
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,878
-It's okay.
-Stop being stubborn.

797
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,088
I'll be fine.

798
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,714
Myeong-hee.

799
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,299
Can't you see I'm having a talk
with my son?

800
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,844
What are you whispering to my new son?

801
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,805
He should get going now.

802
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,724
It's almost time for the curfew.

803
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,393
Curfew?

804
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,484
You can spend the night here.

805
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,153
-What?
-We'll spread out a blanket

806
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:46,074
-in the living room and sprawl out!
-But…

807
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,993
-I'd love that.
-Really?

808
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:51,037
My shirt isn't dry yet anyway.

809
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,373
-It isn't dry yet!
-Right!

810
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,834
It isn't dry yet!

811
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,753
-Son!
-Dad!

812
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,506
-Let's have another drink.
-Give me another glass.

813
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,801
Sure thing. Here you go.

814
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,904
Are you drunk?

815
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,531
Why are you
playing the guitar at this hour?

816
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,950
I'm not drunk.

817
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,578
I'm just parched

818
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,997
from all that soy sauce earlier.
That's all.

819
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,378
Well, then… Should I get you
some honey tea or something?

820
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,296
Don't bother.

821
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,258
Suit yourself then.

822
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,968
I don't need any honey tea, but…

823
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,938
Can you sit with me for a moment?

824
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,304
I'm sorry.

825
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,141
For what?

826
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,648
I feel like I'm being selfish

827
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,027
and causing you trouble again and again.

828
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,451
You didn't cause too much trouble.

829
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,710
After what you told me,

830
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,715
I thought hard about the remaining month.

831
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,428
And I realized,

832
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,597
it's not the month we have
that I'm afraid of,

833
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,059
but how much I'll be hurt
after that month is gone.

834
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,272
I like you, Myeong-hee,

835
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,442
and I'll only continue
to like you more and more.

836
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,031
Goodness, you and your cheesy words.

837
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,510
I look forward to May every year.

838
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,098
On a May night, even if you sing badly,

839
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,934
the grasshoppers help you out.

840
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,144
The grasshoppers?

841
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,146
Yes.

842
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,194
Let's see here.

843
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,931
Whenever I think of you, Myeong-hee,

844
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,809
I can't help but sing.

845
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,731
Goodness.

846
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,526
There you go again
with those cheesy words.

847
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,537
Myeong-hee.

848
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,502
Do you want to go out with me
just until the end of May?

849
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,425
-What's your relationship with Ms. Jang?
-I'd say, we're offender and victim.

850
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,177
Come out while I'm being nice.

851
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,094
Get out of here!

852
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,305
-Are you free tomorrow?
-I have somewhere to be.

853
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,223
-I'll come with you.
-You don't even know where.

854
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,142
-It doesn't matter.
-Keep a good eye on your daughter.

855
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,686
She's not a kid anymore.
I won't go easy now.

856
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,188
Have you been spying on me?

857
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,107
Well, let's just say I'm interested
in my future daughter-in-law.

858
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,444
-I have no interest in getting married.
-That family will help our business.

859
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,571
My father's factory
will be built in a month.

860
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,198
Let's keep this up until then.

861
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,242
We shouldn't cross the line
just to save ourselves for now.
