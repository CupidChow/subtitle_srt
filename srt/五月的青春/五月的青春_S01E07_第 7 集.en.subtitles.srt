1
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,286
Get in the car!

2
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,626
Hwang Jeong-tae,

3
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,170
do you not want to eat?

4
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,547
Pardon?

5
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,633
It's not that.

6
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,928
Why? He's eating.

7
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,930
It's because he just woke up.

8
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,559
It's all because he's never had to starve
and gets a nice meal three times a day.

9
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,145
If we only give him water for a few days,

10
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,940
he'll never pick at his food again.

11
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,614
Mr. Hwang, what brings you by so early?

12
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,368
I found a book Jin-a should read.

13
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,954
-Here.
-My gosh, this is precious.

14
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,039
THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS

15
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,792
Can she read this though?

16
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,210
Yes, of course.

17
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,339
She's improving by the day.

18
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,008
-My gosh, thank you.
-No problem.

19
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,219
My goodness.

20
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,557
Jin-a has her midterm exam today,
so she'll come home early.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,892
Why don't you eat with me
and wait for her?

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,769
Well…

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,397
Then Myeong-hee should join us too.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,898
-Myeong-hee?
-Yes.

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,191
She's not home at the moment.

26
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,194
I guess her overnight shift
isn't over yet.

27
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,738
-Overnight shift?
-Yes.

28
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,199
She didn't work last night.

29
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,203
She didn't come home last night,
so I assumed she was working.

30
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,497
She didn't come home?

31
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,540
No.

32
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,543
Maybe she came home after the curfew began

33
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,837
and left early this morning
before I woke up.

34
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,090
After the curfew began?

35
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,264
EMERGENCY ROOM

36
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,025
How can we help you? Are you a guardian?

37
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,484
No, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,114
Hey, In-young.
Can't you tidy up right away…

39
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,491
-Clean this up, will you?
-Yes, ma'am.

40
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,494
By the way, I thought you were off today.

41
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,290
Don't get me started.
This is all Myeong-hee's fault.

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,760
ETHANOL

43
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,472
I got this. My goodness.

44
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,598
In-young, right?

45
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,642
Do I know you?

46
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,559
Well…

47
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,480
Is Ms. Kim Myeong-hee here today?

48
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,858
She didn't come in today
and didn't even call.

49
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,986
She's never even taken a half-day off,

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,405
but she didn't even call.
I wonder what's going on.

51
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,784
What?

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,204
What do you mean Myeong-hee is gone?

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,040
She's not at home.
She missed work without calling in.

54
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,458
Did you hear from her at all?

55
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,710
No, I didn't.

56
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,965
Maybe something urgent came up last night.

57
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,718
Then she would've called the hospital.

58
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,554
Do you know where she could be?

59
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,515
Why are you asking me?

60
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,850
Now, you know more about her than I do.

61
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,187
You've known her longer than I have.

62
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,022
You said she's your best friend.

63
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,906
Hello?

64
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,574
Hello?

65
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,292
Su-chan.

66
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,044
Don't answer Hwang Hui-tae's calls

67
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,255
until things get sorted out.

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,383
But if I hang up on him like that…

69
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,510
Don't answer his calls.

70
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,232
Do you want to keep this job or not?

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,943
-Get your job done properly.
-I'm sorry, sir.

72
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,904
Goodness, what should I do with you?

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,949
Just do what your predecessors did.
You can't even do that?

74
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,910
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Excuse me.

75
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,538
I'd like to report a missing person.

76
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,124
Is your child missing?

77
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,376
How old?

78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,337
No, it's an adult. She's 26 years old.

79
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,217
What's your relationship with her?

80
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,179
I'm her boyfriend.

81
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,723
How long has she been missing?

82
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,683
Well…

83
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,519
It's been about 15 hours, I think.

84
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,480
15 hours?

85
00:05:56,355 --> 00:06:00,151
So you saw her last night
but haven't heard from her since.

86
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,112
That's right. We parted ways
in front of her place last night,

87
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,822
but I can't reach her.

88
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,617
-Go on. Go.
-No, wait.

89
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,369
Why won't you listen to me?

90
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,998
Has it ever occurred to you
that she might be avoiding you?

91
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,209
She's not at home,
and she didn't go to work today.

92
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,002
What if she got into an accident
on the way to work--

93
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:23,091
Goodness. People don't go missing
that easily, okay?

94
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,509
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

95
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,471
And we can't say she's missing
if it's only been 15 hours.

96
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,932
It looks like she went somewhere.

97
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,602
Wait. She'd never go anywhere
without telling me.

98
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,355
Come on. How do you know?

99
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,941
How can you be so sure?

100
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,901
Well, for example…

101
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,404
Maybe she saw her late grandparents
in her dream and went to visit them.

102
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,492
Or maybe she went to see her parents
because one of them collapsed. Who knows?

103
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,035
Hello.

104
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,954
You need a haircut, punk.

105
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,750
First, check all the places
where she could be.

106
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,587
Wait another day…
No, come back in three days.

107
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,132
Then I'll open a case for you.

108
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,885
I'm already so busy.

109
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,557
Where she could be…

110
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,560
I need to go to Naju.

111
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,355
It's been a while since I went home.
All I did was call.

112
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,736
Go away! That hurts.

113
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,490
Hey, Digestive Drink!

114
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,742
Your big brother is here.

115
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,828
Big brother?

116
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,122
I don't have a brother.

117
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,968
I think they unplugged the phone.

118
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,052
Why?

119
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,139
They do it from time to time
because of my grandma.

120
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,975
But

121
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,478
is Myeong-hee in Naju now?

122
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,273
I wanted to call them and ask,

123
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,025
but you're saying
they unplugged the phone.

124
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,111
Do you know when they'll plug it back in?

125
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,740
That will depend
on my grandma's condition.

126
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,743
It could be for half a day? The whole day?

127
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,453
It's different each time.

128
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,711
Myeong-su, can you give me the address?

129
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,130
190 MAESEONG-RI, SANPO-MYEON, NAJU,
SOUTH JEOLLA PROVINCE

130
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,512
Hold on.

131
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,016
Visiting her parents
when it's only been a few hours?

132
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,687
That's creepy.

133
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,775
Okay, I'll just check from afar
and see if she's there.

134
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,863
That's creepier.

135
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,577
I should pick up some gifts on the way
and properly introduce myself to them.

136
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,998
That will creep them out even more.
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

137
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,458
Young man.

138
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,418
Listen, can you…

139
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,255
Can you call a doctor?

140
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,256
What?

141
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,760
My son is about to die right now.

142
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,888
I took him to a local hospital

143
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,808
and they said I need to prepare
to say goodbye.

144
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,851
What's wrong with your son?

145
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,812
My goodness.

146
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,772
Are you a doctor?

147
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,025
Well, no…

148
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,653
I am…

149
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,992
Then why don't I
call an ambulance for you?

150
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,708
Why are you up already?
You should get some more rest.

151
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,546
I'm sick of lying down. It's just a cold.

152
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,632
Gosh, you must be fine now,
hearing you say that.

153
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,010
-Drink this.
-Okay.

154
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,934
Where's Mom?

155
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,855
She got up in the middle of the night
and stayed by your bedside.

156
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,233
She's not in the room.

157
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,819
She was here just a minute ago.

158
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,154
My goodness.

159
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,947
Gosh, I was busy
brewing your herbal tonic.

160
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,366
Wait. I'll go take a look
around the neighborhood.

161
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,910
Call the village foreman
and ask him to make an announcement.

162
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,579
Okay. Where's the phone?

163
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,791
I can't believe this.

164
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,126
Is anyone home?

165
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,421
-Hyeon-cheol.
-Gosh, Mom!

166
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,214
-Mother!
-Goodness.

167
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,676
Where have you been?
You scared me to death.

168
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,303
Where is her son?

169
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,513
Yes.

170
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm her son.

171
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,774
She said you were my age.
Can you tell me what's troubling you?

172
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,818
Sorry?

173
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,782
Did she say her son was about to die
and drag you here?

174
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,035
The thing is, my mother
loses her memory from time to time.

175
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,745
I'm sorry about this.

176
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,622
Don't worry about it.

177
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,499
I'm glad you're okay.

178
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,001
Then…

179
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,170
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

180
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,797
Mom, let's go inside.

181
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,049
By the way,

182
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,885
can you tell me which direction this is?

183
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,720
-It's my first time here.
-Sure.

184
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,765
190 MAESEONG-RI, SANPO-MYEON, NAJU,
SOUTH JEOLLA PROVINCE

185
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,908
Sorry, we don't have many side dishes.
I should've fried some eggs.

186
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,253
I'm sorry you came all the way here
but couldn't meet Myeong-hee.

187
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,340
Seeing you're here on a weekday
instead of at work,

188
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,509
I guess you're a college student.

189
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,555
Well, yes… So…

190
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,433
I'm about to graduate from college soon.

191
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,603
You're the same age as Myeong-hee
but haven't graduated yet?

192
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,106
You must've taken a few years off.

193
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,694
Actually, I didn't take time off.

194
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,781
It takes six years
to graduate from my department.

195
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,324
Six years?

196
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,831
Then does that mean
you're a medical student?

197
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,833
Where? Chonnam National University?

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,960
Chosun University?

199
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,962
No. It's…

200
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,674
Don't tell me
it's Seoul National University?

201
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,261
Yes.

202
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,556
Cut it out.

203
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,020
Mom, what are you smiling about?

204
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,276
So are your parents aware

205
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,862
that you're seeing Myeong-hee?

206
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,824
Why are you asking that? How silly of you.

207
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,410
Kids these days aren't like us anymore.

208
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,120
Don't mind him and eat.

209
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,206
Sorry, he keeps interrupting your meal.

210
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
Go on.

211
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,042
-Go on and eat.
-Okay.

212
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,003
Stop talking to him when he's eating.

213
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Thank you so much for today.

214
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,053
I came so abruptly,
but you even cooked for me.

215
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,515
Gosh, I'm sorry I couldn't make you
a proper meal.

216
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,685
If you tell me in advance next time,
I'll show you how good a cook I am.

217
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,229
So come with Myeong-hee next time, okay?

218
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,150
Okay. I look forward to seeing you again.

219
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,737
Ma'am, I'll see you next time.

220
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,252
We should repair this darn door.

221
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,586
Take care!

222
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,013
She's not here either.
Where on earth is she?

223
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,646
No, it'll be okay.
Her mom told me not to worry.

224
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,900
She'll be fine. I'm sure she's fine.

225
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,865
Myeong-hee!

226
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,998
Where did you go without even telling me?

227
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,499
Do you know how…

228
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,254
Do you know what I was thinking?

229
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,715
What brings you here?

230
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,634
Do you think I came all the way here
to have fun?

231
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,722
You weren't at home or at work.
So I thought you might've come here.

232
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,563
I know it may creep you out. I know,
but put yourself in my shoes.

233
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,482
-How could I remain calm--
-How did you find out my address?

234
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,320
I asked Myeong-su.

235
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,407
I know this may creep you out too.

236
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,825
I know, but…

237
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,833
Myeong-hee, what's wrong?

238
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,880
Is something wrong?

239
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,928
What's wrong, Myeong-hee?

240
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,848
You seem like a different person.

241
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,228
Myeong-hee.

242
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,668
Stay still, you brat.

243
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,975
Who are you, people?

244
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,394
Why are you doing this to me?

245
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,896
Well, who do you think we are?

246
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,690
Why don't you make a guess?

247
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,194
Is this because of money?
If it is, I'll give you everything I have.

248
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,489
Man, are you treating us
like some petty thieves?

249
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,409
We don't need your money.
Your body will do fine.

250
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,122
I wonder how much we'll get for you.
It's a waste to sell you off to an island.

251
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,207
Hey. Who would buy her?

252
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,846
I did nothing wrong.

253
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,265
Gosh, what a surprise.

254
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,226
You caught on faster than I thought.

255
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,561
Let me go.

256
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,273
I did nothing wrong
to be dragged here like this.

257
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,525
Hey, you brat. Hey.

258
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,819
That's for us to decide.

259
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,738
How can a government organization

260
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,700
abduct a civilian like this
without even telling me what I did wrong?

261
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,914
Why do all of you blabber on
so annoyingly?

262
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,210
Shall I make you shut your mouth?

263
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,297
Go on and try it.

264
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,340
I'll tell the press

265
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,718
and the Catholic Church
about what you did to me…

266
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,838
The parents of the couple
will thank the guests.

267
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,132
Please give them a big hand.

268
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,482
END THE MARTIAL LAW!

269
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,567
END THE MARTIAL LAW!

270
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,375
I heard you're preparing
to go study in Germany.

271
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,295
Why Germany, of all countries?

272
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,510
You see, Germany's visa screening process
is a lot stricter

273
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,303
compared to other countries.

274
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,308
There are communists who try to defect
to North Korea through East Germany.

275
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,313
That's why

276
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,525
we must look closely to find out

277
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,778
whether the applicants
have participated in any protests

278
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,907
and what kind of ideology they believe in.

279
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,953
Are you doing this

280
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,999
because of Hui-tae?

281
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,632
Defeat the Yushin remnants!

282
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,259
-Defeat the Yushin remnants!
-Defeat the Yushin remnants!

283
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,011
End the martial law!

284
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,846
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

285
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,267
-We say no to martial law!
-We say no to martial law!

286
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,102
End the martial law!

287
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,146
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

288
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,814
Defeat…

289
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,900
Step down!

290
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,611
Why are they protesting in broad daylight?

291
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,031
We say no to martial law!

292
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,200
End the martial law!

293
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,368
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

294
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,287
Defeat the Yushin remnants!

295
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,872
Defeat the Yushin remnants!

296
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,208
-Myeong-hee.
-End the martial law!

297
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,293
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

298
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,589
-We say no to martial law!
-We say no to martial law!

299
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,595
Su-chan. I don't mean to be rude,

300
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,389
but I need to ask you something.

301
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,521
I understand. Thanks.

302
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,742
I won't get a passport, will I?

303
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,873
Apparently, the process
has been put on hold.

304
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,084
It's almost done,

305
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,169
but they need
another institution's approval.

306
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,297
It's the Defense Security Command.

307
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,259
What?

308
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,972
It's Hui-tae's father.

309
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,907
Well… You see,

310
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,159
I'm sure they're just trying to scare you.

311
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,662
Not even the Defense Security

312
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,247
can randomly stop an individual
from studying abroad.

313
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,125
It's not like you violated
the National Security Act.

314
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,586
Myeong-hee, don't worry and just wait.

315
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,965
I'll find a way somehow.

316
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,679
You'll be only wasting your time.

317
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,434
I'll be going now.

318
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,707
You should go back.

319
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,586
You're making me feel pressured
and uncomfortable.

320
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,092
-Myeong-hee, I just…
-Please just…

321
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,263
Please just go back.

322
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,524
Fine.

323
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:45,113
I'll be waiting for you in Gwangju.
Let's talk later.

324
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,914
See you at the terminal!

325
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,416
I'll be waiting, Myeong-hee!

326
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,846
I wondered

327
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,141
why Myeong-hee was always stuck
in the hospital like a nun.

328
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,935
Who would've known
she was dating a doctor?

329
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,187
What a pleasant young man.

330
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,523
He even looks like a movie star.

331
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,068
-You're getting ahead of yourself.
-Goodness.

332
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,446
You're one to talk.

333
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,534
Weren't you asking about his parents
when we just met him?

334
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,161
I wasn't getting ahead of myself. I just…

335
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,789
Whatever.

336
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,211
Goodness, Myeong-hee!

337
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,465
Welcome home, sweetie. It's been so long.

338
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,054
Did you see him on your way here?

339
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,265
He was waiting here for you
until a moment ago.

340
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,935
They must've missed each other.

341
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,729
Anyway, have you eaten?

342
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,365
Why are you so out of it?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

343
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,701
Myeong-hee, is everything okay?

344
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,288
What happened?

345
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,624
It doesn't matter why.

346
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,002
You can't leave the country anyway.

347
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,674
KIM HYEON-CHEOL

348
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,760
DAUGHTER: KIM MYEONG-HEE

349
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,680
CONVICTED OF VIOLATING
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT IN 1954

350
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,199
There's no way a commie's daughter
will be allowed to go to Germany.

351
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,618
No way.

352
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,453
My father can't be--

353
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,622
Have you ever wondered

354
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,665
why your father
can't even open his own shop

355
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,210
and has to go from market
to market for decades?

356
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,213
When all the other protesters
were released,

357
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,090
you were forced to make a confession.

358
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,717
Didn't you find that strange?

359
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:18,099
CONVICTED OF VIOLATING
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT IN 1954

360
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,769
Is that because…

361
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,732
Yes.

362
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,401
Your father

363
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,403
is a commie.

364
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,989
That means…

365
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,076
Is it true that I'm a commie's daughter?

366
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,418
I'm not sure…

367
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,547
what you've heard and from whom…

368
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,132
Dad, you tell me.

369
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,302
Is that true or not?

370
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,773
Why did you never tell me?

371
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,985
I had no idea.

372
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,822
I've blamed myself for everything
all my life.

373
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,368
I've regretted everything I've ever done.

374
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,997
You could've…

375
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,333
You could've told me
it wasn't my fault at least once.

376
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,962
-Myeong-hee.
-If only you'd told me…

377
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:35,302
If you'd only told me
why I must live in silence once…

378
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,514
Then I wouldn't have
gotten my hopes up for nothing.

379
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,767
Why did you have to make a fool out of me?

380
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:47,230
Why do I have to get shoved
into the ground without knowing why?

381
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,274
Answer me!

382
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,943
Answer me, Dad!

383
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,456
You little…

384
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,335
You despicable little wench!

385
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,756
Were you sent by Hwang Gi-nam too?

386
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,967
-Go away!
-Mom, please calm down.

387
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,511
-Let go!
-Hurry up and unplug the phone.

388
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,597
Take Mother away.

389
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,016
-Mom, calm down.
-How dare you show up here?

390
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,769
-That's enough.
-Take me instead!

391
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,729
-Mom!
-Get lost!

392
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,230
Mom!

393
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,276
My goodness. My son is innocent.
Why are you taking him?

394
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,236
Sir, just a second, please.

395
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,200
Mother, they're just going to ask me
a few questions.

396
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,746
Like you said, I'm innocent.
You don't have to worry.

397
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,832
Honey, see you later.

398
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,459
See you.

399
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,462
-Be careful.
-Hyeon-cheol.

400
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,215
-My goodness.
-Wait.

401
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,490
Gi-nam.

402
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,326
You're Hwang Gi-nam, right?

403
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,078
It's been a while, Hyeon-cheol.

404
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,582
Goodness. Gi-nam.

405
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,002
My leg hurts so much.

406
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,255
I didn't do anything wrong.

407
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,049
You know that.

408
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,510
My father passed away.

409
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:45,014
My brother has been
out of reach for years…

410
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,727
Your father defected to North Korea
during the war.

411
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,981
Your communist partisan brother
talks to you regularly.

412
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,900
That's what I heard.

413
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,364
-What?
-That's what you said.

414
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,284
You told me that yourself.

415
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,747
Hwang Gi-nam, you jerk!

416
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,795
STATEMENT
KIM HYEON-CHEOL

417
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,672
Just admit it already.

418
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,424
If you end up with more injuries,

419
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,219
your mother will be so worried
that she'll fall ill again.

420
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,263
Your poor mother.

421
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,693
STATEMENT
KIM HYEON-CHEOL

422
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,039
Gosh, Mom.

423
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,457
That's all.

424
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,210
But that's how things were back then.

425
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,879
So that was all

426
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,758
Hwang Gi-nam's doing?

427
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,017
I was going to tell you
when you were leaving for Germany.

428
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,769
Who told you about it?

429
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,858
Don't tell me

430
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,862
you can't study abroad
because of your father.

431
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,828
I should get going.

432
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,638
Myeong-hee!

433
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,574
I thought it would end
if I just stayed quiet.

434
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,829
I didn't want you…

435
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,125
to have to worry about such stigma.

436
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,254
I wanted to break it off
so you wouldn't be affected.

437
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,141
But it didn't stop with you.

438
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,744
Myeong-hee…

439
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,808
She still hasn't come home yet?

440
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,144
She must be working overtime.

441
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,564
I called the hospital,
and they said she wasn't there.

442
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,399
And I can't reach her family in Naju.

443
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,070
She must be on a trip or something.
Myeong-hee isn't a kid.

444
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:30,281
Why is everyone making a fuss
looking for her? Goodness.

445
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,367
You should go home, okay?

446
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,871
If you give me a chance,

447
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,042
I'll take responsibility
and sort everything out.

448
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,590
Then how long will the process take?

449
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,676
Several months?

450
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,807
I see. Then please call me
as soon as you find out

451
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,559
about the part I asked about earlier.

452
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,480
Su-chan. What's going on here?

453
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,733
Su-ryeon. I'm a little busy right now.
Let's talk at home.

454
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
What's this?

455
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,449
Passport. Visa.

456
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,494
Is this about Myeong-hee?

457
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,830
What is it?

458
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,790
Su-chan.

459
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,421
The Defense Security blocked
her passport and visa applications.

460
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,673
What?

461
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,467
It's all my fault.

462
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,304
You don't have to worry about it,
so just go home.

463
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,190
Hey.

464
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,360
I have something to tell you.

465
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,991
It's about Myeong-hee and Hwang Hui-tae.

466
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,996
I don't know how you found out
they're seeing each other, but--

467
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,539
I lied

468
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,333
from the beginning.

469
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,800
Are you saying

470
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,555
it was all a lie, even the blind date?

471
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,980
Then when Mr. Hwang asked,

472
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,150
why did you tell him
you didn't know anything?

473
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,698
I was scared.

474
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,080
I didn't know
things would get this out of hand.

475
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,041
Lee Su-ryeon.

476
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,002
Do you realize

477
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,922
what you have done?

478
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,007
Su-chan, I was just scared

479
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,804
that something bad would happen
to our family because of me--

480
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,264
Look what happened
because of your immature behavior!

481
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,109
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

482
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,486
Expedite the political process!

483
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,614
-Expedite the political process!
-Expedite the political process!

484
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,908
Guarantee workers' rights!

485
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,660
-Go home, you punks.
-Guarantee workers' rights!

486
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,662
-I'm sorry.
-Go home.

487
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,956
Yushin remnants, step down!

488
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,459
-Yushin remnants, step down!
-Yushin remnants, step down!

489
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,795
End the martial law!

490
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,090
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

491
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,212
Myeong-hee.

492
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,340
Myeong-hee!

493
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,304
-Yushin remnants, step down!
-Yushin remnants, step down!

494
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:26,225
End the martial law!

495
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:31,063
-End the martial law!
-Myeong-hee!

496
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,276
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

497
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,697
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

498
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,368
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

499
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,539
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

500
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,499
Yushin remnants, step down!

501
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,460
-Yushin remnants, step down!
-Yushin remnants, step down!

502
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,838
Myeong-hee, can we talk for a second?

503
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,758
Yushin remnants, step down!

504
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,926
Myeong-hee!

505
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,387
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

506
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:07,475
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

507
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,446
What are you doing?

508
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,824
You saw me. Why did you run away?

509
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,416
You were following me, that's why.

510
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,337
Tell me what happened.

511
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,132
If I've suddenly become someone
you have to avoid overnight,

512
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,759
there must be a reason.

513
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,887
Must I tell you the reason?

514
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,015
Yes, I need to hear it.

515
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,226
I kept racking my brain,

516
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,145
but I can't figure out
why you're suddenly treating me like this.

517
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,315
I don't want to be by your side.

518
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,151
I hate it.

519
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,988
I don't want to be called a minx
who stole someone's fiance,

520
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,948
and I don't want to hurt those around me.

521
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,701
I can't do this anymore.

522
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,709
Did something happen
between you and Su-ryeon?

523
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,004
Or is it because of Su-chan?

524
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,922
I just…

525
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,425
I just don't want to do this anymore.

526
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,139
There, you heard it. Are we good now?

527
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,600
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

528
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,020
You said you wouldn't regret it.

529
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,648
You said we should tell
each other everything.

530
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,943
You said that yourself yesterday.

531
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,487
Then you suddenly disappeared
and had me worried sick.

532
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,449
What is going on?
What are you trying to hide?

533
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,577
Go ask your father.

534
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,371
My father?

535
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,290
I can no longer study abroad

536
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,167
because I dated you.

537
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,794
Why am I running away?

538
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,338
It's because I'm scared.

539
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,841
I don't know what could happen
if I stayed with you.

540
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,053
My life could get a lot worse
than it already is.

541
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,639
I ran away from you because I was scared.

542
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,395
Hui-tae,

543
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,023
I'm scared of you now.

544
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,761
Dad, you're home.

545
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,938
You didn't have to do that, you know.

546
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,816
I heard you met that girl.

547
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,529
It was just a fling.

548
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,656
You didn't have to waste your time
like that.

549
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:54,452
You told me that men should date a lot
before settling down.

550
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,165
What's your point?

551
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,960
I just wanted to have some fun
before she left the country.

552
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,379
But now that she knows
you disapprove of her,

553
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,131
she thinks this is like the love story
of the century

554
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,300
as if she's in some kind of
tragic love story.

555
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,217
My goodness.

556
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,554
I'm worried she'd cling to me forever.

557
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,140
Just let her leave the country, Dad.

558
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:30,279
I never thought I'd see you
pull such a dumb trick on me, Hui-tae.

559
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,949
Seeing how desperate you are
makes me think that

560
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,037
I should uproot
the foreseeable problem for good.

561
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,664
Wait.

562
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,001
Please let her leave.

563
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,173
Wouldn't you be relieved
if she left the country?

564
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,968
There are many things
I could do to be relieved.

565
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:57,389
I insisted that we keep seeing each other.
She kept saying no, but I made her.

566
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,226
She's just…

567
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,853
Her only fault is that
she got involved with me.

568
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,147
You really don't need to do this!

569
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,238
I'll get married.

570
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,617
I'll get married right away
if that's what you want.

571
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,127
Of course, you'll get married as planned.

572
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,840
Did you think you could use it
to strike a deal with me?

573
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,227
Hui-tae.

574
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,484
This is why
you shouldn't kneel down often.

575
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,736
Okay?

576
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,239
It'll look too cheap

577
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,200
when you actually need to do it.

578
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,083
I told you.

579
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,838
The only thing you can block

580
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,634
is this hand, nothing more.

581
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,762
And you're in the palm of my hand.

582
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,018
It's too early to get scared.

583
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,021
I haven't even begun yet.

584
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,946
What is it that you want?

585
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,825
I'll do anything you want.

586
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,163
I'll behave myself
and live my life the way you want.

587
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,666
I'll do anything you say, so please…

588
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,712
Please let her…

589
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,923
Please just let her live her life.

590
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,934
Get ready to go to Seoul at once.

591
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:10,856
And don't come back until I tell you to.

592
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,109
And as for that girl,

593
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,822
I'll decide what to do depending on
how you behave yourself.

594
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,011
What do you mean?
You want to send them to Seoul?

595
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,264
They should get a place to live
near the hospital in Seoul anyway.

596
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,893
Let's have them move there
and get a place first.

597
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,937
The wedding can happen
as we decide on the date.

598
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,482
You talked big
that you'd get everything sorted out.

599
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,818
But were you actually planning
to just push forward with it?

600
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,987
Well,

601
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,616
Hui-tae's woman
issue has been taken care of.

602
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,159
You don't need to worry anymore.

603
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,329
How can I believe you
that it's been taken care of?

604
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:13,919
Their marriage isn't a business merger.
You can't force it.

605
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,340
Let's take some time
and see how the situation unfolds.

606
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,508
Are you hoping

607
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,887
the wedding will be called off?

608
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,102
We should put the broken pieces
back together for both families' sake.

609
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,479
Those broken pieces

610
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,274
could become weapons.

611
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,946
Is this

612
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,490
a threat?

613
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,870
No, I'm offering you a word of advice
to help you make a wise decision.

614
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,549
Seoul?

615
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,093
So?

616
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,761
I said, no way.

617
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,139
Gosh, I must've been out of my mind.

618
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,892
I practically walked into the tiger's den
to keep warm.

619
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,228
I'm grateful to the girl
he cheated on you with.

620
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,315
At least we had that to protect us
from being eaten up.

621
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,576
Don't give him iced water.

622
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,829
Hey, it's just one glass.
Don't make such a fuss.

623
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,997
Dad.

624
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,832
There's something I must tell you.

625
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,503
What is it? Is it about work?

626
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,762
It's something you should know.

627
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,354
Are you saying you planned the whole thing
from the get-go?

628
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,649
You…

629
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,108
Lee Su-ryeon! You little…

630
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,735
Dad, no!

631
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,697
Dad, please.

632
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:12,829
Forget it.

633
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:17,000
Talking about who's at fault
will only upset me more.

634
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,545
It may be a blessing in disguise.

635
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,881
The situation has worked out in our favor.

636
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,966
Dad.

637
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,052
We should tell them the truth.

638
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,054
What do you mean?

639
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,640
Are you saying
we should tell Hwang Gi-nam about this?

640
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,142
I told you.

641
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,688
If we don't do anything,
Myeong-hee will be made the scapegoat.

642
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,525
Listen, Su-chan. Myeong-hee…

643
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,193
I know it's unfortunate.

644
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,489
But we must save our family first
and compensate her somehow later.

645
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,992
That's what Su-ryeon was thinking
when she started this.

646
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,120
This all happened to save our family,
so we must make things right.

647
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,663
No, we can never do that.

648
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,498
If we suddenly reveal that,

649
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,917
it's practically throwing our family
at Hwang Gi-nam as prey.

650
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,127
So do you mean

651
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,880
you want to throw Myeong-hee instead
and put an end to this?

652
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,424
What's wrong with that?

653
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:09,052
-To be frank, she's not even our family.
-Dad!

654
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,813
I'm sorry.

655
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,609
I'm afraid I can't obey you this time.

656
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,569
What?

657
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,946
Hey, Lee Su-chan! You…

658
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,327
Dad!

659
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,579
-Dad.
-Dad!

660
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,497
Open your eyes.

661
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,333
-Dad!
-Dad!

662
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,796
He was lucky this time.

663
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,590
Like I've always told you,

664
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,676
stress is the most deadly disease
for patients with angina.

665
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,638
He may suffer a cardiac infarction,

666
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,016
so you must make sure
he gets absolute rest.

667
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,145
How long has father been like that?

668
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,524
Why didn't you tell me?

669
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,155
If I did, would it have made a difference?

670
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,079
Don't tell

671
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,998
Hwang Gi-nam.

672
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,879
-Lee Su-ryeon. How could you still…
-I will…

673
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,883
I will go to Seoul.

674
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,638
Since I started all of this,

675
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,307
I'll take responsibility.

676
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,228
Both Myeong-hee and Dad

677
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,980
did nothing wrong.

678
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,953
Yes, you made the right choice.

679
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,164
My son has a house in Seoul,

680
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,875
so they can stay there
until they find a new home.

681
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,044
Yes.

682
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,047
Then I'll make the preparations
for them to leave immediately.

683
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,384
Yes, okay.

684
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,271
"It's nothing?"

685
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:12,068
So I canceled my plans on my day off
and covered for you over nothing?

686
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,114
Hey, are you acting up
since you'll be quitting soon?

687
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,200
No.

688
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,702
Why do you even come to work?

689
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,622
It seems like your heart
is already in Germany.

690
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,042
If you're going to skip work,
just stop coming at all.

691
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,294
I'm sorry.

692
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:43,266
Are you sure nothing happened yesterday?

693
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,313
I'm sorry. You must've had a tough time.

694
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,481
It's okay.

695
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,610
By the way,
did you talk to Mr. Hwang Hui-tae?

696
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,241
He came to the hospital yesterday
looking for you.

697
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,911
I think I said something
that must've worried him.

698
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,288
He seemed awfully concerned.

699
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,796
HUI-TAE'S SONGWRITING NOTEBOOK

00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,464
It's a Teacher's Day present.

701
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,008
Write a song that will win
the University Song Festival.

702
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,430
I have a present for you too.

703
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,432
You do?

704
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:31,273
Here you go.
This is for the upcoming finals.

705
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,568
And these are for next year.

706
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,778
And…

707
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,740
This is a math concept notebook
that I organized myself.

708
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,909
It'll be more useful
than your reference books.

709
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,206
Why are you giving me a book
for next year already?

710
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,084
You can just give it to me next year.

711
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,045
I can't give it to you next year.

712
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,091
Today is our last lesson.

713
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,738
You can just listen from there.

714
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,783
I just came to say goodbye.

715
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,415
I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.

716
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,877
I probably

717
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,505
won't ever be coming back.

718
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,803
Okay.

719
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,018
I wanted to thank you before I left.

720
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,526
The few weeks we spent together

721
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,280
were the happiest moments

722
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,910
in my entire life.

723
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,332
Thank you.

724
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,101
Can I come closer for a moment?

725
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,394
I'm sorry.

726
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,647
I tried my best to be careful,

727
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,984
but I broke it.

728
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,157
That's how I am.

729
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,660
Anything that comes close to me

730
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,371
keeps getting broken.

731
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,293
I hope you continue…

732
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:45,341
to bravely go down the path

733
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,261
that you wanted to take.

734
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,432
You are

735
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,479
a strong person that no one can break.

736
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,197
You too.

737
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,493
I hope you stay strong

738
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,913
and live bravely.

739
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,683
Look back.

740
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,104
Look back.

741
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,524
Look back.

742
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,653
Look back.

743
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,158
Look back.

744
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,163
Look back…

745
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,454
You'll ruin everything.

746
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,834
Just like your father ruined your life,

747
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,919
you'll end up ruining

748
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,964
Hui-tae's life if you stay next to him.

749
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,508
He's your son.

750
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,554
If you're curious,

751
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,057
stay right next to him and watch

752
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,643
how far

753
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,730
I can go.

754
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,901
Please…

755
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,654
leave Hui-tae alone.

756
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,076
I'll break up with him.
