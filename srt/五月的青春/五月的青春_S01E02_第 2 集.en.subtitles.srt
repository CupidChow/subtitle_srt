1
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,248
Darn it! When did this become like this?

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,630
Hello, I have a blind date at 4 p.m.

3
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,058
That cheeky nurse!

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,398
I'm sorry I'm late.

5
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,734
My name is Lee Su-ryeon.

6
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,127
Write everything down, okay?

7
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,047
This method has a 99.9 percent
success rate of being rejected.

8
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,218
This data is based on
all the blind dates I've had.

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,638
Just follow my instructions,

10
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,849
and getting rejected
is just a matter of time.

11
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,898
I'll have coffee. Just black, please.

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,527
I'll have…

13
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,653
First.

14
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,782
Leave a strong first impression
when choosing the menu.

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,951
I'll have a beer.

16
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,539
So it'll be one black coffee
and one beer? Okay.

17
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,296
I guess you like to drink.

18
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,674
Yes. I can't live without it.

19
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,510
Whenever I feel sober,
my hands tremble like crazy.

20
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,596
I see.

21
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,778
May I have a sip?

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,116
-What?
-You make it look so delicious.

23
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,254
Now, this is some nice beer.

24
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,513
But keep in mind that it's useless to guys
who are heavy drinkers.

25
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,516
So you need to switch
to the modern woman mode.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,688
It's an obvious fact that most men
believe in a patriarchal society.

27
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,191
Did you come here
to find your future wife?

28
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,737
That's usually the case
when it comes to blind dates.

29
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,823
Did you have something else in mind?

30
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,328
No. I came to find my husband too.

31
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,498
But I'm quite a picky woman.

32
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,835
First of all,

33
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,338
I've never done any work at home.

34
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,090
I'm not the type that stays home
to support my husband.

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,218
My career is more important.

36
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,597
I like that.

37
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,017
My ideal type is an ambitious woman.

38
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,395
I'll never have a baby either.

39
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,566
That's up to the woman, of course.
I won't force you to do anything.

40
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,735
I'll never look after
my parents-in-law either.

41
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,531
No need to worry about that.
My parents don't care about me at all.

42
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,081
You're not as picky as I thought.

43
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,208
I guess we're pretty compatible.

44
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,424
If he's a guy with a smooth tongue
that has an answer for everything,

45
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,594
it's time to turn on the philosopher mode.

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,472
First of all, put on a hazy look

47
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,434
and sigh as if everything in life
is futile and say…

48
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,852
What do you think

49
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,230
marriage is?

50
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,070
I'm not sure.

51
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,323
What a profound question.

52
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,536
But

53
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,831
do you know you didn't even ask me
my name yet?

54
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,629
And your name is?

55
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,133
It's Hwang Hui-tae.

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,177
Hwang Hui-tae.

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,308
Hwang Hui-tae?

58
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,143
The one

59
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,770
who went to Seoul National University
of Medicine with top marks?

60
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,898
I guess you saw the banner.

61
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,485
Gosh, practically everyone in Gwangju
saw that banner.

62
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,780
"Congratulations on your acceptance
to SNU. Hwang Hui-tae."

63
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,490
Boom.

64
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,161
I'm glad my father put up that banner

65
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,205
since you're showing such deep interest.

66
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,916
I didn't show any interest.

67
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,715
Why don't you stop drinking? Let's go eat.

68
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,969
Eat?

69
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,846
Yes, eat.

70
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,142
If he says he wants to eat,

71
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,187
that means something
is going awfully wrong.

72
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,815
At this point, you need to switch
to filthy mode

73
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,651
and stimulate his basic instincts.

74
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:09,952
Use the sense of sight, smell, hearing,
and every other sense you can think of

75
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,455
to make him feel uncomfortable.

76
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,208
My goodness!

77
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,128
Almost all the men
who come on blind dates are similar.

78
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,881
They all grew up being sheltered.

79
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,220
Thank you.

80
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,514
Let's eat.

81
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,248
What? You should have a bite too.

82
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,300
Did you bring me here
thinking I'd be repulsed?

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,348
What?

84
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,892
Is this the best you can do?

85
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,728
I know worse places than this.

86
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,912
I guess you grew up being sheltered

87
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,831
since you're the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial.

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,086
Look.

89
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,965
I'm not the neat, spoiled son
you have in mind.

90
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,263
I'm someone who grew up
eating others' leftovers.

91
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,154
What?

92
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,156
Go on and eat.

93
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,913
If he doesn't bat an eye and keeps eating,

94
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,998
then

95
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
that means he's a hard one to crack.

96
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,295
Why?

97
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,006
It means he's a guy
that likes easy-going women.

98
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,843
If you stuffed your face with gukbap
in front of him…

99
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,309
But Myeong-hee, don't worry.

100
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,102
There's still a way.

101
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,606
There's one thing that guys

102
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,401
who dig easy-going women
hate most in the world.

103
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,821
Let's go shopping.

104
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,533
Shopping? Now?

105
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:58,454
It's my rule to go shopping
at least once a day.

106
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,879
Sure. Where do you want to go?

107
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,049
There's a shop I frequent. Follow me.

108
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,985
Guys who like easy-going women

109
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,154
tend to hate it
when someone is extravagant.

110
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,284
What do I do?

111
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,744
I left my wallet at home.

112
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,708
How about you buy me something as a gift?

113
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,626
To celebrate our first date.

114
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,004
Sure.

115
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,172
Look around freely.

116
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,092
And if he's still pretending
to be unfazed,

117
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,510
then it's time for the second strike!

118
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,514
Show me your most expensive items.

119
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,225
Please come this way.

120
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,690
These are
your most expensive items, right?

121
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,693
Gosh, I don't know
if it's because of the price tag.

122
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,654
I really love all of them.

123
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,408
Excuse me, Su-ryeon?

124
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,582
Yes?

125
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,418
Choose anything you want.
Don't worry about the money.

126
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
330,000 WON

127
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,854
This bag is worth three months of my pay.

128
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,190
Why don't you carry it around?

129
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,193
It's the same brand
as the dress you're wearing,

130
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,695
so it'll be a perfect match.

131
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,783
That's why it felt familiar.

132
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,743
I already have this one at home.

133
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,205
I'll look around some more.

134
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,977
MADONNA FASHION

135
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,110
You bought a passport case
when you don't even have a passport.

136
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,529
What odd taste you have.

137
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,742
Well, it's my hobby to buy useless stuff.

138
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,344
Thank you for today…

139
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,102
-Gosh.
-Why are you getting in?

140
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,563
What are you doing?

141
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,022
I'll take you home.

142
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,234
Goodness. That's unnecessary.
I can go by myself.

143
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:19,363
My father told me to take you home
no matter what.

144
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,908
Please drop this lady off first.

145
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,618
Sure. Where to, ma'am?

146
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,620
Hyangrim-dong… That came out wrong.

147
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,498
Please drop me off in Dongmyeong-dong.

148
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,093
It's in the middle of the semester.
You must be busy.

149
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,387
What courses are you taking
in the school of law?

150
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,850
What kind of student takes classes
at a time like this?

151
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,268
We're boycotting
government-funded professors.

152
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,270
We consider all classes to be canceled.

153
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,484
I see. You consider classes
to be canceled.

154
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,406
Then you must have more time
on your hands.

155
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,910
What about you?

156
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,704
Most interns
don't even have time to sleep.

157
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,874
How did you find the time
to go on a date in Gwangju?

158
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,752
I have a lot of time. I'm not an intern.

159
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,921
I've deferred my graduation.

160
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,590
You deferred your graduation?

161
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,223
Gosh. You must've failed
the medical licensing exam.

162
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,935
I heard that a few people fail
every now and then,

163
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,021
but you're the first person
I've met in real life.

164
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,068
Sorry to disappoint you,

165
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,487
but I passed the exam.

166
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,412
Then why haven't you graduated?

167
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,337
I'll tell you when we become closer.

168
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,678
This is me. Are you happy now?

169
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,388
Hurry up and go home now.

170
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,807
Today was the most fun
I've had in a long time.

171
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,561
By the way, take this.

172
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,150
What is this?

173
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,944
You'll need it on our next date.

174
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,196
Our next date?

175
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,533
Didn't you say we have to meet
at least three times?

176
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,952
When should we meet next?

177
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,247
Well…

178
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,541
I'm not sure when I'll have time.

179
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,711
Hold on. Are you turning me down?

180
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,757
The thing is…

181
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,894
I hope you're not.
I'd love to see you again.

182
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,231
Me too. You should leave now.

183
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,442
-Can we meet again then?
-Yes. Call me.

184
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,943
How can I reach you?

185
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,653
Sir, please get going.

186
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,821
Wait.

187
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,870
Myeong-hee?

188
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,166
Su-chan. Are you just coming home now?

189
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,478
Wait. Why are you two coming in together?

190
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,106
We met at the gate. That's why.

191
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,609
Hold on. Look at you.

192
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,445
Is that what you wore to your blind date?

193
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,574
It looks like Myeong-hee
went on the blind date.

194
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,575
-What?
-What?

195
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,455
What? I was just joking.

196
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,499
Myeong-hee looks different than usual.

197
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,337
I look funny in these clothes, don't I?

198
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,464
They're all Su-ryeon's.

199
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,635
You look great.
The clothes suit you perfectly.

200
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,971
Did you go somewhere nice?

201
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,724
What? Well… She was on a date.

202
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,142
We're going upstairs.

203
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,731
A date?

204
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,651
How did it go?

205
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,406
Even when you did
everything I told you to?

206
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,283
He's no ordinary guy, I tell you.

207
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,161
No matter what I did,
he did something worse.

208
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,998
What a weirdo.

209
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,459
What's all this booty
that you brought back?

210
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,047
Don't tell me
you even got to the boutique phase.

211
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,679
I'm not shameless.
So I picked the cheapest one.

212
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,183
I don't know what this could be.
He gave it to me.

213
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,605
A pair of shoes?

214
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,482
Try them on.

215
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,584
They fit perfectly.

216
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,586
How did he figure out your size?

217
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,921
No idea.

218
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,882
Is this guy a pervert?

219
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,219
You know those guys
who are obsessed with women's feet.

220
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,597
He did seem a little weird,

221
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,932
but he didn't really come off
as a pervert.

222
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,893
For now,

223
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,730
-we're putting these back in.
-Why?

224
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,607
"Why"?

225
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,693
Do you want your feet to give him
the okay sign?

226
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,157
-Next time, we should plan ahead--
-Forget it. It's not going to work anyway.

227
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,533
It'll only torture me.

228
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,246
And I don't care
if I have to meet him a dozen times,

229
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,708
as long as I can get the airfare.

230
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,087
Hey, that's no problem.

231
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,256
I promise I'll get the money
before the third date.

232
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,592
So don't worry about anything
and get ready to go.

233
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,847
Anyway, what should you wear
on your next date?

234
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,016
We should probably pick out
some outfits beforehand.

235
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,966
Are you just getting home?

236
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,845
Have you been waiting for me?

237
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,223
Did you do anything
her family might disapprove of?

238
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,102
No, not that I can think of.

239
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,481
Our family's future
depends on this marriage.

240
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,778
A communist brat like her
might not be easy to control at first,

241
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,531
but no girl is impossible to tame.

242
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,826
Make sure this works out.

243
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,704
Goodnight, Dad.

244
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,256
Gosh.

245
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,650
I'm sorry I'm late.

246
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,195
My name is Lee Su-ryeon.

247
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:21,071
I'm not the neat, spoiled son
you have in mind.

248
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,115
You'll need it on our next date.

249
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,363
Honey.

250
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,117
Can you stop by Mudeung Stadium
on your way to work?

251
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,244
The stadium? Why?

252
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,708
Jeong-tae is a representative player
in the provincial preliminaries.

253
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,254
Are you running again?

254
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,174
It's about time you quit.

255
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,509
You'll have no energy left to study.

256
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,304
By the way, Hui-tae.

257
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,556
Have you asked her out on a second date?

258
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,183
I'm working on it.

259
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,643
I'll see her again soon, so don't worry.

260
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,022
You remember the appointment today, right?

261
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,648
They're important people,
so don't be late.

262
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,025
Okay, Dad.

263
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,367
Myeong-hee, you have a call.

264
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,746
Me? I'm not expecting a call.

265
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,249
A man asked to speak to you
in an urgent voice.

266
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,959
What?

267
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,217
Hello?

268
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,927
Myeong-hee!

269
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,305
Myeong-hee, I'm in Gwangju now.

270
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,307
You haven't forgotten about today, right?

271
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,517
You have to come!

272
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,436
Kim Myeong-su! I told you not to call…

273
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,147
I told you not to call me at work.

274
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,192
You're coming, right? You'd better.

275
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,194
I'll keep calling you until you come.

276
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,408
Okay. What time does it start?

277
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,369
Let's start with this. Then I will…

278
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,707
My goodness.

279
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,544
Your father will faint when he comes home.

280
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,547
Why don't you
set up a command center here?

281
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,008
You jerk! Don't crack such a joke.

282
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,886
I'll be right back, guys.

283
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,180
What's your problem?

284
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,224
Do you not want this?

285
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,312
540-3 BONCHEON-DONG, SEO-GU, GWANGJU

286
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,815
How did you find out?
You said it'd be hard.

287
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,193
I stumbled upon an unexpected helper.

288
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,321
I went to middle school with her.

289
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,949
Jang Seok-chul isn't a common name
for girls, you know.

290
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,493
We met briefly the other day.

291
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,911
What's your name?

292
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,746
I'm Park Seon-min.

293
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,081
Thank you, Seon-min.

294
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,293
She must be that girl.

295
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,337
Your secret lover in Gwangju.

296
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,300
We should grab a bite together soon.

297
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,634
Bye, Mrs. Jung.

298
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,932
-That crazy jerk!
-What's he saying?

299
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,695
Su-ryeon!

300
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,365
Goodness.

301
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,038
Su-ryeon.

302
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,046
MADONNA FASHION

303
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,873
You should always watch
where you're walking, Su-ryeon.

304
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,673
I'm sorry. I called you,
but you didn't hear me.

305
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,675
Hwang Hui-tae?

306
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,178
Did you follow me?

307
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,805
What?

308
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,351
Don't worry.
I'm going to the bus stop too.

309
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,397
You're rich. Why won't you take a taxi?

310
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,150
Isn't your family wealthier than mine?

311
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,154
I wasn't sure whether it was you or not.

312
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,490
Your style is very different
than the last time we met.

313
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,245
I was at a rally earlier.

314
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,956
Is that right?

315
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,918
That makes you even more likable
than last time.

316
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,962
Don't be sarcastic.

317
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,298
I really meant it.

318
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,468
By the way, what are you looking for?

319
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,178
I can't find the bus token.

320
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,848
You can be on your way.
I have to get some tokens.

321
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,766
I have some.

322
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,229
Will this be enough?

323
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,524
Do you sell tokens?

324
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,571
How do I go about doing that?
Should I charge interest?

325
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,200
Well, then I'll just take one…

326
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,454
It's not like I can dig the ground
and find these.

327
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,418
Take them all
and pay me back with interest.

328
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,840
Sure, okay.

329
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,636
We should meet again.
The flowers are in full bloom.

330
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,263
Sorry, I have somewhere to be.

331
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,639
Bye.

332
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,849
What? Wait.

333
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,809
Su-ryeon!

334
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,446
Su-ryeon, then how about tomorrow?

335
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,115
What's this? Get out
if you're not getting on.

336
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,325
Just a second please.

337
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,786
The lady over there
with her head facing the window

338
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,871
and with her left hand over her face!

339
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,748
Are you free tomorrow?

340
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,710
Miss!

341
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,546
He's asking you
if he can see you tomorrow.

342
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,674
Yes, sure!

343
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,717
Where? What time?

344
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,561
My goodness! Just meet at Woo Cafe
around 4 p.m.

345
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,315
Okay, 4 p.m. at Woo Cafe it is.

346
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,567
Thank you all for waiting.

347
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,946
All right!

348
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,618
-Go for it!
-You got this!

349
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,829
Good luck!

350
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,664
Kim Myeong-su!

351
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,543
Myeong-hee!

352
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,504
Myeong-hee!

353
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,923
NAJU

354
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,175
Good luck, Myeong-su!

355
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,969
Thanks!

356
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,931
GO, SUSEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL!

357
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,391
GO, EUNGBO MIDDLE SCHOOL!

358
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,560
-Good luck.
-You got this!

359
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,729
Best of luck!

360
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,316
-You got this.
-Good luck!

361
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,901
-Go for it!
-Do a good job!

362
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,328
Myeong-su, my gosh.

363
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,564
GWANGJU

364
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,301
My gosh!

365
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,262
Go, Myeong-su!

366
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,000
GWANGJU

367
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,758
Myeong-su! I'm so proud of you.

368
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,426
You made Naju proud!

369
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,804
What are you talking about?
I came in second.

370
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,556
This means I'm out.

371
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,058
What? You didn't know?

372
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,811
Second place
can go to the Junior Sports Festival.

373
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,481
-You now represent South Jeolla Province!
-What? Seriously?

374
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,193
My gosh! Why didn't you tell me sooner?
My lungs are about to burst.

375
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,153
This is an announcement.

376
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,655
Catch your breath.

377
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,866
I have to go to the main desk.

378
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:12,203
Teachers, please come to the main desk.

379
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,957
My gosh.

380
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:22,171
Even though your shoes came off,
you almost beat Hwang Jeong-tae.

381
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,216
You totally could have
come in the first place.

382
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,010
What is your name?

383
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,221
I'm Kim Myeong-su.

384
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,431
Myeong-su?

385
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,267
Myeong-su?
It sounds like a digestive drink.

386
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,898
I'll see you at the Spartan training.

387
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,112
"Spartan training"?

388
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,281
Myeong-hee!

389
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,118
I did it. I made the team!

390
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,580
-I can join the South Jeolla team too!
-What?

391
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:59,208
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.

392
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,546
My little bear. What do you want to eat?
Just tell me. I'll buy you everything.

393
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,465
I want…

394
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,092
What? Is it because of your friends?

395
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,428
Bring them along. I'll buy…

396
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,721
Dad!

397
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,491
We don't need any entrees.

398
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,409
We'll just have three bowls
of jjajangmyeon.

399
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,748
We'll have tangsuyuk too. Make it a large.

400
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,418
One large tangsuyuk
and three bowls of jjajangmyeon.

401
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,684
This jjajangmyeon looks delicious.

402
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,268
Let's eat.

403
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,652
You're a runner.
Look at the state of your shoes.

404
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,280
With good shoes,
you would've easily won the race.

405
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,034
Mind your own business
and get some new shoes yourself.

406
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,830
What kind of grown woman
wears shoes like those?

407
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,879
The more I think of it,
the stranger it seems.

408
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,589
Is the bank clerk intercepting
all the money

409
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,216
or does your wallet have a hole in it?

410
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,428
Where did all my hard-earned money go?

411
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,518
I almost forgot.

412
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,772
Can I stay with you at the boarding house
for a few days?

413
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,360
The provincial representatives
train in Gwangju.

414
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,615
Does that mean, you'll be
coming to Gwangju every weekend?

415
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,910
Actually, it's not just the weekends.

416
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,997
We'll be training there throughout May.

417
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,165
What did you say?

418
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,000
Throughout May?

419
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,752
What about school?

420
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,003
The teacher said

421
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,631
the school wouldn't care
as long as it's for training.

422
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,050
No.

423
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,553
Enough with your nonsense.
Just stay in school.

424
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,055
Dad.

425
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,019
Do you break your children's wings
as a hobby?

426
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,397
What did you say?

427
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,735
I'll look after Myeong-su
during his training.

428
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,986
Stay out of it.

429
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,041
Just worry about yourself.

430
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,970
-Get up.
-Dad.

431
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,729
Sit back down.

432
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,607
We haven't had the tangsuyuk yet.

433
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,693
Are you coming or not?

434
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,302
Excuse me.

435
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,721
Is this Ms. Jang Seok-chul's home?

436
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,974
Is someone here?

437
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,111
She started sending us less
and less money.

438
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,654
In the end, she stopped completely.

439
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,157
Is it about a guy?

440
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,658
No, that's not it.

441
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,661
The money probably stopped
due to the factory strike.

442
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,662
It's been going on for months.

443
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,414
A strike?

444
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,959
Did she get arrested
for going on strike or something?

445
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,669
No, she didn't get arrested.

446
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,215
The thing is,

447
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,468
she got seriously injured.

448
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,597
She's in a hospital in Seoul right now,

449
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,390
but she'll be transferred to a hospital
in Gwangju…

450
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,102
Wait. If she's sent here to Gwangju,
she can't work at the factory anymore.

451
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,773
She's not in the condition
to work right now.

452
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,568
This isn't much,

453
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,321
but please use this for living expenses
and her medication.

454
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,617
Who cares about her medication?

455
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:48,497
My eldest son can't go back to school
because he can't pay his tuition.

456
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,794
Why did that wench have to

457
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,547
go on that useless strike?

458
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,726
The boy's family told me
that the date went well. I'm surprised.

459
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,478
What else could I do?

460
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,481
Going on three dates was the condition.

461
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,732
Goodness.

462
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,236
Your effort has paid off.
You should go and see.

463
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,403
What do you mean?

464
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,573
I got a call that your gang
has been released.

465
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,868
Is that right?

466
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,119
Dad!

467
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,330
Dad!

468
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:35,044
My goodness. That's enough.

469
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,673
Father. I'm going out for a bit.

470
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,299
See you later.

471
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,054
My gosh.

472
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,974
Guys, I brought tofu for you.

473
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,559
REPORT THE FACTS!

474
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,229
Hold on. Why do you all look so serious?

475
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,731
Did something happen?

476
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,402
Have some tofu first…

477
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,909
How did you get us out?

478
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,789
-What are you talking about?
-No.

479
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,875
Maybe the first question should be
how you got out.

480
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
Tell us.

481
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,007
You're the one
who got caught holding the flyers.

482
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,968
So how come you were the first
to get released?

483
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,935
What could I do?

484
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,022
With all our seniors being wanted
and on the run,

485
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,524
I couldn't let you guys go to prison.

486
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,568
In that case,

487
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,654
why don't you ask your father
to let them off the hook?

488
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,451
Guys, don't be like that.

489
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,328
We're all here to fight for democracy.

490
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,914
Yes, we're all here to fight for democracy

491
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,791
except one person is here to play tag.

492
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,881
You apparently had no problem

493
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,384
with using my father's factory
for printing out flyers.

494
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,764
And all of a sudden,
we belong to different classes?

495
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,144
You just said you don't like me.

496
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,023
Wait, Su-ryeon.

497
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,236
Come on.

498
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,823
While trying to save five seconds,
you may lose 50 years of life.

499
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,909
No jaywalking.

500
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,078
Sir, you're not a car.
Please use the sidewalk.

501
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,038
-Sir!
-Gosh.

502
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,248
Wait.

503
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,960
How dare you try to jaywalk
right in front of me?

504
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,757
Wait. Aren't you the criminal
that I caught red-handed?

505
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,052
Hey, there.
Do you break the law as a hobby?

506
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,887
Your father won't be able to
get you out this time.

507
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,848
Shouldn't you try to keep up appearances?

508
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,184
A well-off person
should set a good example…

509
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,575
I was just…

510
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,412
I didn't mean to make you cry.

511
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,205
Hey, Hyeon-cheol.

512
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,082
It's not a market day today.
What brings you here?

513
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,709
Well…

514
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,547
Show us a pair of running shoes.

515
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,549
They are

516
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,177
for the National Sports Festival.

517
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,555
So show us the best pair you have.

518
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,183
The National Sports Festival?
Myeong-su! Are you participating in it?

519
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,356
We have these ones
and there's this one too.

520
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,193
Take your pick.

521
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,667
This one?

522
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,628
Unlike your father, you have a good eye.

523
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,964
Do you want to try them on?
All right, come here.

524
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,216
Here, the right foot first.

525
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,510
Let's see.

526
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,929
There. Perfect.

527
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,682
Dad.

528
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,310
It's really okay.

529
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,688
I guess he doesn't want new shoes.
Forget it then.

530
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,898
No!

531
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,025
Now, try on the left shoe too.

532
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,818
Put them on and try running in them.

533
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,654
Come on. Hurry,
before your dad changes his mind.

534
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,824
Try running in them. Yes, try now.

535
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,493
How is it?

536
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,458
It should be somewhere around here.

537
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,001
What's that, Dad?

538
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,464
The recipient is Kim Myeong-hee?

539
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,549
What?

540
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:54,345
I brought this
since it has your sister's address.

541
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,430
Dad, did you write her a letter?

542
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,183
Give me that.

543
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,684
I'll hand-deliver it.

544
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,020
This way, you don't have to buy
the postage stamp.

545
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,146
You rascal.

546
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,233
Hey, that tickles.

547
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,151
-Stop.
-It's Myeong-hee.

548
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,861
Myeong-hee!

549
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,248
I should get going. Here, take your shoes.

550
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,334
I'll stop by the training camp
and bring your clothes.

551
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,462
What? Aren't you going to say hi
to Myeong-hee?

552
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,173
Go on. She's waiting.

553
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,217
Myeong-hee!

554
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,740
Dear Lord.

555
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,662
Please bless us with the ability to help
those in need and spread kindness.

556
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,039
Please give us the strength
to fully carry out our mission

557
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,127
using the abilities
that you bestowed upon us.

558
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,423
Lord, we pray to you with all our hearts.

559
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,174
-Amen.
-Amen.

560
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,467
Amen.

561
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,765
I'm sorry I'm late.

562
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,519
You're late indeed.
You should introduce yourself.

563
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,645
Sure.

564
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,357
Hello.

565
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,777
My father must've said
lots of good things about me.

566
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,446
It's nice to meet you in person.

567
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,573
I'm Hwang Hui-tae, his eldest son.

568
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
My gosh.

569
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:49,001
My goodness. Mr. Hwang,
what a happy family you have.

570
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,879
Your wife is the most gorgeous lady
in Gwangju,

571
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,465
and your son attends
the best university in Korea.

572
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,799
And

573
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,761
your younger son is adorable.

574
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,056
I'm sure just looking at them
makes you happy.

575
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,644
Kiddo, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

576
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,438
A doctor, like your big brother?

577
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,108
I want to…

578
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:17,363
Actually, Jeong-tae qualified to compete
in the Junior Sports Festival as…

579
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,697
He wants to become a soldier.

580
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,577
He's already training
to attend the Military Academy later on.

581
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,039
Clearly, he takes after his father.

582
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,875
What a blessed family!

583
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,254
Wait.

584
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,509
Don't eat so fast.
You'll burn your tongue again.

585
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,728
You can eat now.

586
00:44:56,193 --> 00:45:00,072
If someone asks me
what I'd want as my last meal,

587
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,157
I'd pick ramyeon cooked by you.

588
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,035
Eat up.

589
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:11,125
Eat it with kimchi at least.
I said I could fix you a proper meal.

590
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,002
My gosh, thank you.

591
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,005
-Eat up.
-I'm home.

592
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,382
Hey, you're back.

593
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,967
I smell ramyeon!

594
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,012
Careful, it's hot.

595
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,062
Who's this kid?

596
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,524
-Myeong-hee, is he your secret child?
-Gosh!

597
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,401
You wench, watch what you say.

598
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,237
He's my baby brother.

599
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,865
He's here for his track
and field training.

600
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,994
Hello, I'm Kim Myeong-su.

601
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,708
Unlike you, he's very friendly.

602
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,127
Cut it out.

603
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,045
-Take your shoes off, will you?
-Gosh.

604
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,548
-And go wash your hands.
-That hurts!

605
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,800
-That's the point!
-Stop hitting me! It hurts.

606
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,594
Like I said, that is the point!

607
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,637
-Why you…
-Stop! I'll take them off.

608
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,432
Here. Are we good now?

609
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,151
Myeong-hee.

610
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,861
If you're going abroad,
when will you return?

611
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,989
I'll come back
when your grandson is getting married.

612
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,575
You're leaving
because you hate our family, right?

613
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,923
What is this nonsense about?

614
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,383
Can you not leave?

615
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,053
If you leave,
you won't get to see me win a medal.

616
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,431
Dad doesn't even know that you're leaving.

617
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,401
You're just a kid.
Stay out of grown folks' business.

618
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,530
You know…

619
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,368
I just want to see you and Dad
get back on good terms.

620
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,411
Like the old days.

621
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,041
Back then, you smiled a lot
at home with us,

622
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,834
like you're doing here.

623
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,508
You little rascal.

624
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,219
Just go to sleep.

625
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,306
Get home safely, ma'am.

626
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,912
Few more dinners with them
will make you quit smoking.

627
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,501
I told you not to be late. Where were you?

628
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,921
I went to see Su-ryeon.

629
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,260
You said I should see her again soon.
I'm meeting her tomorrow.

630
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,434
Myeong-hee, can I borrow your powder?

631
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,489
You'll start middle school soon.

632
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,159
How do you not know
how to tie your own shoelaces?

633
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,037
It's because I've never owned shoes
with laces before.

634
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,917
Stop! That's way too tight.

635
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,794
This way, it won't come undone
even if you run.

636
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,672
There.

637
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,303
Are you sure I don't have to go with you?

638
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,723
I'm not a baby. I can look at the map.

639
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,309
I'm very good with directions, you know?

640
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,312
See you later, Myeong-hee!

641
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,773
Watch out for cars.

642
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,650
And come home as soon as you're done!

643
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,239
My goodness.

644
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,242
It's warm today. What's with the coat?

645
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,162
Well…

646
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,832
My hands and feet get cold so easily,
you know.

647
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,835
See you later!

648
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,717
-I told you.
-Who can I take?

649
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,260
You can go with Ms. Choi.

650
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,720
Would she be free?

651
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,101
My gosh, Myeong-hee!
Are you going somewhere today?

652
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,646
Why did you get all dolled up
to come to work?

653
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,315
Who are you trying to impress?
My goodness.

654
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,568
Not you, obviously.
Just finish that cigarette.

655
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,738
Why that little…

656
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:59,204
-Rock-paper-scissors. Paper.
-Paper, paper.

657
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:04,334
Are you here for the training? Come here.

658
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,601
That's…

659
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,438
Always be careful and eat well, okay?

660
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,148
Don't push yourself too hard.

661
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,984
-And call me if anything happens.
-Okay.

662
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,111
Even his mom is so pretty.

663
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,697
She's prettier than Jung Yoon-hee.

664
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,533
She used her looks to become a mistress.

665
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,285
My mom told me

666
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,455
that Hwang Jeong-tae's mom is a mistress.

667
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,457
"Mistress?"

668
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,640
It's nice to meet you.

669
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,019
I'm the coach who's in charge
of your overall training,

670
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,479
Park Chul-bum.

671
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,649
The month of May
will become a month you'll remember

672
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,903
as the most passionate moment
of your lives.

673
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,198
Through a Spartan-style training program.

674
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,993
Everyone get into groups
according to your main event!

675
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,538
-Center.
-Center.

676
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,124
Move faster.

677
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,631
You two have the same shoes.

678
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,764
They're not the same.

679
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,432
His shoes look cheap.

680
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,768
-What?
-It's fake.

681
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,354
Did you buy that at the market?

682
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,608
Why do you care what I bought
or where I bought it from?

683
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,571
Hey, doesn't he smell like a beggar?

684
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,698
What?

685
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,201
You little…

686
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,916
Hey, Myeong-su and Jeong-tae, come here.

687
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,292
Get over here now!

688
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,760
Being a steady sponsor
is a very difficult thing to do.

689
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,137
I'll make sure this money
is put to good use.

690
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,348
Oh, sure.

691
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,392
Okay.

692
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,437
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
LEE SU-CHAN

693
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,606
Thank you for your time.

694
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,900
Gosh, I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

695
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,950
EMERGENCY ROOM

696
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,548
Excuse me, when can you check this?

697
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,216
I'll be right there.

698
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,344
I'll be right back.

699
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,315
Gosh.

700
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,235
Ma'am.

701
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,530
You look very busy.

702
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,617
Hey, Su-chan. What are you doing here?

703
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,410
Are you hurt?

704
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,788
I come here often even when I feel fine.

705
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,417
Is it about time to go home now?

706
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,878
I'll be waiting outside.

707
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,922
How about dinner?

708
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,341
I'm sorry.

709
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,885
I have plans tonight.

710
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,178
Plans?

711
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,098
Is it that date you mentioned last time?

712
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,893
No, it's not a date. It's…

713
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,944
Su-chan, I'm still on the clock.

714
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,821
Right. I'm sorry to bother you
when you're so busy.

715
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,657
I'll see you next time then.

716
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,200
Goodbye.

717
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,846
Thank you.

718
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,481
Excuse me?

719
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,028
Which fork do we have to use?
There are so many.

720
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,532
This is the salad fork,
and this is for the main dish.

721
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,617
Thank you.

722
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,830
I thought you were used
to stuff like this.

723
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,707
Aren't you rich?

724
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,166
I'm totally clueless.

725
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,461
I just came because this place
is expensive and famous.

726
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,547
I just wanted to impress you.

727
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,468
Right.

728
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,054
My tokens.

729
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,737
My gosh.

730
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,281
Are these brass coins or what?

731
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,743
I can't deny it.

732
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,580
Every time I meet you, I laugh
more than the past few years combined.

733
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,082
Gosh.

734
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,335
You say that to every girl you meet,
don't you?

735
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,337
No. You're the first.

736
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,302
After struggling with my life
all day long,

737
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,306
I feel free whenever I meet you.

738
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,937
You're really special. I mean it.

739
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,527
It's special to be the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial.

740
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,618
Did the shoes
I bought you last time fit well?

741
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,622
Well, the thing is…

742
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,957
Man, this place is nice.

743
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,376
It took me a month
to get a reservation at this place.

744
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,295
I never expected you to bring me here.

745
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,637
Why? Shall I order something else?

746
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,975
I suddenly feel thirsty.

747
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,977
What kind of drinks do they have?

748
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,106
But it's just us two men.

749
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,483
Is your hand trembling?
Shall I order some beer?

750
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,529
No, I'll have water.

751
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,863
Go on and eat.

752
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,866
-You can come with her next time.
-"Her"? Who?

753
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,535
You know,

754
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,913
that nurse in the ER
that you're hitting on.

755
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,958
-That cold-hearted girl.
-Her?

756
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,584
Cold-hearted, my foot.

757
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,712
It turns out she's a total vixen.

758
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,216
She wags her tail
to try to marry into a rich family.

759
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,135
What a true surprise.

760
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,388
It's the supplier
of our hospital's foreign medicine.

761
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,932
Don't force yourself to eat.
You'll get sick.

762
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,018
I'm not feeling well.

763
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,603
-But you know,
-Can we…

764
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,314
even if she tries,
no rich man will want her.

765
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,859
She should know her place.

766
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,862
-You know what I mean?
-I'll go get some water.

767
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,780
Why is she trying so hard?

768
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,949
Let's choose our menu.

769
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,410
I'll have the New York steak course.

770
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,370
What shall I have?

771
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,539
What the…

772
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,586
Are you crazy?

773
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,589
My goodness. I'm sorry.
My hand must've slipped.

774
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,591
How could your hand slip on my head?

775
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,676
-Darn it.
-I'm so sorry.

776
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,762
-I'll pay to get it cleaned.
-What?

777
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,389
I can't believe this.

778
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,642
Hey, Myeong… Wait…

779
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,982
Use this to get it dry-cleaned.
And watch your mouth from now on.

780
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,700
Su-ryeon!

781
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,704
Are you okay? Can you get up?

782
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,831
I'm fine. It's just a sprain.

783
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,043
-Let me carry you.
-No.

784
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,295
I said it's okay.

785
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,047
I can walk.

786
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,008
How can you walk wearing this--

787
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,551
I said I can walk!

788
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,395
My gosh!

789
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,942
What are you doing?

790
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,860
You need treatment.
Let's go to the hospital.

791
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,278
No.

792
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,781
Not the hospital.

793
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,418
Lift your foot.

794
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,394
Wow, look at those flower petals.

795
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,538
I took an introductory course on Botany.

796
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,874
I bet all these flowers will wither
by next weekend.

797
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,086
So that means…

798
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,300
We must meet again before next weekend.

799
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,516
Does your father keep forcing you
to meet me?

800
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,104
I'm the daughter of Changhwa Industrial,
so you must marry me, is that it?

801
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,905
To be honest,

802
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,200
it wasn't my first time seeing you
at the hotel.

803
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,957
I witnessed the car accident
in front of the hotel.

804
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:37,383
The whole time I was waiting
for Ms. Lee Su-ryeon in the coffee shop,

805
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,887
I was thinking,
"Gosh. Who cares about this date?"

806
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,222
"I should have talked to
that girl from earlier."

807
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,559
But then,

808
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,103
you walked in

809
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,147
as my date.

810
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,152
It's not the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial I like.

811
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:01,032
Even if you were Ms. Song Mal-ja
or Ms. Kim Bok-soon,

812
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,993
it would've made no difference to me.

813
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,426
It's done.

814
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,525
My goodness.

815
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,819
I can see that you received good training.

816
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,906
If only you passed,
you would've made a great doctor.

817
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,117
Gosh. I said I passed.

818
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,369
Why can't you believe me?

819
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,747
It's not that I failed to graduate.
I chose not to.

820
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,833
Why would you choose not to?

821
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,545
Do you want to know why?

822
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,801
But if I tell you,

823
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,970
it'll mean we're close.

824
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,773
I'm entering the University Song Festival.

825
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,817
What?

826
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,361
I'm not qualified once I graduate.

827
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,489
I can only enter it
because I'm still a student.

828
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,673
I can sing for you sometime.

829
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,010
Can we meet again
before the flowers wither?

830
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,858
Did you write the song yourself?

831
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,235
I did.

832
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,743
Then I'd love to.

833
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,764
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

834
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,974
To think how proudly
they pointed their fingers at me

835
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,310
like they were independence fighters
or something.

836
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,732
They'd find fault with whatever you do.

837
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,317
Don't let it bother you.

838
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,487
What's that anyway?

839
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,573
I came to return your clothes.

840
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,997
I'll return the blouse after washing it.

841
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,750
Did you meet him again?

842
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,043
When? How?

843
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,379
I've been ignoring all his calls.

844
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,465
I ran into him.

845
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,428
I couldn't reach you,
so I just went to see him.

846
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,598
I couldn't answer the phone
because I was too upset.

847
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,809
Did anything special happen?

848
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:20,189
I'm meeting him once more soon.

849
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,278
But I feel so bad for lying to him.

850
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,574
Why did those punks have to kick
at the tofu I brought?

851
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,701
They could've just returned it to me.

852
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,956
Sorry.

853
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,041
What were you saying?

854
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:45,047
I'm meeting the guy once more soon.

855
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,216
You don't have to anymore.

856
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,259
What?

857
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,219
You've done enough.

858
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,264
I only asked you to meet him
to get those punks out.

859
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:01,772
I'll still give you the money
for your airfare,

860
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,482
so don't worry about that.

861
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,194
Thanks for all the trouble
you went through for me.

862
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,702
Su-ryeon, come downstairs for a moment.

863
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,960
You really didn't have to bring anything.

864
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,546
Su-ryeon, get over here.

865
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,007
Mr. Hwang sent us this precious gift.

866
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,384
A gift? What gift?

867
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,431
And his son brought it
all the way here in person.

868
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,987
You must be surprised
that I showed up unannounced,

869
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,239
Su-ryeon.

870
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,580
This is Mr. Hwang's son.

871
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,540
-You know them well, don't you?
-What?

872
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:27,251
-What kind of scheme brings you here?
-I'm here to figure out your scheme.

873
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,544
I came to apologize.

874
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,130
Do you know Myeong-hee?

875
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,758
-Can you write down your number?
-I'll write it with a permanent marker.

876
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,051
Are you here to order rice cakes
for your wedding?

877
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,219
-Marriage?
-The parents are talking about it.

878
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,889
One of my in-laws is looking for
a company to invest in.

879
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,974
Hui-tae? How did you find where I live?
