1
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,405
The police are investigating
an unidentified skeleton

2
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,701
found at a construction site
in Gwangju this morning.

3
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,413
The police have sent the skeleton
to the National Forensic Service

4
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,041
for DNA analysis
in order to identify the victim.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,502
Those in the political circles are saying

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,964
the skeleton may belong to
one of the victims of the Gwangju Uprising

7
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,259
and that the blood sample may need to be
compared with the families

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,054
of those who disappeared
during the Gwangju Uprising.

9
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,557
Who's he?
Another relative of a missing person?

10
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,477
No. He's an informant.

11
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,189
-An informant?
-Yes.

12
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,319
VIDEO SURVEY ROOM A

13
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,252
Dad.

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,714
Why are you out here
instead of coming inside?

15
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,841
I didn't even know you were coming.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,218
I'm fine.

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,222
You're not hurt, are you?

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,016
No. Shall I go and get my bag?

19
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,520
No. You wait here a little longer.

20
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,147
I'll go get your sister.

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,898
Can't I come with you?

22
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,443
It's dangerous outside.
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

23
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,113
I won't be too long, okay?

24
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,450
Aren't you Jeong-tae's mother?

25
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,119
Why aren't you coming inside?

26
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,331
Would you mind getting Jeong-tae for me?

27
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,292
Okay.

28
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,712
-See you soon, Dad.
-Sure.

29
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,755
Go on.

30
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,991
If he can't even introduce you to them,
how can you trust him?

31
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,702
You're going to regret this.
Let's go back to Naju with me.

32
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,955
Don't say that. You don't understand.

33
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,206
Ms. Kim!

34
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,753
Dr. Yoo and Mr. Hwang…

35
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,548
They were in a hit-and-run.

36
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,431
EMERGENCY ROOM

37
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,771
GWANGJU

38
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,111
Where's the other one? Is he on his way?

39
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,571
There was only one patient.

40
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,823
What are you talking about?
They left together.

41
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,116
There's another person.

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,661
But there was only one person there!

43
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,912
Hurry up.

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,127
Dr. Yoo.

45
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,546
Dr. Yoo.

46
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,848
Dr. Yoo. Are you all right?

47
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,016
Are you awake?

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,519
Myeong-hee.

49
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,981
Dr. Yoo, what happened to Hui-tae?

50
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,482
He wasn't at the site.

51
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,860
The punks who hit us took him.

52
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,697
They took him?

53
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,325
They drove right into our car,

54
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,370
so Hui-tae had fainted
and they took him with them.

55
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,373
They loaded him into their car and left.

56
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,886
Myeong-hee.

57
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,015
Here you are.

58
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,018
I thought you'd left with Hui-tae…

59
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,442
Su-ryeon.

60
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,612
Hui-tae…

61
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,781
What about him?

62
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,994
Myeong-hee, what happened? Tell me.

63
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,288
Myeong-hee.

64
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,352
Are you awake?

65
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,648
I know I'm not one to talk,

66
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,568
but you, Dad…

67
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,530
You're quite something yourself.

68
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,616
THE LORD WILL KEEP YOUR GOING OUT
AND YOUR COMING IN

69
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,201
FROM THIS TIME FORTH, AND FOREVERMORE

70
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,135
Leave for Seoul in ten minutes.

71
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,388
There are no buses or trains.
You'll go by car.

72
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,474
Treatment

73
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,227
can wait until you're in Seoul.

74
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,437
Where is Lee Su-ryeon?

75
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,190
I don't know.

76
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:45,488
Then we'll say she disappeared in Seoul
and her whereabouts are unknown.

77
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,323
What are you trying to do?

78
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,118
You were never in Gwangju.

79
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,248
You can brainwash me all you like,

80
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,543
but that won't change the fact
that I was in Gwangju.

81
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,175
Then I can destroy all evidence
that you were here.

82
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,802
For example…

83
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,641
That brat who's at the hospital.

84
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:24,068
The doctors, nurses, and patients there…

85
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,737
So many people saw me.

86
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,073
Will you blow up the hospital
or something?

87
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,408
That's not a bad idea.

88
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,370
I can wipe out the building
and blame it on the spies.

89
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,292
Why? Do you not like that?

90
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,880
Then how about we say we killed the spies
that infiltrated the hospital?

91
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,385
I must have become your Achilles' heel.

92
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
This is when you should be your busiest,

93
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,810
and you're trying so hard to
erase my existence.

94
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,397
My being in Gwangju

95
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,233
seems to be a huge threat to you.

96
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,486
Am I wrong?

97
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,869
Let me go.

98
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,749
If you let me go,
not only will I leave Gwangju,

99
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,043
but I'll disappear
from your life for good.

100
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,004
Just as I expected.

101
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,300
You're very smart.

102
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,677
But you're bad at reading someone's mind.

103
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,349
Once you think you know
your opponent's moves and get cocky,

104
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,772
it's practically the same
as exposing your next move.

105
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,569
You've lost.

106
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,073
Just stay here
until the situation comes to an end.

107
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,509
Myeong-hee.

108
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,805
I requested the search team
to look for him extra carefully.

109
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,014
Doesn't the search team

110
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,726
only look for dead people?

111
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,105
What are you talking about? No way.

112
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,569
They're even finding fugitives
that are on the run.

113
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,405
I'm sure he was dragged away
after being hit by the car.

114
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,284
His father is probably behind it.

115
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,331
If Hwang Gi-nam is really behind it,

116
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,293
he probably wasn't taken
to Defense Security Command.

117
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,921
So you should calm down…

118
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,590
There's nothing I can do.

119
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,760
He probably bled a lot.

120
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,389
He might be dying somewhere
right this moment.

121
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,224
But there's nothing I can do.

122
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,185
Myeong-hee.

123
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,271
Pull yourself together.

124
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,692
Why isn't there anything you can do?

125
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,736
You need to wait for Hwang Hui-tae.

126
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,821
You just

127
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,782
want me to wait like this?

128
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,161
I'm certain Hwang Hui-tae will come back.

129
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,080
So until then,

130
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,666
you must stay strong.

131
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,543
Okay?

132
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,214
Hui-tae.

133
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,592
You don't have to leave us on purpose.

134
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,802
I'll just drop by the hospital nearby.

135
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,222
I have nothing to say to my father.

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,228
Can you not go and just stay here?

137
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,107
I'll be right back, so wait for me.

138
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,616
Myeong-hee.

139
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,326
Kim Myeong-hee.

140
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,538
Come with me now.
We must go before it's too late.

141
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,999
Myeong-su and your mother
are waiting for you too--

142
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,167
I'm headed to the hospital.

143
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,213
What are you talking about?
Why the hospital?

144
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,840
Why would you go back there?

145
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,928
He said he'd come back to the hospital.

146
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,555
I'll wait for him there.

147
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,933
You just take Myeong-su and leave.

148
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,978
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,606
What kind of father in this world
would leave his daughter

150
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,566
in this kind of dangerous place?

151
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,362
I can't leave him behind either.

152
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,958
Goodness.

153
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,965
My dear. My gosh, what happened?

154
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,260
My poor baby.

155
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,638
My poor baby, what happened to you?

156
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,099
My goodness.

157
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,059
My goodness.

158
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,108
My poor baby. I can't believe it.

159
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,861
Su-chan has arrived safely thanks to you.

160
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,280
We're indebted to you yet again.

161
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,823
Thank you so much, Mr. Hwang.

162
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,074
No need to thank me.

163
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,119
Let's each take care of our own children
from now on.

164
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,997
Yes. I promise something like
this will never happen again.

165
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,665
We were unfortunate this time--

166
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,126
I'm not talking about your son,
but your daughter.

167
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,336
Sorry?

168
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,213
Su-ryeon is in Seoul--

169
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,507
She's in Gwangju right now.

170
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,343
I've found my son and he's with me now.

171
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,806
So you should look carefully
for your daughter as well.

172
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,564
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

173
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,525
As of this moment, Operation Choongjung
will change its focus

174
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,111
from suppression to total lockdown.

175
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,531
Barricade all roads
leading out of Gwangju,

176
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,825
in order to stop the rebels from escaping.

177
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,829
Any rebel that disobeys orders
is to be shot immediately.

178
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,716
They really had

179
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,802
the eyes of a hunting dog
that even kills humans.

180
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,555
-What?
-You know

181
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,725
those soldiers from the other unit
that passed by.

182
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,312
I don't know
if it's because of my insecurity,

183
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,024
but they really seemed like
they actually killed people.

184
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,542
Will we be able to go back there?

185
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,510
Will we be able…

186
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,430
to return to Gwangju?

187
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
Hello, ma'am.

188
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,528
You must be working really hard.

189
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:23,946
Su-chan.

190
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,866
Are you hurt? What happened?

191
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,158
Well, it's…

192
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,952
Don't worry about it.

193
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,787
The thing is,

194
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,541
I came here to ask you something.

195
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,959
What is it?

196
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,048
Su-ryeon and Hui-tae

197
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,176
are back in Gwangju.

198
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,893
So you knew.

199
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,394
Then

200
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,439
do you know where Su-ryeon is?

201
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,360
-Well…
-Please tell me if you know.

202
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,488
I must find her
before Mr. Hwang hurts her.

203
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,783
I heard that he found Hui-tae
and has him now.

204
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,702
So it's only a matter of time
before he finds Su-ryeon.

205
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,454
Did he really say that?

206
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,831
He said he has Hui-tae with him?

207
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,878
GWANGJU PEACE HOSPITAL

208
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,593
You're really going to stay here

209
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,054
until Hui-tae returns?

210
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,896
Mr. Hwang took Hui-tae.

211
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,148
You know what that means, right?

212
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,026
It means if you keep staying here,

213
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,446
you don't know
when you'll fall in danger too.

214
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,073
I'm worried about you

215
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,243
as much as Su-ryeon, Myeong-hee.

216
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,001
When I was young,

217
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,880
whenever my dad took me to the market,
there's something he always said.

218
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,842
He told me to stay put and not go anywhere

219
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,929
if I let go of his hand and got lost.

220
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,309
He told me I'd go missing if we both
wandered around looking for each other.

221
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,437
He told me to stay put

222
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
until he found me.

223
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,407
I'll stay right here
even if lightning strikes

224
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,244
so that Hui-tae can find me.

225
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,503
Myeong-hee.

226
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,424
This is what I liked so much about you.

227
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,428
You were always brave and strong.

228
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,563
Be careful.

229
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,859
And call me anytime if you need my help.

230
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,903
Okay.

231
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,310
Jeong-tae. Are you up?

232
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,900
Come downstairs to eat.

233
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,902
Your father will be home soon.

234
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,583
Didn't I tell you
not to stomp on the stairs?

235
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,002
Haven't you even washed up yet?

236
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,212
I'm not hungry.

237
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,133
But you should still eat with him.
He doesn't come home often these days.

238
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,885
Go wash up.

239
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,137
Never open this door again.

240
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,731
Have you lost your mind?

241
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,985
What's going on in our house?

242
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,072
Like I said,

243
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
I'm doing this for our family.

244
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,201
For our family?

245
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,828
But the person locked up in there
is your own child.

246
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,913
No.

247
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,332
What's in there is a ticking time bomb.

248
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,167
Just like your father.

249
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,088
Thanks to your mighty father,

250
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,258
we've been stuck in this countryside
for ten years now.

251
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,010
It's my first chance in ten years.
Do you understand?

252
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,639
I can't be hugging a bomb
just because we're family.

253
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,350
I won't make that stupid mistake again.

254
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,028
MALE, 29

255
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,239
NAVY TROUSERS, PURPLE SHIRT,
BROWN JACKET, BROWN SHOES

256
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:26,702
DECEASED

257
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,580
Lee Su-ryeon.

258
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,877
Su-chan.

259
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,968
I did suspect that.

260
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,221
Now that Hui-tae has been taken away,

261
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,390
it should be my turn next.

262
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,687
But Hwang Gi-nam is a threat

263
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,398
to every single person here.

264
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,068
I can't go back home just to save myself.

265
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,737
What about Father?

266
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,324
I'm not asking you
to come back home for good.

267
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,369
But shouldn't you at least go
and see Father once?

268
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,665
If I see him right now,

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,210
I won't be able to leave home again.

270
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,756
Su-ryeon. Now I understand

271
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,508
why you must do this.

272
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,927
But must you really turn your back
on your family?

273
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,430
-In a situation like this--
-All these posters

274
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,433
were put up by people
with missing family members.

275
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,271
Without even knowing
whether they're dead or alive,

276
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,191
they cut out pictures of them
and made these posters.

277
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,327
KIM SUNG-WOOK, 18 YEARS OLD

278
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,789
At least everyone in our family is alive

279
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,457
and we know that.

280
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,210
We should be grateful…

281
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,466
Su-chan.

282
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,980
I heard everything from Su-ryeon.

283
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,193
Judging from how you look,

284
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,071
you must not be sleeping or eating.

285
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,825
Do you think this will make
people praise you for your loyalty?

286
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,619
I can't sleep even if I lay in bed.

287
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,539
And I don't feel hungry.

288
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,457
Don't worry too much.

289
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,169
I doubt even the evil Hwang Gi-nam
could harm his own child.

290
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,506
He would do anything.

291
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,884
Still, they're father and son.

292
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,428
What kind of parent
would kill his own child?

293
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,389
What are you talking about?

294
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,315
You…

295
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,026
Do you have any idea what his father,

296
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,696
Hwang Gi-nam, is like?

297
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,657
I do.

298
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,451
You do?

299
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,041
And you still dated his son?

300
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,460
Hui-tae didn't do anything.

301
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,463
His only fault
is that he's his father's son.

302
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,215
That's precisely the problem.

303
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,345
Do you think he'll be any different
from his savage father?

304
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,389
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

305
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,728
After being stigmatized
all your life yourself,

306
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,565
how could you say the same thing
as Hwang Gi-nam?

307
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,866
Follow me. Come with me to Naju right now.

308
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,493
Let go of me. Let go!

309
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,245
You should stop here.

310
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,498
He's going to ruin your life in the end.

311
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,878
You're the one
who ruined my life, not him.

312
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,720
How could you…

313
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,347
Stop it, both of you!

314
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,349
Stop fighting.

315
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,393
Please stop.

316
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,757
Don't waste your energy.

317
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,677
No one outside can hear you anyway.

318
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,764
The people in this house
will hear me, at least.

319
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,351
Isn't that why you came?

320
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,398
Don't you want to know
what's happening outside?

321
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,235
The martial law army has retreated,

322
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,946
so everyone's celebrating.

323
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,867
They have no idea it means isolation,
not liberation.

324
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,203
Gwangju is now a rat trapped in a cage.

325
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,166
They will slowly bleed to death
unless they surrender.

326
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,918
Just like you.

327
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,722
I finally understand.

328
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,520
My mother said
she'd rather let her lungs rot

329
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,692
than receive treatment with your money.

330
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,112
I think I understand her now.

331
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,585
I don't understand
why both you and the morons outside

332
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,797
are so stupid.

333
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,633
As long as you keep quiet and behave,

334
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,260
you'll be let go sooner or later.

335
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,930
What's the point of being let go?

336
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,225
You'll just lock me up again
when you feel anxious.

337
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,522
That's not the same as being let go.
I'm just on a longer leash.

338
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,025
I'm not your pet dog.

339
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,361
So

340
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,323
stop interfering with my life.

341
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,285
I cannot do that.

342
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,247
I have already paid the price.

343
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,083
That's too bad.

344
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,796
Then I don't think I can go on
playing the good son.

345
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,633
I think I should start with protesting.

346
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,678
I was already arrested before.

347
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,014
The Head of Anti-communist Investigation's
son participates in the protest again.

348
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,017
That would paint a pretty picture.

349
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,646
Or should I go for disguised employment?

350
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,273
Teach students at night…

351
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,570
You should know
when to stop fighting back.

352
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,284
You're not the only person
who can ruin my life.

353
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,829
So stop interfering with my life.

354
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,458
You were an orphan and I took you in.

355
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,252
Yet, you forget your place and act up?

356
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,963
Why am I an orphan

357
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,382
when my father is alive
and well right here?

358
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,851
Don't get the wrong idea.
I chose you to be my son.

359
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,438
If not for my selection,
you are an orphan.

360
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,150
The orphan who begged
for funeral expenses.

361
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,655
The corpses in the street at least
have families to get them.

362
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,699
No one will look for you

363
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,911
as you bleed to death in here.

364
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,539
And then

365
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,043
nothing will happen,

366
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,047
as if you never existed
in the first place.

367
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,592
The orphan

368
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,553
is not me but you.

369
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,019
No one will choose you to be their family.

370
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,652
Sir, there's an emergency call.
You must head back.

371
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,897
Father, when are we going back to Naju?

372
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,621
Should we kidnap Myeong-hee?

373
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,250
You grab her arms, and I'll grab her legs.

374
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,377
Then we could take her back to Naju.

375
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,134
It's no use taking just her body with us.

376
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,220
Her spirit will remain here.

377
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,391
What's with her anyway?

378
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,519
I understand she loves Hui-tae,

379
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,231
but shouldn't her family matter
more to her than anything?

380
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:57,206
Do you know who gave me this watch?

381
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,835
Isn't it something Grandpa
passed down to you?

382
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,545
No.

383
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,298
Actually, it was passed down

384
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,091
to my brother.

385
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,597
Then as he was leaving home,
he passed it down to me

386
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,934
when I was just about your age.

387
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,269
Why did he leave home?

388
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,692
My brother

389
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,820
also had something
that mattered more than his family,

390
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,031
just like your sister.

391
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,244
You never know
what'll happen when you grow up.

392
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,871
You might also find something
that matters more.

393
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,832
I don't think so.

394
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,627
To me, my family
will always matter more than anything.

395
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,300
Goodness. Come here, my boy.

396
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,516
What did you think of Mudeung Stadium?

397
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,019
It was a lot bigger
than the schoolyard, right?

398
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,232
Of course, the schoolyard can't
compare with Mudeung Stadium.

399
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,320
It's the same thing.

400
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,199
Your family, of course, matters to you.

401
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,453
But sometimes, you find things in life

402
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,582
that are much larger and more important,
like Mudeung Stadium.

403
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:30,049
It's not that your sister
doesn't care about her family.

404
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,888
But she can't come home yet
because of something more important.

405
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,270
Here.

406
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,700
Hello?

407
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,536
Jeong-tae, is that you?
It's me, Myeong-su.

408
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,541
Kim Myeong-su. Are you back in Naju?

409
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,378
No. I'm still in Gwangju,
because of my sister.

410
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,504
Your sister?

411
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,339
What about her?

412
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,552
She's waiting for Hui-tae.
She won't step outside the hospital.

413
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,179
So I want to ask you.

414
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,890
Has Hui-tae come home?

415
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,642
Haven't you heard anything?

416
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,565
Hui-tae

417
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,151
might die.

418
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,235
What?

419
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,279
What are you talking about?

420
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,739
My father…

421
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,449
What he did to Hui-tae…

422
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,791
Are you really not going to tell me
who that was?

423
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,293
Hwang Jeong-tae.

424
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,088
Aren't you concerned?

425
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,133
-What?
-There's no sound

426
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,677
coming from the study anymore.

427
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,305
What if Hui-tae is already dead?

428
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,309
If Dad can do this to his favorite son,

429
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,522
who knows if he'll lock me up too
in the future?

430
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,193
That's never going to happen, Jeong-tae.

431
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,863
Your father and Hui-tae
just had a small disagreement, that's all.

432
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,824
Mom.

433
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,952
Can't you let him go?

434
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,830
Dad isn't home right now.

435
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,419
I can't.

436
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,798
Father will let him go
as soon as he calms down.

437
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,967
Don't worry, okay?

438
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,305
I…

439
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,308
I'm going back to the camp.

440
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,396
What? Don't you know
how dangerous it is out there now?

441
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,605
Any place

442
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,359
would be less scary than home.

443
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,929
Wait.

444
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,516
Can I

445
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,518
ask you for a favor?

446
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,942
Please

447
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,904
call the hospital.

448
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,865
If Myeong-hee is still there,

449
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,118
please tell her that I'm safe

450
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,913
and that she should go back to Naju.

451
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,790
I'm sorry

452
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,501
but I can't do that for you.

453
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,758
That look won't do you any good.

454
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:02,720
You already know that
there's nothing I can do in this house.

455
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,848
The only thing I can give you

456
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,976
is just a cup of water.

457
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,398
-You must hate and resent me for that--
-Mother.

458
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,111
I do not resent you.

459
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,615
I never hated you.

460
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,203
I understand how you feel.

461
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,334
I'll ask for something else then.

462
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,715
Take Jeong-tae

463
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,010
and leave this house.

464
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,390
Jeong-tae is still young.

465
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,291
Hey, wake up.

466
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
Wake up, okay?

467
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,211
Pull yourself together.

468
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,379
You moron.

469
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,023
I'll kill

470
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,442
everyone in your family.

471
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,905
Why?

472
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,743
Your grandmother's address is
10-33 Wolhyang-ri, Wolhyang-myeon,

473
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,078
Hampyeong-gun, right?

474
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,496
It's a desolate area.

475
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,666
So it's just perfect
for your ailing mother.

476
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,505
Unless she's there like your father
to look after your grandmother,

477
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,717
no one will know who lives there.

478
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,719
Naturally,

479
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,431
no one will know who dies there.

480
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,528
Jung Hye-gun.

481
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,281
Let's end this quickly.

482
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,367
Isn't it tough on you?

483
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,870
Let's go and see your parents.

484
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,295
Hey, let's say I'm taken
by Defense Security Command.

485
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,840
If I drop your name,
will your father get me out?

486
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,801
Will he?

487
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,224
Give it a go.

488
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,893
The moment you even say
one syllable of my name,

489
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,396
my father will kill you.

490
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,708
Dad.

491
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,712
Hui-tae's dad.

492
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,881
It's me.

493
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,967
Hui-tae's friend Hye-gun.

494
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,435
What is this fool saying?

495
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,981
Sir. Why are you pretending
not to know me?

496
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,066
You said you'd let me off
if I mentioned Hui-tae.

497
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,901
It's me, sir.

498
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,655
I'm Hye-gun, Hui-tae's best friend.

499
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,826
Let go.

500
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,121
Darn you.

501
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,750
Let go of me. Let go, punk.

502
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,171
Darn you. What did you say?

503
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,882
You deserve to die.

504
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,927
How dare you threaten me?

505
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,014
Who said you could say that to me?

506
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,224
Just die.

507
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,144
Die already. Just die.

508
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,461
Dr. Yoo was discharged.

509
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,713
His family came and took him home.

510
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,006
-Goodness, he went home?
-Yes.

511
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,968
That's great.
I was worried he was badly hurt.

512
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,851
Hey.

513
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,021
Does Mr. Hwang have no family?

514
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,983
Pardon?

515
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:12,404
I mean, he went missing
but no one is asking or looking for him.

516
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,698
Does he have no one else?

517
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,161
The militia got us medical supplies.

518
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,705
If you need anything for the ER,
come and get it.

519
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,999
-That is just great.
-It is.

520
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,085
I'll go and get it.

521
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,209
I look forward to May every year.

522
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,469
Why are you working on your own
and tiring yourself out?

523
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,815
You see, sir, I left my spot
only to go to the toilet, but…

524
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,248
It was you.

525
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,130
You did it.

526
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,759
Jeong-tae, go to your room.

527
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,848
Hwang Jeong-tae, go, now.

528
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,988
No, don't get up.

529
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,077
My goodness.

530
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,015
REGULAR SAVINGS ACCOUNT
KIM HYEON-CHEOL

531
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,019
That's the money I saved
to send Myeong-hee to college.

532
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,856
And I also saved the money
she sent me all this time.

533
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,151
I know it's not much,

534
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,612
but it'll be enough
to get you two settled.

535
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,492
You should give this
to Myeong-hee yourself--

536
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,953
No need. You can hold onto it.

537
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,207
Myeong-hee will just throw a fit
and refuse to take it.

538
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,419
Now, this money

539
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,463
belongs to you both anyway.

540
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,636
Father.

541
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,437
Also…

542
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,779
Can you give this to her too?

543
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,079
Although

544
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,750
she met a lousy father like me
and suffered all her life,

545
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,464
she is truly

546
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,842
a precious child.

547
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,514
I hope you both forget
about the tragic past

548
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,186
and cherish each other and live happily.

549
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,939
We will.

550
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,946
Kim Myeong-su.

551
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,116
Are you upset because of your sister?

552
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,495
Whatever.

553
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,839
Have some of these.

554
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,175
-My gosh. Thank you.
-No problem.

555
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,885
You should thank her.

556
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,180
Okay. Go on and eat it.

557
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,810
Here. You can have the big one.

558
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,105
Go on. I already ate.

559
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,337
BLOOD DONATION

560
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,097
Dad.

561
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,392
I think I understand now.

562
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,439
Something as large and important
as Mudeung Stadium.

563
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,651
What did you say?

564
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,616
I like these rice balls.

565
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,785
What?

566
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,919
I'm glad you're here.

567
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,755
They already searched
this place last time,

568
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,256
so it'll be safe for the time being.

569
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,176
We'll just stay
until the lockdown is over.

570
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,805
-This is…
-Right.

571
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,141
Hello, I'm Hwang Hui-tae.

572
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,686
So is this…

573
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,023
Yes, the one in the banner.

574
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:55,320
Is he the reason you mentioned last time?

575
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,780
"Reason?"

576
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,075
Father, let's go inside.

577
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,005
Can you really walk?

578
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,132
It's quite far, you know.

579
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,428
We always used to walk
before there were buses.

580
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,350
I've marked the inspection points

581
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,477
guarded by the soldiers.

582
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,813
So please be careful.

583
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,149
Thank you.
It was a safe trip thanks to you.

584
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,360
Myeong-su.

585
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,612
Here.

586
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,366
Thank you.

587
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,539
Take care then. Let's go.

588
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,751
Be careful, sir!

589
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,802
Are you really not going to look?

590
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,514
Don't you want to know
what's inside the envelope?

591
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,726
I don't want to know.
Stop talking and face forward.

592
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,231
Gosh, you're truly blessed.
You're blessed with love.

593
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:17,652
If only I had a father like that,
I'd be the happiest guy on earth.

594
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,656
You're so spoiled, you know that?

595
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,619
Children who were raised in happy families
always turn out to be spoiled.

596
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,922
Why aren't you saying anything?

597
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,724
Even you aren't reacting to my jokes now.

598
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,976
I don't have anyone left
in this world anymore.

599
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,102
Don't…

600
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,482
Don't ever say that again.

601
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,568
What?

602
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,987
Don't say you don't have anyone left.

603
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,907
Don't say it anymore.

604
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,827
I mean…

605
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:13,083
It's just that
you weren't saying anything,

606
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,668
so I was just joking.

607
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,505
Are you mad?

608
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,341
Yes, I'm mad because you said that.

609
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,552
The entire time I was waiting for you,

610
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,930
I kept thinking
of the things you said to me.

611
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,517
You said I have Myeong-su and my parents

612
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,936
but

613
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,314
you don't have anyone
beside you except for me.

614
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,276
-That was--
-The more I thought about it,

615
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,028
the angrier it made me.

616
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,573
You made it sound like I'll be okay
even if I don't have you.

617
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,661
-Myeong-hee.
-I'm not okay.

618
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,456
If I lose you,

619
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,544
I don't have anything left either.

620
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,709
Myeong-hee.

621
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:42,464
After my mother passed away,
do you know what I feared the most?

622
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,137
Blood. Being in pain.

623
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,976
Since I had no one left
to take care of me,

624
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,563
I was worried
I might die alone and in pain.

625
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,942
And I was worried
no one would notice even if I died.

626
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,948
That's why I went to live
with my father's family.

627
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,911
Even if they weren't my real family,

628
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,289
I thought it'd be better than being alone.

629
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,964
But now, I don't need a family.

630
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,759
I have you.

631
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,109
I'll…

632
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,739
I'll be your family.

633
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,580
Let's get married.

634
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,588
Where is it?

635
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,967
Are we on the right path?

636
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,344
Dad, are you sure we're on the right path?

637
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:14,472
-I don't think this is the one on the map.
-You think so?

638
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,392
That can't be right.
This has to be the right path.

639
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,768
Let me see.

640
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,603
Can you even read maps?

641
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,524
Come on.
I'm at least better at it than you.

642
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,359
From here…

643
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,696
This is…

644
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,872
-That way!
-Hurry!

645
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,960
You go that way!

646
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,336
Go that way!

647
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,546
Turn off the flashlight.

648
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,631
Gosh.

649
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,009
Let's hide over there.

650
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,889
Hurry!

651
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,015
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

652
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,060
-Dad.
-Quiet.

653
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,731
There's no one here, sir.

654
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,359
It's clear here too.

655
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,034
-Search thoroughly!
-Yes, sir.

656
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,330
It's clear here.

657
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,167
-Search everywhere!
-Yes, sir.

658
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,045
Myeong-su.

659
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,381
I'll go and talk to them.

660
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,635
Stay here

661
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,763
and keep your eyes closed.

662
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,140
-No, Dad.
-Keep it down.

663
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,145
Where did the punk go?

664
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,108
Son, listen.

665
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,657
Until I come back,

666
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,952
no matter what you hear,

667
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,705
never come out.

668
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,124
Do you understand?
