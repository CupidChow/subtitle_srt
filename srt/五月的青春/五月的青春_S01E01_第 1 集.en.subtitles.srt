1
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,716
Hey! Can you go see what's in there?

2
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,844
My goodness.

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,513
What if we find
some prehistoric artifacts?

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,525
What the…

5
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,985
What is this?

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,361
Gosh!

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,697
Captain!

8
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,324
Captain!

9
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,887
UNIDENTIFIED SKELETON FOUND
AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE

10
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,140
The police are investigating
an unidentified skeleton

11
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,727
found at a construction site
in Gwangju this morning.

12
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,189
The police have sent the skeleton
to the National Forensic Service

13
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,900
for DNA analysis in order to
identify the victim.

14
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,487
The construction workers at the site
have stated that they found the skeleton

15
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,573
at about 1m below the ground
while digging the ground

16
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,784
with an excavator at around 10 a.m.
They called the police right away,

17
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,996
and the police have sent
the skeleton to the NFS.

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,083
Those in the political circles are saying

19
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,962
the skeleton may belong to
one of the victims of the Gwangju Uprising

20
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,465
and that the blood sample may need to be
compared with the families of those

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,051
who disappeared
during the Gwangju Uprising.

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,972
Meanwhile, the NFS says it will take
a while to get the analysis results

23
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:23,643
as it will be difficult to determine
the identification and the cause of death

24
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,729
because the skeleton was buried
for such a long time.

25
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,733
The train is arriving.

26
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,216
Resign!

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
-Government-funded professors!
-Resign!

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,596
End the emergency martial law!

29
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,598
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,600
Government-funded professors must resign!

31
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,727
-Resign!
-Resign!

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,395
-What's going on?
-What's that?

33
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,319
-Who's that?
-What's going on?

34
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,279
-Goodness.
-What's he doing?

35
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,576
-My gosh.
-Look at that.

36
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,953
-What's he doing here?
-What's his deal?

37
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,331
-What's he doing?
-Who is he?

38
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,750
-Jeez.
-What's he doing?

39
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,085
-Who is he?
-Let him pass.

40
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,631
-My gosh.
-Just let him pass.

41
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
-Why is he staring at us?
-What's his deal?

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,635
-Who is he?
-Goodness.

43
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,595
-Look at that.
-Just let him pass.

44
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,639
-It's no big deal.
-Why is he staring at us?

45
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,228
-Did he just honk at us?
-What was that?

46
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,438
-He'll run us over with his car.
-Let him pass.

47
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,191
-What's he doing?
-Just let him pass.

48
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,451
RELEASE THE WRONGFULLY
IMPRISONED STUDENTS!

49
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,144
Good day.

50
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,448
What a jerk!

51
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,159
Hey, aren't you shameful?

52
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,371
You never showed up when we were
campaigning to save Gyeong-su.

53
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,540
How dare you set foot in here?

54
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,084
KIM GYEONG-SU

55
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,964
Because we have to
pay back our debt together.

56
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,134
Let's say that we stood joint surety.

57
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,387
Hold on.

58
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,724
I didn't know you cared so much
about Gyeong-su.

59
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,393
Were you two close?

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,317
Hey, get lost.

61
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,402
I don't want to talk to a jerk like you.

62
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,655
But then again, what do you expect?

63
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,492
Med students aren't real college students,
you know?

64
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,537
Jerks like you say that
you're studying to save lives

65
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,916
but in fact, you don't care a thing
about people dying on the streets.

66
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,588
What are med students then?
Are they in middle school?

67
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:26,928
Right, so just study like you always do
and play the guitar or something.

68
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,056
Selfish fence-sitters like you
shouldn't come here.

69
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,104
My gosh. What are you doing here then?

70
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,190
You never protested
and got a job right away.

71
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,609
That reminds me.

72
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,863
Tell your newspaper company that
you guys should make Molotov cocktails.

73
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,865
I think you make
quite good Molotov cocktails.

74
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,412
You jerk!

75
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,417
-Let's get married.
-Get married?

76
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,088
With who? Me?

77
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,422
We broke up.

78
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,216
Right, I did say we should break up.

79
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,385
But that doesn't mean I let you go.

80
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,595
What does that mean?

81
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,097
I was just testing you.

82
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,892
I asked you out on our first date
and for all other dates.

83
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,477
You only hold my hand when I tell you to.

84
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,730
I was wondering whether
you actually had feelings for me or not.

85
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,777
So? What's your conclusion?

86
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,112
Let's get married.

87
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,364
My family will take care of everything.

88
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,824
You can just move in with me.

89
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,119
My dad will pay for our living expenses
until you open your own clinic,

90
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,913
-if you finish an internship--
-I won't do an internship.

91
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,039
What?

92
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,624
Why not?

93
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,961
Don't tell me it's because of Gyeong-su.

94
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,298
Do you suddenly want to rebel
against society and the system?

95
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,133
-No, it's not that.
-Then what is it?

96
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,926
You graduated top of your class.

97
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,304
-I haven't graduated yet.
-What?

98
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,639
Why not?

99
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,559
Because I want to participate
in the University Song Festival!

100
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,810
I won't be eligible once I graduate.

101
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,480
Then what about me?

102
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,357
You? What about you?

103
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
Do you want to be a singer too?

104
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,742
No. I want to get married.

105
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,703
I need a husband who's a doctor,
not a singer.

106
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,962
Yoo-jin, then let's do this.

107
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,635
I'll pick out a few great men
among my med school friends.

108
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,637
-You crazy jerk!
-They'll marry you. For real!

109
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,347
GREEN MEAL

110
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,848
The bill has been paid in full.

111
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,142
And

112
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,853
I had some change left over,
so I bought this.

113
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,149
You didn't have to. Just a moment please.

114
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,403
Yes, Jang Seok-chul.

115
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,032
Gosh, Yoo-jin's got a stronger punch
than Injae does.

116
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,701
Yes, okay.

117
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,996
I confirmed it.

118
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,084
You paid the bill,
so you should see the patient.

119
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,715
-But the visiting hours are over.
-You always come after hours.

120
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,343
Go see him quickly.

121
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,035
No.

122
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,745
No…

123
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,163
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

124
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,704
She's turned a corner,

125
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,874
but we're not certain
when her condition will worsen.

126
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,668
I'm sorry to say this,

127
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,548
but I think you should start
preparing to say goodbye.

128
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,725
Seok-chul.

129
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,478
Are you awake?

130
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,610
Home…

131
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,532
Home…

132
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,330
I want to go home…

133
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,887
Let's go.

134
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,265
Let's go home.

135
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,526
-I won.
-No, you didn't.

136
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,530
That hurts.

137
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,115
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

138
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,786
Dried squid, peanuts, and eggs for sale.

139
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,456
Mr. Soldier!

140
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,417
It's me again, Hui-tae.

141
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,255
Do you know how many times I wrote to you?

142
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,590
How could you not call
or write to me once?

143
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,303
Don't tell me you were
dragged to Namsan or something.

144
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,681
Get into your positions!

145
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,976
How does it feel to be a member of
the military that you hated so much?

146
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,853
Anyone who lets them by, you're dead meat!

147
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,231
Well, you're always well-known
for your excessive loyalty,

148
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,024
so I'm sure you're settling in fine.

149
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,901
-Hold it up properly.
-Team C, let's go!

150
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,951
Don't tell me you're still upset
because of what happened that day.

151
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,619
Stand straight, you fool!

152
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,874
If that's the case, let's call it even
because my life is also pretty messed up

153
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,459
thanks to you.

154
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,047
I'm trying my best to untangle this mess.

155
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,926
I'm not sure how,
but I'll do everything in my power.

156
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,472
So please write me back.

157
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,577
His stomach was pierced by
some construction material.

158
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,413
They tried pulling it out,
so he's bleeding really badly.

159
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,929
Go get Doctor Kim. Now.

160
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,972
What? Okay.

161
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,977
Sir, I'll press down on the wound.
It's going to hurt a little bit.

162
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,392
Gosh, is it just now lunchtime?

163
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,019
It looks like we'll have to
work overtime again tonight.

164
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,856
This is all because of that brat,
Kim Myeong-hee.

165
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,026
What use is it
if we request extra personnel?

166
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,154
She keeps working until broad daylight
when she's on night shifts.

167
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,823
That's why the higher-ups think
that's natural.

168
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,450
Gosh. Darn it! That stubborn brat.

169
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,411
Why does she work so hard though?

170
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,164
It doesn't seem like she cares about
what others think of her.

171
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,292
What do you think?
It's because of the money.

172
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,629
What on earth can she possibly do
with some few extra bucks?

173
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,051
Are you here to see a friend?

174
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,470
Thank you very much!

175
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,765
I'm here.

176
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,517
Gwangju.

177
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,815
HOST OF 19TH SOUTH JEOLLA PROVINCE
ATHLETIC MEET AND

178
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,859
61ST PRELIMINARIES OF THE
NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL

179
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,917
RECEPTION

180
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,002
Where is the Deputy Director's office?

181
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,170
Hey!

182
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,339
What will you do about this?

183
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,718
If you hold this for a while…

184
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,971
Pull it out and just stick it in again.

185
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:39,271
Come on, stick it in somewhere else.

186
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,613
Okay.

187
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,914
Gosh, what are you doing?
Are you caressing me or what?

188
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,253
-Move, I'll do it.
-Okay.

189
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,925
Hey, little lady.
I never asked for your help.

190
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,551
You can leave.

191
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,805
What else do you expect
in an emergency room?

192
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,516
You little… Hey, you.

193
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,605
You darned brat.

194
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,942
Hey. Do you know who I am?

195
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,152
I do.

196
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,531
You're a patient.

197
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,157
Let go of me!

198
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,953
PATIENT, JANG SEOK-CHUL

199
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,374
Gosh.

200
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,504
I think it would be better to stay there
for both you and the patient's sake.

201
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,091
It's not easy to transfer a coma patient
from Seoul to Gwangju either.

202
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,301
To be frank,
it'll cost you a lot of money.

203
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,553
Do you have that much money?

204
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,888
If you give the approval,
I promise to get the money.

205
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,351
You seem like a student, and you're
going about things in the wrong order.

206
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,645
We don't make empty promises.
We only take cash.

207
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,314
-Come back when you have the money.
-It's not an empty promise.

208
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,568
-The patient is in need of urgent care--
-I'm glad you mentioned that.

209
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,779
Our hospital is in need of urgent money.
Goodbye, then.

210
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,740
But…

211
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,367
Sir.

212
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,996
This patient was born in Gwangju.

213
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,957
Going back home
might be his last dying wish.

214
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,669
-I think he should spend--
-Get out of my way!

215
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,258
-My gosh, Sang-gon. What is going on?
-Byeong-geol.

216
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,094
Fire this brat now.

217
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:39,058
What kind of nurse
assaults a sick patient in this world?

218
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,226
Hey, I'm not saying this
because he's a friend.

219
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,605
How can a medical worker
assault a patient? Apologize to him.

220
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,065
Now you're treating me
like a medical worker?

221
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,900
What?

222
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,152
You pretended not to see anything

223
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,404
when a young nurse
was being sexually harassed.

224
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,739
But now that I react,

225
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,991
you're suddenly mentioning
my duties as a nurse?

226
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,368
Who are you to talk back to him like that?

227
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,369
Wait, she's…

228
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,291
My goodness.

229
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,251
My gosh, Sang-gon. Are you okay?

230
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,295
What do you think
you're doing in my office?

231
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,548
It was self-defense.
Since you weren't helping me.

232
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,133
What's that attitude
after making this mess?

233
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,260
I'm not the one who made this mess.

234
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,678
What? Hey…

235
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,682
Hey, is anyone out there? Take her out!

236
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,226
My goodness.

237
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,145
Can you help him?

238
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,358
That cheeky wench!
How dare she yell at me?

239
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,984
So, about the transfer…

240
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,071
Get out. Get out now!

241
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,618
Hey. Go check over there.

242
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,453
-Let's split up and search.
-Yes, sir.

243
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,424
I don't know
if these will last another year.

244
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,680
Hey, little lady.

245
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,184
Are you on your way home?

246
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,062
Goodness, does that line still work?

247
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,773
Of course. This line has never failed.

248
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,817
Were you busy getting chased again?

249
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,611
How do you have so much energy?

250
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,529
Let's go. No time for chit-chat.

251
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,073
What are you talking about?
I just got off work.

252
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,909
Come on. We don't have time for this.

253
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,244
Hey, I even got a nosebleed!

254
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,707
Hurry up and ring the doorbell.
My father will be coming out any minute.

255
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,085
So why do you keep sneaking out
like a cat in heat?

256
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,004
Just go in and beg for his forgiveness.

257
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,928
Who is it?

258
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,017
Hello. It's Myeong-hee, Su-ryeon's friend.

259
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,233
You go this way,
and I'll go this way, okay?

260
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,663
Well, I'm here because Su-ryeon called me
and asked me to come over.

261
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,872
She called you?

262
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,085
She's been sick in bed
since yesterday evening.

263
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,339
She must've woken up for a bit
this morning.

264
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,967
She called me around 5 a.m.

265
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,761
Around 5 a.m.,
I was already up and working.

266
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,555
Wait. That's wrong.

267
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,808
It was 4 a.m. It was around 4 a.m.

268
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,519
I see. Come on in.

269
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,920
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

270
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,058
Hold on. Is that you, Myeong-hee?

271
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,024
Mr. Lee. How have you been?

272
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,484
I've been good.
Are you here to see Su-ryeon?

273
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,239
Don't tell me she's still sleeping.

274
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,493
She told me not to wake her up
under any circumstances.

275
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,288
What? I can't believe that brat.

276
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,581
Lee Su-ryeon!

277
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,125
Lee Su-ryeon!

278
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,381
My goodness. Lee Su-ryeon!

279
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,551
-Gosh. It's Dad.
-Lee Su-ryeon!

280
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,349
Lee Su-ryeon!

281
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,395
She must've completely passed out.

282
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,439
Lee Su-ryeon!

283
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,193
-What should I do?
-Lee Su-ryeon!

284
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,530
Lee Su-ryeon!

285
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,330
Lee Su-ryeon!

286
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,942
What time is it? I slept like a log.

287
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,072
Why are you soaked in sweat?

288
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,074
What?

289
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,911
You have the chills.

290
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,540
Well, I must be coming down
with something.

291
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,084
Gosh, I have the chills.

292
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,629
We had to meet up with a wanted
person last night,

293
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,298
and I was the only one they could trust.

294
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,801
What's happening today?

295
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,761
Today is even more important.

296
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,847
We're going to give speeches
in the evening

297
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,473
and print out flyers at night.

298
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,604
I bet within a couple of weeks,
all your hair will be shaved off.

299
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,652
This is the least I can do to
deserve to be called "Joan of Arc."

300
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,237
What does that even mean?

301
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,115
Do you need a license
to protest these days?

302
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,661
If only there were a license,
I'd go and get one.

303
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,872
Whatever I do,

304
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,625
I'll always be my father's daughter.

305
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,755
Having guilt by association is nonsense.

306
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,592
Your father being a capitalist
doesn't make you a hypocrite.

307
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,345
Anyway, I'll go wash up.

308
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,431
STATEMENT DEMANDING DEMOCRATIZATION
OF UNIVERSITIES

309
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,434
Give it a read, okay?

310
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,395
What are you talking about?

311
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,231
I said I worked all night!

312
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,424
My. When did you get here?

313
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,405
I don't think it needs any corrections.

314
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,796
-Su-chan, is that you?
-Myeong-hee?

315
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,841
Goodness, how long has it been?

316
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,970
You've become a real lady.

317
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,764
Su-chan!

318
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,686
What happened?

319
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,938
I thought you were coming back next month.

320
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,357
Are you back in Korea for good?

321
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,484
Yes, it seems so.

322
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,115
A dress?

323
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,368
I never wear these.
Why do you keep getting them for me?

324
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,120
My dressing room is already packed.

325
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,247
Why else? I want you to wear them.

326
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,833
Stop dressing like a North Korean soldier.

327
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,793
What are you talking about?

328
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,005
By the way, if I'd known I'd run into you,

329
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,507
I would've gotten something for you too,
Myeong-hee.

330
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,969
What? Don't worry. That's unnecessary.

331
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,263
Myeong-hee,

332
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,724
you could ask him to get you

333
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,143
those foreign books
when he goes on business trips.

334
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,186
-Hey.
-What?

335
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,773
Su-chan, Myeong-hee is preparing
to study abroad.

336
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,443
-What? Really?
-Yes.

337
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,696
That's impressive.
You're working too, right?

338
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,698
It's just my dream.

339
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,534
I haven't been accepted to
any schools yet.

340
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,120
And I haven't saved up enough either.

341
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,957
If you'd cut back on the money
you send home for the kid,

342
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,002
you would've studied abroad
a dozen times already.

343
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,546
It's not my kid.

344
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:15,800
I have a little brother,
and he's still very young.

345
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,928
You couldn't pretend
that you don't care, could you?

346
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,930
You must be the pillar of your family.

347
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,727
Do you see this, Su-ryeon?

348
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,480
You'll never understand
how firstborns like us feel.

349
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,815
"First-borns like us?"

350
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,361
Goodness. Myeong-hee,
you're still so young for yourself.

351
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,155
It must be hard being a grown-up.

352
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,335
It was really nice seeing you today.

353
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,879
Call me if you need anything
while preparing for your studies.

354
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,714
Okay. Thank you.

355
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,139
Well. Is it really okay if I call you?

356
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,141
When I want to ask you something, I mean.

357
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,229
Yes, of course.

358
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,940
I started a company recently.

359
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,652
Call me at this number if I'm not home.

360
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,154
CHANGHWA PHARMACEUTICALS
LEE SU-CHAN

361
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,241
You're the first person
to receive my business card.

362
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,119
Thank you.

363
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,122
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

364
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,711
-Bye.
-Take care.

365
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,965
Hey, get down.

366
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,010
Go.

367
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,225
-Hey, Kim Myeong-hee, come here.
-Come here.

368
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,978
-Come on here.
-What is it?

369
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,732
What's going on?

370
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,276
Tell us the truth, Myeong-hee.

371
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,237
You were with a guy, and judging
from his car, he must be a bourgeois.

372
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,074
Gosh, it's not like that.

373
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,909
"It's not like that?"

374
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,120
What does she mean?

375
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,457
Why did you call me here?

376
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,917
I'm about to pass out. Make it quick.

377
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,878
Gosh, can you believe the way she talks?

378
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,046
Let's see what you're going to say
when you see this.

379
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,548
What is it?

380
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,427
Did you get a draft notice?

381
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,721
See for yourself.

382
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,163
-Congratulations!
-You got in!

383
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,172
My gosh, is this real?

384
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,757
Guys, is this a prank?

385
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,802
Come on! It's real,
all the way from Germany.

386
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,347
I went to the post office every morning
to pick this up for you.

387
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,558
I don't have time for this.

388
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,018
Hey, I have to go.

389
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:15,814
-Where are you going? We should celebrate!
-I should go tell the Father.

390
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,106
-My gosh.
-Bye!

391
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,674
What? Hwang Hui-tae!

392
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,300
How have you been?

393
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,187
Good job.

394
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,939
I'm proud of you.

395
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,318
Have you decided
when you're going to enroll?

396
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,487
Not any time soon.

397
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,781
I have to apply for a passport

398
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,033
and save up more money.

399
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,292
You see, I got a call
from the Bishops' Conference.

400
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,545
They're giving a scholarship
to just one person this year.

401
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,089
A scholarship?

402
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,467
Yes. I was going to recommend you,

403
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,220
but I was afraid
I was getting ahead of myself.

404
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,056
And you brought me this good news today.

405
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,435
It's the Lord's will.

406
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,021
That would really help me.

407
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,023
But there's one condition.

408
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,859
You must leave the country in a month.

409
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,069
In a month?

410
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,947
It's too soon, right?

411
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,409
Flights are expensive too.

412
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,746
You can try again next year if you want.

413
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,083
No. Please recommend me.

414
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,377
I'll prepare the money somehow.

415
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,588
All right. That sounds good.

416
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,132
Hold on.

417
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,968
Shouldn't you call your family?
Tell them the good news.

418
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,765
Call them immediately.

419
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,517
That's my condition for recommending you.

420
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,366
The preliminaries will be completely
different from the school races.

421
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,828
The fastest runners
from all over the province will be there.

422
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,665
The winner can even enter
the National Sports Festival.

423
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,291
Is that right?

424
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,379
Mom, Myeong-su might even compete
in the Olympics at this rate.

425
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,800
But no one in the whole world can
run faster than Hyeon-cheol.

426
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,469
What? Dad?

427
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,389
Grandma, you're being silly again.

428
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,316
Hold on. The phone is ringing.

429
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,610
Here.

430
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,493
Hello?

431
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,927
Myeong-su, answer the phone.
It's your sister.

432
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,262
It's Myeong-hee?

433
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,681
Hello?

434
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,059
Goodness. I'm not deaf.

435
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,771
What are you so excited about,
little bear?

436
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,191
Myeong-hee, I'm entering a race
in Gwangju next week!

437
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,359
Can you come?

438
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,278
I'll be there if I'm off duty.

439
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,280
Hey, Myeong-su.

440
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,991
Can I talk to Mother?

441
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,702
I won't let you talk to her
unless you promise you'll come.

442
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,996
-Move.
-Mom!

443
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,915
Hi, Myeong-hee. What's the matter?

444
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,837
What? Really?

445
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,175
That's great.

446
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,803
But how are you going to afford it?

447
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,723
I'll ask your father…

448
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,061
You don't want me to tell him?

449
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,812
All right.

450
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,067
I didn't call to ask for help.

451
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,821
My son is innocent!

452
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,573
Who are you taking away now?

453
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,201
-There she goes again.
-Take me instead!

454
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,536
-I'm hanging up.
-Take me!

455
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,456
My son is innocent!

456
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,085
-You little…
-Mother!

457
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,254
-You can't do this!
-Mother, calm down.

458
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,257
-You can't take him away!
-Mother!

459
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,219
Hwang Gi-nam, you jerk!

460
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,607
If only you remembered that sooner.

461
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,902
We could've saved each other
so much trouble.

462
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,153
Sir.

463
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,490
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,284
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

465
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,169
Finish it up.

466
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,424
As the opposition party requested
for the resignation of the Yushin regime

467
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,636
and the introduction of
the single-member district system,

468
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,598
the security commander
commented that it is time

469
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:47,353
that the parties worked together
for an advanced political system.

470
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,813
My goodness.

471
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,023
By overcoming crises inside
and outside the country,

472
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,775
political development…

473
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,777
At this rate,

474
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,906
they'll even kick out all the dogs
that were kept during the Yushin regime.

475
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,034
A scared dog barks first.

476
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,496
All they do is bark but never bite.

477
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,959
What if we relax thinking
it's a scared dog,

478
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,421
but it turns out to be a crazy dog?

479
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,757
In these turbulent times,

480
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,095
you should find someone
who can have your back.

481
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,850
I will be fine
as long as I have you on my side.

482
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,310
What I mean is,

483
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,188
you need a lifeboat you can hop into
when you're in a pinch.

484
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,989
Thanks.

485
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,786
You already have an excellent card
in your hand. Why look further?

486
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,289
You know what's the surest way
to form an alliance?

487
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,169
Your son is of an age to marry, isn't he?

488
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,881
I'll lead you to water.

489
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,051
Try and catch the fish yourself.

490
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,511
Of course.

491
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,805
Thank you, sir.

492
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,275
NATIONAL NEW COMMUNITY MOVEMENT
LEADERS SUMMIT

493
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,573
Are you getting in or not?

494
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,033
I am.

495
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,547
Dear student democracy activists.

496
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:44,679
Punishing the remaining powers on campus
should go beyond opportunism.

497
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,683
We should all be
the guillotines of history.

498
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,019
We must expel
all government-funded professors,

499
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,646
who have lived as parasites
of the Yushin dictatorship

500
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,231
from our sacred campus!

501
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,817
-Yes!
-Yes!

502
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,320
Expel government-funded professors!

503
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,740
-Expel government-funded professors!
-Expel government-funded professors!

504
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,785
-Expel government-funded professors!
-Expel government-funded professors!

505
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,204
"Jang Seok-chul?"

506
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,540
That's a girl's name?

507
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,710
Yes. She's 24 years old.

508
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,879
Would it be possible?

509
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,093
He's the most resourceful member
of the student council.

510
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,804
He's better than most
private detectives, right?

511
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,934
This is not much to go on,
but I'll ask around.

512
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,603
Thanks.

513
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,646
No problem.

514
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,940
-Hey, Jung Hye-gun.
-Hey.

515
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,608
Did you prepare the sample?

516
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,820
It's tonight.

517
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,741
Well, I brought the sample here.

518
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,993
But I'm afraid I can't go with you
to print them.

519
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,287
A friend is visiting from Seoul
for the first time in years.

520
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,414
A friend?

521
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,169
This place isn't open to just anyone.

522
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
Can we trust you?

523
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,593
If you can't,
are you going to torture me or something?

524
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,890
Well, as long as we confirm your identity,
we can use all the help we can get.

525
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,351
Gosh, I'd rather be tortured.

526
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,313
Come on. If you came all the way here,

527
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,982
isn't it because you're interested in
what we're doing?

528
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,485
No. I just came to drink.

529
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,075
Let's go.

530
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,826
Hey. Wait a minute.

531
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,246
Sorry. I can't help you.
I'll see you at the rally.

532
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,212
Who on earth is that random jerk?

533
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,384
-What?
-You tell her!

534
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,386
Why should I? You go…

535
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,678
Go tell her.

536
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,060
Well.

537
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,356
-Myeong-hee.
-Yes?

538
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,775
Do you know what day it is?

539
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,695
The rent.

540
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,241
I forgot. I'll give it to you right away.

541
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,077
Also, since we're on that subject…

542
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,380
Jin-a will stop taking private lessons
from you now.

543
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,258
Gosh, her grades aren't improving at all.

544
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,679
Then what about the rent?

545
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,975
You can pay me the original rent
starting next month.

546
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,230
Gosh, why is it so dusty in here?
Look at this dust.

Call me if you need anything

553
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,465
You've taken good care of it.

554
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,052
Gosh, this place is already too cluttered.

555
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,471
That thing is such a nuisance,
so you can have it.

556
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,806
I wonder how much I can sell this for.

557
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,313
Do you gamble?
You'll sell your mother's last belonging?

558
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,984
Something's wrong, right?

559
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,611
It's strange.

560
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,197
You're suddenly talking about money
out of the blue.

561
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,242
And you always hated staying with me here,
but you suddenly dropped by like this.

562
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,869
It's just because my father
doesn't know I'm here.

563
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,663
That's what's the strangest.

564
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,415
You never came to Gwangju
unless your father called you.

565
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,126
I told you I have some business here.

566
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,672
I know, so what is that business?

567
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,133
-Something at the hospital.
-Come on.

568
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,263
Seoul is packed with hospitals.
Why does it have to be one in Gwangju?

569
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,557
Hwang Hui-tae.

570
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,728
You have a girl in Gwangju, don't you?

571
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,564
Sort of. Are you satisfied?

572
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,148
Turn off the light.

573
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,234
"Sort of?"

574
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,824
-There really is someone.
-My goodness.

575
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,076
-Who is it? Tell me.
-Darn it.

576
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,432

Darn it.

580
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,508
Hey! This way.

581
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,144
-Get them!
-Hey!

582
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,605
-Stop!
-Come here!

583
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,566
-Get them!
-Go after them!

584
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,986
Come here!

585
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,532
Hui-tae. Get up.

586
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,034
Hey, Hwang Hui-tae.

587
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,786
What is it?

588
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,416
What…

589
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,131
Dad.

590
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,196
Good morning.

591
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,162
-Hui-tae?
-Yes.

592
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,748
What brings you to Gwangju?

593
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,962
What is it?

594
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,589
Why are you here?

595
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,008
Hey, Jeong-tae. It's good to see you too.

596
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,260
Hey, don't be rude to your brother.

597
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,770
Bring it if you're done writing.

598
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,896
Okay.

599
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,609
"So due to the curfew,
I couldn't go to an inn

600
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,071
and ended up
falling asleep at that house."

601
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,909
"Eventually, at precisely 5 a.m.,

602
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,955
you found me and dragged me back

603
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,498
to where I am now."

604
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,418
That's all.

605
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,505
Why aren't you working as an intern?

606
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,633
How did you know that?

607
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,053
Are you tailing me?

608
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,596
Don't joke around.

609
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,974
I'm asking why you're not working
at the hospital.

610
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
I didn't graduate.

611
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,650
I thought it would be better
than getting expelled.

612
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,538
I waited six years
to see this flower bloom.

613
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,543
I turned on the heater in winter
just for this flower in this empty room.

614
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,506
I raised it with the utmost care,
but bugs started living inside it.

615
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,634
I was worried the pesticide
might harm the flower,

616
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,387
so I even diluted it with water.

617
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,389
But the insects
eventually hatched eggs inside it.

618
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,020
No matter how precious it is,

619
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,689
if the roots have been eaten away,

620
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,406
it's nothing more
than a host of parasites.

621
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:35,746
I only accepted you as my son
because I believed you would prove useful.

622
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,500
Instead of becoming a host of parasites.

623
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,129
So…

624
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,634
How much have you been eaten away?

625
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,106
Dad,

626
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,942
I need money.

627
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,527
What?

628
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,239
I need money to sort out a situation
that I created.

629
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,619
If you help me out
without asking any questions,

630
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:19,331
I'll do whatever you tell me to do
without asking any questions from now on.

631
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,336
Whatever I tell you to do?

632
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,218
Lee Su-ryeon, come out.

633
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,605
What about the others?

634
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,274
I had this sensation
in the back of my head.

635
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,277
My sense of smell and hearing…

636
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,905
All my senses were telling me,

637
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,157
"It's that way."

638
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,867
Let go of me.

639
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,496
I said, let go!
Why am I the only one being released?

640
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,498
Hey, stop right there.

641
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,712
What's going on here?

642
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,965
Why are you letting her go
after all my hard work?

643
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,217
Exactly.

644
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,387
What are you doing? Put me back in.

645
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,472
Put me back in right now.

646
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,349
What on earth is going on?

647
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,059
Come on.

648
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,313
What are you all doing?

649
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,066
Chief, you came at the right time.

650
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,818
The senior inspector
is releasing the trespasser

651
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,488
that I had so much trouble
in catching red-handed--

652
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,908
Watch your language.

653
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,412
She was just visiting a factory
owned by her father.

654
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,706
How is that trespassing?

655
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,874
Pardon?

656
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,296
A factory owned by her father?

657
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,468
Then release the others too.

658
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,554
They were just visiting like I was.

659
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,390
That's enough.

660
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,606
Unbelievable.

661
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,485
You brought the whole gang
to my factory now?

662
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,863
I know I spoiled you raising you alone,
but this is just too much.

663
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,656
I never asked you to get me out.

664
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,367
I can take care of myself.

665
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,703
You can take care of yourself? How?

666
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,580
By going to prison?

667
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,040
Once you're convicted,

668
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,125
my factory will be stigmatized
as a place that prints flyers.

669
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,752
We'll go out of business.

670
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:34,049
You're not to leave this house,
not even for school. End of discussion.

671
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,342
Dad.

672
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,052
Dad!

673
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,139
What? Arrested?

674
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,144
Everyone who gathered
to print out flyers got arrested.

675
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,064
What about Su-ryeon?
She must have been there too.

676
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,817
Yes, but she was released
thanks to her father.

677
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,276
Are you happy now?

678
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,492
I heard everything from Father.

679
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,704
You're going to Germany next month, right?

680
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,124
I don't know yet.

681
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,835
I need money for the airfare.

682
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,754
Ask your lady for help.

683
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,214
I'm not a beggar.

684
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,842
Why on earth would I ask her
to give me money?

685
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,594
You're just borrowing it.

686
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,472
That scholarship is such
a rare opportunity.

687
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,352
I can apply again next year.

688
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,189
What if you don't get it next year?
Will you wait another year?

689
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,193
Do you want to lose the opportunity
because of your pride?

690
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:42,200
There are unpaid bills.

691
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,702
Mr. Choi!

692
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,666
My goodness.

00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,679
It's been a while, Mr. Kim.

698
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,973
-It's been so long. How have you been?
-Hello.

699
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:08,602
My goodness.
They say the fox plays the king

700
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,896
when the tiger is away,

701
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,356
and Hwang Gi-nam seems to be
enjoying more power

702
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,692
since the president passed away.

703
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,694
How frustrating.

704
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,653
-And I'm…
-Jeez.

705
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,741
-Apologies. I'll talk to you later.
-Sure.

706
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,162
-I'll get going.
-All right.

707
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,790
Hello.

708
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,713
Did your daughter come back home safely?

709
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,840
Yes, thanks to you.

710
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,717
I feel so bad every time.

711
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,011
We help each other.
You don't have to feel bad.

712
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:47,265
In these turbulent times,
there are many things to think about.

713
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,976
Especially for those who are on their own
like you and me,

714
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,187
one small mistake can be all it takes.

715
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,234
You're right.
We're living in strange times.

716
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,072
Speaking of which,

717
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:07,535
isn't it time your daughter
started getting ready to get married?

718
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,135
Dad.

719
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,891
Dad, we need to talk.

720
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,602
Go to your room.
I have nothing to say to you.

721
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,606
Do you want to see your daughter die?

722
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,900
Please get them out.

723
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,694
If something happens to them,

724
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,239
how will I face the world?

725
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,574
Dad.

726
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,000
I can get your friends out
on one condition.

727
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,170
I'll do anything. Anything at all.

728
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,047
Su-ryeon, it's time

729
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,509
for you to grow up.

730
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,808
How can I go on a date
with such a horrible person's son?

731
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,185
Go on a date, and they'll be released.

732
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,645
It's already decided.

733
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,231
He's the son of Hwang Gi-nam,
of all people!

734
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,276
He was once the Head of
Anti-communist Investigation.

735
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,069
So what?

736
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,406
All you have to do is sit with him
for a while and turn him down.

737
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,452
Imagine someone sees me
with a powerful anti-communist's son.

738
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,456
I will be burned at the stake immediately.

739
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,332
What can you do?

740
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,377
This is the only way
to get your friends out.

741
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,632
Right. Didn't you say
you had something to tell me?

742
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,808
I feel bad for sharing good news
when you're so devastated.

743
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,144
What is it?

744
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,485
What could this be?

745
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,451
What? "Acceptance Letter?"

746
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,914
Hey, did you get in?

747
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,710
Goodness. When did you even apply?
You never told me.

748
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,171
I wasn't counting on getting in.

749
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,297
I guess I was lucky.

750
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,174
Congratulations.

751
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:30,136
I knew you could do anything
once you set your mind to it.

752
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,641
It must've been so hard,
working and studying all at once.

753
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,643
I'm proud of you, Myeong-hee.

754
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,895
Thanks.

755
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:45,110
But this feels as if you're getting
a draft notice.

756
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,694
When are you leaving?

757
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,532
I'm going to try to leave next month.

758
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,243
What? Next month?

759
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:58,123
Didn't you say you'd have to save up
for another year?

760
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,795
You're just borrowing it.

761
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,422
Well…

762
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,135
I won the Catholic Foundation scholarship.

763
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,970
Really?

764
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,639
That's great.

765
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:17,058
You must be so relieved.

766
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,272
But the thing is…

767
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,359
to get the scholarship,
I must leave next month.

768
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,779
So I have to

769
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,408
scrape up money for airfare soon.

770
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,661
But flights are so expensive.

771
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,997
Where are you going to get all that money?

772
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:43,960
Well…

773
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:45,920
Myeong-hee.

774
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,507
I could ask my father.

775
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,677
No. Forget it.

776
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,471
I shouldn't have said anything.

777
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,140
I can find a way. Don't worry.

778
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,768
So when is this date of yours?

779
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,150
Hold on.

780
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,615
You know,

781
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:17,160
I got a great idea.

782
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,336
You can go on the blind date
instead of me,

783
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:30,715
and I'll buy the plane ticket
instead of you.

784
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,802
You just have to meet with him
three times.

785
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,972
And if he dumps you first,

786
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,433
you just have to meet him once.

787
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,895
No one will ever find out
since you don't know each other.

788
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,022
Come on, that's total nonsense.

789
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,901
Why? Let's help each other out
in this difficult situation.

790
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,196
Three dates for a plane ticket to Germany.

791
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:58,952
Come on. Don't you think this is
a win-win for both of us?

792
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,904
Ta-da!

793
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,532
What in the world?

794
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:40,618
-Su-ryeon, I'm going to kill you.
-Stop it! My goodness.

795
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,786
Hey!

796
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,840
How about this purple dress to start with?

797
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,596
-What about this?
-I don't think so.

798
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,560
Who are you?

799
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,147
Are you really Myeong-hee?

800
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,195
What are you doing?

801
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,083
Yes! That's perfect!

802
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,304
Goodness, let me see.

803
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,893
Most of my clothes fit you,

804
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,062
but the shoes are the problem.

805
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,190
Try it on again.

806
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,824
Good. It won't slip off now.

807
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,286
All right. It's time for the last touch.

808
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,708
This is my good luck charm.

809
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:57,255
I never failed to get rejected by a guy
whenever I wore this.

810
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,383
Gosh, it's perfect.

811
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,718
You look gorgeous.

812
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,721
I don't know what I'm doing right now.

813
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,347
Come on.

814
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,559
Don't you want to go on the date now
that it's about to happen?

815
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:12,311
No. Going on a date isn't a big deal.

816
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,606
It's just that the plane ticket
is too expensive.

817
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,360
-I don't want to get you in trouble--
-There you go again!

818
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,279
It's not like I'm doing it for free.

819
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,283
We both have nothing to lose from this.

820
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:29,162
So just go and get dumped. Got it?

821
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,597
GWANGJU PARK HOTEL CAFE, 4 P.M.

822
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,571
Darn.

823
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,328
Jin-woo… Jin-woo!

824
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,955
-Dear. My son.
-He's been hit.

825
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,749
-Jin-woo.
-What's going on?

826
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,125
-Jin-woo!
-What happened?

827
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,752
My son.

828
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,003
-Gosh.
-Jin-woo.

829
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,505
Jin-woo.

830
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,757
Please look at me.

831
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,134
No, Jin-woo.

832
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:40,900
PATIENT: JANG SEOK-CHUL
GUARDIAN: HWANG HUI-TAE

833
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,038
Hui-tae. Please save Seok-chul.

834
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,458
Hui-tae! Please save her.

835
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,045
Hui-tae!

836
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,597
-Dear.
-What do we do?

837
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,724
-Hey!
-Lay him down.

838
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,352
-Did he hit his head?
-No.

839
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,145
I just bumped into him slightly

840
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,732
-and he fell down.
-Ma'am, please save my son.

841
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,364
-My gosh.
-My son…

842
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,991
I think he's injured.

843
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,994
I think he just passed out, so calm down.

844
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,996
-Call an ambulance now.
-Okay.

845
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,180
My son… Please…

846
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,521
Hey, little boy. Open your eyes.

847
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,857
Kid. Look at me.

848
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,195
He woke up!

849
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,412
What is your name?

850
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,206
Can you look here for me?

851
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,667
-Gosh.
-I'm so glad he's not hurt.

852
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,556
-My gosh, Sang-gon. What is going on?
-Byeong-geol.

853
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,267
Fire this brat now.

854
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:43,397
What kind of nurse
assaults a sick patient in this world?

855
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,651
Ma'am, please save my son.

856
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,904
That cheeky nurse!

857
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,912
I'm sorry I'm late.

858
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,332
My name is Lee Su-ryeon.

859
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,719
Even when you did
everything I told you to?

860
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,470
No matter what I did,
he did something worse.

861
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,097
It looks like Myeong-hee
went on the blind date.

862
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,306
-What?
-What?

863
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,433
Go, Myeong-su!

864
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,020
-Myeong-hee, is he your secret child?
-You wench, watch what you say.

865
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,647
Su-ryeon, then how about tomorrow?

866
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,108
-How about dinner?
-I have plans tonight.

867
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,068
It turns out she's a total vixen.

868
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,154
After struggling with my life
all day long,

869
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,531
I feel free whenever I meet you.

870
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,200
I can sing for you sometime.

871
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,369
Can we meet again
before the flowers wither?
