1
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,487
Your mind keeps going back
to May of that year.

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,449
That's not strange at all.

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,955
If you lose your favorite umbrella,

4
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,208
you think of it whenever it rains.

5
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,470
It feels even worse

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,307
if the season you lost your loved one

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,185
comes back every year.

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,984
It's only natural

9
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,073
that our minds return to that day

10
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,784
as if it were yesterday.

11
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,998
Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you
during a session.

12
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,185
Hello?

13
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,939
Did you get the text message?

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,819
They found it.

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,320
Don't kill me.

16
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,699
Please don't kill me.

17
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,913
Over here! There's a kid here!

18
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,557
My goodness. Don't.

19
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,350
Don't look at what I'm writing.

20
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,854
The writing's so small
that I can't even see it.

21
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,858
We're going to read it out
to each other anyway.

22
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,276
What's the point in writing so small?

23
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,904
Can't we skip the prayer?

24
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,947
Marriage vows are enough.

25
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,619
We have no officiator or guests.

26
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,663
We didn't prepare outfits,
wedding gifts, or anything.

27
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,124
We should exchange this
to commemorate our marriage.

28
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,501
I'm useless at writing essays.

29
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,046
I didn't tell you to write an essay.

30
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,841
Just write what you want.
I bet it'll all come true.

31
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,220
The Lord will take pity on us
because we're penniless.

32
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,307
Why aren't you writing out your prayer?

33
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,643
I memorized mine already.

34
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,145
There's a prayer I say every day.

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,981
What is it about?

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,860
If I die,

37
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,406
I want you to be buried with me.

38
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,909
As in buried alive with you?

39
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,661
Pray for something else.

40
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,247
You said the prayers will come true.

41
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,916
Then you can pray
that you won't be buried alive.

42
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,627
Let's see whose prayer is more effective.

43
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,061
What are you doing in my office?

44
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,534
We got a tip
that your son is closely connected

45
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,621
to the main suspect of this incident.

46
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,209
I think you are mistaken.

47
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,712
-The suspect only said--
-Stop.

48
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,839
You can defend yourself
during the investigation.

49
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,799
An inspector

50
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,303
should always stay objective.

51
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,472
Until the investigation is over,

52
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,142
I will take charge of the steering wheel.

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,453
Next, the bride and groom
will say their vows.

54
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,496
The groom may go first.

55
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,123
Okay!

56
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,171
I, Hwang Hui-tae,

57
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,382
accept Kim Myeong-hee as my wife.

58
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,342
Forever, with love and respect,

59
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,970
I will cherish her.

60
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,640
I solemnly swear before the Lord.

61
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,021
Does the bride, Kim Myeong-hee,

62
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,232
who's known to be terrible with words,
swear the same?

63
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,484
Yes.

64
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,944
Your voice isn't loud enough!

65
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,446
Yes!

66
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,573
Very well.

67
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,702
Finally, the bride and groom
will exchange prayers.

68
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:14,707
I heard that the bride
was tormented by the agony of creation.

69
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,126
Shall we hear your prayer?

70
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,296
The groom can go first
since he memorized his prayer.

71
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,843
Okay, then.

72
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,562
Lord.

73
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,525
Whatever hardship may befall us,

74
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,778
we won't let go of these hands
we finally get to hold.

75
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,822
Lord, let us overcome the hardship.

76
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,076
More than anything,

77
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,162
give me worse pains
instead of Myeong-hee, Lord.

78
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,167
I pray sincerely in the Lord's name.

79
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,020
Darn it. My prayer's sloppy.

80
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,399
You said you'd pray
that I'd be buried alive.

81
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,325
I, Kim Myeong-hee,

82
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,618
Myeong-hee!

83
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,457
Myeong-hee.

84
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,043
Just now, your father…

85
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,558
Myeong-hee.

86
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,739
No.

87
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,783
It's not my father.

88
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,162
Hui-tae. Look at that.

89
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,040
My father isn't that short.

90
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,667
Dad.

91
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,504
Dad. Open your eyes.

92
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,298
Stop teasing me and open your eyes.

93
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,927
Why are you lying here on the cold ground?

94
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,679
Dad.

95
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,889
Dad, wake up.

96
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,059
Open your eyes right now!

97
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,483
You can't… You can't do this.

98
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,654
To the end…

99
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,449
Why must you give me a hard time
to the very end?

100
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,582
No, Dad. I can't let you go like this.

101
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,874
Dad…

102
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,420
Dad, let's go home.

103
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,506
Let's go home, Dad.

104
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,809
Dad.

105
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,936
Dad…

106
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,109
KIM SUNG-WOOK, 18 YEARS OLD
WE ARE LOOKING FOR OUR SON

107
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,527
So does this mean…

108
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,739
our son hasn't died

109
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,866
but has been arrested?

110
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,537
My dear. Honey, he's alive.

111
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,542
But didn't you say
you were arrested with him?

112
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,085
How were you released?

113
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,799
I was… Well…

114
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,692
Su-chan.

115
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,114
-If it's because you feel guilty--
-Three days.

116
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,159
The world I believed in

117
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,787
crumbled in just three days.

118
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,248
I was dragged away
and treated like an animal.

119
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,127
When I lied down on my bed after
being released thanks to Mr. Hwang,

120
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,464
do you know what I thought?

121
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,848
I felt comfortable.

122
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,434
I didn't even know if the people

123
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,937
who were arrested with me
were dead or alive.

124
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,065
But I felt so cozy and comfortable.

125
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,736
That's why…

126
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,156
I feel ashamed.

127
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,493
I'm ashamed of lying down, eating,

128
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,663
and even wearing this suit
and breathing this air.

129
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,416
I feel like a total coward.

130
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,920
I feel ashamed to death.

131
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,718
Su-chan.

132
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,181
We may not be able to change anything,

133
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,643
but there are things we can do.

134
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,204
I'll go

135
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,750
look for a way to contact Naju
and ask about the funeral procedure.

136
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,631
You stay here

137
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,593
beside your father.

138
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,765
I'll take care
of all the necessary arrangements.

139
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,318
FROM KIM HYEON-CHEOL
TO KIM MYEONG-HEE

140
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,286
REGULAR SAVINGS ACCOUNT

141
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,085
CURRENT BALANCE

142
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,611
I saved all the money you've sent me.

143
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,532
It's under your name,

144
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,577
so you can take your seal
and withdraw it anytime.

145
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,332
Myeong-su said this to me one day.

146
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,211
That the runner who runs way in the front

147
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,713
does nothing
but block the wind for the others.

148
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,551
He said it was your loss if you stood
in the front from the beginning.

149
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,848
Perhaps, I lived my life…

150
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,101
-Let's go and…
-always in the front,

151
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,061
blocking the wind with my whole body.

152
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,064
I was that runner who was in the front.

153
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,572
I was afraid you'd be
hit by the wind like me.

154
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,284
What if your wings got hurt
from the hardships of this world?

155
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,746
I hoped you wouldn't stand
in the front like me and always tried…

156
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,331
Dad, I didn't do anything wrong.

157
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,584
…to hold you back.

158
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,213
But your wings

159
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,799
were strong enough
to endure any kind of wind.

160
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
If I just let you be,

161
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,805
you would have ridden the wind

162
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,600
and flew up high into the sky.

163
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,562
Since everything that happened
wasn't your fault,

164
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,815
just leave it behind with me.

165
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,109
And from now on,

166
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,321
let your wings carry you

167
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,406
freely

168
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,659
wherever you want to go.

169
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,382
She's currently at Sangmugwan
with your son.

170
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,593
Don't send our own men.

171
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,762
Use one of our spies in the militia
to get rid of her.

172
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,972
Make it look like
an internal conflict broke out

173
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,307
and do it near the government building.

174
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,517
And make sure…

175
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,437
you kill her in front of my son.

176
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,522
I'll do that, sir.

177
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,235
She had a little kid with her.
What shall I do about him?

178
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,614
Get rid of him too if the timing is right…

179
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,867
What do you want?

180
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,998
The housekeeper

181
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,128
asked if you're going to eat.

182
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,384
I'm working right now.
Tell her I'll eat later.

183
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,594
Okay.

184
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,400
Eat up now.

185
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,319
Here. Try it.

186
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,947
Hurry up and eat.

187
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,682
Excuse me.

188
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,184
Are you Kim Myeong-hee?

189
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
Yes.

190
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,315
I have an urgent message for you.

191
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:12,197
Mr. Hwang Hui-tae asked for you
to come outside immediately.

192
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,870
MESSAGE FROM HWANG HUI-TAE
COME TO THE SERVICE CENTER

193
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,206
Hui-tae asked for me? Do you know why?

194
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,083
I'm just delivering the message.

195
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,795
Since it's the service center,

196
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,131
I guess it's about the funeral.

197
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,397
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

198
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,398
Divorce?

199
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,318
Are you insane?

200
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,361
I'm as sane as I can be.

201
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,828
I won't put up with this nonsense.

202
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,500
I'll mail you the papers again.

203
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,336
If you want to talk to me,
contact Attorney Choi from now on.

204
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,630
Jeong-tae

205
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,673
will come with me.

206
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,262
If you're going to leave, go alone.

207
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,264
I'll never let you have custody.

208
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,269
Then let's ask Jeong-tae to choose
who he'll live with.

209
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,858
What? Choose?

210
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,195
Jeong-tae, come downstairs.

211
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,033
You better stop crossing the line.

212
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,578
Jeong-tae. Hwang Jeong-tae!

213
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,416
Ma'am. Your son left urgently a while ago.

214
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,216
What do you want?

215
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,403
Excuse me.
Did you see a woman sitting there?

216
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,907
Did you miss each other?

217
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,910
She left as soon as
she received the message.

218
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,871
What message?

219
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,541
You sent her a message
to come to the service center.

220
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,348
Ms. Kim Myeong-hee?
Are you here to see Hwang Hui-tae?

221
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,684
Yes. What is going on?

222
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,854
The militia got the long-distance calls
working again.

223
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,105
Let me show you the way.

224
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,525
Go straight ahead and turn right, okay?

225
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,964
What in the world?

226
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,383
Let go! Let go, you little brat!

227
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,010
-I can't.
-Jeong-tae!

228
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,012
-Hey, let go.
-Myeong-hee, run!

229
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,015
-Let go!
-Don't do that.

230
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,350
I said, let go!

231
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,770
Jeong-tae!

232
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,923
Jeong-tae.

233
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,008
Jeong-tae!

234
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,887
Who did this?
Who said you could shoot the kid?

235
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,433
-Who said you could shoot my son?
-Is it your doing again?

236
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,186
Is this what you did for your family?

237
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,730
What have you done now?

238
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,110
-Jeong-tae.
-Don't come any closer!

239
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,780
Don't you lay a finger on my son.

240
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,120
Hui-tae.

241
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,708
-Did you bring your car?
-Yes.

242
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,420
Let's take him to the hospital first.
Jeong-tae, can you hear me?

243
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,546
Can you get up?

244
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,134
Jeong-tae.

245
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,721
Jeong-tae.

246
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:13,707
The orphan is not me but you.

247
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,754
No one will choose you to be their family.

248
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,068
Su-ryeon, get the cart.

249
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,281
Load them all.

250
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,797
I have another rat in my storage now.

251
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,465
Dad.

252
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,640
Did you two decide to
consider me a living corpse now?

253
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,185
Dad, I can explain. Right now…

254
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
It was my idea.

255
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,069
When I was little,

256
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,364
you said this to me all the time.

257
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,200
"It's pointless to prosper alone."

258
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,995
"We should grow together
with the City of Gwangju."

259
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,998
I admired you for that,

260
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,502
and it really made me proud
of our company.

261
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,882
If you ask me,

262
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,470
I think it's time, Dad.

263
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,360
What can you possibly do
with a cartful of supplies?

264
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,862
Open all our storage.

265
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,573
Take everything we have.

266
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,492
Dad.

267
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,192
Where is my sister?

268
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,401
You're awake.

269
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,987
Your sister went to see Hui-tae
for a second.

270
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,998
My goodness.
You still can't reach Mr. Park?

271
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,834
The phone lines are cut off,
and the roads are blocked.

272
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,295
There's no way we can reach someone
outside the city.

273
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,089
Then will she be cremated right away?

274
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,633
There won't even be a funeral?

275
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,259
What can we do?

276
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,262
Dead bodies are still pouring in.

277
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,598
We can't keep her here much longer.

278
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,850
Poor woman.

279
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,188
She can't even see her family
one last time.

280
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,232
I feel so sorry for her.

281
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,650
Mom…

282
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,027
Grandma…

283
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,040
Excuse me. Do you still have the map?

284
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,044
-What?
-The map you gave my father the other day.

285
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,213
The map? What do you need it for?

286
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,341
Excuse me.
Can I report a missing person here?

287
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,802
-No, not here.
-Okay.

288
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,970
Just a second.

289
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,765
Why don't you try
at the provincial government office?

290
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,475
Okay. Thank you.

291
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,567
Shouldn't you be there
when Jeong-tae comes out of surgery?

292
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,070
The doctor said he'd pull through.

293
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,530
Once your father…

294
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,864
Myeong-hee.

295
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,158
Myeong-su…

296
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,705
Myeong-su has gone missing.

297
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,582
What?

298
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,178
I think he went this way.

299
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,975
But I'll go and check that way too,
just in case.

300
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,771
Stay away from this area.

301
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,732
There are soldiers everywhere.

302
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,247
-Myeong-su.
-Myeong-su.

303
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,084
-Kim Myeong-su.
-Kim Myeong-su.

304
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,961
Myeong-su.

305
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,880
Myeong-su.

306
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,967
-Myeong-su.
-Kim Myeong-su.

307
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,719
Gosh, where did he go?

308
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,554
Myeong-hee.

309
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,027
The road splits here.

310
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,700
I'll check this way. You go that way.

311
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,786
Wait, you can't go that way.

312
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,080
It's the area Seon-min said
we should stay away from.

313
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,875
But it's not marked on Myeong-su's map.
We don't know where he may be.

314
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,127
Then I'll go that way.

315
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,296
You go this way.

316
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,094
Did you already forget my wedding prayer?

317
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:05,016
I'll never leave you behind
and put myself in danger.

318
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll just go have a quick look
and see if he's there.

319
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,986
Five minutes.

320
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,281
We'll meet here again in five minutes.

321
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,095
Five minutes, okay?

322
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,141
I'll see you here in five minutes.

323
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,601
Okay?

324
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,200
He's my family too.

326
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,629
See you later.

327
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,010
Myeong-su.

328
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,387
Kim Myeong-su.

329
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,449
Hands up.

330
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,343
Search thoroughly.

331
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,117
Go ahead and wait for me in Naju.

332
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,327
I'll be there soon.

333
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,204
I don't want to.

334
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,165
I'm not going alone.

335
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,750
Kim Myeong-su.

336
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,461
Dad promised he'd come back,
but he didn't.

337
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,799
Come with me.
Please come with me, Myeong-hee.

338
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,512
It's more dangerous if you stay with me.

339
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,891
I'm a nurse, so no one will attack me.

340
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,769
I'll explain to the soldiers
and catch up with you.

341
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,565
On the count of three,
run as fast as you can to Naju.

342
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,735
-Do you understand?
-No.

343
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,945
I don't want to.

344
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,822
Little bear.

345
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,366
Listen to me.

346
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,369
I'll catch up with you soon.

347
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,837
I promise.

348
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,966
Are you sure?

349
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,844
Are you sure you'll catch up with me?

350
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,767
When I make a promise, I never break it.

351
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,019
You know that, right?

352
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,929
On the count of three,
run as fast as you can.

353
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,848
One.

354
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,851
Two.

355
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,646
Three, go.

356
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,415
What are you doing? Go get that boy!

357
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,127
I'll go get him.

358
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,340
That stupid moron. There he goes again.

359
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,907
No.

360
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,133
Run. Now!

361
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,764
What are you waiting for? Run! Now!

362
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,598
What's with this punk?

363
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,850
He's a medical student
at Seoul National University.

364
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,727
Why is a student from SNU here?

365
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,397
I'm from Gwangju.

366
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,025
I'm visiting my family.

367
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,112
Hey.

368
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,155
Cut it out.

369
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,366
You came here to lead a rebellion,
didn't you?

370
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,452
That's not true.

371
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,538
I'm really from Gwangju.

372
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,289
Check my ID card.

373
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,457
Hey.

374
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,876
Just shoot him.

375
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,161
Hwang Hui-tae?

376
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,629
Yes, it's you.

377
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,841
The one who went to SNU with top marks.
Hwang Hui-tae.

378
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,467
You know him?

379
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,094
He's from my neighborhood.

380
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,054
I'm from Gwangju.

381
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,559
Get up.

382
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,609
Where are you going?

383
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,778
The order is to
shoot any rebel to death immediately.

384
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,119
Why don't we arrest him first to be sure?

385
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,664
We'll take him with us
and question him thoroughly.

386
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,465
That way.

387
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,270
If you want to live, keep walking.

388
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,397
Don't look back.

389
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,406
Hey, did you go through her pockets?

390
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,576
I'll do it now.

391
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,912
Find anything that reveals her identity.

392
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,841
Sir…

393
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,470
My brother…

394
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,350
My brother, Myeong-su…

395
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,979
Is he alive?

396
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,189
I can see the stars.

397
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,071
CHUNGMU

398
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,453
Welcome. Are you alone?

399
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,294
Sure. Leave one with me.

400
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,262
They're pretty good this year.

401
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,139
Who do you think will win?

402
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,518
I bet the med students will win.

403
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,229
-Do you?
-They were very good.

404
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,189
Did you like that song?

405
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,445
"AFTER THE PLAY ENDS"
WRITTEN BY CHOI MYEONG-SEOB

406
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,293

MISSING PERSON
KIM MYEONG-HEE, 26, GWANGJU

409
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,833
SEOUL, 2021

410
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,127
EMERGENCY WARD

411
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,713
I only let you off because you're a woman.

412
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,591
Do you have a death wish?

413
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,677
-Gosh.
-What should we do?

414
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,513
I'm not obligated to do something
that isn't a nurse's duty.

415
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,433
You really need to stop talking back.

416
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,435
Come on, now.

417
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,316
These are bad hands.

418
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,317
HWANG HUI-TAE

419
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,695
Who are you?

420
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,948
Step aside.

421
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,911
Step aside.

422
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,080
You won't?

423
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,290
Do you want to die too?

424
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:18,424
Gosh. Why are you so angry?

425
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,716
Who are you?

426
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,972
-Don't just stand there. Call security.
-Yes, sir.

427
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,267
Are you a patient or a family member?

428
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,061
You can calm down now.

429
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,439
EMERGENCY MEDICINE,
PROFESSOR HWANG HUI-TAE

430
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,402
Come in.

431
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,324
Did I drop my phone earlier?

432
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,243
It says the power's off.

433
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,706
Jeong-tae could've just called me.

434
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,791
Why does he want to see me?

435
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,420
Did he get on a plane?

436
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,592
Okay. It's not serious, is it?

437
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,053
What is it
that he wants to tell me in person?

438
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,597
Hey.

439
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,682
I found it.

440
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,101
I'm so scatterbrained.

441
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,731
I'll come right over. Text me the address.

442
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,192
Okay. See you soon. Bye.

443
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,702
No, it's fine.

444
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,332
Thank you.

445
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,924
Who are you anyway?

446
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,386
I was told that you asked to see me.

447
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:47,971
Me?

448
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,307
Did I…

449
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,811
Yes. You're that guy.

450
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,813
The guy who administered CPR
on a moving bus.

451
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,399
So what about the patient?

452
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,945
Did the patient live?

453
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,696
No.

454
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,990
The patient died last Saturday.

455
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,745
EMERGENCY MEDICINE,
PROFESSOR HWANG HUI-TAE

456
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,459
So you want to quit the internship?
Because a patient died?

457
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,462
It's not just that.

458
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,634
I don't think
I have the right to become a doctor.

459
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,062
The thing is,

460
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:41,692
I have to be somewhere soon.
So I'll be very brief.

461
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,903
What's your name?

462
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,197
I'm Lee Seo-on.

463
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,866
Seo-on. Okay, Seo-on.

464
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,959
You know,

465
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,087
we don't decide who lives or dies.

466
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,380
That decision…

467
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,466
is up to the Almighty.

468
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,428
All we can do
is do our best between the two.

469
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,640
Seo-on, despite being afraid,
you did your best instead of running away.

470
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,645
I guarantee you.

471
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,605
INTERN LEE SEO-ON

472
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,772
Seo-on.

473
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,401
You will become a good doctor.

474
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,282
I have to be somewhere soon.

475
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,035
If you're going to stay,
turn off the lights later.

476
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,095
PUNISH THE FAKE PATRIOTS!

477
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,723
THE MAY 18 GWANGJU UPRISING
WAS THE WORK OF SPIES

478
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,731
The light is green. You may cross now.

479
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,494
Hey, Seok-chul.

480
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,791
I'm sorry I suddenly asked you to come.

481
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,209
You must be busy.

482
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,960
I'm not as busy as you.

483
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,464
Why did you lose so much weight?
You should take care of your health.

484
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,633
Come to the hospital for a checkup.

485
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,927
Our staff discounts end this year.

486
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,805
Let's go.

487
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,728
By the way, Seok-chul.

488
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:47,734
If you rip those banners on the streets
these days, how much is the fine?

489
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,902
I'm not sure.

490
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,406
Why don't you ask Su-ryeon
about legal matters?

491
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,282
Who? Lee Su-ryeon?

492
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,078
All she knows are labor laws.

493
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,330
She did nothing
but protest during law school.

494
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,752
I was surprised
when I turned on my phone earlier.

495
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,588
I had so many missed calls
from some old friends.

496
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,175
And strangely, they were all from Gwangju.

497
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,267
Hey.

498
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,269
Myeong-su.

499
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,314
How have you been, Hui-tae?

500
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:27,983
What…

501
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,695
Is today a special day?
Are we holding a reunion?

502
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,088
What is it?

503
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,467
Did you find her?

504
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,762
Yes.

505
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,380
We found this note
buried with the skeleton.

506
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:36,134
According to the informant,
this belonged to the deceased too.

507
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,847
GWANGJU METROPOLITAN POLICE

508
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,574
Gyeong-su.

509
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,261
Hui-tae…

510
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,782
I, Kim Myeong-hee,

511
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,285
refuse to be buried alive
with Hwang Hui-tae.

512
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,715
Lord,

513
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,468
if something unexpected happens

514
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,888
and we have to let go
of each other's hands,

515
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,140
please don't let the sorrow

516
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,435
overwhelm the lives of those left behind.

517
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,982
Even if the tears we shed

518
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,276
fill up to our chins,

519
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,530
please don't let us drown

520
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,867
and give us the power and courage

521
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:52,163
to swim safely throughout this life.

522
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,445
As always, May has come.

523
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,532
This year is the 41st May

524
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,452
since I lost you, Myeong-hee.

525
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,879
All this time,

526
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,466
my life felt like swimming
during a rising tide.

527
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,387
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't move forward

528
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,017
and I even tried to let myself drown.

529
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,949
But when I woke up,

530
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,745
that tide had pushed me back

531
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,372
to that May inside my heart.

532
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,544
It felt so cruel
that I lived in resentment.

533
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,350
For a very long time,

534
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,437
I lived in regret
and thought about what could've been.

535
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,775
If I hadn't gone to Gwangju
in May of that year,

536
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,738
if I hadn't met you in Gwangju,

537
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,618
if I hadn't let go of your hand
in those woods,

538
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,122
would you still be alive?

539
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,457
But…

540
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,837
on this 41st May
when you've finally returned,

541
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,091
I now realize that it was all my choice.

542
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,553
In May of that year,

543
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,722
I chose to go to Gwangju

544
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,478
and chose to love you with all my heart.

545
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,940
I prayed every day

546
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,234
that worse pains in life

547
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,237
would come to me instead of you.

548
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,035
If I had died
in the crossroads of life and death,

549
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,163
and you had lived,

550
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,125
you would've experienced the tides

551
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,502
that I had experienced all this time.

552
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,548
The life of the one who was left behind.

553
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,260
Hence, I've finally realized

554
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,680
that what I experienced all this time

555
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,975
was the Lord's way of answering my prayer.

556
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,353
Those lonely and painful 41 years…

557
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,440
were merely

558
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,151
my love for you.

559
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,507
TO GRANDPA MYEONG-HEE

560
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,719
The remaining years of my life

561
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,473
will be an answer to your prayer.

562
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,227
No matter how many more times

563
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,104
the rising tide pushes me back
to that May,

564
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,525
I have you here now.

565
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,611
Until we meet again,

566
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,031
I will swim against the tide
with all my might.

567
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:44,080
The first May in 2021. From Hwang Hui-tae.

568
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:51,921
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING YOUTH OF MAY

569
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,806
