1
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,696
So why do you keep provoking them?

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,282
They think you're the bad guy.

3
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,869
I don't care what they think.

4
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,458
The more I think about it,
the more baffled I get.

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,211
There are plenty of seniors.
How could they make you protest?

6
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,173
They're obviously trying
to dump it all on you

7
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,716
because they don't want to
be dragged to Namsan.

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,469
It's my choice.

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,554
No one put me up to it.

10
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,393
Sure. Whatever, Mr. Fighter.

11
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,355
Everything you do bothers me.

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,984
And what's with this lame taste in music?

13
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,030
You told me to request a song
I wanted to listen to.

14
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,990
Why must you nitpick about everything?

15
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,202
We really don't see eye to eye.

16
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,871
You say that all the time.

17
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,707
Why did you team up with me then?

18
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,501
What do you think?

19
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,337
Because you couldn't find
anyone else to write lyrics.

20
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,674
I'm sorry, but there are many people
who can do that.

21
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,802
Then what?

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,720
Because I'm a nice person?

23
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,932
Gosh, you're saying that about yourself?
Have you gone mad?

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,771
That's what everyone else says.
They say I'm nice.

25
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,065
And that's why they all like me.

26
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,652
My goodness.

27
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,116
Kim Gyeong-su.

28
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,535
Don't be delusional.

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,538
You're not a good person.

30
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,058
You punks. Do you think
you're on a picnic now?

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,812
Hurry up! You're all so slow.

32
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,167
Hui-tae, the ambulance is arriving.

33
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,085
Okay.

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,349
The martial law army headquarters…

35
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,518
Can't you write it properly? What is this?

36
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,103
Do you have an accurate count?

37
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,938
Yes, I think so.

38
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,368
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,370
I thought you moved to Seoul
to get married.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,002
I'll just get the medical supplies
and leave.

41
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,462
Don't mind me.

42
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,299
Why? Did your father-in-law
send you here to spy on us?

43
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,218
What?

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,469
Am I wrong?

45
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,596
Are you the Grim Reaper or something?

46
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,057
Everyone who met up with you
has disappeared.

47
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,936
Did Hye-gun also go missing
after meeting up with you?

48
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,981
It was me, not her.

49
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,612
Hye-gun met with me
before he went missing.

50
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,073
Does that make me the Grim Reaper too?

51
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,076
Why are you taking it out on her?

52
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,536
That's because her fiance is…

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,955
She moved out.

54
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,082
What?

55
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,543
She moved out.
Look at her. Can't you tell?

56
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,964
She's been helping the victims
for days with me.

57
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,300
So don't waste your energy
attacking someone

58
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,010
who's working toward
the same goal as you are.

59
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,151
Boo-yong, that thing…

60
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,237
Did you finish it?

61
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,616
What's with this handwriting?
Make the letters bigger.

62
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,120
Keep your head down, please.

63
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,248
-It'll be quick.
-This is only his second day here,

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,375
but he's better at intubation
than Dr. Song,

65
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,212
who's been an intern for half a year.
He already got the hang of it.

66
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,588
I know.

67
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,842
He passed the exam
with the highest score, you know.

68
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,636
Don't stare at him.
Let's just take a quick glance.

69
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,651
Does anyone have a moment to spare?

70
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,029
Please go take care of Kim Duk-bae.

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,490
Kim Duk-bae? The delirious patient
who beats up everyone?

72
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,035
That's right.
He's just not getting better.

73
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,329
Give him more sedatives.

74
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,913
-And take this urinary bag…
-What?

75
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,583
-Attach this urinary bag too.
-Goodness.

76
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,420
Here.

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,968
I'll do it.

78
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,512
Really?

79
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,979
Myeong-hee, what are you doing?

80
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,773
What?

81
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,524
We have to admit a new patient.

82
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,985
The ambulance is arriving.
It's an emergency patient.

83
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,362
We'll be right back.

84
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,365
Wait…

85
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,454
Clearly, he's already
made himself at home here.

86
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,707
-No one's coming?
-I'm coming.

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,337
I told you. Don't step in
unless you're told to.

88
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,214
Why would you volunteer
to do the difficult tasks?

89
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,924
Why should that matter?

90
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,926
I just want to do the things
that I can do.

91
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,305
Does it mean other people avoid it
because they don't know how to work?

92
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,976
See? They keep forcing everything on you
since they know you'll say yes.

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,978
You do all the hard work too.

94
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,149
-You covered the windows with mattresses--
-Do you think I wanted to do that?

95
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,485
When bullets were flying in
through the windows?

96
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,612
I did it because you were about to do it.

97
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,781
If I didn't, you would've done it instead.

98
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,367
-I get it. Stop nagging.
-"Stop nagging"?

99
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,410
I'm saying this for your sake.

100
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,079
Wait, a patient has arrived.

101
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,459
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

102
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,008
The patient is 18, and he's been shot
in the hand and lower abdomen.

103
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,885
He's been shot?

104
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,396
Let's prepare for surgery right away.
Prepare plenty of blood for transfusion.

105
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,651
Darn it.

106
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,157
Those darn punks.

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,826
They're now shooting civilians
with the guns meant to protect them?

108
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,327
Can you believe this?

109
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,039
What did the kid do to deserve this?

110
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,047
Jeong-tae, can't you come sleep at home?

111
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,133
I can give you a ride back and forth.

112
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,135
I'm really okay.

113
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,637
No one has gone home.
They're all sleeping here.

114
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,726
I'm just so worried.
And your father may ask to see you soon.

115
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,645
He never asks to see me.

116
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,149
What?

117
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,279
Anyway, I won't go.
I'm going to stay here.

118
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,161
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,166
Our training is being carried out strictly
within the training camp.

120
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,876
No one is taking a single step
out of here.

121
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,836
So don't worry about Jeong-tae.

122
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,590
Please call me if something happens.

123
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,425
Yes, of course.

124
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,010
Okay, goodbye.

125
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:36,933
Yes?

126
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,353
We're training strictly
within the training camp.

127
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,065
EMERGENCY ROOM

128
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,108
What did they say? Is Myeong-su okay?

129
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,862
They're staying inside the training camp,
so he said not to worry.

130
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,704
If you're concerned,
shall we bring him here? I'll go get him.

131
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,041
It's better to stay
instead of seeing everything here.

132
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,168
It's safer too.

133
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,262
That punk.

134
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,525
You think you're so darn fast?

135
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,157
Are you crazy?

136
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,827
Soo-gon, get out of here now!

137
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,246
-You darn…
-Sergeant Hong!

138
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,959
Don't come any closer!
If you do, I'll kill this jerk!

139
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,420
You crazy punk.
Private Kim, what are you doing?

140
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,880
Shoot him now! Shoot him!

141
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,843
Stay still!

142
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,012
Shoot him!

143
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,778
Due to the military's
excessive use of force,

144
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,448
hundreds of innocent civilians
have been injured.

145
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,825
Someone even died yesterday.

146
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,120
We must make the troops
withdraw immediately.

147
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,748
Withdrawing suddenly like this
won't solve anything.

148
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,541
What?

149
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,793
Do you think they were dispatched
for no reason?

150
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,130
It's more important to suppress the mob
that's causing the frenzy.

151
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,634
Whose side are you on right now?

152
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,428
We're gathered here
to sort this situation out.

153
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,929
We're not here to take sides.

154
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,101
Or perhaps, Father,

155
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,938
are you here
to represent one side in particular?

156
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,316
Please watch your mouth.

157
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,443
You're the ones
who should watch your mouths.

158
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,487
-What?
-Did I say something wrong?

159
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,447
How could you say that to an assemblyman?

160
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,077
The minutes from today's
emergency committee meeting.

161
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,000
Did you participate in the meeting
and write it?

162
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,378
No, sir.

163
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,047
The officials at the meeting wrote them--

164
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,215
Mr. Hwang.

165
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,925
We are

166
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,427
in positions that require some legwork.

167
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,931
How do you control the situation
behind a desk

168
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,474
while simply receiving reports?

169
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,935
This really…

170
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,604
troubles me.

171
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,858
I mean, the martial law has been expanded
mainly because of Gwangju.

172
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,571
I'll make sure to participate
in future meetings.

173
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,467
You loaded the bullets backward.

174
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,928
-Did you do this on purpose?
-I'm sorry, sir.

175
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,723
Hey. Did you join this place
to protect the commies?

176
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,809
How can you call yourself a soldier?

177
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,478
Answer me, you punk.

178
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,607
How dare you load your bullets backward?

179
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,444
You stupid punk. I can't believe you.

180
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,905
You're a darn disgrace.

181
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,882
Corporal Lee.

182
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,801
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

183
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,054
I just couldn't get myself to shoot…

184
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,973
Do you think I fired that shot
because I wanted to?

185
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,019
Hey, Kim Gyeong-su.

186
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,688
Do you think that makes you a nice person?

187
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,443
This is the army.

188
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,696
If you don't shoot, I have to.

189
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,242
Can you call yourself nice if you force
others to do to keep your hands clean?

190
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,537
That's what you call being selfish.

191
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm sorry, sir.

192
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,964
If you don't want to shoot anyone,
arrest them quickly

193
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,551
before someone else shoots.

194
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,905
What is that sound?
I've been hearing it all day.

195
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,616
Don't worry. It's probably nothing.

196
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,786
Chang-geun,
it's time to take your medicine.

197
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,416
Did Su-chan really go to work
this morning?

198
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,420
Why? Is he not answering the phone
at the office?

199
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,965
Did you actually see Su-chan leave?

200
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,386
Tell me. What is going on?

201
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,764
Chang-geun.

202
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,433
You need to calm down first.

203
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,103
Tell me! What happened to Su-chan?

204
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
Sir.

205
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,913
Sir.

206
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,500
Over here. A person has collapsed.

207
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,629
A man has collapsed. Please…

208
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,759
-My gosh.
-Who told you to move?

209
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,219
Do you want to die?

210
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,929
Get back in your position.

211
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,101
What are you all looking at?

212
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,978
Eyes down!

213
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,940
Take him away.

214
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,573
Sir…

215
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,587
Hey. Get back in your position, you punk.

216
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,968
What? Who was arrested?

217
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,262
Su-ryeon's older brother.

218
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,016
I'm not sure, but can you check
if he's really been arrested?

219
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,226
What a hassle.

220
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,521
Tell them I'll check.

221
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,108
But what is going on?

222
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,860
People are calling all day,
asking me to find people.

223
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,947
There's no need for you to know.
Just keep to the house for now.

224
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,870
By the way…

225
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,171
Has Hui-tae called?

226
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,384
No.

227
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,096
You should check on him first.

228
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,474
Don't sit back
just because he doesn't call first.

229
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,144
He never asks to see me.

230
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,234
Why aren't you asking about Jeong-tae?

231
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,279
Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?

232
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,491
Jeong-tae is your son too.

233
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,035
You haven't seen him in days.

234
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,328
Aren't you worried?

235
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
Do you think I have the time
to worry about him?

236
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,500
That's enough of your nonsense.
Just give me that.

237
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,723
I finally got in touch with Mr. Lee.

238
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,810
He'll be here early in the morning.

239
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,397
That's a relief.

240
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,237
Once he gets here,
let's leave immediately.

241
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,532
Immediately?

242
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,954
Our plan was to stay
until Mr. Lee comes to get Jin-a.

243
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,170
What's with that face?

244
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,965
It's not like that.

245
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,134
Then what is it?

246
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,720
If something is bothering you,
just tell me.

247
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,222
It's just that…

248
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,850
If we leave,

249
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,103
the others will have to do more work.

250
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,981
That's what I was worried about.

251
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,157
What? Were you thinking
that I'm a pushover?

252
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,245
No way.

253
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,123
I was thinking you are such a good person.

254
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,461
But listen, Myeong-hee.

255
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,756
If you want to be good,
you must put yourself first.

256
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,801
If you put others before yourself,

257
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,470
that's hypocrisy, I think.

258
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,599
Don't people normally call that
a sacrifice?

259
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,269
They would normally.

260
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,022
But…

261
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,317
to someone who loves you, it's hypocrisy.

262
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,158
So for now, let's put you and me first.

263
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,921
We'll be training indoors again today.

264
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,173
Get ready and come out
as quickly as you can.

265
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,555
Gosh, I feel so cooped up.

266
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
Why can't we go out?

267
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,394
It's my birthday today,
and I'm stuck indoors all day.

268
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,897
Is it your birthday today, Sung-il?

269
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,733
Gosh, then we should celebrate.

270
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,821
You said you love comic books, right?
Should we go borrow some comics?

271
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,949
We can't even train outside.
How can we go out?

272
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,578
My gosh. We have two fast runners here.

273
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,663
You two can rush over there
and borrow some.

274
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,416
Gather around. I have a plan.

275
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm going grocery shopping.

276
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,176
See you.

277
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,147
Excuse me, Coach.

278
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,151
Do you have any digestive medicine?

279
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,361
I think I have an upset stomach.

280
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,740
You have an upset stomach? You, Jin-kyu?

281
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,743
-Then let me prick your fingers.
-What?

282
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,122
I think some medicine will do.

283
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,541
Medicine won't do any good.

284
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,002
Pricking all ten fingers
is the best remedy.

285
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,748
You still can't reach them?

286
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,501
You can't make any long-distance calls?

287
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,419
It's just Gwangju that's out of reach.

288
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,715
This won't do.
I'll have to go there myself.

289
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,677
Go where? To Gwangju?

290
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,887
By yourself?

291
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,307
I've heard some terrible rumors.

292
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,142
That's why I should go there.

293
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,562
FROM KIM HYEON-CHEOL
TO KIM MYEONG-HEE

294
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,109
I hope everything's fine.

295
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,905
Hyeon-cheol, where are you going?

296
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,450
Mom, I have to
make a quick trip to Gwangju.

297
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,579
Don't go. Stay with me.

298
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,709
Mom, have a seat for a second.

299
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,339
I'll come back as soon as
I know the kids are fine.

300
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,300
Don't worry and stay put, okay?

301
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,518
My goodness, you look so beautiful, Mom.

302
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,525
See you later.

303
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,652
You don't have to come out.

304
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,613
-Be careful.
-Don't worry.

305
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,836
Hey, let's get a box of Choco Pies too.

306
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,212
We'll pretend it's a cake.

307
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,715
Is it your birthday?
You're not the one paying…

308
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,066
My goodness. You should stop.

309
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,110
What if the man dies or something?
You're going too far.

310
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,030
Round up everyone here!

311
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,458
End the martial law!

312
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,460
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

313
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,253
Denounce media corruption!

314

-Denounce media corruption!
-Denounce media corruption!

315
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,591
End the unlawful firearms training!

316
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,218
-End the unlawful training!
-End the unlawful training!

317
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,012
-This is a democratic nation!

00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,973

00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
End the martial law!

320
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,393
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

321
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,479
Denounce media corruption!

322
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,481
-Denounce media corruption!
-Denounce media corruption!

323
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,733
-Take your positions!
-End the unlawful training!

324
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,527
-End the unlawful training!
-End the unlawful training!

325
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,278
Denounce media corruption!

326
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,114
-Denounce media corruption!
-Denounce media corruption!

327
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,908
-This is a democratic nation!
-This is a democratic nation!

328
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,661
-End the martial law!
-End the martial law!

329
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,622
And halt!

330
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:40,669
-Until Mount Baekdu is worn away
-Until Mount Baekdu is worn away

331
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:45,006
-And the East Sea runs dry

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,553

-Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea
-Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea

335
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,940
-Aim!
-Such a splendid land

336
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,912
What's that sound?

337
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,092
RELEASE ALL ARRESTED STUDENTS!

338
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,237
RELEASE ALL ARRESTED STUDENTS!

339
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,633
Run. Run, now!

340
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,479
Come on, run!

341
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,589
I told you all to leave!

342
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,926
There aren't any tickets.
No tickets at all.

343
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,804
Goodness, why is everyone gathered
around here?

344
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,348
What do you mean?

345
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,225
There aren't any bus tickets?

346
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,813
My goodness. All the Gwangju-bound buses
aren't running at the moment.

347
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,774
Then how can I get to Gwangju?

348
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,693
I guess you'd have to walk.

349
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,194
No vehicle is allowed to enter.

350
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,030
You don't have any tickets left?

351
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,199
Goodness, no.
There are absolutely no tickets.

352
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,368
What do I do?

353
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,206
Excuse me. If you have an extra map,
may I borrow it?

354
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,750
You'll actually walk there?

355
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,795
Everyone's trying to flee Gwangju now.
Why would you go there?

356
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,592
It'll take him over three months
to get there with that limp.

357
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,636
My gosh… I'm looking for Lee Jin-a.

358
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,221
Lee Jin-a. Jin-a…

359
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,559
Excuse me…

360
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,271
Myeong-hee.

361
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,109
Jin-a…

362
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,864
My dear.

363
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,952
Jin-a.

364
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,832
Jin-a, Daddy is here.

365
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,752
Jin-a.

366
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,298
Open your eyes, please.

367
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,177
She regained her consciousness
in the morning.

368
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,679
She's just asleep now
because of the drugs.

369
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,889
So don't worry.

370
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,433
Thankfully, the surgery went well.

371
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,813
Yes, Myeong-hee told me everything.

372
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,191
Thank you, Mr. Hwang.

373
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,278
I didn't really do anything.

374
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,241
It would've been dangerous
if it weren't for Hui-tae.

375
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,953
He saved her life.

376
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,422
Thank you, Mr. Hwang.

377
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,304
My gosh… Thank you so much
for saving Jin-a's life.

378
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,563
Right, Myeong-hee.

379
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,774
Go to the ER and say goodbye to everyone.

380
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,360
I'll go see Seok-chul and join you.

381
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,156
Sure. Take your time.

382
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,536
Myeong-hee.

383
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,499
I forgot to say this earlier
because I was so frazzled.

384
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,336
On my way here, I saw the protest.

385
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,589
And the soldiers
were beating up the protesters

386
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,799
and even firing their guns.
It was utter chaos.

387
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,303
You didn't know what was going on,
so you must've been shocked.

388
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,514
I sure was shocked,
but that's not important. Your…

389
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,480
Your brother. Is he still in Gwangju?

390
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,274
My brother? Why do you ask?

391
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,319
I can't stop thinking

392
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,239
that I saw your little brother
in that mayhem.

393
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,873
The kid looked just like your brother.

394
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,876
He was wearing a tracksuit
like your brother.

395
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,716
Gosh. But I couldn't go up to him

396
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,885
because I was dodging bullets
in that chaos.

397
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,480
Please… No…

398
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,492
Goodness, the phone's been ringing
off the hook.

399
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,122
We're training strictly
within the training camp.

400
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,668
You'd like to speak to him?

401
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,586
Just a moment, please.

402
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,258
Hey, Digestive Drink.
Your sister's on the phone.

403
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,261
Kim Myeong-su.

404
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,473
What's going on?

405
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,725
Where is Myeong-su?

406
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,646
It hurts so much…

407
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,732
Doctor, please hurry.

408
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,982
What happened? Why are there
so many patients with gunshot wounds?

409
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,817
The troops opened fire on civilians.

410
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,652
The soldiers shot them?

411
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,322
Are these all the victims?

412
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,866
The victims in the streets
would fill an entire truck.

413
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,201
We're already so short-staffed.

414
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,120
But we were told
they'd even shoot ambulances,

415
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,955
so no one wants to go out there.

416
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,124
What? They'll shoot ambulances?

417
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,086
They even shoot little kids.
They obviously don't care.

418
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,089
Let's go out there and help.

419
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,051
We can't let people die in the streets.

420
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,012
Let's take our cars
and pick up the injured.

421
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,181
Who wants to come with me?

422
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,776
Goodness, please help her.

423
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,112
-Doctor, will my son be okay?
-Of course.

424
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,698
Have you lost your mind?
Where are you going?

425
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,659
I'm going to get patients.

426
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,203
There are people
with gunshot wounds everywhere.

427
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,623
They're not the only people out there.
There are soldiers everywhere too.

428
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,750
Should we just sit back and watch?

429
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,877
Someone has to go there.

430
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,838
But why does that someone have to be you?

431
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,423
Do you have two lives?

432
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,137
I have to go.

433
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,931
Stop being so righteous!

434
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:58,142
Don't tell me what to do!

435
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,661
What do you think you're doing? Get out.

436
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,830
I'm not getting out until you do.

437
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,375
Get out. You don't have to do this.

438
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,585
Don't tell me what to do.

439
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,842
Mr. Hwang, are you coming with us?

440
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,760
Yes.

441
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,029
Man, I can't believe this.

442
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,697
Doctor, this way.

443
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,038
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

444
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,041
Myeong-hee, I'll carry her on my back.

445
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,669
Careful, easy.

446
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,974
Let's go. Get in the ambulance! Hurry!

447
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,226
Myeong-hee, get in. Hurry.

448
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,937
Get in. Hurry up.

449
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,584
If you leave it tangled,

450
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,919
it's your loss,

451
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,255
whether it's your shoelaces or training.

452
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,883
Isn't running fast
the most important thing to you?

453
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,530
Where are you going?
Get in the car. Let's get out of here.

454
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,366
Hui-tae, I hear a kid crying
from over there.

455
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,701
Are you out of your mind?
The soldiers are firing.

456
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,539
I must go. I have to go check!

457
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,041
Kim Myeong-hee!

458
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,168
What if it's Myeong-su?

459
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,631
Why would he be here now?

460
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,967
Mr. Lee said he saw Myeong-su.

461
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,136
He saw him here all lost
when the soldiers were firing.

462
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,222
That's Myeong-su's shoe.

463
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,815
Myeong-hee. Myeong-hee!

464
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,615
Darn it. Who's that wench?

465
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,452
I got this. I'll go get her, sir.

466
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,038
Hey!

467
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,592
Myeong-su.

468
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,802
Myeong-su.

469
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,787
If you don't want to shoot anyone,
arrest them quickly

470
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,623
before someone else shoots.

471
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,267
Kim Gyeong-su.

472
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,945
Hui-tae.

473
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,707
Myeong-hee, what are you doing?
Get in! Mr. Hwang!

474
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,300
Myeong-hee, let's go.

475
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
Come on, Myeong-hee.

476
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,846
-Get in, Myeong-hee.
-Quick!

477
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,036
Myeong-hee.

478
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,122
Myeong-hee!

479
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,433
Goodness. How will you find them
in this mayhem?

480
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,477
Please fix a meal for the kids
if I'm late.

481
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,567
You rascals!

482
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,278
Coach, the North Korean army…

483
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,239
The North Korean army
has invaded our country!

484
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:46,991
What?

485
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,046
Be careful.

486
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,964
Go.

487
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,771
Are you two all right?

488
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,441
Your brother called earlier.

489
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,110
He says he's back
at the training camp safe and sound.

490
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,985
Stop. What brings you here?

491
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,656
Good day, sir.

492
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,283
I have some urgent business in Gwangju.

493
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,077
Civilians are not allowed to pass.
Please go back.

494
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,788
Sir.

495
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,166
I'm a vendor at Yangdong Market.

496
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,710
My kids are in Gwangju at the moment.

497
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,255
Please let me through.

498
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,394
One per person, okay?

499
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,729
Those who have served in the army
get first dibs.

500
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,273
Come forward.

501
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,032
Hey.

502
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,368
Where did you guys get the guns?

503
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,454
We got them
from the Reserve Forces' armory.

504
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,290
What are you planning to do with the guns?

505
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,750
You want to wage war
against armed soldiers?

506
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,795
Then what? Are we supposed to
do nothing and just let them shoot?

507
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,091
Did you not see the flyers
they distributed today?

508
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,052
They're trying to make us
look like mere rioters.

509
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,596
Why give them a reason…

510
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,433
They're massacring civilians.
Why must we remain immaculate?

511
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,977
Is it lawful for soldiers
to shoot innocent civilians?

512
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,312
And is it unlawful to go against it?

513
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,481
What is the law to begin with?

514
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,609
The law was made
so the people could be protected.

515
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,326
You do what you need to do.
I'm going to do what I think is right.

516
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,288
Those who have served in the army
get first dibs.

517
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,664
Come forward.

518
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,879
Are you sure it's Lee Su-chan?

519
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,841
Don't bother. I'll handle it myself.

520
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,470
Okay, keep me updated.

521
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,600
What was that call about?

522
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,060
Well,

523
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,480
the rioters robbed another armory.

524
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,192
Things are going according to plan.

525
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,944
HEAD OF ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATION,
HWANG GI-NAM

526
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,654
Why do you look so worried?

527
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,281
Is it because of your son?

528
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,160
My son? What do you mean?

529
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,037
Well…

530
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,415
Your son was arrested in the past

531
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,293
while helping the commies.

532
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,673
Well, that…

533
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,677
If you mean his arrest
for treating a suspect,

534
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,513
it was just a misunderstanding
that happened

535
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,849
because my son is a medical student.
They released him right away.

536
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,563
So he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

537
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,524
Then I'm relieved.

538
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,943
But you know…

539
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,116
Your son.

540
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,368
Where is he now?

541
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,998
He recently moved to Seoul
with his fiancee.

542
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,917
He's in Seoul now?

543
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,003
Are you sure?

544
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:15,342
Sir, are you here to keep an eye on me?

545
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,934
I'm saying this just in case.

546
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,228
Make sure your son stays away
from trouble.

547
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,273
If he gets caught
in the wrong place again,

548
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,317
it'll definitely look suspicious.

549
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,023
This punk…

550
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,039
Myeong-hee.

551
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,153
Hui-tae, you were right.

552
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,449
I'm a hypocrite.

553
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,456
Earlier, in that alleyway

554
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,793
the moment I checked the face
of that injured kid,

555
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,714
I felt relieved

556
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,717
because it wasn't Myeong-su.

557
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,055
He was probably someone's son

558
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,141
and someone's little brother too.

559
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,729
But at that moment, I felt relieved.

560
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,864
Is that wrong?

561
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,911
I feel relieved too whenever I see that

562
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,456
you're not the one who's been hurt.

563
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,086
Is it wrong to hope for someone you love

564
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,338
to be safe?

565
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,426
If that's the case,
I'll just be a bad person then.

566
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,813
Nice people always tend to regret
their wrongdoings.

567
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,025
Bad people feel nothing at all.

568
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,405
A real hypocrite

569
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,658
never thinks of him or herself
as a hypocrite.

570
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,330
I didn't tell you about Myeong-su

571
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,875
on purpose.

572
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,795
In case you wouldn't let me go.

573
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,714
You did the right thing.

574
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,094
If I knew it was because of Myeong-su,
I would've never let you go.

575
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,888
I would've gone alone.

576
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,227
Is it okay for you to be in danger
but not me?

577
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,442
Well, I have nothing left.

578
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,571
Even if something happens to me,

579
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,574
you'll have Myeong-su

580
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,743
and your parents.

581
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,122
But if I lose you, I'll have nothing left.

582
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:21,838
So from now on, just leave it to me
when it comes to doing dangerous things.

583
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,639
I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm asking you.

584
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:58,792
Come on, no need to worry.
I'm just feeling a bit cold.

585
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,510
What's going on out there?

586
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,804
Did the North Korean Army
really invade us?

587
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,599
It's not the North Korean army.

588
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,269
It's our own army.

589
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,813
I'm telling you,
it's the North Korean army.

590
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:23,150
Why would our soldiers
shoot our own people?

591
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,403
Why did the soldiers suddenly turn bad?

592
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:31,617
Guys, don't you remember Mazinger Z?
The real villain was Dr. Hell,

593
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,827
who tried to conquer the world.

594
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,621
There's probably a real villain

595
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,248
who's controlling the soldiers
like his puppets.

596
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,092
Take that punk away.

597
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,762
Let's get going.

598
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,058
-Hey, you!
-Come over here!

599
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,272
-Come here!
-Follow me.

600
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,568
-Let go of me!
-Take him away.

601
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,706
Then…

602
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,292
Who's the real villain?

603
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,836
What is he trying to conquer?

604
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,632
I can't stand this childish nonsense.

605
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,531
Mr. Hwang.

606
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,664
So I've come to help you after all.

607
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,500
I won't help you twice, so be careful.

608
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,503
By the way,

609
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,589
do you know where your sister is?

610
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,550
I can't reach her.

611
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,935
There's a car waiting outside,

612
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,147
so don't go outside
and take care of yourself for now.

613
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,899
Sir.

614
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,486
Please release the others too.

615
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,699
They're all innocent people
who were dragged here. Please.

616
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,828
At least the injured, or the kids…

617
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,379
Stop blabbering
and just live a quiet life.

618
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:54,634
I'm holding myself back
from throwing your whole family in prison.

619
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,447
Stop moving around, you punks.

620
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:22,078
Private Kim Gyeong-su
still doesn't want to fire his weapon.

621
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,085
Open your eyes.
You should see this yourself.

622
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,671
See how much they're suffering
because of you.

623
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,049
What do you think?

624
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,802
Do you think you can shoot now?

625
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,434
I knew it.

626
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,686
You don't care
if your comrades die or not.

627
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,898
All you care about
are those hopeless rebels.

628
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,910
Get back up, you punk.

629
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,204
Kim Gyeong-su.

630
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,249
You're not a good person.

631
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:12,212
There's no such thing
as a good person to begin with.

632
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,589
It's all about making the best choice
for each moment.

633
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,426
But…

634
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,389
You don't force others
to make that choice for you.

635
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,267
That doesn't make you a good person.

636
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,352
It just means you're strong.

637
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,605
I like you because you're a strong person.

638
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,528
She was a nurse.

639
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,160
What?

640
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,372
I can't shoot someone who isn't a rebel.

641
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,317
Myeong-hee, what are you doing?
Get in! Mr. Hwang!

642
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,487
Come on!

643
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,705
Seok-chul is alive.

644
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,127
She's in Gwangju right now.

645
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,628
You don't have to give me a ride.

646
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,547
I'm just dropping you off
on my way to get more blood.

647
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,717
I can do that much for a comrade who
shared a near-death experience with me.

648
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,387
Shall I drop you off at the station?

649
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,013
How about

650
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,891
we go see Myeong-su
before going to the station?

651
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,853
Can we?

652
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,232
You'll feel reassured
once you see that he's okay.

653
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,442
You should give him back his shoes too.

654
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,530
Goodness, all this romance
is making me cringe.

655
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,491
Then what? Where shall I drop you off?

656
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,786
-It's near the terminal…
-Myeong-hee.

657
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,923
What are you doing here?

658
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,719
Just come with me.
Myeong-su is waiting too.

659
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,596
We were headed to his camp right now--

660
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,015
Let's go back to Naju.

661
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,684
We should get out of this place right now.

662
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,644
Just take Myeong-su with you.

663
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,896
-I can take care of myself.
-Kim Myeong-hee!

664
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,701
I'll go help Dr. Yoo for a bit.

665
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,327
No, you don't have to.

666
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,164
My, I'm relieved. We're short-handed here.

667
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,082
I'll go start the ambulance.

668
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,045
I'll leave you to talk.

669
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,596
GWANGJU PEACE HOSPITAL

670
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,209
How can a father and daughter
be so icy to each other?

671
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,961
It won't be easy for you
once you get married.

672
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,257
Now I know
how she turned out so hard-boiled.

673
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,927
"Hard-boiled"? No way.

674
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,930
She's as soft as tofu. It worries me.

675
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,934
You must be blinded by love.
And there's nothing you can do about that.

676
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,566
Anyway, how did the other hospital
get so much blood?

677
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,276
Through donations.

678
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,737
They got that much
from employee donations?

679
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,489
No, from the citizens.

680
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,741
They made announcements
about a blood shortage,

681
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,202
and people are still lining up
to donate their blood.

682
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,676
Why? Is it a piece you like?

683
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,388
Not me. My friend likes it.

684
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,103
What in the world?

685
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,375
GWANGJU PEACE HOSPITAL

686
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,879
How many times must I tell you?
I'm not going.

687
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,592
Why? Did he ask you to stay with him?

688
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,760
Does he want to marry you?

689
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,305
Stay out of my life.

690
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,098
What about his parents?

691
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,310
Do they even know you two are dating?

692
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:03,605
If he can't even introduce you to them,
how can you trust him?

693
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,609
You're going to regret this.
Let's go back to Naju with me.

694
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,778
Don't say that. You don't understand.

695
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,406
Ms. Kim!

696
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,495
Dr. Yoo and Mr. Hwang…

697
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,648
What are you talking about?
They left together.

698
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,483
But there was only one person there!

699
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,944
He might be dying somewhere
right this moment.

700
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,529
But there's nothing I can do.

701
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,240
I heard that he found Hui-tae
and has him now.

702
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,282
Did he really say that?

703
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,368
He's going to ruin your life in the end.

704
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,495
You're the one
who ruined my life, not him.

705
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,289
I'll kill everyone in your family.

706
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,627
Hui-tae might die.

707
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,628
What are you talking about?

708
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,172
I'll stay right here
even if lightning strikes

709
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,258
so that Hui-tae can find me.
