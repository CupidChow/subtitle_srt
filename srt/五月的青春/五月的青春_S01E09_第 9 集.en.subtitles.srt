1
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,322
We'll arrest everyone on the list
before the night is over.

2
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,411
We must find out who is behind all this,
so round them all up.

3
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,457
Every disaster is preceded
by warning signs.

4
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:52,886
Spies from the North
have infiltrated Gwangju to incite a coup.

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,472
If you encounter anyone
who seems to defy the government,

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,849
arrest them immediately. Understand?

7
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,850
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

8
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,936
Just like how you can smell gas
before an earthquake,

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,773
and just like animals ascend the mountains
before a tsunami.

10
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,365
-Stop right there!
-The strange, ominous feeling

11
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,619
that only those who are sensitive
can pick up.

12
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,015
Because I grew up with anxiety,

13
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,018
I was always sensitive and alert.

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,730
And now that I had someone to protect,

15
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,400
I had to be more alert
to sense such warnings.

16
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,828
Why are you praying
first thing in the morning?

17
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,624
I prayed

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,379
that you wouldn't snore.

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,006
Liar.

20
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,261
Did I snore?

21
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,517
Sleep some more.
The sun hasn't come up yet.

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,603
Why are you changing the subject?
I asked you if I snored.

23
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,856
You didn't snore.

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,067
Come here.

25
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,378
Lads. Get your act together, okay?

26
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,380
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

27
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,090
Gosh.

28
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,759
I was wondering
why it was so quiet for a few days.

29
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,720
I guess we'll cry our eyes out again.

30
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,765
If they want us to do this,

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,894
shouldn't they at least give us
some gas masks? Goodness.

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,109
I'd like to report a missing person.

33
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,778
No. Is your child missing?

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,779
How old?

35
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,408
No, it's an adult. Age 26.

36
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,849
I had caught you red-handed…

37
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,434
What?

38
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,853
No, it's nothing.

39
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,566
Okay, so the missing person
is 26 years old.

40
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,026
Is it a female?

41
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,861
No, a male.

42
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,407
A male? Okay.

43
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,078
Then what is your relationship with him?

44
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,872
-Is he your boyfriend?
-Sorry?

45
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,086
No, he's my friend.

46
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,130
I see, a friend.

47
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,549
Has your friend gone missing?

48
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,677
You must be worried.

49
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,140
By any chance, did you receive
any accident reports last night?

50
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,227
No, not really.

51
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,645
Hold on.

52
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,189
Can you give me your number?

53
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,277
But what do you need my number for?

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,029
We need to know the number of
the person making the report.

55
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,074
I'll call you right away
if we receive news of an accident.

56
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,909
So…

57
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,831
Can you write down a number
where I can reach you?

58
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,959
It's standard procedure.

59
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,212
Okay.

60
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,677
The Government held an emergency meeting
at 9:30 p.m. last night

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,558
and decided to enforce
martial law nationwide as of 00:00 a.m.

62
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,059
What is he talking about?

63
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,145
-The government spokesperson
-Enforce martial law nationwide?

64
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,149
-commented at 11:30 p.m. last night…
-Didn't you read the paper yet?

65
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,484
They decided to enforce martial law
nationwide last night.

66
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:23,448
On these grounds,
starting 2400 hours, May 17, 1980,

67
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,992
the emergency martial law
is in effect nationwide.

68
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,536
Considering the current situation…

69
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,371
Wait a minute, ma'am…

70
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,000
-The entire nation is deemed to be
-What?

71
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,045
in a state of emergency,
and as of 2400 hours, May 17,

72
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,130
-the emergency martial law
-Come on, what's this?

73
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,381
is in effect nationwide.

74
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
Myeong-hee.

75
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,775
Before we go, let's drop by Hye-gun's.
I need to get some stuff.

76
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,569
Then why don't we split up
and meet back here?

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,864
Why do you want to split up?
Where are you going?

78
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,824
I want to go see Myeong-su.

79
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,576
I just want to say goodbye.

80
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,369
No. Let me go with you.

81
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,873
What if you come with me
and bump into Jeong-tae?

82
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,501
Then I'll stay hidden somewhere.

83
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,795
It's just that I had a bad dream.

84
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,173
Gosh. Didn't you say
you wanted to leave as soon as possible?

85
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,009
We'll be able to save time
and leave earlier if we split up.

86
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,221
So let's go about our business
and meet back here, okay?

87
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,392
Okay then.

88
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,950
Isn't Su-ryeon answering yet?

89
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:49,951
No.

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,788
I heard there was a huge protest
in Seoul last time.

91
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,582
What if something happened to her?

92
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,752
Come on, I bet she's just busy.

93
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,755
They're probably looking around real hard
to find a new house.

94
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,551
Then shall I send your aunt
to check on her?

95
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,178
Gosh, they're not babies.

96
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,556
They're probably doing just fine.

97
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
I'll tell her to call you
once I get in touch with her.

98
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,728
So go to your room and get some rest.

99
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,398
Okay.

100
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,242
Hye-gun, I came to get my guitar…

101
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,005
Hye-gun. Jung Hye-gun!

102
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,508
You…

103
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,765
Hwang Hui-tae?

104
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,982
Hye-gun told me to come over last night
and we were supposed to meet here.

105
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,819
But when I came,
this place was totally empty.

106
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,323
The door wasn't locked,
and the chairs were all busted up.

107
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,414
They enforced martial law nationwide
last night.

108
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,917
The martial law
was in effect the whole time anyway.

109
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,795
Are you stupid?

110
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,049
This means that the new military regime
is on the verge of starting a coup.

111
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,178
I know. But what does that have to do
with Hye-gun's disappearance?

112
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm afraid the Defense Security Command

113
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,602
is behind this.

114
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,233
So

115
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,902
-I was thinking…
-No.

116
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,490
What? I didn't say anything yet.

117
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,825
It's obvious.

118
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,703
You want me to ask my father
if Hye-gun was taken, right?

119
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,332
Do you still not know
what kind of man my father is?

120
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,962
If I ask him, he won't stay still
and make matters ten times worse.

121
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,007
Things will turn more dangerous
if I get involved.

122
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,515
Then what will you do now?

123
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,852
You said Myeong-hee will be in danger
if she gets involved with you.

124
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,939
That's why we are leaving today.

125
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,276
What? Where to?

126
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,444
Anywhere.

127
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,654
As long as it isn't Gwangju.

128
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,949
If you're going to keep fighting,
go do it in Seoul.

129
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,287
If you're thinking of staying here,
wear a hat at least.

130
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,753
Seon-min?

131
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,923
Where's Hye-gun? Did he not come home?

132
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,557
Myeong-hee.

133
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,729
Hey, little bear.

134
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,773
Don't you have training today?

135
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,733
We're human beings too, you know.

136
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,193
We need our rest on Sundays.

137
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,445
What brings you here suddenly?

138
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,115
Myeong-su.

139
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,326
I…

140
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,288
will be leaving Gwangju for a while.

141
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,373
What? Why?

142
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,124
Why?

143
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,834
Where are you going?

144
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,170
When are you coming back?

145
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,132
-I'll call the training camp later--
-Are you going abroad?

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,844
You said you weren't going last time.

147
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,598
Goodness, I'm not going abroad.

148
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,185
I promised I'd go see you compete
at the Nationals.

149
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,939
I always keep my promise no matter what.

150
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,108
You know that, right?

151
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,403
Are you going alone?

152
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,364
I'm going with a friend.

153
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,825
That's good enough for me.

154
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,828
Promise you'll come to the Nationals.

155
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,246
You promised.

156
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
Goodness.

157
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,263
We need to take a detour
because of the protest.

158
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,390
Passengers headed to Geumnam-ro
or Gwangju Station

159
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:08,018
-must get off at this stop.
-Those darn demonstrations.

160
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,812
Don't they ever get tired of it?

161
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,021
Darn it.

162
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,399
-Wait a minute.
-What's going on?

163
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,359
What's happening?

164
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,946
Drag off all the college students!

165
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,125
Hey, come here.

166
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,171
I'm not a college student.
I'll show you my ID.

167
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,172
Come with me.

168
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,007
Let me go! I'm not a college student!

169
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,176
You brat, how dare you?

170
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,011
Do you think this is a joke?

171
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,680
You little…

172
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,533
Who are you?

173
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,576
What are you doing? Go after them!

174
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,459
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

175
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,296
No. I'm okay.

176
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,174
What on earth is going on?

177
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,803
I don't know.
I heard something about martial law.

178
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,764
The situation seems pretty serious.
Let's head to the station.

179
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,100
We'll be okay if we stay off the streets
and go around.

180
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,438
Hui-tae.

181
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,983
-Hui-tae…
-What? Why?

182
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,072
Darn, what is this?

183
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,619
I said I'm okay.

184
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,165
Hey, Myeong-hee. What brings you here?

185
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,295
-Hello.
-It's me again.

186
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,133
Myeong-hee, what are you doing here?
You're off today.

187
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,802
-I'm here as a guardian.
-What?

188
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,931
Who is this gentleman
being protected by you?

189
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,058
He has a guitar. Is he a singer?

190
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,686
His head is busted,
so maybe he's a college student.

191
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,062
He's my boyfriend.

192
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,106
Your boyfriend?

193
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,984
Is he really your boyfriend?

194
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,488
Yes. So please hurry up
and take a look at him.

195
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,992
Well, okay. Please have a seat.

196
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,874
Let me take a look at your wound.

197
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,086
Well…

198
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,840
He doesn't need any stitches,
but he may need a CT scan.

199
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,051
How long will a CT scan take?

200
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,094
You'll have to wait until this evening.

201
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,972
We have so many patients with head wounds.

202
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,726
Then I'll just leave
after you disinfect my wound.

203
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,187
Come on. Are you a doctor?

204
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,481
Give me that.

205
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,233
Myeong-hee's boyfriend, Mr. Hwang Hui-tae…

206
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,110
Hwang Hui-tae?

207
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,906
Your name sounds familiar.
Hwang Hui-tae… Hwang…

208
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,116
It's from the banner!

209
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,285
Are you that Hwang Hui-tae
who went to SNU with top marks?

210
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,996
My gosh. So you are a doctor, after all.

211
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,832
As per Dr. Hwang's self-diagnosis,
just disinfect his wound.

212
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,585
Please do a CT scan too. We'll wait.

213
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,753
Myeong-hee.

214
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,590
-Get ready for a CT scan.
-Yes, doctor.

215
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,389
Is this the CT Scan Room?

216
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,557
How many patients are waiting…

217
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,686
Myeong-hee, I'm really fine.

218
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,229
It's just a little scratch.

219
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,691
But that scratch is on your head.
You need to get a CT scan, at least.

220
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,404
Fine. Then let's get out of Gwangju first.

221
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,782
I'll get a CT done
as soon as we get to another city.

222
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,201
We're at a hospital right now.
What's the point?

223
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,744
We're not going anywhere
until you get tested.

224
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,080
Myeong-hee. Seriously…

225
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,374
Seriously what?

226
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,876
What's with that face?

227
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,630
If you're unhappy about something,
just tell me…

228
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,056
Stay still, you little punk.

229
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,770
All right. Let me ask you once more.

230
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,357
Who is behind the recent torch protest?

231
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,193
I already told you.

232
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,071
College students…

233
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,033
It was all college students
who came out voluntarily…

234
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,660
Are you kidding me?

235
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,666
I know there is someone behind you all.

236
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,669
He made you start a rebellion, didn't he?

237
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,088
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,305
I've never even met such a person.

239
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,601
Are you still enjoying this?

240
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,104
Hey.

241
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,023
Dip him.

242
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,567
No! I'm sorry!

243
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,736
-Get up, you punk.
-Please don't!

244
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,571
-Get off me.
-I'm sorry!

245
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,656
Please don't do this!

246
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,366
Go on in.

247
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,994
Go on in, you little…

248
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,215
Gosh.

249
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,847
Here.

250
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,852
Go ahead and eat.

251
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,562
You didn't even eat your dinner.

252
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,191
Thank you.

253
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,112
If I go home,

254
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,324
my father would probably
prepare a feast for me.

255
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,577
Are you from around here?

256
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,250
I was born and raised here.

257
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,133
Anyway, I wonder
how those spies crossed the border.

258
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,761
And why did they have to crawl
all the way down here to Gwangju?

259
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,934
By the way, Corporal Lee…

260
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,730
How do we tell rebels apart
from ordinary students?

261
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,819
Do you want to skip dinner tomorrow too?

262
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,238
Just follow the orders.

263
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,449
I'm sorry, sir.

264
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,743
The problem with smart ones is

265
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,080
that they think too much.

266
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,548
You don't have to stay here with me.

267
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,676
Forget it.
The test results aren't out yet.

268
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,802
I'm really fine.

269
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,929
Come on.

270
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,766
Thank you for waiting.

271
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,394
Here you go. Since you're a top student,

272
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,396
I'm sure I don't have to
explain anything to you.

273
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,939
Doctor.

274
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,650
Take it easy. I was just joking.

275
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,696
It's a concussion.
Luckily, there's no internal bleeding.

276
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,740
Are you still feeling dizzy and nauseous?

277
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,493
Not anymore. I'm totally fine now.

278
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,787
Come on. Don't shake your head like that.

279
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,790
Okay. Well then…

280
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,047
-What's that sound?
-It's curfew.

281
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,674
What? There are still a few hours
until curfew.

282
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,301
Didn't you know?

283
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,511
With the martial law expanded,
the curfew has been moved up.

284
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,055
Hold on.

285
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,098
What do we do then?

286
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,851
What else?
You're stuck here until morning.

287
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,645
-What?
-What?

288
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,648
Don't go wandering out after curfew
and get hit in the head.

289
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,317
You can sleep in the lobby
or in an empty treatment room.

290
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,153
Now if you please,
I need you to empty that bed.

291
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,364
Gosh.

292
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,137
I've never met anyone as stubborn as you.

293
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,767
I've never seen a grown man
throw a tantrum like you either.

294
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,894
I didn't do that.

295
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,899
If only we had gone straight
to the train station when I said…

296
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,110
Then you would've thrown up
on a moving train

297
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,861
from that concussion you have.

298
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,531
Exactly.

299
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,325
If we'd stayed together this morning,

300
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,494
I wouldn't have had a concussion
in the first place.

301
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,414
So what? Are you saying it's all my fault?

302
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,832
No, that's not it.

303
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,418
I don't like your tone.

304
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,880
Whatever. Just hurry up and lie down.

305
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,507
Come on.

306
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,177
I'll go and check
if there are any extra beds.

307
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,220
Hold on.

308
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,473
Why do you need an extra bed?
We can share the same bed.

309
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,728
Have you lost your mind? We can't do that.

310
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,646
What are you talking about? Last night…

311
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,608
-Gosh.
-You're embarrassing me.

312
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,444
Keep it down.

313
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,323
Last night, we shared a bed
even smaller than this one. So what?

314
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,074
Jeez.

315
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,578
Fine. You sleep in this bed.

316
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,122
-I'll go find an extra bed.
-Come on.

317
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,583
Forget it. I'll go.

318
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,376
You're a patient right now.

319
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,129
Stop talking and lie down.

320
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,548
-I can help you.
-Just lie down.

321
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,815
What a stubborn woman.

322
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,153
I like that.

323
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,325
Hello?

324
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,743
Su-chan, it's me.

325
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,997
Su-ryeon. Why is it so hard to reach you?

326
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,918
I'm sorry. I've been a little busy.

327
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,130
How's Dad? Is he feeling better?

328
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,638
Yes, he just took his medicine
and fell asleep.

329
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,724
What about you? Is everything okay?

330
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,229
I'm good. Is everything okay with you?

331
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,357
I heard there was chaos in Gwangju today.

332
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,195
Hello?

333
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,279
Lee Su-ryeon.

334
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,406
Where are you right now?

335
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,370
Where else? I'm at my place in Seoul.

336
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,998
Then hang up. I'll call your home.

337
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,167
No, you can't.

338
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,503
Hui-tae is asleep.

339
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,047
He's a light sleeper.

340
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,632
I'm going to bed now.

341
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,718
I'll call you tomorrow. Good night.

342
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,220
Hey, Su-ryeon.

343
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,037
Gosh.

344
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,385
What's wrong? Did it break earlier?

345
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,929
No, it's just a little scratch.

346
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,602
I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

347
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,190
I had a dream.

348
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,609
What's wrong? Was it a nightmare?

349
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,655
It was about what we saw
earlier in the day.

350
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,078
Why do you think the soldiers did that?

351
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,759
Myeong-hee, let me tell you a secret.

352
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,847
I've been struck by lightning,
a long time ago.

353
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,724
What?

354
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,227
-Really?
-Yes.

355
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,437
I went under an awning
to take cover from the rain,

356
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,897
and it hit my elbow like this.

357
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,650
Crazy, right?

358
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,903
I couldn't believe it either.

359
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,656
So all I did was study
how lightning works for a while.

360
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,034
But the reason was simple.

361
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,619
I was

362
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,205
right next to a payphone, that's why.

363
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,792
So I still try to avoid being close
to payphones whenever it rains.

364
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,798
The same goes for what happened today.

365
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,467
It's like being struck by lightning.

366
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,178
We just

367
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,723
happened to be standing
next to a payphone.

368
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,522
Everything will be fine
once we leave Gwangju tomorrow.

369
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,653
But what if it's like this
everywhere else?

370
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,702
Don't worry.

371
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,663
My intuition is always on point.

372
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,334
I'm almost like a human canary.

373
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,673
Okay, Mr. Human Canary.

374
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,174
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,012
Try playing the guitar
and see if it sounds okay.

376
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,598
But in return,

377
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,060
we must go to the station
as soon as we wake up. Don't be stubborn.

378
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,528
Let's see.

379
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,755
Attention.

380
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,881
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

381
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,883
It's supposed to rain in the afternoon,

382
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,886
so the training session will be
replaced by indoor practice.

383
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,971
-No!
-Darn it.

384
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,057
Be quiet.

385
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,105
We were stuck in our rooms
all day yesterday.

386
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,481
Do we have to
practice indoors again today?

387
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,817
You heard him.
It's supposed to rain later.

388
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,987
Then we can go out for a run
before it starts raining.

389
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,365
I feel all cooped up.

390
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,328
Things are getting tense
in the downtown area of Gwangju.

391
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,872
-We'll be okay.
-Make sure you lock it well.

392
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,131
-My gosh.
-Why are they taking them?

393
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,342
-Look at that!
-They're dragging him!

394
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,594
-My gosh!
-no!

395
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,347
-What are they doing?
-Did you see that?

396
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,769
It's gutsy of you
to gather around like this.

397
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,146
All of you, be on your way.

398
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,399
Officer. You saw that too!
How could you not stop them?

399
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,026
The police can't stop them.
So please, just go home.

400
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,779
Are soldiers above the law?

401
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,948
-Move aside.
-You'll get everyone killed!

402
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,742
Go home already.

403
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,961
Hey, let's just go to the bakery
and come back quickly.

404
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,671
The class won't start until later.

405
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,631
Didn't you hear what the teacher said?

406
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,842
We shouldn't go anywhere near downtown.

407
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,928
That just means we shouldn't protest.

408
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,806
-Did you actually believe it?
-Hey, come on.

409
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,189
Why are you doing this to me?

410
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,361
Hey, isn't that the director?

411
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,574
My gosh. It is him.

412
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,869
Don't hit innocent people!

413
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,040
-Don't hit him!
-Stop this now!

414
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,292
Don't hit our teacher!

415
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,092
What? What is going on?

416
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,471
Hey, let's go. Come on.

417
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,564
EMERGENCY ROOM

418
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,441
Myeong-hee.

419
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,035
What do you think you're doing?

420
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,329
You promised you'd leave with me
in the morning.

421
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,332
The hospital is full of patients,
and we're running out of beds.

422
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,960
-You saw it yourself.
-I did. That's why I'm saying this.

423
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,504
Can't you see?
This isn't a normal situation.

424
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,006
No, it isn't.

425
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,758
Are you telling me
to leave my patients behind?

426
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,218
Yes, let's just go.

427
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,345
Hui-tae.

428
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,598
You might be disappointed in me,
but I can't help it.

429
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,017
For me, our safety comes first.

430
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,768
I do understand.

431
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,271
But can't you wait
until the worst is over?

432
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,526
No. We must leave immediately.
Don't you understand what's going on here?

433
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,987
Why are you two just standing around?

434
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:50,450
Even interns from other departments
and students are helping out.

435
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,870
I wonder why Mr. Hwang, the top student
with a medical license, isn't.

436
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,082
If you want to help out,
put it on and step inside.

437
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,001
If you don't want to,
give it to Myeong-hee and leave.

438
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,296
Only medical staff are allowed
in the Emergency Room.

439
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,592
I can't leave right now.

440
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,801
Myeong-hee!

441
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,274
Okay. 7 p.m.

442
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,151
What?

443
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,820
We're leaving at 7 p.m. sharp.

444
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,281
I'll carry you out on my shoulders
if I must.

445
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,576
Gosh, I can't believe this.

446
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,121
The one who loves more always loses.

447
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,583
-Hui-tae, if you feel uncomfortable--
-I said 7 p.m., okay?

448
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,426
Yes.

449
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,679
Then we'll proceed as planned.

450
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,599
Pardon? The martial law?

451
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,769
No, that's no problem.

452
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,231
It's not going to have much impact
on the general public.

453
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,774
We'll proceed as planned.

454
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,152
Man, this is bad.

455
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,363
What if they barge in here too?

456
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,908
Aren't you going for lunch?

457
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,997
Why? Is everything okay?

458
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,791
The thing is…

459
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,712
There's a big ruckus outside
because of the martial law.

460
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:32,218
If you're worried,
you can leave early today.

461
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,680
Well, that's not why we brought it up.

462
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,182
Goodness. Just go home.

463
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,268
Your family must be
waiting for you at home.

464
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,730
I'll also head home
as soon as I wrap things up.

465
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,194
Come on!

466
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,583
Hey, what are you doing here?

467
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,047
He's my little brother.

468
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,090
You said you were going to the academy.

469
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,760
I'll take him.

470
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,600
You wench!

471
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,439
All of you, on your knees.
And hands behind the back.

472
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,357
Your head on the ground.

473
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,529
-Head on the ground, you punk!
-My goodness.

474
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,951
When will you be here?

475
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,079
-In five minutes, sir.
-Five minutes?

476
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,373
Why are you standing around? Get them!

477
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,543
Go get them.

478
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll watch these punks.

479
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,010
Keep your head down!

480
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,560
They're gone. Get up.

481
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,063
Hey, look at me.

482
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,899
Mr. Officer.

483
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,528
Everyone, get up.

484
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,488
It's okay. It's all right.

485
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,741
There are a lot of soldiers over there,
so go this way.

486
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,327
What are you waiting for? Run!

487
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,745
-Really?
-Yes, it's okay.

488
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,288
Come on. Let's go.

489
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,040
-Go, hurry.
-Come on.

490
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,959
Let's get out of here.

491
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,922
-Will you be okay though?
-Yes, just go.

492
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,108
Su-chan.

493
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,701
You said you were in Seoul last night.

494
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,081
Did you come back to Gwangju
with Hui-tae today?

495
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,043
Yes, this morning.

496
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,545
You're lying again!

497
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,091
Do you think I'm an idiot?

498
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,763
You said I could come back
if things don't work out.

499
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,891
That's why I came back.

500
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,895
When I said you could come back,

501
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,940
I didn't mean you could join the protest
and take part in that ruckus.

502
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,152
I didn't join the protest,
nor did I take part in the ruckus.

503
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,278
You didn't?

504
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,615
You were being chased by soldiers,
covered in blood.

505
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,744
-Are you still going to deny it?
-Su-chan, this isn't a normal situation.

506
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,247
I saw the soldiers dragging a kid
barely old enough to be in middle school.

507
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,043
Would you have done nothing
if you'd seen it?

508
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,961
Are you okay with them dragging you?

509
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,340
What would you have done
if you'd run into Mr. Hwang, not me?

510
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,553
You're still scared of him,
knowing what's going on?

511
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,181
Why? Are you afraid
he'd hurt your business?

512
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,225
No! I'm afraid he'd hurt you.

513
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,857
Mother said this one thing to me
in her final moments.

514
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,944
She asked me to look after you
in her place.

515
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,240
I can just close the business
if things go wrong.

516
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,783
But if something happens to you…

517
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,620
Dad is bedridden too,
so if something bad happens to you…

518
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,376
How would I live?

519
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,468
Let's go home, okay?

520
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,806
If this is an abnormal situation
like you said,

521
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,476
let's stay home until things calm down

522
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,813
and try to look for another way.

523
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,773
Okay?

524
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,319
You can look

525
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,446
for another way.

526
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,282
I'm not going home.

527
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,493
Su-ryeon.

528
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,748
Even if you throw yourself
into that mayhem,

529
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,419
nothing's going to change.

530
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,965
I may not be able to change anything,

531
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,637
but there are things I can do.

532
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,183
Tell Dad

533
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,893
that I'm

534
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,146
in Seoul.

535
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,191
Su-ryeon.

536
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,488
If you walk out that door now,

537
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,701
I'll no longer think of you as my family.

538
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,598
Mr. Hwang. Dress the wound
and use this to triage the patient.

539
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,807
-Pardon?
-Take this.

540
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,728
Write down the patient's symptoms,
name, and age, and stick it on him.

541
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,356
If the patient can't be identified,
just make up a name.

542
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,274
If anyone needs emergency surgery,
tell us right away.

543
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,319
Wait. I haven't even completed
my internship yet.

544
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,362
Why would you trust me with this?

545
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,863
You said you passed the exam.

546
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,282
-It's the same as the practical.
-But

547
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,493
he's not a simulated patient.

548
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,704
Just do it. I'm sure you're better
than that fool over there.

549
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,839
CHO YOUNG-HOON, 22

550
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,008
Coming through! Make way.

551
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:46,926
A new patient!

552
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,178
Doctor! Hurry!

553
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,180
Please treat him right away.

554
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,431
Hui-tae.

555
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,434
-This looks like a stab wound.
-A stab wound?

556
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,061
He's been stabbed with a bayonet.

557
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,855
The other patients waiting outside
all have stab wounds.

558
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,944
Excuse me. Move aside please.

559
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,155
Myeong-hee, get a saline drip started
and call Surgery.

560
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,907
-I'll see if we can book an OR now.
-Okay.

561
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,742
Sorry, excuse me.

562
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,747
EMERGENCY ROOM

563
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,457
Send them to the OR in this order.

564
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,418
-For this, just suture the wounds.
-Okay.

565
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,128
Excuse me, doctor.

566
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,755
When will Kim Bong-seok get his surgery?

567
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,800
Kim Bong-seok?
We booked his surgery just now.

568
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,594
Really? Thank you so much.

569
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,347
Nurse, we need to go into
an emergency surgery.

570
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,933
A stab wound of the femoral artery.

571
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,102
What? What are you saying?

572
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,604
Who are you to change the order?

573
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,732
I'm sorry, but we must prioritize
emergency surgeries…

574
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,651
-My gosh!
-My son needs urgent care too.

575
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,404
He needs to undergo surgery immediately!

576
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,656
This patient will die
if he doesn't undergo surgery now.

577
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,117
Sir, please let go of this and…

578
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,077
Who do you think you are? The Almighty?

579
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,164
Are you the Almighty?
Who are you to decide who should go first?

580
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,876
If my son dies
because he can't get surgery now…

581
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,044
Will you take responsibility for it
if he dies?

582
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,174
-Will you take responsibility?
-Goodness, calm down!

583
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,759
This will only delay your son's surgery.

584
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,844
I'm sorry, doctor.

585
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,096
Hui-tae, we've finished triaging
all the patients,

586
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,389
so go back to ambulatory care.

587
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,433
-Let's go.
-Thank you, doctor.

588
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,642
Goodness.

589
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,049
Ms. Kim Bo-yeon?

590
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,344
I'll disinfect your wound
and stitch it up for you.

591
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,803
Hui-tae.

592
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,097
Jin-a.

593
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:08,234
Who knew I'd get to see you
in your white coat?

594
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,780
I see this brilliant light
radiating from you.

595
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,907
Is this what they call an aura?

596
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,037
Keep your mouth shut, will you?

597
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,084
It's done, but you'll have to
wait for the CT scan.

598
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,379
My, look at the precise stitches!

599
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,048
It almost looks like
you used a sewing machine.

600
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,094
Jin-a, are you all right? No injuries?

601
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,973
I'm totally fine. I'm very nimble,
unlike this slow turtle here.

602
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,560
They hit you on the head too. I heard it.

603
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,105
They hit you on the head?

604
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,440
It's nothing serious.

605
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,609
Just like a teacher's finger flick
when you doze off in class.

606
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,153
Let me have a look.

607
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,704
Keep your eyes on my finger.

608
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,671
My gosh, what is this?

609
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,506
You crazy fool!

610
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,757
Your friend is dying here

611
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,009
and you get excited enough
to get a nosebleed?

612
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,552
Do you have a death wish?

613
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,806
Hui-tae, this isn't
because I'm overexcited or anything…

614
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,516
You should get checked out
by a doctor too.

615
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,562
Myeong-hee is over there,
so go register with her. Okay?

616
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,148
Mr. Hwang, you need to stitch up
these patients too.

617
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,149
Okay.

618
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,569
-Get yourself checked out.
-Okay.

619
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,284
What? You little…

620
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,245
Gosh, what should we do?

621
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,373
-What is going on?
-Why? Is something wrong?

622
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,958
I went to the supermarket

623
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,461
that opened over there
for some side dishes.

624
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,212
The owner of that place is from Gwangju.

625
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,090
He said Gwangju is
in a state of chaos right now.

626
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,885
Gwangju?

627
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,262
What do you mean, chaos?

628
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,764
He said soldiers

629
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,600
have taken over the streets of Gwangju.

630
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,685
It's as if a war has broken out.

631
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,979
That's plain nonsense.

632
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,441
If a war breaks out,
it would be on the front lines.

633
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,860
-Why would it be in Gwangju?
-Who knows?

634
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:19,114
Anyhow, he said soldiers are beating
young people up and arresting them.

635
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,741
It's a total mess.

636
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,330
Bo-yeon, it's time for your CT scan.

637
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,167
Where's Jin-a?

638
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,795
She went to call my family.

639
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,673
Did she register to see a doctor?

640
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,980
CASHIER

641
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,149
REGISTRATION

642
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,861
Excuse me.

643
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,696
Hey, In-young.

644
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,949
Is there another payphone besides that?

645
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,326
There's one in the Annex.

646
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,912
-It's through that corridor.
-Thanks.

647
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,044
I told her to see a doctor.
She just doesn't listen.

648
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,256
Goodness, that stubborn girl…

649
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,306
Jin-a!

650
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,271
Jin-a.

651
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,564
Jin-a!

652
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,630
Hello?

653
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,049
Is anyone there?

654
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,734
Hui-tae. Please save Seok-chul.

655
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,986
Please save her.

656
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,246
Jin-a, what is your dream?

657
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,415
My dream is to become a radio producer.

658
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,666
Can you show me around Seoul?

659
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,503
Show me TBC's broadcasting station
and your university too!

660
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,171
It's a Teacher's Day present.

661
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,508
Write a song that will win
the University Song Festival.

662
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,017
Hui-tae.

663
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,646
You must save her, no matter what.

664
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,243
In-young. Did you see Hui-tae?

665
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,454
He went to the Annex to make a phone call.

666
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,084
Why wouldn't he just use the phone
at the nurse's station?

667
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,352
Please.

668
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,315
Jin-a, please.

669
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,737
You said you wanted to go to
the TBC broadcasting station.

670
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,656
Please come back.

671
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,288
Hello?

672
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,207
Can anyone help me?

673
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,335
Hui-tae!

674
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,714
Myeong-hee. Please go and get help.

675
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,218
Jin-a, please.

676
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,888
Please come back, please.

677
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,401
Jin-a. Can you hear me? Jin-a.

678
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,848
Hang in there a little longer.

679
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,773
Be careful.

680
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,864
-Here, Seon-min.
-Okay.

681
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,242
YUSHIN REMNANTS, STEP DOWN!

682
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,077
Sir, are you okay?

683
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,329
Hang in there.

684
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,872
Gosh.

685
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,258
Hey!

686
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,427
Mister!

687
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,559
Mister. Hey!

688
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,061
Name…

689
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,438
What?

690
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,647
Your name…

691
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,860
Wait here.

692
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,995
I didn't get to…

693
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,006
Mister. Hey!

694
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,557
I had caught you red-handed…

695
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,434
What?

696
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,853
No, it's nothing.

697
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,648
Can you write down a number
where I can reach you?

698
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,860
Hey, look at me.

699
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,446
Mr. Officer.

700
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,115
-Will you be okay though?
-Yes, just go.

701
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,394
Mr. Officer.

702
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,858
Mr. Officer.

703
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,693
Mr. Officer!

704
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,324
Mr. Officer!

705
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,668
Please don't do this.

706
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,712
Do what? We didn't do anything.

707
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,173
I know.

708
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,883
Stop it.

709
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,470
She's just a young student.

710
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,597
Why are you harassing her?

711
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,890
Who are you?

712
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,559
Just let her go.

713
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,061
I can vouch for her…

714
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,504
Hui-tae.

715
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,512
The surgery went well,
and her vitals are stable.

716
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,472
She just went up to the recovery room.

717
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,152
Thank you so much.

718
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,490
If the CPR had been any later,
she wouldn't have made it.

719
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,576
Hui-tae,

720
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,287
you saved Jin-a.

721
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,806
We're already short of beds.
Patients are lying on mats in the lobby.

722
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,558
There's no way
we can accept more patients.

723
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,103
But we couldn't refuse to accept patients
in this situation.

724
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,063
Deputy Director.

725
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,523
More than half of the patients
are unidentified.

726
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,442
With their medical bills aside,

727
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,071
the military might suspect we teamed up
with the protestors and attack us too.

728
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,241
What kind of hospital refuses
to accept patients?

729
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,451
Deputy Director.

730
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,538
Close the main gate
and continue to accept patients.

731
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,959
The soldiers might see,
so turn off all the lights

732
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,251
except in the operating rooms
and the emergency room.

733
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,132
GWANGJU PEACE HOSPITAL

734
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,229
Eat even if you're not hungry.

735
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,148
You haven't eaten all day.

736
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,487
I guess

737
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,281
you really do have good intuition.

738
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,620
I saw Jin-a earlier,
and we even talked a little too.

739
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,999
But I didn't even notice she was hurt,

740
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,418
let alone see any warning signs.

741
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,004
She looked the same as usual to me.

742
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,551
See? I'm a human canary.

743
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,558
I'm sorry.

744
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,518
For what?

745
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,730
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

746
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,607
I put you through so much.

747
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,737
If I had believed your hunch

748
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,198
and left with you
either yesterday or today,

749
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,162
you wouldn't have had to go through this.

750
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,792
Thanks to your stubbornness,

751
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,128
Jin-a lived.

752
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,391
By nature,

753
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,560
I avoid risks before they happen.

754
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,231
You're a person who remains where you are
even when lightning strikes.

755
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,943
Anyway, thanks to you,

756
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,863
for the first time in my life,
I didn't run away

757
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,034
and could be there when Jin-a collapsed.

758
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,746
That means

759
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,791
your stubbornness saved Jin-a.

760
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,049
It's time.

761
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,551
Shall we head to the station now?

762
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,152
Let me tell you something
as the human canary.

763
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,405
Getting more patients with stab wounds

764
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,450
is not a good sign at all.

765
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,834
Let's wait until the worst is over.

766
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,213
Just until Jin-a wakes up.

767
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,969
Will that really be okay?

768
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,973
I don't know.

769
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,350
Maybe getting struck by lightning
made me reckless.

770
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,704
We had a belief
that we could handle anything together.

771
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,957
And that inexplicable belief

772
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,293
trumped all warning signs.

773
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,174
But little did we know…

774
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,720
Welcome, sir.

775
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,892
The lightning was also
nothing more than a warning sign.

776
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,731
What was actually coming toward us was

777
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,859
a tremendous storm.

778
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,492
Lights off.

779
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,996
In the face of the storm,

780
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,832
the only thing we could do was

781
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,420
hold each other's hands
so that we wouldn't lose each other.

782
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,033
I told you. Don't step in
unless you're told to.

783
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,702
-I get it. Stop nagging.
-"Stop nagging?"

784
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,579
Over here. A person has collapsed.

785
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,418
-I must go. I have to go check!
-Are you out of your mind?

786
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,255
-The soldiers are firing.
-That's Myeong-su's shoe.

787
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,923
You want to wage war
against armed soldiers?

788
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,759
They're massacring civilians.
Why must we remain immaculate?

789
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,512
Hui-tae, you were right.

790
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,764
I'm a hypocrite.
