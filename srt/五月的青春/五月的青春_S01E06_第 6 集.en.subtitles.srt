1
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,441
Are you okay?

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,318
No.

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,656
I'm not okay.

4
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,704
I don't want this May to pass by

5
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,374
without you.

6
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,207
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT,
HWANG HUI-TAE AND LEE SU-RYEON

7
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,773
Excuse me.

8
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,400
May I ask why you're here?

9
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,362
It's nothing.

10
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,365
Wait.

11
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,742
Thank you for coming such a long way.

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,119
-No problem.
-Congratulations.

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,038
When your children get married,
remember to invite me.

14
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,332
-I promise to be there.
-Sure.

15
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,458
Thank you so much.

16
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,919
-Congratulations once again.
-Thank you.

17
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,173
Don't forget to invite me
to your family events.

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,676
I'll be the first to congratulate you.

19
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,929
Once again, thank you so much for coming.

20
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,111
Su-ryeon.

21
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,281
Our guests are about to leave.
Where is Hui-tae?

22
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,535
It's been a while since I last saw him.
Did he get sick or what?

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,329
I sent him home.

24
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,582
What do you mean you sent him home?

25
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,128
Well, he wasn't feeling well
since this morning,

26
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,338
so I told him to go home
and get some rest.

27
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,173
My goodness.

28
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,843
But still, how could he really leave?

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,429
Can you believe this? Jeez.

30
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,908
What's wrong with Hui-tae?

31
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,246
I think he came down with a cold.

32
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,081
I see.

33
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,834
Myeong-hee was coughing all day long too.

34
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,711
I guess it's because
the seasons are changing.

35
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,090
Things were so hectic
that I didn't even notice her leaving.

36
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,634
Did you say goodbye to her?

37
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,429
Both of us were so busy,

38
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,389
so I guess she just left quietly.

39
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,894
You know how Myeong-hee
doesn't like to bother others.

40
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,190
-Su-ryeon.
-What?

41
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,317
You did great today.

42
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,820
Thanks.

43
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,531
It would've been nice
if Mom were here too.

44
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,708
Why can't I walk you all the way home?

45
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,170
It's right over there.
We're almost home anyway.

46
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,423
And I don't want…

47
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,760
You don't want Jin-a to see us
and cause a fuss?

48
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,847
Okay.

49
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,350
What are you doing tomorrow?

50
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,852
I need to work after going to church.

51
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,899
Then I'll schedule my lesson
for tomorrow evening.

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,735
So I can bump into you
when you get off work.

53
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,239
Why don't you just hand me
your work schedule?

54
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,907
So I can schedule our dates accordingly.

55
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,702
Sure thing.

56
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,749
Gosh, I guess this is why
people write song lyrics.

57
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,128
Since we can't talk on the phone

58
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,880
or look at a picture
when we miss each other.

59
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,591
The nights feel too long.

60
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,193
Can I take this with me?

61
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,321
So I can think of you.

62
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,916
What about me?

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,252
Shouldn't you give me something too?

64
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,923
I don't have anything to give you.
Shall I rip off a button?

65
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,483
I'll take this.

66
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,715
Hey, over there.

67
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,303
It's almost time for the curfew siren.
What are you two doing so late at night?

68
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,763
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,391
If you're not going to get a room,
go home already.

70
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,478
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-That's how the law is.

71
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,938
-Yes, I know.
-Okay.

72
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,108
Well, I'd better go home now.

73
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,361
Okay then. See you tomorrow, Myeong-hee.

74
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,654
Get home safe.

75
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
Good morning, Dad…

76
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,991
I heard you weren't
feeling well yesterday.

77
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,076
Do you feel better now?

78
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,246
Yes.

79
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,055
Do you think you can beat me now
that you're grown up?

80
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,308
Don't be mistaken.

81
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,978
All you can do is block my hand.

82
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,857
No matter what,
I'm always one step ahead of you.

83
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,987
Also…

84
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,285
If you ever disappoint me as my son
in front of people like that again,

85
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,496
it won't end with a slap.

86
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,915
Do you understand?

87
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,756
Sir, you have a guest.

88
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,828
You must've been tired
after the engagement ceremony.

89
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,288
You didn't have to.

90
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,458
I didn't get to pay my respects
before the ceremony,

91
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,587
and my father earnestly told me
to bring these gifts to you myself.

92
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,799
What a precious gift.

93
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
Please thank your father for me.

94
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,136
Okay.

95
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,974
Is the food ready?

96
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,016
Yes.

97
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,059
Where's Jeong-tae?

98
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,688
He went to a church retreat
and will be back tomorrow.

99
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,649
Let's go eat then.

100
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,928
-You…
-Wait.

101
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,806
If you're going to slap me,
slap me on this side.

102
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,936
What did you expect me to do
if you disappeared?

103
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,356
Do you know how hard it was
to come up with an excuse?

104
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,026
Sorry. Something came up suddenly.

105
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,322
I saw you last night
leaving with Myeong-hee.

106
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,783
What are you two thinking?

107
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,954
Whatever it is,
isn't it none of your business now?

108
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,665
We got engaged like you wanted,

109
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,293
and we'll maintain this
until the factory is completed.

110
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,878
That's as far as we go.

111
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,631
Why is it none of my business?

112
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,800
Like you just said,
we have to maintain this situation.

113
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,177
If people find out
about your relationship,

114
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,846
the engagement and everything else
will be ruined.

115
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,641
Got it. We'll be careful from now on.

116
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,142
Why do you sound so carefree?

117
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,605
To be honest, you guys are lucky
that I was the only one who saw you.

118
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,066
What if our family
or one of our guests saw you?

119
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,652
How would I explain it?

120
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,321
Why are you so angry?

121
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,199
Who says I'm angry?

122
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,117
Come inside for some snacks.

123
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,334
-Okay.
-Okay.

124
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,547
Gosh.

125
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,968
Show me your photo albums.

126
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,679
I'd love to see
how ugly you were as a kid.

127
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,349
I don't have any photo albums.

128
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,019
Is there anything you do have?

129
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,872
Who's this?

130
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,377
It's my mother.

131
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,003
What?

132
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,551
Not the one you saw downstairs,
but my birth mother.

133
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,346
That's the only photo of her
from before she got sick.

134
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,390
Goodness.

135
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,895
Why did you shove a photo of your mother
in the corner?

136
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,814
Frame it or something.

137
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,232
Gosh.

138
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,403
What about you?

139
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,698
I didn't see
a single photo of your mother either.

140
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,703
That's because I hid them
because seeing them makes me

141
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,788
miss her more.

142
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,418
I know the feeling.

143
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,008
How old were you when she passed away?

144
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,594
I was 12.

145
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,596
Goodness.

146
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,764
You were too young.

147
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,267
It must've been hard
to deal with all the events.

148
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,478
What events?

149
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,315
I mean, you must've missed her
on every sports day,

150
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,692
school entrance ceremony,
graduation, and such.

151
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,655
The only event that I had to deal with
alone was my high school graduation

152
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,157
and it was hard enough.

153
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,289
I was only forced to attend it
because I was the valedictorian.

154
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,677
-Thank you so much.
-Enjoy.

155
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,181
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

156
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,724
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

157
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,601
-Dig in.
-Thanks.

158
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,561
-This is so good.
-Enjoy.

159
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,774
They all need to be washed, right?
Give them to me.

160
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,779
Hye-gun.

161
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,532
Is something wrong?

162
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,408
Why are you ignoring me?

163
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,995
What's the matter? Tell me.

164
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,916
-I saw everything.
-What do you mean?

165
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,544
At Su-ryeon's engagement ceremony,

166
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,587
I saw you with…

167
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,839
Hui-tae.

168
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,387
How do you know each other?

169
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,140
No. More importantly,

170
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,851
what's going on between you two?

171
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,313
Hui-tae is Su-ryeon's fiance.

172
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,775
And you're her friend.

173
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,986
-Hye-gun.
-Does Su-ryeon know

174
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,531
what's going on

175
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,034
between you two?

176
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,700
Hello?

177
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,079
Master Hui-tae, this is for you.

178
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,790
Me?

179
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,503
Hello?

180
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,049
Hui-tae, are you feeling any better?

181
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,511
I feel like we haven't spent
enough time together.

182
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,388
How about we meet up this evening,
just us guys?

183
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,806
Well…

184
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,686
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.

185
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,856
Come on, don't be like that.
Please free up some time.

186
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,608
I promise it won't take long.

187
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,278
Well…

188
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,701
RESUME
HONG YONG-GIL

189
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,163
It's my cousin that I once talked about.

190
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,999
About Changhwa Pharmaceuticals,

191
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,544
the president seems inexperienced.

192
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,422
Wouldn't joint management be helpful?

193
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,722
I appreciate your thoughtful opinion,

194
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,141
but his father, Mr. Lee Chang-geun,

195
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,519
is already participating
in the management.

196
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,356
They won't be interested
in joint management.

197
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,234
This isn't like you.

198
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,904
Are you already trying to
protect your in-laws?

199
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,532
It's not like that, sir.

200
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
Thank you.

201
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,088
You know the president left
for the Middle East.

202
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,219
Emergency martial law
will be expanded soon.

203
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,722
The boat is about to set sail.

204
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,350
To get into the same boat,
this is your only chance.

205
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,564
Mr. Hwang.

206
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:08,485
Do you think the new government
will only last for five years?

207
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,237
You need to look far ahead.

208
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,115
You're too good
to be stuck where you are now.

209
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,877
You're absolutely right.
I'd like to pour you one.

210
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,921
Good.

211
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,885
Let me pour you one.

212
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,399
One more?

213
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,239
-Another bottle, please.
-Coming up.

214
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,699
Cheers.

215
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,539
This is nice.

216
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,209
You can slow down if you want.

217
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,377
You don't have to drink as fast as I do.

218
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,214
Goodness, you don't have
to worry about me.

219
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,257
Have two, okay?

220
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,972
So what's your plan now?

221
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,474
The wedding and everything.

222
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,892
Where will you live?

223
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,771
I guess we will go
with what our parents want.

224
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,778
Is that also why you had
an engagement ceremony?

225
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,613
Your parents made you do it?

226
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,495
What about Su-ryeon?

227
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,582
From going on that blind date
to the engagement, did she want all of it?

228
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,215
Listen, Hui-tae.

229
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,010
Just because you don't want this marriage,

230
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,974
it doesn't mean you don't have any
responsibilities and duties to fulfill.

231
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,685
I believe I'm fulfilling all my duties.

232
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,731
You can't say that.

233
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,861
You ran away
from your engagement ceremony.

234
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,704
Also, you didn't run away alone that day.

235
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,253
Excuse me.

236
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,131
May I ask why you're here?

237
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,508
It's nothing.

238
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,761
Wait.

239
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,616
Why did you want to see me today?

240
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,370
Whatever you're up to,
you should stop right now.

241
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,748
Don't do anything
you can't take responsibility for.

242
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm not doing anything
I can't take responsibility for.

243
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,589
Do you even know
what it means to take responsibility?

244
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,801
It means to make sure
no one gets hurt by your actions.

245
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,803
Even if everyone around you
becomes devastated,

246
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,680
do you think it's no problem
as long as you're okay?

247
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,391
How can you be so reckless?

248
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,786
Let me ask you something.

249
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,332
Are you sure you're angry
because of Su-ryeon?

250
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,418
What?

251
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,472
You can be responsible and do your duty.

252
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,601
It's more important for me
to not have any regrets.

253
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,899
The last one.

254
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,919
What? It's just you.
I thought it was Hui-tae.

255
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,839
Is he not here yet?

256
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,549
I thought you had a tutoring session
this evening.

257
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,510
I have no idea what's going on.
Did he forget about it?

258
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,185
Hold on. How did you know
I had a session this evening?

259
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,190
Well…

260
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,194
I'm here!

261
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,574
You're late.
I was getting worried about you.

262
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,875
The thing is…

263
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,463
I did all the homework, but…

264
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,133
I couldn't finish
writing the questions I got wrong.

265
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,469
My gosh, you finished all the homework?

266
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,555
Gosh, I gave you a lot of homework.

267
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,475
Good girl, Jin-a.

268
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,733
Hui-tae, did you drink?

269
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,193
Music is what?

270
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,112
-Math!
-That's right.

271
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,781
Go put on a song.

272
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,201
Show me your fine taste in music,
Director Jin-a.

273
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,537
Okay.

274
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,672
Do you want a Korean song or a pop song?

275
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,075
Hui-tae.

276
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,327
Hui-tae.

277
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,124
Hui-tae, wake up.

278
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
Hui-tae.

279
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,254
Hui-tae.

280
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,631
Hui-tae.

281
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,509
Wake up, Hui-tae.

282
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,765
Myeong-hee, this is the first time
dreaming of you.

283
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,187
Gosh, I guess you haven't sobered up yet.

284
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,316
Mr. Hwang.

285
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,027
Wake up and have some hangover soup.

286
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,337
Why am I here?

287
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,385
I told you to make soybean sprout soup.

288
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,180
Who'd want to eat spicy soup
in the morning?

289
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,515
I didn't make it for you.

290
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,475
Just eat your breakfast and go to school!

291
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,230
This is surely making my hangover go away.

292
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,402
I knew he'd have a discerning palate!

293
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:51,573
These Jeolla natives don't know
how good this is.

294
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,826
I'm also from Jeolla Province.

295
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,245
Born and raised in Gwangju.

296
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,416
Jeolla Province is indeed
famous for good food.

297
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,876
That's right.

298
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,423
You talk like a Seoul native.

299
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,800
I had no idea you were from Gwangju.

300
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,428
I guess you rarely use the dialect.

301
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,431
I do use it,

302
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,934
but my father is adamant about me
using Seoul accent.

303
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,770
Of course!

304
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:27,567
No wonder! A wise man
did a great job raising his son.

305
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,611
When my son was enlisting in the army,

306
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,613
I also emphasized to him

307
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,657
that he must be mindful of his dialect.

308
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,701
Fortunately, my son is half Gyeongsang
and half Jeolla,

309
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,496
so he can use both dialects freely.

310
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,581
He's like those people in border towns!

311
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,000
-Border towns?
-That's right.

312
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,961
I'm originally from Jinju.

313
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,671
It's too hot!

314
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,716
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

315
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,135
Do you have a girlfriend?

316
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,846
I'm asking you if you have a girlfriend.

317
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,060
Hey, I heard the girls who protest
sleep around a lot.

318
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,441
Come on. Tell me some stories.
Especially girls who work in factories.

319
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,402
I heard

320
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,655
they'd sleep with any college guys.

321
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,742
Have you hit on any factory girls?

322
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,912
No, I have not.

323
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,583
You look like you want to punch me.

324
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:31,214
If you don't have any stories to tell,
then make some up or something.

325
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,134
How dare you glare at me?

326
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,766
Am I eating seaweed soup with clams
or sand?

327
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,603
They should've removed the sand properly!

328
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,569
Darn it.

329
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,573
-Halt!
-One, two!

330
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,250
Hey.

331
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,377
Take a break.

332
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,379
This is exhausting.

333
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,636
Earlier…

334
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,555
Why did you do that?

335
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,640
I was going to take it up with him anyway.

336
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,269
He always speaks ill of Jeolla Province
in front of this Gwangju native.

337
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,523
Elite colleges and Jeolla Province
are his trigger.

338
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,109
But because of me…

339
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,277
It's okay.

340
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,863
That jerk will be discharged
in a month anyway.

341
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,575
It's so nice to talk comfortably
like this.

342
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,868
My goodness.

343
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,498
My best friend is also from Gwangju.

344
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,125
You little…

345
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,253
Gwangju's not so small
that everyone knows everyone.

346
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,385
-Quick.
-Okay.

347
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
RESUME
HONG YONG-GIL

348
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,556
What is this?

349
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,809
Joint management?

350
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,853
Don't think too much of it.

351
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,481
It's so the investors
can put their worries to rest.

352
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,983
Mr. Hwang, I'm a businessman.

353
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,778
I've overcome all sorts of hardships
in this industry.

354
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,947
Bribing people in high places…

355
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,866
Sure, I was prepared for it
and will deal with it.

356
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,034
But this is different.

357
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,413
You're asking me
to hand over the business to him.

358
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,456
This is practically robbery without a gun.

359
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,041
With a gun, I'd say.

360
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,132
RESUME
HONG YONG-GIL

361
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,719
I suggest you make a choice
that will damage you less.

362
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,721
Like a true businessman.

363
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,979
Myeong-hee.

364
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,985
I hope your hangover is gone.
Who did you drink with last night?

365
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,572
Just someone who makes me uncomfortable.

366
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,240
Right. Give me your work schedule.

367
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,577
-Were you being serious?
-Yes.

368
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,373
-I'm off today and tomorrow.
-Really?

369
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,501
Then let's hang out the whole time.

370
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,340
I mean, not including the night.

371
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,926
We can meet up two days in a row.

372
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,933
Can we spend the night together too?

373
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,523
Myeong-hee! A call for you!

374
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,192
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

375
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,405
Hey, Myeong-hee.

376
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,242
What time does your shift start today?

377
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,745
That's great.

378
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,747
Then…

379
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,459
Can Myeong-su sleepover
at your place tonight?

380
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,629
Your dad was going to pick him up
on his way home,

381
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,298
but he's not feeling well.

382
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,556
What time should I pick him up?

383
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,521
Okay.

384
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,439
All right.

385
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,074
Let's head out now.

386
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,410
No? Why not?

387
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,172
What a coincidence.

388
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,968
I can't believe Hui-tae's brother
is your roommate, Myeong-su.

389
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,725
Did I force you to come
when it's uncomfortable?

390
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,312
Don't worry.
He has nowhere else to go anyway.

391
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,941
He's supposed to be
at a church retreat. Right?

392
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,696
When he glares at you,
he's your spitting image.

393
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,030
-That's not true.
-That's not true.

394
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,782
Be polite to her.

395
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,661
That's so interesting.

396
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,247
They even say the same thing
at the same time.

397
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,640
Myeong-su, dig in.

398
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,142
But don't eat too fast, okay?

399
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,351
Okay.

400
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,563
He's obviously growing much faster
and needs more food.

401
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:42,817
Come on. He's done growing.

402
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,194
I was just as tall as Myeong-su
when I was 12.

403
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,780
Kids who grow later end up taller.

404
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,491
It's all nonsense, so don't listen to him.

405
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,951
Eat up now.

406
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,912
Here. Try it.

407
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,666
Hurry up and eat.

408
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,884
By the way,

409
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,637
what is your relationship?

410
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,853
That reminds me.

411
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,564
Your brother recently got engaged, right?

412
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,653
Wait, are you his fiancee?

413
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,113
What are you talking about?

414
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,950
We're just…

415
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,333
We're just friends. Eat up.

416
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,214
If you're just friends,
why are you so inseparable?

417
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,341
Gosh, what about you and Myeong-su?

418
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,052
You two always hang out
even though you're not engaged.

419
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,887
Hold on a second.

420
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,891
This is the last day you can take it easy
before the race, right?

421
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,935
Is there any place you want to go?

422
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,234
There is a place I want to go
with all of you.

423
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,194
We can do that.

424
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,071
Where is the place?

425
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,962
TICKET OFFICE

426
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,935
I can't believe
the first of our precious two days

427
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,604
is passing by like this.

428
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,399
It's not like we're spending
the entire time together.

429
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,069
And I had a lot of fun.

430
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,696
Didn't you have fun?

431
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,741
Do you know this feeling?

432
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,535
The feeling when you're eating sweet candy

433
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,706
and one of your molars is aching.

434
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,583
You can't really enjoy the candy

435
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:51,005
because you're distracted
by the pain in your tooth.

436
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,216
Why do you hate your brother so much?

437
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,013
You have no idea
how mean he usually is to me.

438
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,392
To me, it looks like
you're the one being mean to him.

439
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,519
What?

440
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,106
Jeong-tae may be tall,
but he's still only 12.

441
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,900
Do you want to fight with a kid?

442
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,027
Are you 12 too?

443
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,157
Forget it. You don't understand.

444
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,036
He may be young, but he can really be…

445
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,623
He pretends to be mature,
but he's still a little kid.

446
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,794
See?

447
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,547
Does he look like a grown-up to you?

448
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,928
There are things you can't hide
no matter how hard.

449
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,058
I think Jeong-tae
wants to become close to you.

450
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,395
That kid? To me?

451
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,189
Gosh.

452
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,816
No way.

453
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,942
That makes no sense.

454
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,570
Reach out to him first.

455
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,574
You're a grown-up, not a 12-year-old boy.

456
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,638
Su-ryeon.

457
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,516
JAEYOUNG CONFECTIONERY
ASSORTED GIFT SET

458
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,896
JAEYOUNG CONFECTIONERY
ASSORTED GIFT SET

459
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,482
DECLARATION FOR DEMOCRACY

460
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,988
It's not okay to print the first draft
as it is.

461
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,866
I made some revisions
to the draft you gave me.

462
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,826
Do you mean you printed all these…

463
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,953
by yourself?

464
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,497
I thought you'd need more flyers

465
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,041
for the upcoming street protests
and rallies.

466
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,170
I got so much arm exercise

467
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,005
from running the mimeograph.

468
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,506
Do you see this?

469
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,009
I can beat anything now.

470
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,307
After putting in so much work,
you must be disappointed.

471
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,601
Not at all.

472
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,438
I just feel bad
that I can't fight next to you.

473
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,650
Anyway,

474
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,445
I'll be printing flyers in my room.

475
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,407
Let me know
if I can help you with anything.

476
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,828
Thank you so much.

477
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,915
By the way,

478
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,708
are you okay?

479
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,502
What?

480
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,545
I mean…

481
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,423
Hui-tae and Myeong-hee.

482
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,220
Did she…

483
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,306
tell you too?

484
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,606
What do you mean? A woman problem?

485
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,902
I don't mean to badmouth
your future brother-in-law,

486
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,529
so this is a little awkward,

487
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,239
but you know

488
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,491
his family is quite complicated.

489
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,537
It wouldn't hurt to look into it
before the wedding.

490
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,122
Who knows?

491
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,833
He might have another woman in Seoul
like his father.

492
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,293
You're going too far.

493
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,837
You can never be sure.

494
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,964
He's used to it.

495
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,465
Even after he gets married,

496
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,594
what if he seduces an innocent lady
and has a child with her or something?

497
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,140
Enough of that.

498
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,017
Just bring me last year's
financial statements.

499
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,734
There are things you can't hide
no matter how hard.

500
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,946
I think Jeong-tae wants to
become close to you.

501
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,199
What are you looking at?

502
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,706
Aren't you tired of hating me yet?

503
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,499
What about you?

504
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,210
Aren't you tired of living with us yet?

505
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,589
Not at all. I love it.

506
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,008
I'm going to live with you
for the rest of my life.

507
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,594
Leech.

508
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,555
Let me ask you something.

509
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,515
Why do you hate me so much?

510
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,268
You give me no choice.

511
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,480
When someone hates me,

512
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,273
I can't help but fight back.

513
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,068
So don't show it.

514
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,361
Just ignore me.

515
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,322
Think of me as a gardener
who eats with you.

516
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,366
You keep pretending you're the real son.

517
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,122
People call my mom a mistress
since you moved in.

518
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,541
They say I'm the son of a mistress.

519
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,669
My parents and I are the real family.

520
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,631
I'm the legitimate son!

521
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,971
Is that what made you so anxious?

522
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,892
Gosh, you…

523
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,895
You are still a kid indeed.

524
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,651
You're right.

525
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,488
No matter how hard I try to hide it,

526
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,865
I can't change the fact that
I was born out of wedlock,

527
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,534
and you're the legitimate son.

528
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,121
So you don't need to be anxious.

529
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,666
Okay?

530
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,345
Don't tell anyone about Myeong-hee
and I'll do the same.

531
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,931
I wasn't going to tell anyone anyway.

532
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,474
Really?

533
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,398
Would other people think

534
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,567
that we look alike too?
Like Jeong-tae and his brother?

535
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,736
What? Me and this little bear?

536
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,906
We don't look alike at all.

537
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,665
Su-chan?

538
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,259
That must be your brother
you told me about last time.

539
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,846
He looks just like you when he smiles.

540
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,806
You think so?

541
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,060
By the way, why were you waiting for me?

542
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,524
Myeong-hee.

543
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,323
What's going on
between you and Hwang Hui-tae?

544
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,921
It's okay.

545
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,632
Mistakes can be rectified.

546
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,884
You're being fooled by him right now.

547
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,968
It's…

548
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,514
not a mistake.

549
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935
And I'm not being fooled.

550
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:06,315
Myeong-hee, Hwang Hui-tae
is not a good person.

551
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,235
You should not get involved with him.

552
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,362
But it is the choice I made.

553
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,492
All my life,

554
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,827
I put others first
and gave up on what I wanted.

555
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,914
I didn't have the courage to do otherwise.

556
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,543
And for the first time in my life,

557
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,796
I mustered up my courage
and chose Hui-tae.

558
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,759
Even if people bash me for it
and hurl stones at me,

559
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,679
I will put up with it

560
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,640
since I made the choice.

561
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,849
But why…

562
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,394
Why must you put up with people

563
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,855
pointing fingers at you
because of a jerk like him?

564
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,152
I'm sorry.

565
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,856
Just try them on.

566
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,482
Come on.

567
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,736
How pretty.

568
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,784
Myeong-hee, you made it.

569
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,711
Well, go on in.

570
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,962
Okay.

571
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,858
Hey, mister. Take this off at least.

572
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,526
Su-ryeon.

573
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,282
Do you like Hwang Hui-tae?

574
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,701
Gosh, you're drunk.

575
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,162
What's with this random question?

576
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,789
Answer my question.

577
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,584
Do you like Hwang Hui-tae?

578
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,380
Why would I get engaged to someone
I don't even like?

579
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,257
Then what about him?

580
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,470
Does he like you?

581
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,852
I don't know. Just sleep.

582
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,482
Goodness.

583
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,987
You and Myeong-hee both. Why…

584
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,915
Why fall for such a jerk?

585
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,260
I said I can take you there.

586
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,429
Come on. I'm not a baby.

587
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,348
I told you, if I had a map, I could walk
all the way to our home in Naju.

588
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,767
You stubborn rascal.

589
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,229
Watch out for cars.
You made sure to pack everything, right?

590
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,648
Yes. Just bring some fried chicken
next time.

591
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,697
You don't need to walk me out.

592
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,282
Bye!

593
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,837
I knew it! Did you forget something again?

594
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,730
I'm sorry about last time.

595
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,940
I know it was an important event.

596
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,150
You two…

597
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,694
Do you really have to do this?

598
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,449
I understand you like each other.

599
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,577
But why make it obvious to Hye-gun
and my brother too?

600
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,289
Must you make me look like an idiot
and cause all this?

601
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,291
Su-ryeon, I'm not trying to make a fuss.

602
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,545
-About Hye-gun and Su-chan--
-You're leaving anyway!

603
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,965
What?

604
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,846
You're leaving in less than a month.

605
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,768
You're only here for a few more weeks.
But to my family and me, this is…

606
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,899
This all sounds too familiar.

607
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,030
So if I leave,

608
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,700
all will be good again, like that time?

609
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,537
What?

610
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,335
Myeong-hee.

611
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:24,007
Is the priest at your church
one of the priests who got arrested?

612
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,097
I've got a good idea.

613
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,599
Do you want to do it with me?

614
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,017
What is it?

615
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,778
END THE OPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS

616
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,492
Hey, Hyun-ju. Read this.

617
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,994
Take a look.

618
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,163
-Read this.
-You're here.

619
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,082
You're early. Read this.

620
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,421
Kim Myeong-hee.

621
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,464
Come with us.

622
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,843
-Why…
-Come on.

623
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:08,844
Myeong-hee.

624
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,182
-Hey.
-What?

625
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,768
I heard Myeong-hee
submitted a letter of withdrawal.

626
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,187
-What?
-You know, because of the protest.

627
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,690
-But why just her?
-I don't know.

628
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,498
Is that

629
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,044
what you thought this whole time?

630
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,384
It must've been awful to have to hide it

631
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,638
while acting like a friend to my face
all these years.

632
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,293
My gosh! You scared me.

633
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,545
I nearly jumped out of my skin!

634
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,715
You speak with Jeolla dialect
whenever you're startled.

635
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,301
I wouldn't be startled
with the Seoul dialect, would I?

636
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,511
Goodness.

637
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,054
Hold on.

638
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,891
I came early,
but you got here earlier than I did.

639
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,268
I guess you missed me a lot.

640
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:41,937
No!

641
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,523
It's not that.

642
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,484
Today's our first official date.

643
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,069
Is there anything you want to do?

644
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,991
They're all just ordinary things.

645
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,453
What do you want to do?

646
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,249
Well…

647
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,336
If I tell you,

648
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,505
are you willing to do anything?

649
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,968
-Gosh.
-Hey!

650
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,095
What?

651
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,023
"Love and Peace?"

652
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:36,116
LOVE AND PEACE

653
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,493
-Don't come so close.
-What?

654
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,208
Myeong-hee's favorite butter bread.

655
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,835
Goodness, Hui-tae.

656
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,129
What? Stop taking them.

657
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,236
What are you doing?

658
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,822
Look at you. You look so stupid.

659
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,326
Here. Eat all of this.

660
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,259
LIKE THE LAST WILDFLOWER

661
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,770
RESUME
HONG YONG-GIL

662
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,859
A joint management with someone
I don't even know? What is this…

663
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,779
Okay.

664
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,990
I understand giving out bribes
is an old custom.

665
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,700
Getting involved like this
is an abuse of authority.

666
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,410
I can never allow this, Dad.

667
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,705
Do you think I don't know that?

668
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,210
I had no choice this time.

669
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,840
No matter how filthy it is,
what can we do?

670
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,883
We're about to become a family,
so we must oblige.

671
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,102
We shouldn't let this drag on.

672
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,312
Let's call off Su-ryeon's engagement.

673
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,732
What are you talking about?

674
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,985
That punk Hwang Hui-tae

675
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,863
is seeing someone else.

676
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,742
"Complete the lyrics for my song."

677
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,250
Wait. I requested this song.

678
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,630
Okay then. What else do you want to do?

679
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,799
What else?

680
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,762
I need to go to Naju.

681
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,640
It's been a while since I went.
All I did was call.

682
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,227
I'm planning on visiting
when I'm off next time.

683
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,857
"Visit home in Naju."

684
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,445
Open parenthesis, "With Hui-tae."

685
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:24,618
What? Why would you go there?
How will you introduce yourself?

686
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,537
What do you think?
I'll say I'm your boyfriend.

687
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,375
Once I put my mind to it,
I can make adults love me.

688
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,920
It's just that I don't
actually do that very often.

689
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,214
Promise me we'll go to Naju together.

690
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,970
Let's see. What else is there?

691
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,056
We have so many things to do.

692
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,398
The song you requested sounds so nice.

693
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,400
What's the title?

694
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,488
I'll tell you if you tell me first.

695
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,658
Mine is Nogoziri's "A Cup of Tea"…

696
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,494
Not the song you requested.

697
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,790
I mean what you've been
thinking of all day

698
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,460
to wear those sad-looking eyes.

699
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,298
I'm making so many people suffer

700
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,843
just for my own happiness.

701
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,723
That's why whenever I feel happy,

702
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,644
it feels as if I've become a bad person.

703
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,943
You should've told me.
Why are you hiding your pain?

704
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,195
You're hiding your pain too.

705
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,784
In case you'll seem regretful
if I see you in pain.

706
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,834
I have no regrets.

707
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,629
But it's not like there's no pain
because we don't regret.

708
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,801
Even if we don't seem strong or happy,

709
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,514
I hope we can show each other everything.

710
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,567
Gosh, you're in trouble now.

711
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,528
I'm actually a real sissy.

712
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,239
I'm going to whine all day from now on.

713
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,034
Sure, I'll hear you out.

714
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,494
Anyway, what is the title of this song?

715
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,343
DECLARATION FOR DEMOCRACY

716
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,767
-Let's become one
-Let's become one

717
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,353
-Let's gather together and become one
-Let's gather together and become one

718
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,986
END THE EMERGENCY MARTIAL LAW!

719
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,281
-Let's take a step forward
-Let's take a step forward

720
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,284
-We will continue to stay strong
-We will continue to stay strong

721
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,162
-And fight for democracy
-And fight for democracy

722
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,998
-Let's keep marching forward
-Let's keep marching forward

723
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,894
What is going on?

724
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,107
I hope you don't get shocked.

725
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,403
I heard your fiance
is seeing someone else.

726
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,326
Since this is your son's fault,

727
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,079
let's not make matters worse
and end it here.

728
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,878
Does your daughter
know nothing about this?

729
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,880
If she knew that,

730
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,385
would she have gotten engaged?

731
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,226
So, you had no idea
Hui-tae was seeing someone else

732
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,062
or who that woman was?

733
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,858
You had no idea whatsoever?

734
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,209
I have no excuse.

735
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,963
It's all my fault
for failing to raise my son properly.

736
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:51,426
However, our families
have managed to be united.

737
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,262
How can we end everything
because of one setback?

738
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,182
If you give me a chance,

739
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:01,603
I'll take responsibility
and sort everything out.

740
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,032
I never had a chance
to take two days off like this.

741
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,575
I guess everyone is like this,

742
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,535
but I didn't have enough vacation days
to begin with.

743
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,288
There's this junior nurse named In-young.

744
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:24,918
She's a newbie and clumsy with her work
so everyone keeps making me work with her…

745
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,173
I'm boring you, aren't I?

746
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,425
What? No.

747
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,469
I was enjoying listening to you.
Keep going.

748
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,471
Just let me know if I'm boring you.

749
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,264
You didn't say anything,
so I kept blabbering.

750
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,058
It wasn't boring.

751
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,727
I'm really okay.

752
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,691
If you're okay,
what are those sleepy eyes?

753
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,572
Didn't we promise
to tell each other everything?

754
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,327
Hey, Sissy. How could you?

755
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,673
It's just that I'm anxious.

756
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,846
I'm so happy right now.

757
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,601
This type of happiness

758
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,856
was never something
I could have all my life.

759
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,906
It's like
I'm flying really high in the air,

760
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,869
until I suddenly crash.

761
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,204
It makes me anxious.

762
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,427
I know it's silly and absurd.

763
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,356
I can't walk you all the way home
today either, can I?

764
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,529
See you tomorrow.

765
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,507
I'd like to report a missing person.

766
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,051
Has it occurred to you
that she might be avoiding you?

767
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,054
I'm sorry you came all the way here
but couldn't meet Myeong-hee.

768
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,723
Are your parents aware
that you're seeing Myeong-hee?

769
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,099
Why are you asking that?

770
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,935
The Defense Security blocked
her passport and visa applications.

771
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,645
I have something to tell you.

772
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,979
I lied.

773
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,106
-Lee Su-ryeon! You little…
-Dad, no!

774
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,150
Her only fault is that
she got involved with me.

775
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,487
It's too early to get scared.
I haven't even begun yet.

776
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,364
Please just let her live her life.
