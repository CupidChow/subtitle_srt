00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:43,350

00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,672
Hi there.

5
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,671
Oh, really?

6
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,257
Good.

7
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,809
Rather tomorrow.

8
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,679
In the afternoon.

9
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,943
Yes.

10
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,154
Okay.

11
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,961
He has to apologize to
Bruce and Roman. Seriously.

12
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,058
Yeah, go ahead.

13
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,269
Not for me.

14
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,766
Right?

15
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,030
What a waste.

16
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:56,451
How I wanted to take her life
and end mine.

17
00:08:57,244 --> 00:09:00,830
Fine. My search continues.

18
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,509
"VACANT"

"PAY"

21
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,050
We live in a dystopia.

22
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:40,801
A living hell.

23
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:45,268
That was fine with me.

24
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,604
I was happy.

25
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:52,855
But now that's gone. Taken.

26
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,819
I long for death.

27
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,619
But I won't die alone.

28
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:49,495
I'll kill a woman.
My revenge on society.

29
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,505
My love was taken from me,

30
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,427
so it's my right and duty...

31
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,262
do the same to someone else.

32
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,972
"VACANT"

33
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,566
"VACANT"

00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,718
"HIRED"

35
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,860
Are we there yet?

36
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,034
Hey!

37
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:51,162
Why are we on the freeway?

38
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,465
Huh?

39
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,794
Stop that shit!

40
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:03,796
I said why the fuck
are we on the freeway!

41
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:08,387
Stop the car!

42
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,225
Get off the freeway!

43
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,980
You fuck.

44
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:20,525
You better kill me.

45
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,037
Are you stupid?

46
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:27,740
I said are you fucking stupid? Hey!

47
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:54,388
From time to time, I think,
screw vengeance. I just want to die.

48
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,773
So I let some fuckers try to kill me.

49
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,984
But it doesn't work.

50
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,571
Humans are built tougher
than you think.

51
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,999
My wife was hunted.

52
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,087
Like an impala chased by a lion.

53
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:10,927
Like a baby penguin
eaten by an albatross.

54
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,180
The murderer cornered her,
then slowed down.

55
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:25,396
He played with her.

56
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,322
My wife hated to be scared.

57
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,660
She couldn't even watch horror movies.

58
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,083
I lost my mind just thinking about

59
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:49,086
how scared she must have been.

60
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,489
Stop!

61
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,581
Stop!

62
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:47,690
Stop!

63
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:04,369
Stop! Stop! No! No! No!

64
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,761
My wife was captured. Gagged and bound.

65
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,055
Then she was placed in a tub.

66
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:15,524
Water filled it slowly.

67
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:49,349
Her fear and despair were unimaginable.

68
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:05,657
I lost so much blood and all
I could do was to watch her die.

69
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:23,967
I will never forget the laughter,
I heard from under the helmet.

70
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:31,080
My wife was killed mercilessly.

71
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:36,707
Then the murderer took
his own life in front of me.

72
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,837
That is why I must kill someone,
without mercy,

73
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,010
and then die.

74
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:50,762
It's my retribution, my mourning.

75
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,193
Bon appetit.

76
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,877
"HIRED"

77
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:17,802
Mister, you can look.

78
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:22,394
But no accidents, okay?

79
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,734
Enemy of women. Die now!

80
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:51,855
We are all masochists.

81
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:58,945
We like to be tied down
and stripped of our freedom.

82
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,747
Maybe this is the reason,
why we gravitate toward populists

83
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,292
and fascists.

84
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,628
Then self-destruct. It's our fate.

85
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:29,596
Male chauvinism is the dumbest concept.

86
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:36,644
For most things,
women do it better than men.

87
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:43,488
Just think, even if you don't
know your mother's face,

88
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:48,239
you were given birth by a woman.

89
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:55,667
Women should handle politics
all together.

90
00:29:56,877 --> 00:30:01,377
Things would be better
than now for sure.

91
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,222
Women on the top. I like it that way.

92
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:14,015
Even when I fuck. That's right.

93
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm not an enemy of women.

94
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:33,052
Forgive me. Justice is obsolete.

95
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,190
"PAY"

96
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,489
I love you.

97
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,444
Me too.

98
00:35:58,113 --> 00:36:02,450
Never let me go.

99
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,690
I can't take it anymore.
I need my victim now.

100
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,721
"VACANT"

101
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,945
"WAITING" "RESERVED" "HIRED"

102
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,859
If you kill a person or two,
you'd be charged with murder

103
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,661
and put away for about 20 years.

104
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:20,375
If you kill five or more,
you'll be executed.

105
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:25,292
But in a war, if you kill one
or two, you'll get a bonus.

106
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:33,512
Kill 10 or so, you're given a medal.

107
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:39,348
Reaction to murder is subjective.

108
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,230
"VACANT"

109
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,311
The corner of 7th please.

110
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,651
Oh, yes.

111
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:29,063
Spitting image,

112
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,655
mirror image,

113
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,285
carbon copy,

114
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,082
doppelganger,

115
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,045
dead ringer...

116
00:44:03,348 --> 00:44:06,017
-It's 1220 Yen.
-Yes.

117
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:11,105
I have exact change.

118
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,906
Here.

119
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,667
Yes. Thanks.

120
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,245
Thank you very much.

121
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,039
Please take all your belongings.

122
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:33,586
Oh. I'll open the trunk.

123
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,638
Yes.

124
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:10,164
Thank you.

125
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:29,131
Your loved one will be taken
with no reason.

126
00:49:29,674 --> 00:49:33,260
Sadness, anger,

127
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:36,013
despair...

128
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:41,269
How will you handle them?

129
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:46,750
Where to?

130
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,673
Didn't I ride in your cab yesterday?

131
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,340
Huh? That's not possible.
I was off yesterday.

132
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,139
Where to?

133
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:04,852
I'll get off at Show a Street.

134
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:15,738
"PAY"

135
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:08,415
Finally, I found a perfect offering.

136
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:13,420
She even looks like my wife.

137
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:17,049
I will take her life, then mine.

138
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:23,005
Die with her.
Finally end my existence.

139
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,974
I've made my wife wait too long.

140
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,701
Are you talking to me?

141
00:54:10,788 --> 00:54:12,706
You talking to me?

142
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,752
You talking to me?

143
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,643
Well, I'm the only one here.

144
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:41,290
For three nights and days,
I will have her.

145
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:46,499
Then I will kill her and kill myself.

146
00:57:48,714 --> 00:57:50,632
Kill myself.

147
00:58:28,587 --> 00:58:30,672
What are you wearing?

148
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,340
No! Stop! Let me go!

149
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:40,557
See? Your leg. It's cursed.

150
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,894
You have not paid proper
respect to your ancestors.

151
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:48,023
Your agent not renewing
the contract was a curse too.

152
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,150
From your ancestors.

153
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:54,863
But how come I need to have sex
with this man? It's absurd!

154
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,074
How many times do I have to say this?

155
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:01,078
Sensei's penis has the
spiritual power to lift the curse!

156
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,081
It's not sex, it's a sexual exorcism!

157
00:59:05,624 --> 00:59:11,800
I had it many times with Sensei
and my stocks are doing tremendously!

158
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,800
Unreal.

159
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:18,178
Go. Both of you.

160
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:22,015
Never come back!

161
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,317
The demon is strong with this one.

162
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:41,118
You, hold her down.

163
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:43,078
Yes sir!

164
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,580
Stop! Let me go! No!

165
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:55,091
The exorcism will start
with her vagina,

166
00:59:55,841 --> 01:00:00,053
then her anus,
and ends in her mouth.

167
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,472
Yes Sensei! Please!

168
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:08,683
No! Let me go!

169
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,817
Help Ma yumi.

170
01:00:13,984 --> 01:00:17,946
Stop! No!

171
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,357
Sensei!

172
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:30,431
Go to hell! Under the bed fucker!

173
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,905
Who are you?

174
01:01:47,828 --> 01:01:50,705
Ma yumi! Take the gun!

175
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:15,355
Shoot!

176
01:02:59,566 --> 01:03:01,901
Who are you?

177
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,782
Don't die...

178
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,710
Who are you?

179
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,372
Don't die...

180
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,725
Mr. Fujinaga?

181
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,273
Are you there?

182
01:04:33,285 --> 01:04:35,912
He went back to work
the day before yesterday.

183
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,506
Really?

184
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:43,499
His doctor told me he should still
be recovering at home.

185
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,798
He had to start driving again...

186
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:49,634
said he can't be still any longer.

187
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,222
He's very strange.

188
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,390
I see...

189
01:05:00,854 --> 01:05:03,273
Mr. Fujinaga saved my life.

190
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:08,361
Oh! You were in the paper!

191
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,366
Do you want to know something weird?

192
01:05:13,158 --> 01:05:16,202
I went out with him once.

193
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,789
He told me

194
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:24,211
that he joined the French Foreign Legion
when he was 18.

195
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:28,757
Do you know why?

196
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,056
Because he wanted to kill people.

197
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,977
Fucking weird, right?

198
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,898
France! Unbelievable!

199
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:49,235
He wanted to kill people...

200
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:56,201
Fucking manga shit right?

201
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:58,912
He must be lying.

202
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:06,150
Oh, do you happen to know
where his wife's cemetery is?

203
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,004
His wife?

204
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:13,700
Yes. She was a murder victim.

205
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:17,931
Do you really think someone
would marry that dude?

206
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:23,700
He's been alone forever!
No one would marry such a creep.

207
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:45,351
I don't think you should go in.

208
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:06,664
What? I shot this 2 years ago...

209
01:08:57,257 --> 01:08:58,557
"HIRED"

210
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,721
Thank you for choosing to ride with us.

211

"If the world considers hatred
and lies are virtues,

212
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:54,415
then the villains
will go on unpunished."
