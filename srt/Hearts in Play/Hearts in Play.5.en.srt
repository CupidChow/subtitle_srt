1
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,860
That's the award stand I've been dreaming of

2
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,480
Standing there watching the national flag rise

3
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm sure you'll be happy

4
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,680
First

5
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,600
First of all,

6
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Thank you for your hard work.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,280
Let's give a big round of applause

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,120
Congratulations!

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
Ready. Ready. Ready.

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,440
Got

11
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,479
This week's turnover red flag

12
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,759
Congratulations to Xia Fan Xing

13
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,000
[for winning the national Youth Table Tennis Tournament.]

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,530
Please come to the stage to receive the award.

15
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,360
Class 1, Grade 2, please come to the stage.

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,440
What are you doing?

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,760
Are you talking about Class 1, Grade 2?

18
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
Why are people in Class 3 going up?

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm not sure.

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
Why did she go up there?

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Mr. Wang.

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,560
Your students

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
go up there?

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Come on. Let's go.

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,040
No.

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,400
It's their class again.

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Xia Fan Xing.

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Come here.

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,980
Congratulations.

30
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,840
This is from Class 1, Grade 2.

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,400
Not yours.

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,960
Class 1, Grade 2.

33
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
Okay.

34
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,210
I told you we heard it wrong.

35
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
The principal just announced

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,200
the red flag should be flown.

37
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Is it Class 1 or Class 3?

38
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
It must be Class 3.

39
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,399
What else can the stars do?

40
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,600
Yes, it's our class.

41
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
See? We heard it wrong.

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
Luckily I didn't go up there.

43
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Otherwise, it'll be embarrassing.

44
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,760
Our class hasn't got a flag for months.

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,060
I thought I could get it this time.

46
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,360
What a pity.

47
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,340
You're here. You're here.

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
Are you sleepwalking?

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
Is this the red flag of our class?

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Go and get it.

51
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,240
It's not easy for Class 1, Grade 2 to get it.

52
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
but you took it.

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
Xia Fan Xing.

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,440
Do you hear me?

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,760
Burn your own candles.

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,400
Xia Fan Xing.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,060
What are you doing?

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
Xia Fan Xing.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,130
Star, what's wrong?

60
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,380
You didn't sleep well last night?

61
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
Maybe.

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,480
Then go to the toilet and wash your face.

63
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,400
Or you'll fall asleep in class.

64
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Let's go.

65
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,320
We still need to collect the application form as soon as possible.

66
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,360
Vice President Xia.

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,400
Chuyu.

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
Xia Fan Xing, I'm looking for you.

69
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,880
Star.

70
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,360
[Stars]

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Well...

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,160
Chu Yu, wait.

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,720
Star.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,640
What are you doing?

75
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,900
What are you doing?

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
What's wrong?

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
I didn't see it.

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
A tiger.

79
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
and a dog?

80
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,960
Where?

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
What's wrong with her?

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,940
I don't eat humans.

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
I have something

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,760
I don't know if I should tell you.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,159
What is it?

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,640
I have no money.

87
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,360
I don't want to borrow money from you.

88
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,740
Can you let her finish?

89
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,360
Say it.

90
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,320
I keep seeing animals today.

91
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,880
Many animals.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Animals?

93
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,640
What animal?

94
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,400
I can see it now.

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,560
A pig.

96
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,320
Star.

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,840
You just want to scold me.

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,159
Don't cry.

99
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,520
Tangtang, don't cry.

100
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,640
A crying pig.

101
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh

102
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
So fragile.

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,640
Toad!

104
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,160
Toad!

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,520
Toad!

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Sweet Pig.

107
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Toad Liu is here to accompany you.

108
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,640
What am I then?

109
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,440
Pig and dog.

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,920
A toad?

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
or a tortoise?

112
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,480
You are...

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,840
a ping pong player.

114
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
Can you draw a picture for me?

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,960
A ping pong player.

116
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm like this now.

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,760
Wow

118
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,080
So many rubbish balls are pushing dung balls

119
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,680
So poor

120
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,320
Such a big dung ball.

121
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
It feels so good.

122
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,640
The world in your eyes is so wonderful.

123
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
Don't you think

124
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,720
I'm crazy. I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

125
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,250
I don't think so.

126
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,720
You just see something different from others.

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,400
Is it only normal

128
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
is normal?

129
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,400
This world is called the world

130
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,260
because of different existence.

131
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,640
Wow!

132
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
It's so bright. It's so bright.

133
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,280
What's wrong?

134
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,760
I'm fine.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,480
I'll take a nap.

136
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,840
I think something is wrong with you.

137
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,800
I'll be fine after taking a nap.

138
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
Don't talk.

139
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Star.

140
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
Class begins.

141
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Stop sleeping.

142
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,120
It's dangerous to skip class

143
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,940
skipping class is dangerous.

144
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,780
Where are Xia Fan Xing and Shengyang?

145
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,560
Tangtang.

146
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,920
Where did they go?

147
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,880
I don't know.

148
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,680
Spit it out.

149
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,400
One is sitting next to you.

150
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,480
The other one is nice to you. He wants to stay with you every day.

151
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
Tell me you don't know where they are.

152
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
They've been together

153
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
than me.

154
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,040
Maybe they eloped.

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,880
Jo Woo-rin.

156
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,170
What are you talking about?

157
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,840
Sir.

158
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,370
Shengyang and Xia Fan Xing hugged each other on the playground.

159
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,960
They hugged each other.

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,680
What?

161
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Move!

162
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Excuse me

163
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,960
Let me see

164
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,620
Where is it?

165
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Excuse me

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Excuse me

167
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,920
I didn’t know

168
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
Shengyang is honest.

169
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
is a pervert.

170
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Are they dating?

171
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,120
Why didn't you tell me?

172
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Look.

173
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,800
Go back to study.

174
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,040
Look at them.

175
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,080
Look.

176
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,400
It's here. It's here.

177
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,160
Look.

178
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,400
Let's go.

179
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,320
Why are you two acting sweet dramas instead of having classes?

180
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,920
Mr. Wang.

181
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,440
Star.

182
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,960
Hello. Hello.

183
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
Star.

184
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,960
Wake up.

185
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,600
It's lath.

186
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,770
Xia Fan Xing.

187
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
No.

188
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Something's wrong with Xia Fan Xing.

189
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,770
Go to the infirmary.

190
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,060
I'll carry him.

191
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
Let's go to the infirmary.

192
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,640
Hurry up.

193
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:57,970
Okay.

194
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,400
Shengyang.

195
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,960
If I didn't die,

196
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,480
can you promise me one thing?

197
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
What is it?

198
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,120
Join the Table Tennis Club?

199
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,440
Look at you.

200
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,170
Can you stop being so stubborn?

201
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,300
This is not obsession.

202
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,600
It's not benevolence.

203
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
and immortality.

204
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
The invincible sportsmanship.

205
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Dr. Sun said she was food poisoning.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
We need to find a way to make her vomit.

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,320
She's going to make the medicine.

208
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,040
She needs to be taken to the hospital to have gastric lavage.

209
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
So serious?

210
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,000
She's hallucinating.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,330
Of course it's serious.

212
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,280
Xia Fan Xing.

213
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,280
Hang in there.

214
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,850
I'll call an ambulance.

215
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,720
Star.

216
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
Hang in there.

217
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,740
Can you spit it out?

218
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,680
It's coming

219
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,600
What is this?

220
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,080
Soap water

221
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,340
I heard soap water can make people vomit.

222
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,400
I've heard of it too.

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
I think so.

224
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,160
You drank too much.

225
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,680
Is it that good?

226
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Spit the trash can.

227
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Is it normal?

228
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,040
I don't know.

229
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
I don't know.

230
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,160
How many times have I told you?

231
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,490
Are you out of your mind?

232
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
I ate so many eggs for nothing.

233
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,540
and still sleepwalking here.

234
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,240
Turn to page 36.

235
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Let's start the fifth lesson today.

236
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,480
Read "The Fifth Secret of the Red Wall".

237
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,640
Let me read a sentence.

238
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
Read after me.

239
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,079
In the east of the river

240
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,240
A playboy

241
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,720
In the east of the river,

242
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,200
Romantic figure

243
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
The west of the hometown is

244
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,720
the Red Wall of Zhou Lang from the Three Kingdoms.

245
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,680
In the west of the hometown,

246
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,410
the Red Wall of Zhou Lang from the Three Kingdoms.

247
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,320
Tangtang.

248
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
Grandpa.

249
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,680
Chuyu.

250
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,200
Liu Manxin.

251
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Come in.

252
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,290
Hello, grandpa.

253
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
Grandpa.

254
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,720
How is Twinkle?

255
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,720
It's much better.

256
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,440
Well,

257
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,760
I'm not awake yet.

258
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Your name is...

259
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Shengyang.

260
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,080
Oh.

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,760
I remember.

262
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,840
Thank you for sending the stars in time.

263
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,400
Grandpa,

264
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,210
I haven't had time to thank you.

265
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,040
It's okay.

266
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,780
What about you?

267
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,920
My name is Luo Qing.

268
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,560
A young man who has dreams in ping-pong.

269
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,290
Why did you come empty-handed?

270
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,520
I have a sense of respect for Xia Fan Xing.

271
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,280
I'm just kidding.

272
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,240
You're being serious.

273
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,960
Grandpa Xia likes to joke.

274
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
You're all here.

275
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,000
Star.

276
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,040
How are you?

277
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
These days,

278
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
these days.

279
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,240
I haven't slept in such a long time.

280
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,920
Really?

281
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
Who said that?

282
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,360
During the summer vacation,

283
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,320
during the winter break.

284
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,520
Grandpa.

285
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,000
We only have 45 days off for five months.

286
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,760
That's unreasonable.

287
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,520
Right?

288
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,400
Yes.

289
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,520
We should put it off last month.

290
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,520
Be content.

291
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,680
When we graduate from university,

292
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,800
without winter and summer vacation,

293
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,860
we can only rest on a regular holiday.

294
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,360
So pathetic.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
You wish!

296
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,760
When you start working,

297
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,680
you'll be great

298
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
That's amazing.

299
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,920
Grandpa.

300
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,720
We're kids.

301
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
We're not fools.

302
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,440
It's against the Labor Law

303
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,800
is against the Labor Law.

304
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,720
Yeah.

305
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,840
Children are the best.

306
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,120
Naive.

307
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,320
Star.

308
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,040
How are you now?

309
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm much better.

310
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,780
I'll go to school in a few days.

311
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,800
Don't eat anything again.

312
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,840
It's dangerous.

313
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,680
Yeah.

314
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,680
I also want to tell you this question.

315
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,640
From now on, don't go out to eat anything.

316
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
This house...

317
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,120
No matter how much it is, it's better than the outside. It's better than the outside.

318
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,840
it's more hygienic than outside.

319
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,400
Got it, grandpa.

320
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,840
Today,

321
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,560
at home today.

322
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,960
Grandpa.

323
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,640
Here.

324
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
show you.

325
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,640
Okay.

326
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,200
Grandpa.

327
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,920
Thank you, grandpa.

328
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm going.

329
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,200
Enjoy.

330
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
Wow

331
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,160
You bought so many fruits

332
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,090
Who bought them?

333
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,040
Good for you.

334
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,840
Liu Manxin.

335
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,360
How could it be him?

336
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,320
We bought it together.

337
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,720
Say something

338
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,450
First of all,

339
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,240
thank you for your concern.

340
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,400
One more thing.

341
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,280
Since...

342
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Sheng Yang.

343
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,880
I have a gift for you.

344
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,480
Why won't you give it to us?

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,120
You'll know soon.

346
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,800
Application form for Table Tennis Club.

347
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,380
Please fill it out.

348
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,200
Time to eat.

349
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,600
Let's talk after dinner.

350
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,160
No.

351
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,240
Fill in now.

352
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
Let's talk after dinner.

353
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,480
Hold him down.

354
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,040
Fill in now.

355
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
All right

356
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
It's good to be young.

357
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,280
Let me say a few words.

358
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,440
At this happy moment,

359
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,800
at this happy moment.

360
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,640
Chuyu.

361
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,920
Is he at home?

362
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,560
Grandpa, tell me.

363
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,040
What should I say?

364
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Anything is fine.

365
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,480
At home,

366
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
we can just...

367
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,000
Grandpa

368
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,400
Just one thing.

369
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
I wish you

370
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
in the future.

371
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,120
Happy.

372
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,800
[Happy]

373
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,440
healthy and happy.

374
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,720
and live happily ever after.

375
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,040
Have this dish.

376
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,640
Grandma Wu brought it back from a trip to the south.

377
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,920
I didn't even eat it.

378
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
This is for you

379
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,560
Let's eat

380
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,160
Let's eat.

381
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,960
Hurry up.

382
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's eat

383
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,600
It's really delicious

384
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Eat up.

385
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,400
Delicious

386
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Eat more.

387
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Don't save money.

388
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,040
Grandpa.

389
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,760
Did the hospital find out

390
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
what he ate and got poisoned?

391
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
Of course.

392
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,760
It's just the result.

393
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,600
Oh.

394
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,040
I forgot.

395
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,580
It doesn't matter.

396
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,840
Anyway,

397
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
I ate something dirty.

398
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:35,840
No.

399
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,900
It's not hygienic.

400
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,080
You can't eat

401
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
eat outside?

402
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,680
In the future,

403
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,840
eat more at home.

404
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,600
Come on.

405
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,330
Eat more.

406
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,680
Let's eat.

407
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,520
Eat more.

408
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,650
Thank you, grandpa.

409
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,010
This is a good thing.

410
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,920
Rain season

411
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
It's the peak season of mushrooms growing in the south.

412
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
When eating wild mushrooms,

413
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
Remember.

414
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,080
If you don't know how to distinguish

415
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,540
and poisonous mushrooms,

416
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,040
Please don't eat it.

417
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,840
Otherwise,

418
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,360
there might be serious consequences.

419
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
My son is so handsome.

420
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Mom, I'm practicing.

421
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Go on.

422
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll shoot mine.

423
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,240
Don't just shoot me.

424
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,120
Mom, you're on camera too.

425
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Your mom is so pretty.

426
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,080
I'm afraid they'll be blinded by the mirror.

427
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,000
We will

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
with my son.

429
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
Hello, everyone.

430
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
This is my favorite mom.

431
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,720
This is my most handsome son.

432
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,320
My son.

433
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,380
You're still so handsome.

434
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,240
Why are you crying?

435
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,530
You won't look handsome if you cry.

436
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
Have you been eating well lately?

437
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,660
It's getting cold.

438
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,730
Remember to wear more clothes.

439
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,520
Stop playing with your phone.

440
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,780
It's bad for your eyes.

441
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,680
Especially when you walk.

442
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
I miss you so much.

443
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
to be your mom.

444
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,200
to be your mother.

445
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,120
I'm not done being your son.

446
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,720
How can I live without you?

447
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,040
My child.

448
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,840
happiness

449
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,960
can't only depend on one person

450
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,680
or one thing.

451
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,700
you have to learn to separate happiness.

452
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,200
If those kids

453
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,440
can make you happy,

454
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,680
you need to fit in with them.

455
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,400
If ping-pong

456
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,280
can make you happy,

457
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,120
Keep playing.

458
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,240
In this way,

459
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,600
no matter what you lose,

460
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,120
even if you lose something.

461
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,160
Mom.

462
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,320
should be a part of your happiness.

463
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,320
Without me,

464
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
without me.

465
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,520
What kind of monster are these?

466
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,360
Grandpa.

467
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,520
Grandpa.

468
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,920
Look.

469
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,280
What did you see?

470
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,880
A ping pong player.

471
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,080
A ping pong player, right?

472
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,760
Piggy.

473
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,120
Toad.

474
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,600
It's okay, grandpa.

475
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,760
Tiger.

476
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,000
Silly.

477
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,360
Grandpa.

478
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,040
I...

479
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
What do I look like?

480
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,040
You are...

481
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,320
Xia...

482
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,760
Fan.

483
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,440
Gosh.

484
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,920
What did I see?

485
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,840
Did I see it right?

486
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,440
I ate mushrooms again.

487
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
What took you so long?

488
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Shengyang.

489
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,760
Shengyang.

490
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,900
Welcome to the Table Tennis Club.

491
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,040
Great!

492
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Our Table Tennis Club is finally going to grow.

493
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,560
I didn't say I'd join the Table Tennis Club.

494
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,560
Then why are you here?

495
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,680
You want me to join the Table Tennis Club.

496
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,940
But I have a condition.

497
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,960
You can ask me anything.

498
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,040
Anything.

499
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,680
Even if you want Liu Manxin to be your slave.

500
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Xia Fan Xing.

501
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
Thank you.

502
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Xia Fan Xing.

503
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
If you defeat him,

504
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,040
I'll join the Table Tennis Club.

505
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,880
Luo Qing,

506
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
Let Xia Fan Star beat him.

507
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
We'll use one month as the deadline.

508
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,600
If you can beat him

509
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,760
within a month,

510
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
I'll join the Table Tennis Club.

511
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,330
Anyway, I'll play with him.

512
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,760
You mean

513
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,000
there must be

514
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,400
one of them

515
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,000
can't fulfill his wish.

516
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,360
Shengyang.

517
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,680
Aren't you asking them to bite you?

518
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,800
I mean parrots.

519
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,520
Fight with each other?

520
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,380
Forget it if you don't want to.

521
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,960
I didn't say I don't want to.

522
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,760
Then...

523
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,360
Come on.

524
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,120
What time is it?

525
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
What took you so long?

526
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
This is home.

527
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
Do you really think this is a hotel?

528
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,880
Xia Fan Xing asked me to practice with her.

529
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,680
The country has its laws.

530
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,800
We have our own rules.

531
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,460
I think we should make three rules in the future.

532
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,160
First,

533
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,130
you can't go home past nine in the evening.

534
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,120
Second,

535
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,720
you can't go out for drinks anymore.

536
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,520
Third,

537
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,800
From now on,

538
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
sit down and pee.

539
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,080
What

540
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,200
Sit down and pee

541
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,520
It's easy to get wet by the toilet

542
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,920
No

543
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,280
I'm a man

544
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,800
Funny.

545
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
I know you're a man.

546
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,800
Who says men can't sit and pee?

547
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Think about it.

548
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,560
Are you

549
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,440
sit and pound?

550
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,600
When you sit

551
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,400
when you sit down?

552
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,320
Then you can't sit up and pound

553
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,800
and you stand up and sneeze.

554
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,720
Right?

555
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,040
Since you can sit and pound,

556
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,280
Thump Thump

557
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,240
Then you

558
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,840
sit down and pow.

559
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,360
If I catch you, you'll be fined ten dollars.

560
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,570
Where are you going?

561
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
Thump Thump

562
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,080
Sitting and buzzing
