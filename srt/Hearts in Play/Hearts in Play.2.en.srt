1
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,360
So it's him.

2
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,440
Look.

3
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,039
It's him.

4
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,920
That's him, right?

5
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
Yes, yes, yes.

6
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,220
That's the one.

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,960
I heard there was a transfer student at school.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,360
Look, he's coming.

9
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,560
Keep your voice down.

10
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
That's Shengyang.

11
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,400
Remember later.

12
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,940
Make sure to cheer loudly.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,759
Shengyang!

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,560
The best in the world!

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,759
Shengyang!

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,600
Everyone,

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,479
in a moment.

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,520
When Shengyang comes in,

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
we'll shout loudly,

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
Shengyang, Shengyang,

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,440
the best in the world!

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,480
So noisy.

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,720
Xia Fanxing,

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
you must be bored.

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,880
Don't you think this is too loud?

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
Zhao Youlin,

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,920
why are you always the one talking the most?

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,160
It's true though.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
Your ping pong club business,

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,720
why drag us into it?

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
This student's way of speaking

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
is rather unfair, don't you think?

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Chu Yu.

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,680
Hurry!

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,640
Chuyu.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
The table tennis club

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,000
is our Xinde High School's table tennis club.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,760
We recruit talented people

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,560
to contribute to our school's athletic program

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,840
and bring glory to it.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,640
Only when the school thrives

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,120
can students excel.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
As they say,

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,600
the school is our home,

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,520
progress depends on everyone.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
Look!

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,960
See how well our Chuyu speaks.

48
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,520
Truly worthy of being a student council member

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,640
and our school's broadcasting star.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Look at his level of awareness,

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,040
and then look

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,900
at yourselves.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
Speechless.

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,000
Chuyu,

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm counting on you later.

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,400
Vice President Xia,

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,200
rest assured.

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,160
As

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
the current Student Council Vice President of Xinde High School,

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,600
Broadcasting Station Director,

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
three-time scholarship recipient,

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
two-time flag-raising leader,

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,620
and outstanding member of the Red Flag Class for two years,

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
I have the responsibility,

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
the obligation,

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,800
and the mission

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,960
to support the Table Tennis Club under the Student Council

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,720
in its revitalization efforts.

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,850
Vice President Xia.

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,040
Good luck!

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,120
This morning,

72
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Student Council Vice President Lin Chuyu

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
cordially met with the Table Tennis Club Vice President,

74
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Xia Fanxing,

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,650
and held friendly talks on revitalizing the Table Tennis Club.

76
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,920
Chuyu,

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,240
let me walk you out.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
No need, please stay.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,320
I insist.

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
Here they come!

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,520
Everyone!

82
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,480
Shengyang!

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,360
The best in the world!

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
Shengyang!

85
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
Number one!

86
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,840
Shengyang!

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,600
The best in the world!

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
Shengyang!

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,320
The absolute best!

90
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,240
Xia Fanxing,

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,600
what are you doing?

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
Shengyang.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,880
Listen.

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,770
Just listen.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,280
Everyone is really excited for your comeback.

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
If you join the table tennis club,

97
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,320
students will come watch you play every day,

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
and they'll be pretty girls too.

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
Are you an ADC?

100
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,320
I play support.

101
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,960
Why?

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
You're making me die of embarrassment.

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,650
What is this?

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,480
It's posted all over the hallways.

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,210
Why don't you just announce it over the PA system?

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,280
Welcome to Xinde Radio.

107
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm your student friend,

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Lin Chuyu.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Recently,

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,960
our school welcomed an outstanding transfer student,

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Shengyang,

112
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,280
who has been affectionately dubbed the 'Ping Pong Prince,'

113
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
'Table Tennis Master,'

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,840
and 'Ping Pong Prodigy.'

115
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,320
Shengyang not only excels at table tennis,

116
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,960
but also ranks at the top of his class academically,

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
and has received the Outstanding Student Award multiple times.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
Where is the broadcasting station?

119
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,320
[Broadcasting Station]

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
What's the rush?

121
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,080
Just listen.

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,040
Listen.

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
They're all praising you.

124
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
And let me tell you,

125
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,960
the one broadcasting now

126
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,880
is our Xinde School beauty queen

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Lin Chuyu.

128
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,240
She won the championship in the Youth Table Tennis Tournament.

129
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,840
Shengyang's arrival

130
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,000
is like a shot in the arm

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,320
for Xinde High School's table tennis club.

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,880
Make her stop quickly.

133
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,200
Why are you afraid of compliments?

134
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,560
I don't need it.

135
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,320
Alright.

136
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,400
I'll go make her stop,

137
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,600
and then you'll join the table tennis club.

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,280
Hurry up.

139
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,480
What's wrong?

140
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,320
Nothing.

141
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,400
The broadcasting station is in room 2046.

142
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,080
Go ahead.

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,159
You've sprained your ankle.

144
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,260
You're not going to 2046 anymore?

145
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,250
Let me take you to the infirmary first.

146
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
For me,

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,680
he gave up 2046.

148
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,800
He must feel the heavy weight,

149
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,080
because he's carrying

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,220
the entire honor and future of Xinde High School's table tennis club.

151
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,640
For her,

152
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,600
I gave up 2046.

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,320
I can feel something heavy on my back.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,520
She must weigh about 157.6 jin,

155
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,040
including 97.6 jin of actual weight

156
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,200
and 60 jin of wild imagination.

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,200
Someday the wind will rise,

158
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,240
and we'll set sail across the vast sea.

159
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,960
I believe in the near future...

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,200
Our Xinde Table Tennis Club

161
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,720
will surely achieve greatness

162
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
on the competition field

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,960
and write a new chapter.

164
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,159
The table tennis athletes of Xinde must carry forward

165
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,120
the unyielding spirit of sportsmanship.

166
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,080
They will showcase the vibrant style

167
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,000
of motivated

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
and ambitious

169
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,840
new-era students

170
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,760
with unlimited potential.

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Xia Fanxing

172
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,100
How many times has the doctor told you

173
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
that you've had surgery

174
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,880
and shouldn't do intense exercise?

175
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,760
Why won't you listen?

176
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
If you keep being this stubborn,

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,920
you'll never return to competition.

178
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
School nurse,

179
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,420
what's wrong with her?

180
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,200
During her previous training,

181
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
she damaged her ligaments

182
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
and even had surgery.

183
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,680
Oh,

184
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
it's just a minor injury.

185
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,400
Which athlete hasn't been injured?

186
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,960
Right?

187
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,720
You had surgery

188
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,090
and you call that minor?

189
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Well, our athletic spirit

190
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,520
is about perseverance

191
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,650
and never giving up,

192
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,440
isn't it?

193
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
Forget about surgery,

194
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
even if we got hit by a grenade,

195
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,560
it wouldn't defeat us athletes.

196
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Thank you for taking me to the infirmary.

197
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Don't worry.

198
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,320
I won't let your kindness go unrewarded.

199
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,000
Here.

200
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,920
This is the lucky racket I bought

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,980
with a month's worth of my allowance.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,130
I haven't even put the rubber on it yet.

203
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I plan to use it

204
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,800
to win the championship this season.

205
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
Feel it.

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,500
What are you doing?

207
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Oh come on,

208
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,920
don't be shy.

209
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I usually don't let others touch it.

210
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,720
If you touch my lucky racket,

211
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,200
you'll have to join our table tennis club.

212
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Are you crazy?

213
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,880
You forced me to touch it.

214
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,600
Don't get upset.

215
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,280
All you need to do

216
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,880
is compete in the tournament

217
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,140
and win the championship for our school.

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,760
Shengyang,

219
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,280
you can't touch me for nothing.

220
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,840
You must take responsibility for me.

221
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Shengyang.

222
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
The gentleman says

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
learning should never cease.

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,370
Blue comes from the indigo plant yet is bluer than the plant.

225
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,640
Ice is formed from water yet is colder than water.

226
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,920
A gentleman refers to a person of learning and cultivation.

227
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,880
This saying means that

228
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,600
a gentleman believes

229
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,760
learning should never stop.

230
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,680
Indigo is extracted from the indigo plant,

231
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
yet it is bluer than the plant itself.

232
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,080
Ice is formed from water.

233
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,000
Straight wood follows the carpenter's line,

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,360
bent wood forms wheels,

235
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,530
its curves conform to the compass,

236
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,560
though dried and withered.

237
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,240
Teacher.

238
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,420
Tangtang is drinking bubble tea.

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Tangtang.

240
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,610
You're sneaking snacks again.

241
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
Then repeat what I just said.

242
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,840
What's this?

243
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,760
Saliva.

244
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,600
That's nice of you.

245
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,120
I just wanted to try.

246
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,720
Between two points.

247
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,600
Is a straight line the shortest?

248
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,000
Xia Fanxing

249
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,690
Teacher, I didn't put rubber on my racket.

250
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,400
Please don't, teacher.

251
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,920
This racket is very important to me.

252
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,450
Teacher.

253
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,120
The land of the crouching dragon

254
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,200
and every three steps, there's a phoenix chick.

255
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,480
So stupid!

256
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,320
Shut up.

257
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,100
You're already in 11th grade now.

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,920
Can you please focus

259
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,250
on what really matters?

260
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
Liu Manxin

261
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,560
As the president of the table tennis club,

262
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,690
can you keep your club members in line?

263
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,580
Don't worry, teacher.

264
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,880
I'll strictly follow classroom rules

265
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
and discipline those two

266
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,520
to follow my example.

267
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,360
Rich guy, phone call!

268
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Whose phone is that?

269
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
Rich guy, phone call!

270
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Who put it here?

271
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,080
Rich guy,

272
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,220
answer your phone!

273
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,640
The rich guy is busted!

274
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
You three will stand

275
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,660
for the rest of this class.

276
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,760
Fanxing.

277
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,120
Fanxing.

278
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
My milk tea!

279
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,480
I can't be happy all day without my milk tea.

280
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,280
And my phone!

281
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,200
It's all your fault.

282
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,760
How can you blame me?

283
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,760
It's his fault.

284
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,020
You should have put it on silent mode.

285
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,570
Exactly.

286
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,600
Those are all secondary issues.

287
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,640
That racket means a lot to me.

288
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
It has sentimental value.

289
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,480
Whatever.

290
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,210
Let's go get it back.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,040
Let's go in.

292
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,610
You three are stealing things.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,920
The racket is mine.

294
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,960
The bubble tea is mine too.

295
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,280
The phone is mine as well.

296
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,840
Is that really stealing?

297
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,880
What does this have to do with me?

298
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,160
Daoyang

299
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,760
Shengyang

300
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
You're a member of the table tennis club.

301
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,280
Since when?

302
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Stop being stubborn.

303
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,010
You will be eventually.

304
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,120
So stupid.

305
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,450
Don't you have any sense of team pride?

306
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,720
Victory!

307
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,480
Action!

308
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,320
How did you get in?

309
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,970
The door wasn't locked.

310
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,490
Hurry up and search.

311
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,490
What are you doing here?

312
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,820
I'm talking to you.

313
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,940
What are you doing?

314
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,680
This is a school.

315
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,820
You can't just barge in like this.

316
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,180
Do you think I'm blind?

317
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,760
Sir,

318
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
when you speak to me,

319
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,359
please mind your tone.

320
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,760
Taiwanese compatriots.

321
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,160
The wind from Taiwan,

322
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,760
the summer breeze,

323
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,040
all carry my longing for you.

324
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,240
Why should you care where I come from?

325
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,400
No.

326
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,650
Who are you looking for?

327
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,010
Please register first.

328
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,280
My destined rival,

329
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,240
Shengyang.

330
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,240
What is this?

331
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
What the hell is this?

332
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Who is Shengyang?

333
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,440
We don't have such a teacher at this school.

334
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,560
He's a student.

335
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,400
A student.

336
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,040
Students are all in class at this hour.

337
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
You won't be able to see him.

338
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
You need to contact his homeroom teacher.

339
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,210
Do you know which class he's in?

340
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,800
Sometimes knowing too much

341
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,040
isn't a good thing.

342
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,620
If you don't know, how can I help you contact him?

343
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
I walk alone

344
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,520
and need no one's help.

345
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,660
Even in the lonely darkness of night,

346
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,600
I can still forge ahead on my own.

347
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,280
Go in and look.

348
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,770
You're quite funny.

349
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,640
Let me tell you something.

350
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,570
This is a school,

351
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
not a market,

352
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,200
not a place where strangers can just walk in.

353
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,240
Are you crazy?

354
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
Nothing can stop me from moving forward,

355
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
not even threats from the old man,

356
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
I won't back down.

357
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,080
Get down now!

358
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,540
I said get down!

359
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,720
Get down.

360
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,640
Don't touch me.

361
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,200
Get down.

362
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,000
Let go.

363
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,640
Get down first.

364
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,280
Let go of me.

365
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,920
You get down first.

366
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,720
You let go first.

367
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,640
I'll let go after you get down.

368
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll get down if you let go.

369
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
You get down first, then I'll let go.

370
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,800
Let go now.

371
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,520
Get down.

372
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,200
Let go.

373
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,480
Get down right now.

374
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Let go

375
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,920
of me.

376
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
This should be Mr. Chang's cabinet.

377
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
Hurry up and pick them up.

378
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Let's find what we need first.

379
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,560
Wow!

380
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,250
Did our class teachers confiscate all these?

381
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,880
These must be from many different teachers.

382
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,200
Look at the dates.

383
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,850
Some are over ten years old.

384
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,800
Hello, teacher.

385
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,920
Take this.

386
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Take this one too.

387
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,180
How can I carry so many?

388
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,060
Drink this.

389
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,170
Suck it quickly.

390
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,280
Don't swallow it.

391
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,410
We need to return it to Tangtang later.

392
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,100
I was just looking for you two.

393
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,440
Come with me.

394
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,020
Let's talk inside.

395
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,040
Sir,

396
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,760
your shoelace is untied.

397
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,920
My shoelace is untied.

398
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,920
Sir.

399
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,440
What is it now?

400
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
I...

401
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,880
My dream.

402
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,080
Come in and tell us.

403
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,080
Hey, teacher.

404
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,840
Since you two like sitting on windowsills so much,

405
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,970
go run ten laps around the playground.

406
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,520
Shengyang.

407
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,600
Look! Quick, look!

408
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,840
Look over there.

409
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Look at those two.

410
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,290
So funny.

411
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,280
Shengyang,

412
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,520
what's wrong?

413
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,900
Don't you see they're laughing at us?

414
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,600
They are laughing.

415
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,800
Xia Fanxing,

416
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,530
can't you tell they're mocking us?

417
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,760
No,

418
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,320
they're just laughing happily.

419
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,240
Ziyi.

420
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Shengyang.

421
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,640
What do you want now?

422
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,690
Join the table tennis club.

423
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,720
At a time like this,

424
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,180
can we not talk about that?

425
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,960
What time is it now?

426
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
Don't you feel we have a hurdle

427
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,810
that we can't overcome?

428
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,580
Aren't hurdles meant to be overcome?

429
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,740
No one has hurdles they can't eventually overcome.

430
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,120
Good.

431
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,960
Perfect.

432
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,680
Isn't my mom supposed to visit me today?

433
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,360
Mom, Dad,

434
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,600
I'm home.

435
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,860
There are some hurdles in life you just can't overcome.

436
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
I didn't tell you

437
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,320
because I didn't want to affect your competition.

438
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,530
Just because you were worried about my competition,

439
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,290
you even kept my mom's illness from me.

440
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,360
There are some things

441
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,320
you won't understand right now.

442
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,640
I won't understand?

443
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,560
I only understand that when my mom needed me most,

444
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,000
I wasn't by her side.

445
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,580
I didn't even get to see her one last time.

446
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
What's the point

447
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,920
of having it anymore?

448
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,000
Look!

449
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,400
The sunrise.

450
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,000
That's the sunset.

451
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,200
Whether it's sunset or sunrise, it's up to us to decide.

452
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,440
As long as we have hope,

453
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,770
everything we see is a new dawn.

454
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,000
Let go!

455
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,560
Come down first.

456
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,200
Let go!

457
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,760
What are you doing?

458
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,640
Whether we can overcome this obstacle

459
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,240
is up to us.

460
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,880
Ma Dongxi,

461
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,970
what are you looking at?

462
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,800
Do you want to go down and try the hurdles too?

463
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Sir,

464
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,940
Shengyang and Xia Fanxing are watching the sunset.

465
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,000
Look, everyone,

466
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,280
it's beautiful outside.

467
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,920
Hurry!

468
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,400
Teacher,

469
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,200
are we canceling self-study?

470
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,720
If we only focus on moving forward in life,

471
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,080
we'll miss many beautiful moments.

472
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,320
Learning to appreciate beautiful moments

473
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,360
is also an important lesson in life.

474
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,800
You think I can't handle you, huh?

475
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
Let me tell you one more time.

476
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,080
This is a school.

477
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
If you dare climb up again,

478
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,800
I'll call the police, got it?

479
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,480
Hey mister,

480
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,000
don't be so angry.

481
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,240
I can just wait here.

482
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,580
What time does school end?

483
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,040
5:30.

484
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,680
Shengyang,

485
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,440
5:30

486
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,520
will be the beginning of your nightmare.

487
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,240
Uncle.

488
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
You told me school ends at 5:30.

489
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,400
Now the school is empty.

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,340
I'm afraid you can't afford the price for deceiving me.

491
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,760
They use the front gate after school.

492
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,760
This is the back gate.

493
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
So it wasn't you who deceived me,

494
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,680
it was fate.

495
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,640
It's so late.

496
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,880
Who else is as hardworking as I am,

497
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,970
still practicing basketball?

498
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,680
Who's there?
