1
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,440
Ready.

2
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,120
Look right.

3
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,800
Look forward.

4
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,400
Okay.

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,600
Today.

6
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,200
Mr. Wang.

7
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,360
Mr. Wang.

8
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,700
Are you calling me?

9
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,400
No.

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,400
Maybe I heard it wrong.

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760
I thought you were calling me.

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,400
No.

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,890
Mr. Wang, if you need anything,

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,479
you can call me.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,080
It's okay.

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,880
I understand.

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,320
No.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,160
I mean

19
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,840
if

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,680
Mr. Wang,

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,080
you can call me.

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,240
It's okay.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,920
Okay.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,720
Mr. Shang.

25
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,640
Mr. Wang.

26
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,880
Are you busy?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,440
I want to...

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
It's time for class.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,300
Come on.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
I mean call him if you need anything.

31
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,520
Really?

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,920
You run faster than a rabbit.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,560
According to your actual situation,

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
according to

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,240
and the goal.

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,360
tacit plan.

37
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,400
Since we're going to land

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,320
to exercise.

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,760
So,

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
your tacit training

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,840
also focus on

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
in action.

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,360
How about this?

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,960
It's the spare time.

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,280
Three, five.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,400
One, three, five.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
Boys imitate girls' movements.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
As long as you two are together,

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,530
no matter what girls do,

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,280
boys have to imitate it.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
What about 246?

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Change.

53
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
Girls imitate boys' movements.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,360
Why are you doing this?

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,840
Read it a hundred times.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
It shows its righteousness.

57
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
You've been imitating each other for a long time.

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
you can guess

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,160
you can guess what he's going to do next.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
This is very helpful

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
for your game.

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Chuyu’s idea is very good.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,520
Very good.

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
But...

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,400
if I let him keep imitating me,

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,560
it'll be tiring

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,920
That's exhausting.

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
It's like hell.

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,680
Don't forget.

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,160
you made an oath.

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,960
No problem.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
We can do it.

73
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Come on.

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,280
Come on.

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm familiar with this.

76
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
So naïve.

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,480
Victory!

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,360
You're the idiot.

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Today is Wednesday.

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,320
Imitate me.

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Just for a while.

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
No.

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Time is running out.

84
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,640
Hurry up.

85
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,120
Wrong.

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
Can you be more careful?

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,880
How come?

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,680
I raised my right hand.

89
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,880
You raised your left hand.

90
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,700
Isn't this the right hand?

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,480
Do you think I'm a fool?

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,200
I...

93
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,440
The direction is obviously different.

94
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,560
That's right.

95
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
Good.

96
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,580
Anyway, your hand must go up. Double hit.

97
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Hurry up.

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
What are you doing? Go ahead.

99
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
We're rehearsing the dance.

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,880
Our school anniversary program signed up for a dance show.

101
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,040
What a pity.

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
If you don't participate in the competition,

103
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
you can dance

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,120
with us.

105
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,480
One, two, one, two.

106
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,420
What are you doing?

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,240
You're drooling.

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm not.

109
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,320
Are you that jealous?

110
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,080
No.

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm going to win in the league.

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,880
What competition?

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,280
On behalf of the school,

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,610
on behalf of the school.

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,320
What's more enviable

116
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,220
Starry and the others are already working hard.

117
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,080
We can't fall behind

118
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
It's not hard.

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
You're awesome.

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,810
Then you can even learn how to talk.

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Then you can even learn how to speak.

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
You really choked.

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,160
Unequal proof.

124
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,280
It's the same as

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
in math.

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,200
There is no comprehensive method.

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,480
This question

128
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,520
mainly

129
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Set XY as the main number.

130
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,520
X plus Y equals one.

131
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
Prove it with anti-evidence.

132
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,200
Take a look at the sample in the book.

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,720
The conclusion is denied by the confirmation question.

134
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
It's proven that the conflict is caused by deduction.

135
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
Look down.

136
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,320
A square plus b.

137
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,720
Then the square of C plus D

138
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,760
ABCD is the real number.

139
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,360
It involves four actual numbers.

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
And in form,

141
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,960
is also related to square and square.

142
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,280
Let's see

143
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,240
if we can compare

144
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
A.

145
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
Add B.

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,200
is more than 2B's guidance.

147
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Let's study its unequal relationship.

148
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm looking for a student.

149
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,760
Xia Fan Xing is very active in this class.

150
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,360
You deserve encouragement.

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Come on. Come on.

152
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,000
and solve

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
this question.

154
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Go for it!

155
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,080
Today is Thursday.

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
It's your turn to imitate me.

157
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay.

158
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,040
Come on.

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,280
Short legs.

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,240
Can you do it?

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
Why not?

162
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay.

163
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
That's all for this class.

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
Class is over.

165
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,600
I know.

166
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,160
I understand your puberty.

167
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
But you're high school students.

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,660
You should focus on your studies.

169
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,240
If you want to date, you can date whenever you go to college.

170
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,840
You can date as much as you want.

171
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,880
No one cares.

172
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,560
Sir.

173
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,680
It's not what you think.

174
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,640
Look at you two.

175
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,080
look like a couple.

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
The movements are the same.

177
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I knew something was wrong with you.

178
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,160
Sir.

179
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,220
You think too much.

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,960
We're imitating each other.

181
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,940
She imitated me today.

182
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,400
Not bad, Shengyang.

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,520
I didn’t know

184
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,760
you were a domineering president.

185
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,120
What?

186
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
Mr Zhou Chuan.

187
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,440
It's not his fault.

188
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,500
I did it willingly.

189
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,640
Star.

190
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,280
You're under his control, you know?

191
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,560
You can't date now,

192
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,880
even if you really fall in love,

193
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
you can't be so humble.

194
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,800
Why do you imitate him?

195
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,720
Be brave and be yourself.

196
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,640
You are the one and only.

197
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,080
Mr Zhou Chuan.

198
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,760
It really wasn't you.

199
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,040
Stop explaining.

200
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,480
Your relationship ends here.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,720
If you want to continue,

202
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,490
I can only talk to your parents.

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,520
Alright, go to class.

204
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Shengyang.

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Tell me honestly.

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
What spell did you cast?

207
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,000
that can make the stars

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
the stars

209
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,560
He's so obsessed.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,480
No, sir.

211
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,520
You misunderstood.

212
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm not your teacher.

213
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,080
In this aspect,

214
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,140
you are my teacher.

215
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,280
Share it.

216
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,560
Share what?

217
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,560
Stop pretending.

218
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,680
What did you do?

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,400
to

220
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,360
make her

221
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,220
to imitate you with all her heart?

222
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,160
No, sir.

223
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,200
We did that

224
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,920
to improve tacit understanding.

225
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,050
Good mixed doubles.

226
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
A mixed pair?

227
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,000
That's a good reason.

228
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,560
Why didn't I think of it?

229
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,280
Mr. Sheng.

230
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Mr. Chang

231
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,080
needs to be busy.

232
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,640
And?

233
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,160
Later,

234
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
I'll send you

235
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,040
the tactics of doubles to you.

236
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay?

237
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,680
Not a teacher.

238
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,240
Sir.

239
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,880
Please wait.

240
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,480
This is good.

241
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,290
Why didn't I think of it?

242
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
Mr. Wang.

243
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,800
What's up?

244
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Look.

245
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
You sit

246
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,560
every day.

247
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,040
It's bad for your health.

248
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,170
Do you want to get up?

249
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,600
exercise?

250
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,200
Do you think

251
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,730
sitting in class every day?

252
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,000
How can class be exercise?

253
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,520
Am I right?

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,760
Do you want to

255
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,640
play ping pong?

256
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,640
Do you think I'm idle?

257
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,720
Imitation is really hard.

259
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,880
When I think of imitating him,

260
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm scared.

261
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,200
Look at you.

262
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,760
All you know is eating.

263
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,020
I don't know what to do.

264
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,540
None of your business.

265
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,240
How did you two do it?

266
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
It's like a copy.

267
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,680
We both

268
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,560
sacrificed.

269
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,280
to attend the school anniversary.

270
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,800
Here.

271
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,840
Work hard.

272
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
How hard you work.

273
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,250
The test paper was revised last month.

274
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,680
Some students

275
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,480
made the same mistake as before.

276
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,400
How can you make mistakes after several hundred times?

277
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,760
But some of you

278
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,700
should congratulate her.

279
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,490
For example, Tangtang.

280
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,920
Her grades are stable.

281
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,520
She's still at the bottom.

282
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,810
Why don't you write the next essay?

283
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,960
My dream.

284
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,860
This topic is so easy to write.

285
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,080
I don't know what my dream is.

286
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,920
Sir.

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
My dream is to eat.

288
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Jo Woo-rin.

289
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,890
It's none of your business.

290
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
It's true

291
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,170
Ask Tangtang

292
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,800
what delicious food did you bring today?

293
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
Cut the crap.

294
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,120
Take out your textbook.

295
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,040
Class begins.

296
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,170
Tangtang, sit down.

297
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,640
Tangtang, are you okay?

298
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm fine.

299
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,000
What did you cook today?

300
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,800
Eat

301
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,960
All you know is eating.

302
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,720
You got the lowest scores again.

303
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,400
How many times have I told you?

304
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,920
Don't you study hard now?

305
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,440
In the future,

306
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,640
you can't even eat.

307
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
Eat some pork head.

308
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,080
to replenish your brain.

309
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Did you

310
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
from the market?

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,640
The vegetable seller didn't

312
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,840
before making the vegetables.

313
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
It smells fishy.

314
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,000
In order to cover up the smell,

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,840
to cover the smell.

316
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,040
But eat carefully.

317
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
It still tastes good.

318
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
If you have the strength,

319
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,000
why don't you talk about

320
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
When we talk about study,

321
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,960
you feel sleepy.

322
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,920
When you talk about food,

323
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,480
when you talk about food.

324
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,040
What will you do in the future?

325
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I don't want you to get into Harvard.

326
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
Cambridge or something.

327
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,240
Let's just

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,900
to go to Tsingbei University.

329
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,160
I'll be content.

330
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,040
Mom.

331
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,200
Tsingbei University seems not easy.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,040
How did your aunt

333
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,800
get in?

334
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Both of you

335
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
both arms and legs.

336
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,770
What's the difference?

337
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,640
I...

338
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,440
I might not be that talented.

339
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,400
Where?

340
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,079
Are you eating the top?

341
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,640
Is that a gift?

342
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Can a pig eat it?

343
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,599
Do you want to be a pig?

344
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,359
Tangtang, be careful.

345
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,880
Can you

346
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,160
let mom raise her head

347
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,420
in front of relatives.

348
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
It's the stars

349
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,120
Come in.

350
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,580
Auntie.

351
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,680
Tangtang is eating.

352
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Come and join us.

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
Thank you.

354
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,560
I'm not eating.

355
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,200
Well...

356
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,280
The teacher said

357
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
to review.

358
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,600
Star.

359
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,360
I'll take Tangtang to review

360
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Tangtang will stay at my house tonight.

361
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,920
Mom

362
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
I'm going to review.

363
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,640
Study hard.

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
My grandpa cooked ribs.

365
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Roast ribs.

366
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,120
The delicious ribs are here

367
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,160
Wow

368
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,880
It smells good

369
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,680
Let's eat.

370
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
This time,

371
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,720
no poisonous mushrooms this time?

372
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,120
Don't worry.

373
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
Now I can

374
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,760
can tell the poison mushrooms.

375
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Let's eat.

376
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,530
That's good.

377
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,840
Thank you.

378
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,920
Have you ever been polite?

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,000
Tangtang.

380
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,680
How does it taste?

381
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,000
Give grandpa

382
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,080
for grandpa.

383
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,360
Well,

384
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,840
a bit of wood.

385
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,160
Grandpa.

386
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,920
Did you

387
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,960
Did you drip directly?

388
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,160
How do you know?

389
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
The ribs should be marinated

390
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,920
We need to make them first

391
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
The ribs cooked like this

392
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,440
will be soft.

393
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,560
Come on. Come on.

394
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,520
Grandpa.

395
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,440
Tangtang is awesome, right?

396
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,920
Tangtang is amazing.

397
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
How do you know that?

398
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,360
I'm a foodie.

399
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,280
This is not Bap Soon.

400
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,640
She's just

401
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,920
a gourmet.

402
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,440
A gourmet.

403
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,520
A gourmet

404
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
Try this.

405
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,020
Help grandpa improve.

406
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,840
Lü.

407
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,370
Taste it.

408
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
Not bad.

409
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
Try this

410
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,600
Delicious

411
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,520
Me too.

412
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
Math.

413
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,040
It's too easy.

414
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,840
Come on.

415
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,360
This one.

416
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
The first question.

417
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,000
An is

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
First A1.

419
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,720
equals one.

420
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,880
The difference is D.

421
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,480
equals to three.

422
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
If

423
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,400
an equals to 2005,

424
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,730
The sequence number N is

425
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,640
667.

426
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,240
668.

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,920
670

428
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
669

429
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,000
Tangtang.

430
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,720
Which one?

431
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,600
What did I tell you before?

432
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,200
When you meet a question you don't know,

433
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,480
Just choose.

434
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,560
Right.

435
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,560
This is the quiz technique.

436
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,600
Well said.

437
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,120
Let's see the answer.

438
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,880
It's D.

439
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,160
It can't be D.

440
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
Then the answer will be wrong.

441
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,200
We have to question authority boldly.

442
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
What is the answer?

443
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,480
Let me ask Shengyang.

444
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,840
Shengyang Shengyang?

445
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,440
The answer on this question

446
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,560
is D.

447
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,440
Check if it's wrong.

448
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
Definitely not.

449
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,040
It should be C.

450
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:25,800
Right.

451
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,400
D.

452
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
669.

453
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,160
Use the formula.

454
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,280
and you'll know.

455
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
It's a formula.

456
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,440
I learned it.

457
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,760
All formula.

458
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,080
All formula.

459
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,720
Tangtang.

460
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
Do you remember the formula?

461
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
I think I've learned it.

462
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,080
What a familiar name.

463
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,720
A little strange.

464
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,960
A familiar stranger.

465
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,840
I remember.

466
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,360
I remember.

467
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,220
How to write it?

468
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
We must memorize ancient poems in Chinese.

469
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,260
You haven't memorized it yet?

470
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,480
Learning Chinese.

471
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm learning Chinese.

472
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,960
Learning Chinese.

473
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,360
Chinese.

474
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,920
This...

475
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
As the legend of Chancellor Lian Po,

476
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,840
Lian Po and Lin Xiang are like the legendary books.

477
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
This one.

478
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,640
So long.

479
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,800
Another one.

480
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,600
Watching the ocean

481
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,160
That's it.

482
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,360
The Chinese characters have become

483
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,440
Simple character.

484
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,130
It doesn't have the taste of Chinese characters.

485
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,680
What do you know?

486
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Do you know

487
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,800
was established,

488
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,440
80 percent are illiterate.

489
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,250
Do you know what that means?

490
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
To get rid of illiterate blindness,

491
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,080
and study.

492
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,480
That's why we simplified the Chinese characters.

493
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,520
The prosperity of our country

494
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,450
has contributed a lot to it.

495
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
I see.

496
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,360
I was ignorant.

497
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,640
Don't disturb me.

498
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,180
I'm studying tactics.

499
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,320
Do you know

500
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
why I love lollipops so much?

501
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
Tangtang

502
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,640
I think Star told me

503
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
I think it's because her grandma

504
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,920
her grandma always left delicious food

505
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,120
to her brother.

506
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,760
You're a girl.

507
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,080
Eat more vegetables.

508
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,840
These are for your brother.

509
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,440
Since then,

510
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,640
she swore

511
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
I must rely on myself

512
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,640
on my own.

513
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,960
That's why.

514
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,680
Is there anything delicious here

515
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,140
or good restaurants here?

516
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,080
There are a lot of delicious food.

517
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,160
What

518
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,120
Sausage salvage rice

519
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,200
Tuna dumplings

520
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,930
Seaweed dumplings.

521
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,680
You're buying me dinner?

522
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,720
It's not you.

523
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,400
Tangtang

524
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,000
You're a bitch.

525
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
It seems our Taiwan compatriots

526
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,560
have fallen in love.

527
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,120
Oh.

528
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I was right.

529
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,600
I'm not.

530
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,120
It's all mine.

531
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,740
Is there another person here?

532
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,600
No.

533
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,640
Why are you buying me dinner?

534
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,120
No reason.

535
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,880
Let me make it clear.

536
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
In high school,

537
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,280
in high school.

538
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
If you want to pursue me,

539
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,000
wait until I go to college.

540
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,560
Why are you laughing so happily?

541
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,880
Don't think too much, woman.

542
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,920
I just think

543
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
since we need tacit understanding,

544
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,860
let's not give each other a hard time.

545
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
So from now on,

546
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
we have to imitate each other.

547
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,420
so that we can defeat them.

548
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,280
But I'm afraid I can't.

549
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,640
I'm not as good as the stars.

550
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
Who said that?

551
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,720
She can do it.

552
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
Of course you can.

553
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,320
Really?

554
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
I trust you.

555
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,760
Seafood buns.

556
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,920
Eat up.

557
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,040
Dear

558
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,080
leaders,

559
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

560
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,960
Teachers.

561
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,800
Everyone.

562
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,680
Everyone.

563
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,720
Okay.

564
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,280
Today,

565
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,000
we gather here

566
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,560
to celebrate.

567
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,680
Xinde High School.

568
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,400
The 20th anniversary.

569
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,440
Twenty years.

570
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,760
The Lide Tree

571
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,560
Never forget your original aspirations.

572
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,320
New journey.

573
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
Let's work hard.

574
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,720
Again.

575
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,600
and glory.

576
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,880
Today,

577
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
let's

578
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
in the name of youth

579
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,440
in the name of youth

580
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,320
the glory

581
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,600
and dreams.

582
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
[and dreams.]

583
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,680
Aren't you going to watch the school anniversary show?

584
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,320
No.

585
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,250
Seize every minute and every second to practice.

586
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,290
Take a break with me.

587
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,120
You need company even when you're resting.

588
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,360
Don't you often go fishing with Tangtang?

589
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,640
That's different.

590
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,360
Let's go.

591
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,480
What?

592
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,760
I'm not going.

593
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,440
Excuse me.

594
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,400
Excuse me.

595
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,640
I can't hold it anymore.

596
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,680
Zhao Youlin.

597
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Cheng Yao.

598
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,720
What's wrong?

599
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,080
It's all because of Woo-rin.

600
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,800
He said he'd take us there last night.

601
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,400
to reward us.

602
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,360
We have diarrhea.

603
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,320
Alright, cut the crap.

604
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,920
We have to go on stage later.

605
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,520
Let's go to the toilet first.

606
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,400
How can we go on stage like this?

607
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,440
I can't hold it anymore.

608
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,200
Jo Woo-rin.

609
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,080
What is it? What's going on? What's wrong?

610
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,480
That's the ladies' room.

611
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,480
Do you really want to go to the school anniversary?

612
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,640
Of course.

613
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,720
I didn't participate in the first year of high school

614
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,200
When I was in grade 12

615
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,880
you must be very nervous.

616
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,120
There's no chance.

617
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,880
High school life

618
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,800
is destined to leave regrets.

619
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,640
They can't dance anyway.

620
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Let's go and save them.

621
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,200
We...

622
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,560
We've never rehearsed dancing.

623
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,570
Will anyone be more in sync than us?

624
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,080
Ah.

625
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,680
Beautiful.

626
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,560
and shine in youth.

627
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,320
Next,

628
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,080
please enjoy

629
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,960
from Class 3, Grade 2.

630
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,760
Applause!

631
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,600
Welcome.

632
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,120
Why are the stars and Shengyang up there?

633
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,240
When did they rehearse?

634
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
I didn't know.

635
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,120
they abandoned me.

636
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,600
Tacit understanding.

637
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,920
No skills at all.

638
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,400
I got on the stage of the school anniversary.

639
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,960
The regret I thought I would leave

640
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,290
was somehow fulfilled.

641
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,000
You can be disappointed in life,

642
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,690
but don't be disappointed.

643
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,360
I don't know

644
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
I don't know how it will end.
