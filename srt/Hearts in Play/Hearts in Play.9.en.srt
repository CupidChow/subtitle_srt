1
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,160
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,680
Time out!

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,320
They've stopped.

4
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,560
Let's take a break.

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,780
Are you kidding me?

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,480
Are you a garbage truck?

7
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,039
Trash is catching up.

8
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,479
Meitong.

9
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,420
She’s consciously restricting your serve.

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,600
Give her a forehand long ball.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Hold her back.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,660
with her remote platform.

13
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,479
You have better basic skills than her.

14
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,160
Take your time.

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,120
Be careful. Be careful.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,720
Star.

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,500
Many people are praising you.

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,560
Star.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,240
You can only say it right if you hit me like this.

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,680
Relax.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
Come on.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,210
Come on. Come on.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,680
Come on.

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,600
Are you ready?

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,240
Yes.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,760
Start.

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,680
You're here.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't be nervous.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,360
Steady.

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
11 to 9.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Great.

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,329
The stars are great.

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,520
Well done

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,720
Call me sister.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,720
Little pet.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,640
Good star.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,200
If we play like this,

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,160
we'll win.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Mr. Chang is right.

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,320
It's like Argentina against our men's footing.

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,200
Losing is a win.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Yeah.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,760
I really want the principal to see our strength.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
It's okay. There's a replay.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Yes.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,920
Fortunately, your video

47
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,960
Young-jeong.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I won’t let them get a penny.

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,290
Where is Shengyang?

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
Listen.

51
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,960
I am Shengyang.

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
This...

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,440
No.

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,520
Is he okay?

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,200
You are Shengyang?

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
I just had a plastic surgery.

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,970
What about your accent?

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,400
By the way,

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
by the way.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,440
Bro.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,720
Your brain is the most important thing now.

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,640
You know?

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Is this idiot your school?

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Can you take him away?

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,320
Sorry.

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,880
We'll take care of it.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,320
I want to play basketball with him.

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,640
I want to play basketball with him.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
Okay.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,519
Old friend,

71
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,680
Let me explain.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,680
Shengyang will be here soon.

73
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,480
You asked us to wait for your students.

74
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,240
Chang Pil Sheng.

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Are you kidding me?

76
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,840
Old classmate.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,640
Can't you wait for five minutes?

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
Chang Pil!

79
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,800
Are your students scared?

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
How could my students be scared?

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,920
I dare you.

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
Let's wait for another ten minutes. Okay.

83
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Little girl,

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
According to the rules,

85
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,560
you give up.

86
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,800
We won.

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
I thought I could have a match with Shengyang.

88
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
I shouldn’t have come here.

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,400
How could you say that?

90
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Are we going to give up like this?

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,520
Wait.

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm the president of the Table Tennis Club of Xinde High School.

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,340
I'll play with you.

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,480
I heard you're the president of your school.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Today, we’ll talk about

96
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,760
I only fight with Shengyang.

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,640
Do you know

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,320
Shengyang is only good at using Bubble Gum in our club.

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm good.

100
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,480
If you're scared,

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
you can leave now.

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Young Ting

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,880
Make it quick.

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,050
Another player.

105
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
Guess the serve.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,840
Let him serve.

107
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Who else can’t do it?

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Liu Manxin.

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
Liu Manxin.

110
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,780
This dishonest president

111
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,280
OK?

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Hey, I...

113
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,840
I knew it.

114
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,480
Too weak.

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,400
This is too bad.

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,040
Didn't he practice?

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,960
Maybe someone else can do it.

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,620
Stop embarrassing yourself.

119
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,040
Replace.

120
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,880
Don't embarrass our school.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,840
Didn't your president buy it?

122
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,160
He started to hit people.

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,600
Chang Pil Sheng, you've gone too far.

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,039
It’s my turn.

125
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,520
I'm not afraid.

126
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,600
Luo Qing.

127
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,840
Calm down.

128
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
Stop fighting!

129
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,000
No, no, no.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,720
Calm down.

131
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,080
Calm down.

132
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Don't fight. Calm down.

133
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,440
Shengyang.

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,000
It's so lively.

135
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,440
Am I late?

136
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,920
He said that just now.

137
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,050
You're not from the Table Tennis Club.

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,280
I am now.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,840
Sir.

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
President.

141
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
Shengyang from Xinde Table Tennis Club.

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,320
Report.

143
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,720
Mr. Sun.

144
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,850
This is my child.

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,520
This is my child.

146
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,240
My teammates.

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,720
I want to fight with you.

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,320
You guys

149
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,450
You treat us as training partners.

150
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,440
Yes.

151
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
The game has started, right?

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,960
Chang Pil wins! Shame on you!

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
You want a wheel battle?

154
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,560
It's okay, coach.

155
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
I came here

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,320
to compete with

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,400
[the 16th Youth Table Tennis Championships]

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Let's play.

159
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,720
Second place.

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,560
I want to fight him even more.

161
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,440
What was your last ranking?

162
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,690
Heroes don't care about rankings.

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,920
Come on, Shengyang.

164
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,400
Let's start all over again.

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,860
Start from the beginning.

166
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,640
No need.

167
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,160
Our president often tells us to be polite to our opponents.

168
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,690
The three balls just now...

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,520
The four balls

170
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
I'll let you win.

171
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,290
To express my feelings.

172
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,800
You're so arrogant.

173
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Cut the crap.

174
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,880
Come on.

175
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,600
He's going to poop.

176
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
I have tissues.

177
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,400
Here.

178
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
0 to 5.

179
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,320
Mr. Chang, can he really do it?

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,800
He hasn't played basketball for a long time.

181
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
My hands are a little rusty.

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,720
No problem.

183
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,040
He's here to be funny

184
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,800
Come on, son.

185
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
You're the best! You can do it!

186
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,450
Red Feather.

187
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,440
So handsome.

188
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,000
My son is so handsome.

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
Are you still serving or not?

190
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,800
Sit over there.

191
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,360
Come on.

192
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
Come on!

193
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,760
Come on!

194
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
Why are you so eager to lose?

195
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll help you.

196
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,640
Wonderful!

197
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
Nice shot.

198
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,000
Five to one.

199
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Great!

200
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,560
Tangtang

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
My family and babies.

202
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,900
Roll up the live comments.

203
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,280
Nice shot!

204
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Nice shot!

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,320
It's okay

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Just do it like this.

207
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,520
Keep your balance.

208
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,880
Okay.

209
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
Very good.

210
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,960
Very good.

211
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,600
Shengyang made another goal.

212
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
You're playing anxiously, family and babies.

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,800
There's a turn

214
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,160
Nice.

215
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,720
You even typed.

216
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
How dare you say we can't?

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,240
Can you do it?

218
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,480
Nice!

219
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,760
Nice shot!

220
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,880
Look.

221
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,640
Nice shot!

222
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
No hurry.

223
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,960
It's okay.

224
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,040
Hold it.

225
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:18,970
Good job.

226
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
We did it!

227
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,920
We won, right?

228
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,450
He's overtaking us.

229
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,720
Don't worry.

230
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,040
Great!

231
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
We won back.

232
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,400
Come on.

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,730
11 Bing9.12.

234
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,660
It’s the match point of Shengyang again.

235
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,360
No hurry.

236
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,920
Nice shot!

237
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,980
It's Jung Young-jeong's match point again.

238
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,120
One more!

239
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Who's serving?

240
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,000
Nice shot!

241
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,040
Nice shot!

242
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,040
Four to ten.

243
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,160
Yingting wins.

244
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Nice shot!

245
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,740
Shengyang, nice shot!

246
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,960
Yingting is great

247
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,440
Good job

248
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
If you start from zero,

249
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,480
you would have lost.

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
You are right.

251
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,360
Shengyang.

252
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
See you in the Middle School League.

253
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,560
I hope you can make it to the final.

254
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,440
The same goes for you.

255
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,560
Wait.

256
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,140
The principal sent it.

257
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,320
He asked you to prepare

258
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
to participate in

259
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,280
[Middle School Table Tennis Tournament.]

260
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,640
Shengyang.

261
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,500
Welcome to the Table Tennis Club.

262
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,080
Welcome Shengyang.

263
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,280
Let's go.

264
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,610
I'll treat you to a meal.

265
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,730
Impossible.

266
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
You never invite me.

267
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Why not?

268
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
What should we eat?

269
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
I want to eat sausage salvage rice.

270
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,640
Let's go

271
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,880
Let's eat.

272
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,359
Let's go.

273
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
How's the weather today?

274
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,980
We often use an idiom to write compositions.

275
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,360
Sunshine.

276
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,040
Look! It's them!

277
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
Look, it's them.

278
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,680
It's them!

279
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,120
Isn't that Angel Star?

280
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
They're even with Aoyo.

281
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah.

282
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,980
They were so arrogant before.

283
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,380
They've brought honor to our school.

284
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,600
Awesome!

285
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,640
Great

286
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,560
What are you doing?

287
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,800
Sir.

288
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,280
Who put the wrong thing on my desk?

289
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,280
I did.

290
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
The teacher's punishment is clear.

291
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You've improved.

292
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,090
You should be rewarded.

293
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,240
Open it.

294
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
Thank you.

295
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,300
Remember to finish it.

296
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
Catch the wind

297
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
and live up to our expectations.

298
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm a member of the Table Tennis Club.

299
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Xia Fan Xing.

300
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,880
Shengyang.

301
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,160
[On last Saturday,]

302
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
[and won five high school ping-pong tournaments.]

303
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,420
Qingyang High School.

304
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,720
[The champion, Qingyang High School]

305
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,600
[and had a friendly match.]

306
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,560
and got an extraordinary result.

307
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,120
He has developed the sportsmanship that never gives up.

308
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,040
Winning is not the purpose.

309
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,160
Winning is the true meaning.

310
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,170
Show your style.

311
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,520
Just write it out.

312
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,840
No.

313
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,600
You should write something like a student of Xinde High School.

314
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,600
What about the Table Tennis Club?

315
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,760
You have to join the Table Tennis Club too.

316
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,560
If you do that,

317
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,360
Gosh.

318
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,040
A student of Xinde High School.

319
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,800
I think it's easier this way.

320
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
There's something wrong with your logic.

321
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Little mouth.

322
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,840
Let me sort it out.

323
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
What are you writing?

324
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,960
Chuyu said

325
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,600
the ending of our game with Qingyang Table Tennis Club

326
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,040
is exciting.

327
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,840
It's amazing.

328
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
We're going to make it public.

329
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,160
So?

330
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,660
I wanted Star to come to the broadcasting club and do it myself.

331
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,700
But the manuscript was rejected several times.

332
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,400
They said they didn't write well.

333
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,460
I need to change it.

334
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,200
It's just a radio script.

335
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,520
Don't be so serious.

336
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
This is not serious.

337
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,690
Be serious. Be serious.

338
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,240
Besides,

339
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
I think Chuyu is right.

340
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
After all, this is the first time our Table Tennis Club publicized it at the radio station.

341
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,600
I've finished it.

342
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,440
Take a look for me.

343
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
Hello, mentors.

344
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Hello, everyone.

345
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm Xia Fan Xing from Xinde Table Tennis Club.

346
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,360
It's an honor

347
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,200
to share our joy with you here.

348
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,120
Our Table Tennis Club

349
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
[has won]

350
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,720
[Qingyang High School]

351
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,520
[Qingyang High School]

352
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
[a friendly match]

353
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,880
[a friendly match.]

354
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,080
[We hold the spirit]

355
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,680
and never give up.

356
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,520
Losing the opponent

357
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,080
But it's a great opportunity

358
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
with such an excellent opponent

359
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,040
and 12 to 14.

360
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,800
is already

361
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,360
for us.

362
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,240
Next,

363
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,000
we will represent Xinde High School

364
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,760
on behalf of Xinde High School.

365
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Stop.

366
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
Not again.

367
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
Let's go. Let's go.

368
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,800
Chou Yu. Yes.

369
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
What is the point?

370
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,720
Look.

371
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
I've told you about the competition.

372
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
I also promoted sportsmanship.

373
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,000
And the back.

374
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Later?

375
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
I also talked about the league.

376
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,320
It also promotes the spirit of our students.

377
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,680
No need.

378
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,420
Take it back and modify it.

379
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
It's returned again.

380
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,040
Change it again.

381
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
How?

382
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,600
My composition is not good.

383
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Help me change it.

384
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,760
Then help me.

385
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
Didn’t Chuyu give any specific amendments?

386
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,760
She said

387
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,760
She said, "Let's go." "Let's go." "Let's go."

388
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
didn't get the point.

389
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,360
The point.

390
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
Let him try.

391
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,280
Shengyang.

392
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,040
Take a look.

393
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,560
Your reading ability is perfect.

394
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,960
You can definitely do it.

395
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,680
Shengyang’s reading understanding is always perfect.

396
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,120
I see.

397
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
Will this work?

398
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,160
Wonderful, Star, you wrote it so well.

399
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,720
I finally got the point.

400
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,280
Let's start.

401
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
Hello, everyone.

402
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,720
Hello, mentors.

403
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm Xia Fan Xing from Xinde Table Tennis Club.

404
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,880
It's an honor

405
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,120
to share our joy with you here.

406
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,240
[Last Saturday,]

407
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,840
[the champion of many high school ping-pong tournaments]

408
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,320
[Qingyang High School]

409
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,600
[a friendly match.]

410
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,440
Even though he lost,

411
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,360
but this result

412
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,160
with the support of our classmates.

413
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,240
Especially the vice president of the student union, Lin Chuyu.

414
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,760
She often sends us food during our training.

415
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,920
and encouraged us.

416
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,480
Wow.

417
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,120
Shengyang Star.

418
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,800
The comments of your video are so high.

419
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,680
You'll become Internet celebrities soon.

420
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,160
You can deliver goods live soon.

421
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,960
Look.

422
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,080
Look.

423
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,760
I've never seen so many comments.

424
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,720
Look at this one.

425
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,880
The stars

426
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Chuyu

427
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,920
Star.

428
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,720
Shengyang.

429
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,720
Chuyu.

430
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
I specially congratulate you on behalf of the student union

431
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,680
on your achievement.

432
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,320
Thank you.

433
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,720
You're welcome.

434
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,720
Don't mention it.

435
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,520
This is what I should do as the president of the Table Tennis Club.

436
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
Stop it.

437
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,880
You are celebrities of the school now.

438
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,680
The student union wants you to be disciplinary committee.

439
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,480
Sorry.

440
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,690
I'm not interested.

441
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Chu Yu.

442
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I can do it.

443
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,880
Tangtang, you really can't.

444
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,680
They are

445
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
are the role models of students.

446
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,570
A role model is still powerful.

447
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,520
After entering the student council,

448
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,720
we can use their influence

449
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,580
We can serve the students better.

450
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,280
It sounds

451
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
a great responsibility.

452
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,680
Actually, I'm doing this for your own good.

453
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
The principal

454
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,520
the principal dropped out just like that.

455
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,680
After Star enters the student council,

456
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,880
in the Student Union,

457
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,240
we can protect the Table Tennis Club better.

458
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,480
Chuyu is right.

459
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,880
If I join the Student Union,

460
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,840
then

461
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
I can protect the Table Tennis Club.

462
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,880
Star.

463
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
We need to learn.

464
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,440
and prepare for the competition.

465
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
I don't have the energy to attend the student council.

466
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,240
I’m leaving.

467
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,540
Shengyang.

468
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,000
Chuyu, don’t worry.

469
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,180
As long as I'm here,

470
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
I will support you.

471
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,440
Me too.

472
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,320
Me too.

473
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,160
You are the best.

474
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,680
Star, look.

475
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,080
I've prepared it for you.

476
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,720
Please take the lead

477
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,080
to add bricks to our school's development.

478
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,240
to create

479
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,400
a happy campus environment.

480
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,880
Here.

481
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,400
Why are you throwing trash?

482
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm sorry. I'll pick it up now.

483
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,650
Hurry up.

484
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,250
Throw it into the trash can.

485
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,160
Don't throw it away next time.

486
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,800
Or I'll record it.

487
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,770
What's going on?

488
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,880
He's running in the corridor.

489
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,010
What if you get hurt?

490
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,200
Go to study.

491
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,040
We'll go now.

492
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,440
Loud in the corridor

493
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,560
Noisy.

494
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,540
Go to study.

495
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,480
Oh.

496
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,120
Study hard.

497
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,120
Excuse me.

498
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,180
Shengyang.

499
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:55,880
Star.

500
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm going to practice.

501
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,480
Let's go.

502
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
Can't you see I'm working?

503
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
Chuyu gave me the school discipline.

504
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,320
How much you trust me.

505
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,210
I have to shoulder this responsibility and mission.

506
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
and make everyone

507
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,840
to abide by the discipline

508
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,080
and build a beautiful campus together.

509
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,090
You sound more and more like Lin Chuyu.

510
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,720
After I became the disciplinary committee,

511
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I know how heavy the burden on her shoulders is.

512
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,800
This is not something I can understand

513
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
I can understand.

514
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,900
Shengyang.

515
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,840
Please cooperate with us.

516
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,360
Look at you.

517
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,280
You don't pay attention to your appearance at all.

518
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,050
When are you going to practice?

519
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,250
Waiting for school.

520
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,060
I'll wait for you to practice.

521
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,920
Shengyang.

522
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,890
Next time you see me,

523
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,050
don't call me Xia Fan Xing anymore.

524
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Call me.

525
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,240
Mr. Xia.
