1
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,320
Go and bring light to humanity.

2
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,760
Go and bring light to humanity.

3
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,560
Charge!

4
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,640
Come on!

5
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,000
Nice shot!

6
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,440
Great shot!

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,520
But

8
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,120
Manxin,

9
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
what was Fanxing

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,400
talking about just now?

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,720
Something about light for humanity?

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,120
That's just Xia Fanxing's energy.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,729
Fanxing,

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,520
come on!

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,160
The glory belongs to you.

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Go Fanxing!

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Come on!

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,720
Hey.

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Lower your center of gravity.

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,479
Watch your wrist.

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,979
The 16th City Middle School Table Tennis League officially kicks off today.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,880
Outstanding table tennis students from middle and high schools across the city have gathered here

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,320
Outstanding table tennis students from middle and high schools across the city have gathered here

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,720
to compete in the preliminaries.

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,050
They're competing for spots in the top 64.

26
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,680
Come on!

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,720
Go, Fanxing!

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,360
Come on!

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,320
Time out!

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
Hurry!

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Hurry up!

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,120
What's wrong?

33
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,650
Fanxing?

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,579
What happened?

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,200
Nothing.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,680
Are you thirsty?

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,800
You need to rest a bit, right?

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Okay, quickly.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Drink some water.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,010
Fanxing,

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,760
you're playing really well.

42
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,640
We're already

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,320
far ahead.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
All you need to do now is

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,360
stay steady and focused.

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,320
What's your name, coach?

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Chang Bisheng.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,720
That means always victorious.

49
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,920
Victory in every match.

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,000
Good.

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,920
Grandpa, I need to use the bathroom.

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
I'll go with you.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,080
No need,

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I can go by myself.

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,050
Coach Chang,

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
my granddaughter

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,360
is playing well, isn't she?

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
With your granddaughter's skill level,

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,520
making the top eight

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
will be a piece of cake.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,850
Grandpa.

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,800
Oh my!

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,100
Still not back yet.

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,079
I don't know.

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,480
Why hasn't Fanxing returned yet?

66
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
It's been so long.

67
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,800
Sorry, referee.

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Tangtang,

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
go check quickly.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,600
Maybe

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
she forgot to bring the paper.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,760
This kid is always so careless.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Brother,

74
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
have a cigarette.

75
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,120
This is a gymnasium.

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
How did you bring cigarettes in here?

77
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,290
Just one cigarette.

78
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,610
Grandpa.

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
Don't be angry, referee.

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,760
Let me give you a massage.

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,520
Help! Someone come quickly!

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,920
Xia Fanxing fell into the toilet!

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,120
Xia Fanxing fell into the toilet!

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,240
Fanxing fell into the toilet!

85
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,079
Just because of Tangtang's words,

86
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,440
I got a nickname from then on.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,080
Angel Fanxing.

88
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,840
Angel Fanxing.

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,800
Angel Fanxing.

90
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Let them mock me.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
The best way to deal with mockery

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
is to take it as a compliment.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
But after being called that for so long,

94
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,159
don't forget my real name,

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,400
Xia Fanxing.

96
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,760
Good morning.

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm from Xinde High School,

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
a student in Class 3, Grade 2,

99
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,960
Xia Fanxing.

100
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
However,

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,640
I have another mysterious identity,

102
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,880
which is

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,240
a member of Xinde High School's table tennis club.

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,840
This person playing now

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
is Tangtang.

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,760
But her specialty isn't table tennis,

107
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,480
it's eating.

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,600
In any situation,

109
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,330
don't even think about stopping her from eating.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,680
Tangtang.

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,820
What are you doing?

112
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
Jump once, let me see.

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,280
If you think she only eats these things,

114
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,210
then you're underestimating her.

115
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,050
Her original creations

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
are also extraordinary.

117
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,360
This is Tangtang,

118
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,120
a food monster in human form.

119
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,240
This is Liu Manxin,

120
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
he's the president of our table tennis club.

121
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,850
He became president

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,760
not because he's good at playing,

123
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,420
but because the president must possess another important skill.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
Liu Manxin.

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,640
All the balls in the club are worn out,

126
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,600
we need to buy new ones.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
More expenses again.

128
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,080
That's right.

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
This skill

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
is just...

131
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
What's going on?

132
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Is the table tennis club recruiting again?

133
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,440
Look at the time!

134
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,280
The competition is coming up soon.

135
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,000
The ping pong club desperately needs new talent.

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
Liu Manxin.

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Why did you raise the price again?

138
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,520
I used to pay only 2 yuan for a match ticket.

139
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,920
The ping pong club belongs to all of us.

140
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,080
Just contribute a little bit.

141
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,290
We're not far from winning the championship.

142
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,159
This person

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,800
is our business-minded club president.

144
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
We have another important member.

145
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,520
And that story

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,760
begins on a bright sunny morning.

147
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,920
Fanxing

148
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,640
loves you.

149
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,320
Love me.

150
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,160
Don't just love me.

151
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,960
Tangtang,

152
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,200
have you recruited any new members for our ping pong club?

153
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm telling you,

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
otherwise it'll be too late.

155
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I heard

156
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,560
this year's middle school ping pong tournament

157
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
has added mixed doubles.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
This time,

159
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,290
we should get as many medals

160
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
as we possibly can.

161
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,690
You want to win gold medals?

162
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,120
Our school is known for being physically weak.

163
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
They only care about academic scores

164
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,880
and have never won any medals in any sports.

165
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
I suggest

166
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,680
you give up on that idea.

167
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,960
Zhao Youlin is right.

168
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
Besides,

169
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,200
you didn't even make it to the top 32 last time

170
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
and you fell into the toilet.

171
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
How can you talk about championships?

172
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,840
Angel Fanxing.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,460
Still dreaming of medals.

174
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,840
Shengyang

175
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes, teacher.

176
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,520
I understand your situation.

177
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,880
You're quite the celebrity at your school.

178
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,680
Teacher.

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,720
I transferred here just to focus on my studies.

180
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,960
I don't want to think about anything else.

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,760
Very good.

182
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,210
I'll take you to your class.

183
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,960
If you ask me,

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,600
high school students like you

185
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,330
should focus

186
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,000
on your studies.

187
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,559
Fanxing is only like this because she injured her leg.

188
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,480
The teacher said

189
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,940
with her skills, she would definitely make it to the top eight.

190
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,480
It's exactly because our school

191
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,720
has never won any sports awards

192
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,920
that I'm determined to bring back a medal.

193
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,800
Who says that if we didn't have it before,

194
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,120
we won't have it in the future?

195
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,880
China didn't have atomic bombs before,

196
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,160
but now we do,

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,760
right?

198
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
People need to be bold in their thinking and actions.

199
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,880
We must get rid of this

200
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,140
label of being a physically weak school.

201
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,160
Speechless.

202
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,280
Being number one

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
creates business opportunities.

204
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,400
Our school

205
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,080
has never won

206
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,040
any sports awards.

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
We're filling a gap at our school.

208
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,520
If we win this award,

209
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,320
do you think the school leaders will neglect us?

210
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
No.

211
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm planning

212
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,360
to create a video account for our ping pong club.

213
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,200
First,

214
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,800
it can raise our club's profile

215
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
and help us recruit new members.

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,140
Second,

217
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
once the account takes off

218
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,640
and we gain followers,

219
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
we can do livestream sales.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,640
That's a decent income too.

221
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,160
Liu Manxin,

222
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,740
why are you always thinking about money?

223
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Xia Fanxing.

224
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,080
Hmm.

225
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,340
Aren't you going to college to find a job?

226
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,810
And aren't you finding a job to make money?

227
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,240
If we start now while we're in high school,

228
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
doing what college students would do,

229
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
what are we doing?

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Taking shortcuts.

231
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,360
Hmm.

232
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,330
I've already registered the account.

233
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,680
Why do you have a meal card?

234
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,940
This isn't an ordinary meal card.

235
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Look.

236
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
A phone!

237
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,440
Be careful the teachers don't catch you.

238
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,600
This is a stealth phone.

239
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
Teachers can't see it.

240
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Ma Dongxi.

241
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,720
You don't need to eat so many eggs just for working out.

242
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,640
Finally, it's your turn.

243
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,120
Hey! My egg!

244
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,960
Wow!

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,000
He actually used a book to absorb the egg's force.

246
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,000
And with such perfect aim.

247
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,400
It broke.

248
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,200
Are you all trying to rebel?

249
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
Since you have so much energy,

250
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,240
you'll recite 'Li Sao' from memory,

251
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,040
ten times.

252
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
No!

253
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,760
We won't dare do it again,

254
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,360
teacher.

255
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,680
Please don't, teacher.

256
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,640
Stop trying to negotiate with me.

257
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,360
This is the new transfer student in our class.

258
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,400
Shengyang,

259
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,760
from now on, he's part of our class.

260
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,480
Everyone should care for each other

261
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,680
and help one another.

262
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,740
Shengyang,

263
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
you'll sit next to Tangtang.

264
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,000
Could he be a ping-pong prodigy?

265
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,210
We might have a chance at the mixed doubles championship this year.

266
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,160
Why are you looking at me?

267
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,600
Look at the blackboard.

268
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,480
Let me first talk about our class's homework situation.

269
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
Xia Fanxing.

270
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I've told you hundreds of times

271
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
to write neatly.

272
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,820
Look at your handwriting.

273
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,610
It looks like chicken scratch.

274
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,140
Don't you care about your presentation points in the college entrance exam?

275
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,160
Alright, take out your textbooks.

276
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Where did we leave off last time?

277
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,760
Turn to page 51,

278
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,860
three short articles.

279
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,600
Today we'll be discussing

280
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Montaigne's 'Love of Life.'

281
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,620
Has anyone previewed this material?

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,960
Ma Dongxi.

283
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,960
Hey!

284
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Shengyang!

285
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
Hello.

286
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,000
My name is Xia Fanxing.

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,240
Stars of summer.

288
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,200
You must be good at table tennis, right?

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,680
Just now when you

290
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,360
caught that egg

291
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,440
with your textbook,

292
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,160
wow!

293
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,960
You clearly absorbed the impact with the book,

294
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
and your landing control

295
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
was amazing.

296
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,800
Hey!

297
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,650
Join our table tennis club.

298
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,200
Excuse me.

299
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,960
Hello?

300
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,520
Shengyang,

301
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,160
haven't you heard of our table tennis club?

302
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,760
Our table tennis club is the most prestigious club in the school.

303
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,720
We really are the strongest club on campus.

304
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,440
Let me tell you,

305
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,640
many students are dying to get in but can't.

306
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,920
Today

307
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
you're in luck.

308
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,680
I...

309
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,040
Listen.

310
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,940
I'm the vice president of the table tennis club.

311
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,330
As long as I approve,

312
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,720
you can skip

313
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,520
the written test, interview, and elimination rounds,

314
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,600
and join directly.

315
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Plus, you'll get training from professional coaches.

316
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,480
In the future,

317
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,200
you can meet many sports celebrities.

318
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,920
Let's compete together.

319
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Do you even believe what you're saying?

320
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,240
It doesn't matter if I believe it.

321
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,280
As long as you do.

322
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,240
Fine.

323
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,160
Join the table tennis club.

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,660
Shengyang.

325
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,840
Join the table tennis club.

326
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,440
Shengyang.

327
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,560
Join the table tennis club.

328
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,040
Shengyang.

329
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,720
Oh,

330
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,680
sorry.

331
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
Shengyang.

333
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,040
Shengyang,

334
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,130
please join the table tennis club.

335
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,400
Shengyang,

336
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
join the table tennis club.

337
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,720
Get out.

338
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,880
Sure thing.

339
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,080
What's wrong with you?

340
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,440
Why are you like this?

341
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,400
Xia Fanxing.

342
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,040
I have good news for you.

343
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
Really good news.

344
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,040
Our school has a new student.

345
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,420
His name is Sheng Yang.

346
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,680
Do you know who he is?

347
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,900
He's the former

348
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,120
youth

349
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,960
table tennis

350
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,120
championship

351
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,080
winner.

352
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,640
Wow.

353
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,880
But don't get too excited.

354
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,480
This guy

355
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,080
has quit the sport.

356
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,200
Don't know why.

357
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,770
So I'm giving you a mission.

358
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,840
You must convince him to join our

359
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,760
table tennis club.

360
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,680
Use what you're best at:

361
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,520
tricks and sweet talk.

362
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,200
Whatever it takes,

363
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,680
just get him to join us.

364
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,480
Let me finish.

365
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,040
You'll

366
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,000
compete in

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
women's singles.

368
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,120
He'll compete in

369
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,680
men's singles.

370
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,360
And both of you

371
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,240
will go for mixed doubles.

372
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,900
Our chances

373
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,880
will improve.

374
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,400
Got it?

375
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
Coach,

376
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,400
what are you saying?

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Coach,

378
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,840
what do you mean by tricks and sweet talk?

379
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,900
I've never tricked anyone in my life.

380
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,400
Others might not know you,

381
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,460
but I certainly do.

382
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,800
The moment you open your mouth,

383
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,200
you start

384
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,530
sweet-talking people.

385
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,599
I don't care.

386
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,960
This task is yours now.

387
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,880
We must get rid of

388
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
our school's reputation as physically weak.

389
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,640
Got that?

390
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,440
Fine.

391
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,240
That's it.

392
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,200
Student,

393
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,319
you look unfamiliar.

394
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,099
Are you new?

395
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
What's your name?

396
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,300
Sheng Yang.

397
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,839
Right.

398
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,760
Make sure to recruit Sheng Yang.

399
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,320
Grandpa.

400
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,840
Under what circumstances

401
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
would you give up your hobby?

402
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
Why would I give up Mrs. Wang?

403
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,320
I said hobby.

404
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,280
Your Mrs. Li.

405
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,000
Hobby!

406
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,020
That's your Mrs. Zhao.

407
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,080
Oh my!

408
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,240
Xia Dade.

409
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm talking about hobbies.

410
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,760
You're just

411
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,680
grandmas

412
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,500
Were you deprived of grandmas in your past life?

413
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,920
You silly child.

414
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,240
Do you know

415
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,160
when your grandpa started feeling old?

416
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,840
When?

417
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
It's when

418
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,040
I started finding old ladies pretty.

419
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,760
Your grandpa's

420
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,120
hobby

421
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,520
is old ladies.

422
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
Grandpa!

423
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
Don't you

424
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,490
really love playing ping pong?

425
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
When I was little,

426
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,520
whenever you practiced,

427
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,920
I would follow you around.

428
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
I love playing ping pong

429
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,040
largely because of your influence.

430
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,540
That goes without saying.

431
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,320
Your grandpa's ping pong skills

432
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,360
in this community

433
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
are second to none.

434
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,560
Of course!

435
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,640
So,

436
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,100
under what circumstances would you?

437
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,280
Under what circumstances?

438
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,680
When there are no grannies watching.

439
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,960
Hey!

440
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,240
Old Xia!

441
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,040
Wang Xishi,

442
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,000
Li Zhaojun and Zhao Diaochan are all here!

443
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,440
Come quickly for a game!

444
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,600
Old Sun

445
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,720
will be here soon.

446
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,320
You

447
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
keep track of the time yourself.

448
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,240
Five hours and we'll finish it.

449
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,160
Grandpa's leaving.

450
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,040
Bye now.

451
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
Bye-bye.

452
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
Is this really the reason?

453
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,890
No one watches me play basketball.

454
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,880
What's the point of playing anymore?

455
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm never playing again.

456
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
I see.

457
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,240
Shengyang.

458
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,040
Just wait.

459
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,680
I'll definitely make you

460
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,330
return to the court.

461
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
Why do I have such a bad feeling about this?
