1
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,360
I know a disease called

2
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,320
Sunshine depression.

3
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
It's also called Smile Depression.

4
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,320
Star.

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,240
I have a test paper for Tsingbuk University.

6
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,360
I heard everyone who made this test paper

7
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,160
can go to Cheongbuk University.

8
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
There's such a thing?

9
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,200
Why isn't it here?

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,330
I've seen it before.

11
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,360
My cousin made this paper

12
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,289
and got into Tsingbei University.

13
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,440
Wow!

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
I didn't know there was such a paper.

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,600
Chuyu.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,759
It's good. It's good. It's good.

17
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,600
You do it.

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
You do it. You do it.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,320
You do it.

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Wait a minute

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,960
Do it now

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,440
Do it now

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,480
Do it now.

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
I need to practice.

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,520
The competition is coming.

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,920
I'll do it after the game.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,720
I'm curious about this paper.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Shall we do it together?

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,410
Are you practicing?

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,800
What are you doing?

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,040
Doing exercises is also part of practice.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,520
Mr. Chang said

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
ping-pong is a sport

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,960
while playing Go.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,650
The brain is also important

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,490
Come on Let's do it together

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,079
I'll use a red pen.

38
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,010
You use blue pen.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,930
First question.

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Do you often have headaches recently?

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
No.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,840
A little.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,120
It fits perfectly.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Completely.

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,300
This is a question from Beijing University.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Okay, shut up.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Go on.

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,880
Maybe the test of Tsingbei University is so tricky.

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,810
I'll do it first.

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
The second question.

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,120
You can't copy my answer

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
You can't copy my answer.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
I didn't.

54
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
That's what I thought.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,480
As long as it's from the bottom of my heart.

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,520
Next question.

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,079
Question 3.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,200
There are unnecessary thoughts or words in your head.

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,880
Question 4.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The interest of a man decreases.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
What question is this?

62
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,360
Check the score.

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,920
Come on.

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,810
What's wrong with you three today?

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,340
Are you hiding something from us?

66
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,040
How dare you talk about us?

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah.

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
Why didn't you tell us what happened to Star?

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,720
Traitor.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,320
You're so funny.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,440
It's funny

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
What's wrong?

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
They seem to know.

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Know what?

75
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,080
It's about your movement transformation.

76
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,400
Really?

77
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,000
No wonder they were so strange.

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,760
Did they hear us

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,640
the other day?

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,200
Just know it.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,340
Take these two days to adjust.

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,159
I'm fine these days.

83
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,420
your video these days.

84
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,840
I think your movements

85
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,520
because of your nervousness.

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,450
So you have to overcome your nervousness.

87
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Okay.

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,160
I'll overcome it.

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
Okay. Again.

90
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,240
How is it?

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,880
Did you calculate it?

92
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Yes.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,600
45 points.

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
45 points.

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,650
What does that mean?

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,760
Fail.

97
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Why is the score so low?

98
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
Tangtang

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,920
This isn't a school exam.

100
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,240
It says it's normal if it's less than 50 points.

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,159
Normal.

102
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,720
Impossible.

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,880
Is this accurate or not?

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
It's just a reference.

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
How about

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,400
get her a psychologist?

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,440
No.

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
If I tell her directly,

109
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,000
what if she can't accept it?

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,820
Should we keep observing her?

111
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
Try not to leave her alone these days.

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,940
Let's stay with her for a few days.

113
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's do it again.

114
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640
Coming.

115
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
Why are you two here?

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
My house is being decorated.

117
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,340
I'll stay at your house for a few days.

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,840
My house doesn't want me anymore.

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,900
I'll stay at your house for a few days.

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,680
Did you know?

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Star.

122
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,880
Is what Manxin said true?

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,040
Star.

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,440
Why didn't you tell us?

125
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,180
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

126
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,240
Sung.

127
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
We didn't notice your condition earlier.

129
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
You've been caring about us

130
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
and taking care of us.

131
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,880
But we never really care about you.

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,880
As your good friends,

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,080
We're not qualified.

134
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,800
Star.

135
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,520
My snacks

136
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
in the future.

137
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,520
Really?

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Wait.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,880
No.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,600
What?

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,920
What's the condition?

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,180
It's not that serious.

143
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,840
You have depression.

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
It's not serious.

145
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,159
Someone will die.

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Who has depression?

147
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,159
You.

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
Me?

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,920
When did I get depression?

150
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,600
Liu Manxin said that.

151
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,360
What did Shengyang tell you?

152
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,860
genetic transformation?

153
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,960
No.

154
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,360
That's technical transformation.

155
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
Technical transformation?

156
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,640
Shengyang said

157
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,960
through watching my game video,

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,800
I found

159
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,080
the technical movements during the game.

160
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
and the standard movements

161
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,160
There are obvious changes.

162
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,320
and mistakes.

163
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
So he analyzed

164
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,960
this could be

165
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
in the competition,

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,400
in the competition

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
or nervous.

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,560
Liu Manxin also said

169
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,130
he heard you told Shengyang

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,370
you were depressed.

171
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,400
Yes.

172
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,919
I'm depressed again.

173
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,880
He's talking about me.

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
Unusual.

175
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
Liu Manxin also said

176
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,640
when you were alone,

177
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,320
when you're alone.

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,520
You're alone.

179
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,600
alone.

180
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,840
When she's with us,

181
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,900
when she's with us.

182
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,920
When I was alone,

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
I was there.

184
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,680
I sing and dance

185
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,040
I shout and laugh

186
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,480
Am I not crazy?

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
Indeed.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,440
Liu Manxin, that bastard.

189
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,300
I’ll teach him a lesson tomorrow.

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,760
Tangtang,

191
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,400
You just said

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,080
give me all the delicious food.

193
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,320
Is it true?

194
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,040
She's asleep

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,920
Tangtang doesn't snore when she sleeps.

196
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,160
Let me see.

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Sugar

198
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,880
Is there something delicious?

199
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,370
Sweet and sweet.

200
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,400
How was your observation yesterday?

201
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,120
It's serious.

202
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,240
We need to find her a psychologist.

203
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
What are you waiting for?

204
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,800
Find it

205
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,680
Star's grandpa is old.

206
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,040
You can't tell him about this.

207
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,760
Yes.

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
Liu Manxin.

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
We plan to

210
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,240
raise money to treat her.

211
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,680
How much does it cost?

212
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,760
A few hundred at least.

213
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,480
How much do you have?

214
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,440
A few hundred.

215
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,880
Take it.

216
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Is this enough?

217
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,880
This is too different.

218
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,560
Liu Manxin.

219
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,170
Take out your little vault.

220
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Here it is.

221
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
I don't know how much it costs to see a psychiatrist.

222
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,600
That's all I have.

223
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,320
I'll think of other ways.

224
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,880
Enough.

225
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,740
That's enough.

226
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,360
I found the star.

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,280
Liu Manxin.

228
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,600
Xia Fan Xing.

229
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Can you stop spreading rumors

230
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,360
and spread rumors everywhere?

231
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,640
Shengyang is talking about technical transformation.

232
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,680
Listen to a genetic transformation.

233
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,280
It's different from ordinary people.

234
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,610
Listen to it. Like this.

235
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,120
Like this.

236
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,280
Are you okay?

237
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I'm fine.

238
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,960
But...

239
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,720
to punish you,

240
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,880
this money

241
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,540
as the public expenses of the Table Tennis Club.

242
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,880
No.

243
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Xia Fan Xing.

244
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,840
That's too much.

245
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,200
Xia Fan Xing!

246
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Give me my life!

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,720
Let me teach you a way to overcome nervousness.

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,840
Blow your thumb like me.

249
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,880
Are you kidding me?

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Really.

251
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,160
When you blow at your thumb,

252
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,680
the air flow goes through the nerves on the thumb.

253
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,760
It can adjust heart rate and blood pressure.

254
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,600
Really?

255
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,640
Try it. Try it.

256
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,480
Not like this.

257
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Like this.

258
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
Blow it for five seconds.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,130
Repeat three times.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,880
How do you feel?

261
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,160
It seems good.

262
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,320
Try it.

263
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
How is it? Does it work?

264
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
This is today's training plan.

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,720
Hold it with forehand first.

266
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,880
and guard the loop.

267
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,880
The last one is for your leg.

268
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,800
That is, multi-serve.

269
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Sheng Yang.

270
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,040
Mr. Wang.

271
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,240
The Middle School League is about to start, right?

272
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't worry.

273
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,400
We won't delay our study.

274
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,290
We also listen carefully in class.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,520
Why are you so nervous?

276
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm here to tell you

277
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,160
you must be devoted to everything.

278
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,620
You can't be half-minded.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So I've discussed it with all the teachers.

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,040
During this period,

281
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
just focus on your competition.

282
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,260
After the game,

283
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,640
after the competition.

284
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
Really?

285
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,320
Can you be so nice?

286
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,880
What do you mean?

287
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,440
What do you mean?

288
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,600
I mean

289
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,280
we won't let you down.

290
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
Tell me

291
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,720
what do you want?

292
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,680
Sit down

293
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,240
Teacher's wish is

294
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,880
to study hard

295
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,520
and get a good result.

296
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,400
and get good grades.

297
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,720
It's not what the teacher wants.

298
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,960
It's just a way to realize my expectations.

299
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
At that time,

300
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,140
our teacher had always been there for us.

301
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,920
Only a famous school

302
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,360
and get a high salary

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,400
to be happy.

304
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,120
It's a formula.

305
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
It was like a clone during that time.

306
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,320
I've been using this formula

307
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,600
with this formula.

308
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
So I really hope

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,240
I hope

310
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,360
find your own

311
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,600
happiness

312
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
and happiness.

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,600
When you find your formula one day,

314
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,440
I will do my best to help you.

315
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,780
Come on.

316
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,320
What are we practicing today?

317
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Do you remember when you played with Xin Meitong last time,

318
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,180
when she played with Xin Meimeng?

319
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,880
Yes.

320
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,320
The court is like a battlefield.

321
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
If you don't change these weaknesses,

322
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,960
she won't be the only one

323
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,280
there will be other opponents who will use this trick against you.

324
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,720
So if you want to play well,

325
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,920
you have to overcome these weaknesses.

326
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,880
Here.

327
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,360
Let's start with the forehand.

328
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,160
Okay.

329
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
Catch him!

330
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,250
Don't move! Don't move!

331
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Come on. Come on.

332
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,360
[Xinde High School has been fighting all the way.]

333
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
[The 17th City High School Table Tennis Tournament]

334
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,960
[officially begins.]

335
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,290
[Excellent ping pong players from all junior high schools in the city]

336
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,760
[will be held today.]

337
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,840
will enter the top 64.

338
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,120
Yingting.

339
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,650
Meitong.

340
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,200
Did you notice

341
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
many losers in this stadium?

342
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,440
Yes.

343
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,600
Many losers

344
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,880
Tangtang.

345
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,960
Liu Manxin.

346
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,680
Didn't you notice it's noisy in this venue?

347
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,760
Yes.

348
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
So many flies.

349
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,800
Hello?

350
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,720
Xia Fan Xing.

351
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,920
You'd better pass the qualifiers.

352
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,640
Otherwise, you won't have a chance to compete with me.

353
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
Of course.

354
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,120
Let's go. Okay.

355
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
Come on.

356
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,810
We're destined to meet.

357
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,080
We were in the preliminaries last year.

358
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,440
Did we fall again?

359
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,920
No way.

360
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,180
Didn't you take advantage last year?

361
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm not that lucky this year.

362
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,320
The first round, Charlie Zhang Lin.

363
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,440
Nine to eleven, Zhang Lin wins.

364
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,840
Good job.

365
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,840
Let's go! Let's go!

366
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,520
We have

367
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,320
Four sets.

368
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,680
You can adapt to the rhythm.

369
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,080
It's okay.

370
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,400
Take your time.

371
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Come on, X.

372
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,000
Baby stars

373
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,800
Good job.

374
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,800
Come on.

375
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,640
Zhou Changshu of Shengyang in the first round.

376
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
Shengyang won.

377
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,760
Why can you score for others?

378
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
You can't let others score.

379
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,600
You should shave his head.

380
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,960
The sun

381
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,400
It can remove all fear

382
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,040
and darkness.

383
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,210
Come on. Come on.

384
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Watch your steps.

385
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,640
The third round, Xia Fan, Zhang Lin.

386
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
11 to 5.
