1
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,360
The one on the blackboard. The one on the blackboard.

2
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,000
and

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,360
There are special use in the language,

4
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,840
there are many more

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,039
Everyone

6
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,720
find ten of them.

7
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,440
I'll check the next class.

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,600
Everyone

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,840
is different.

10
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,480
Good news.

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,400
Hello. Hello.

12
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,920
Mr. Chang.

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,720
The class is not over yet.

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,400
Didn't you ring the bell?

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,360
It doesn't mean the class is over.

16
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,680
You don't have enough class

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,009
I don't know. I'll do it.

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,600
Come on. Come on.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Let's go. Let's go.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,880
It doesn't mean the class is over.

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,840
Can I think that way?

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,479
It means

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,360
The bell doesn't mean class.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,720
Students can do nothing

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,400
and have nothing to worry about.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,880
That's it.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,720
You're late.

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Right?

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,039
I...

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,440
have a reason to doubt

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,200
Now,

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,960
in the society,

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,479
those

34
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,160
that doesn't allow you to get off work on time.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
From class

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,480
in class.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,280
Mr. Wang.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,760
I won't take up your time.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,320
I see.

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,250
I have good news.

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,760
Stars.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,240
Shengyang.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,420
Qingyang High School.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
[Incoming call.]

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,360
Agreed.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,480
to

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
with us.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,720
a friendly match.

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,520
I knew it.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Give me the video.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,520
Is it okay?

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Yes.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,320
Okay.

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
I'm so embarrassed this time.

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
Ask him to shave his head.

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,290
Why are you so happy?

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,340
Jo Woo-rin.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,920
What?

60
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
Wait for me.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,079
Wait for me and Shengyang.

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,320
will slap you in the face.

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
Mr. Wang.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
Mr. Chang.

65
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,240
Students.

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,120
I just made up my mind.

67
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,450
You've messed up again.

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,160
Mr. Wang.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
That's their dream.

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,680
They are students.

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,480
Their mission is to study

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,600
to get good grades.

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,320
Mr. Wang.

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,960
Stop talking about mission.

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Okay?

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
Look at their task now.

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,480
Study hard.

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,520
The mission of graduation

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,920
to get into a good university.

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,680
right?

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,360
And

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
The next mission is to get married and have children.

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
Right?

84
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,760
Mission?

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
Who decided this?

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,560
The kids came to this world

87
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,400
He's here to enjoy life.

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,960
right?

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
instead of completing

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,760
one by one.

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Mr. Wang.

92
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,160
I don't know if you noticed

93
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,690
I just...

94
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
when I announced the good news,

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
their smiles

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,120
their smiles

97
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,760
from the heart.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,780
From the inside

99
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,960
from the inside.

100
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,720
He can't fake it, Mr. Wang.

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,080
Mr. Wang.

102
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Kids,

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
After entering the society,

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,840
more people will exploit their happiness.

105
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
I beg you.

106
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,800
In this limited campus life,

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
give them more happiness.

108
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Okay?

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Mr. Chang.

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
How dare you!

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,760
Who agreed

112
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,440
to let Qingyang High School play in our school?

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,320
Principal.

114
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,960
Here's the thing.

115
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,920
That's what I think.

116
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,520
I just want you to see

117
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,560
the strength of

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,840
Table Tennis Club

119
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,000
can participate in the competition.

120
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,760
What ability?

121
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,159
You want me to shave 11 to 0?

122
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,840
We don't participate in the competition because we don't want to be embarrassed.

123
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,520
Look at you.

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,600
You let him beat you up at home.

125
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,400
Principal.

126
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,880
Just trust me this once.

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,760
OK?

128
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,360
I'll make you proud.

129
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,400
I think it's the present.

130
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,840
Qingyang High School

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,560
[of Qingyang High School]

132
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,240
the champion of the High School Table Tennis League.

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,480
How can we compete with him?

134
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,120
That's not right.

135
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,880
Principal,

136
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,840
You're the only one who can do it. You're the only one who can do it.

137
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,320
The American swimming team

138
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
for over 40 years.

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,000
for over 40 years.

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,600
At the Paris Olympics,

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
in Paris Olympics.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,920
We have to look up to our own children.

143
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
If we look down on our own children,

144
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,120
how can we train

145
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
self-improvement.

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,159
Be independent.

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,800
and confident?

148
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
You're ruining her growth.

149
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Mr. Chang.

150
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,880
Don't button my hat.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,640
No.

152
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,440
Hello? Hello?

153
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,840
Hello. Hello.

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,880
Come in.

155
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
Principal.

156
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
This is the report

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,090
this month's research report.

158
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
Mr. Wang.

159
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,540
You came at the right time.

160
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Mr. Chang.

161
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm not the only one

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,000
is not up to me alone.

163
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,720
The students of the Table Tennis Club

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,640
are from Mr. Wang's class, right?

165
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Ask Mr. Wang.

166
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,480
If Mr. Wang agrees,

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,720
I'll agree.

168
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
I agree.

169
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you hear me?

170
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm not the only one who agrees.

171
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,200
Mr. Wang also agrees.

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Mr. Wang.

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,520
Did you not hear what I said just now?

174
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,800
I'm asking

175
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,520
Principal.

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
They won't give up

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
they won't give up.

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,360
We have to let them hit the south wall.

179
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,520
Maybe they'll turn back.

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,159
Fine.

181
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,560
Do you have to fight?

182
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,840
Good.

183
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,380
Tomorrow is Saturday.

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,700
Students are on holidays.

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,520
We won't lose too much face.

186
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,020
Thank you, principal.

187
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,240
OK.

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,640
We're leaving.

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,160
Mr. Wang.

191
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,920
Mr. Wang.

192
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Thank you so much.

193
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,560
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

194
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,080
Thank you for your help, Mr. Wang.

195
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,880
Don't worry.

196
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,200
This time,

197
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,320
our Table Tennis Club

198
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,120
will never disgrace the school.

199
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,400
I don't care if you're embarrassed or not.

200
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,040
Mr. Chang.

201
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,680
Promise me one thing.

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,200
What?

203
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,060
If we lose to Qingyang High School this time,

204
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640
then from now on,

205
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,770
don't mention the competition again.

206
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
We're even now.

207
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,560
Does it count as winning?

208
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,600
If we draw,

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Kind of.

210
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,360
Great. Thank you, Mr. Wang.

211
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,080
Thank you.

212
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,520
If we win this time,

213
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,600
Mr. Wang, please persuade the principal with us.

214
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,200
OK?

215
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,320
Let's talk about it. Okay.

216
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
Great!

217
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,340
I didn't expect

218
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
you're a good person.

219
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,320
That's not what I meant.

220
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,280
Mr. Chang.

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Can you let go of your hand now?

222
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,720
Sorry.

223
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,240
Mr. Wang.

224
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,040
Mr. Chang.

225
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,770
I'll take up your PE class this afternoon.

226
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm going to get sick again.

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,400
Can't I?

228
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,880
No problem.

229
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Whatever you say.

230
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,690
I'm born.

231
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,760
I have a baby.

232
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
I'll give birth to it.

233
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,840
Bye.

234
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,900
Goodbye, Mr. Wang.

235
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,160
You let me beat Luo Qing

236
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,120
because you want me to improve.

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,040
Right?

238
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
Indeed.

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
During this period of time,

240
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,000
I've improved a lot

241
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,320
with Luo Qing.

242
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,840
Plus, I learned Xin Meitong’s playing style.

243
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,360
I've improved again.

244
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
Thank you.

245
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,520
You're welcome.

246
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,920
You're the best.

247
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Really?

248
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,440
Then...

249
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,960
will you come

250
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
Will you come?

251
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,440
That ship has been sinking for a long time.

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
I heard

253
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
it was left here in 2022.

254
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,250
It's been waiting for someone to catch it.

255
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,160
It must have been forgotten for a long time.

256
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,080
No way.

257
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Its home

258
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,960
is just loving it from afar.

259
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,280
You too.

260
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,800
Your mom

261
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
went far away.

262
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,720
There.

263
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,320
she will still love you.

264
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,800
Continue.

265
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,920
watching you play.

266
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
Except not being with you,

267
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,810
everything is the same.

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
How did you know?

269
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm Xia Fan Xing.

270
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,440
I know everything.

271
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,860
You seem to be controlling me.

272
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,040
I'm trying to control you.

273
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm...

274
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.

275
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,160
Yeah

276
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
Come on

277
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
It's okay. It's okay.

278
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,720
Do you know

279
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
why I like ping-pong?

280
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,960
Why?

281
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,280
Look.

282
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Look.

283
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
Does it look like a sun?

284
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,480
Sun

285
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,560
represents hope.

286
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
Hope

287
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,240
is in our hands.

288
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,760
Luo Qing.

289
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,400
Do you know

290
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,320
what GXN means?

291
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,970
Did you offend someone?

292
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,520
I didn't offend anyone.

293
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,480
GXN asked you to clean up.

294
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,260
You must have offended someone else.

295
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Are you crazy?

296
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,880
No.

297
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,890
Why are you wearing the same pajamas as me?

298
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,320
Your dad bought it for me.

299
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,240
He told me to buy one and get one free.

300
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
I didn't expect

301
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,520
your dad is a gangster too.

302
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
Chop him.

303
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,840
It's a promotion.

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,040
It means the merchants will sell it to you at a cheap price.

305
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,120
It's not true.

306
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Kill him.

307
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
It doesn't make sense.

308
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,120
You chopped him.

309
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,650
How dare he take your money?

310
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
Let's not talk about this.

311
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,960
We have a generation gap.

312
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
I care about you.

313
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,920
Ziyi.

314
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Shengyang.

315
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,720
Do you want to go tomorrow?

316
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,880
What's wrong?

317
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
You said you don't want to play anymore.

318
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,370
But I heard that Jeong Aeng Du is very good.

319
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,120
How about

320
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,840
let me fight him tomorrow.

321
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
His name is Jung Young-jeong.

322
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,080
Tomorrow's game is to restore the principal's confidence

323
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
so that we can participate in the competition.

324
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,840
We should be the ones to fight.

325
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,770
The students of Xinde should do it.

326
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,920
You're not a student of Xinde.

327
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
Where are you going?

328
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,480
Oh.

329
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,960
Of course I know.

330
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,320
I bought you milk tea.

331
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,120
The lollipop is good.

332
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,000
Thanks.

333
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,400
What's wrong?

334
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,680
I don't know.

335
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Shengyang.

336
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
You seem

337
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Lactic sugar is impatient.

338
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
Tomorrow,

339
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let me teach him a lesson.

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,040
Long time no see.

341
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,760
Old classmate.

342
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,600
Thank you.

343
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
Thank you for agreeing

344
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,960
to play a friendly game with us.

345
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,920
I think

346
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,240
let's not waste time

347
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,120
Let's play.

348
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,760
Just one round.

349
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,960
It's our responsibility

350
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,200
is also our responsibility.

351
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,120
Look at you students.

352
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,420
How is your mental endurance?

353
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,720
Don't cry when you lose.

354
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,560
What?

355
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,920
I won't cry.

356
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,040
That’s good.

357
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,650
Where is Shengyang?

358
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
Shengyang will arrive soon.

359
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,420
How about this?

360
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,720
Let's play a female singles first.

361
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,800
Sure.

362
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,880
Let's

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,730
go straight.

364
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,760
Go.

365
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,700
Let's go, kids.

366
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
Look at you imitating me.

367
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,360
Not bad.

368
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes.

369
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,840
I've learned a lot from you.

370
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,640
Thank you.

371
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
No matter how similar

372
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,400
is fake.

373
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,840
Have you heard the story of Son Goku and Six-Eared Macao Monkey?

374
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Yes.

375
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,520
The Six-Eared Macago Monkey

376
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
he died miserably.

377
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,560
How did you know?

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,800
The one who retrieved the sutra in the west

379
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,440
is not the Six-Eared Macao Monkey.

380
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,680
Meitong, stop talking to her.

381
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
Let’s start.

382
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,880
Okay.

383
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,320
I'll shave

384
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,280
shave her head.

385
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,720
Sure.

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,460
I'm looking forward to it.

387
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,320
Guess the serve.

388
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,240
The character is you.

389
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
The flower is you.

390
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,400
Flower.

391
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Serve!

392
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,640
Luo Qing.

393
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,940
Why isn’t Shengyang here yet?

394
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,440
He pooped all night last night.

395
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
I don't think he's up yet.

396
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,040
What?

397
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,280
But I really want to play with her.

398
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,680
Does it look like the sun?

399
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
Sun

400
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,920
means hope.

401
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,320
Hope

402
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,440
is in our hands.

403
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,560
Luo Qing.

404
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,360
Come on.

405
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,760
Fight with me.

406
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,520
Three to one.

407
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,760
No.

408
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
You can't hit her like this.

409
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
She seems to be walking the stars.

410
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Yes, because she knows

411
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
Star's weakness is her knees.

412
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,040
That's why she keeps pulling and fighting.

413
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,680
This is so bad.

414
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,520
There's nothing bad about it.

415
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,600
ping-pong

416
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,200
is moving

417
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,520
while playing Go.

418
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,080
and test your brain and physical strength.

419
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,000
That's it.

420
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,160
Time out.

421
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Time out.

422
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,440
Four to one.

423
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,850
I request a time out.

424
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,040
Hurry up.

425
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,200
Have a seat.

426
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,960
It's okay.

427
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,160
Well done.

428
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,000
Her knees are her weakness.

429
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,530
You hit her like this later.

430
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,520
Hurry up.

431
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
Take care of her in five minutes.

432
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
No need.

433
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,170
I'll finish her in two minutes.

434
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,160
You can't play with her now.

435
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,680
Like this.

436
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,780
Let's go. Let's go.

437
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
What else?

438
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
Let's stop fighting.

439
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,360
Because this

440
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,320
affect your injury too much.

441
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,640
I'm fine.

442
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
I can hold on.

443
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,840
I just called Shengyang.

444
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,440
but he didn’t answer.

445
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,160
Tangtang.

446
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,760
Don't worry.

447
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
He'll come.

448
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,160
Have you had enough rest?

449
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,080
Let's start.

450
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,320
What's the rush?

451
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,020
Do as Luo Qing said.

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,480
Steady.

453
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,120
Relax. Steady.

454
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,320
Watch your knees.

455
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,200
Shengyang, come here.

456
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,040
Xin Meitong played with the stars on purpose.

457
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,720
Did he hurt his leg?

458
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,400
Tangtang

459
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,140
Send me some live videos of the competition.

460
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,600
Nine to two.

461
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,360
I don't think you can do it.

462
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,260
If you can't, just give up.

463
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,480
You're the one who lost.

464
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,280
Aren't you going to shave my head?

465
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,160
I won two balls.

466
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
From now on,

467
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
if I let you win another ball,

468
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,800
I'll call you sister.

469
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,720
Okay.

470
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
You said that.

471
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Here.

472
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,440
Meitong.

473
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,400
Don’t be angry.

474
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,930
Don't mess up the strategy.

475
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,980
Fight with her.

476
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,160
No tactics.

477
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,050
This ball...

478
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,880
I won't let you score.

479
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
Around!

480
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,540
I'm so familiar with this.

481
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
Defense loop.

482
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,320
Awesome.

483
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,250
What's going on?

484
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,760
Ding's leg.

485
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,960
How did she catch the loop so smoothly?

486
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,600
The one wearing cosmetic contact lenses definitely didn't expect it.

487
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,160
Starry has been practicing for a month.

488
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,520
The loop I played

489
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,600
The stars are fighting back.

490
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
Let me do a live stream.

491
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,560
What is this?

492
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,800
Let me see.

493
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,360
Little girl.

494
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,920
Call me sister.

495
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,800
You just won a ball.

496
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,720
You're so proud.

497
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,120
Old classmate.

498
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,200
You seem to have forgotten

499
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,240
about the scores.

500
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,640
Nine to three.

501
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,600
If you dare,

502
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,480
you can win another ball.

503
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
What's the score?

504
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,840
What's the score?

505
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,680
Ten to three.

506
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
Pass.

507
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,480
Just like this.

508
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,880
What did you hit?

509
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
It stinks.

510
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,200
You're embarrassing yourself again.

511
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm speechless.

512
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,160
How embarrassing.

513
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,920
Turn off the live stream.

514
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Don't embarrass our school.

515
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,520
The prettiest boy in Weihai

516
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,120
Milk tea withdrawal player. Are you hungry?

517
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm so embarrassed.

518
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,000
I shouldn't have expected that.

519
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,800
[Master: It's embarrassing]

520
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,600
[Master: How embarrassing!]

521
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,440
Wang Mei Ru: What's embarrassing? It's only embarrassing if you don't dare to accept the challenge.

522
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,900
[Electronic squid: Turn it off.] Don't embarrass our school.

523
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,760
Tangtang, tell Star to pick up the phone.

524
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,560
Sir.

525
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,420
Shengyang wants to talk to the stars.

526
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,360
Look at this. Look at this.

527
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,600
Why is it pause again?

528
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,280
Old classmate.

529
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,000
Pause.

530
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,560
Hurry up.

531
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
Make sure you hit it.

532
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,480
Star.

533
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,900
I just watched the video of your game.

534
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,520
She must have studied you.

535
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,400
She knew your leg was injured.

536
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,660
So I'm mobilizing you.

537
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
Next, you have to make short shots.

538
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,980
to limit her serve attack.

539
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,600
Okay.

540
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay.

541
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,720
You'll come to the competition, right?

542
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
I will.

543
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,530
I'll be right there.

544
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
I'll wait for you.

545
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,160
We are waiting for you.

546
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,930
are waiting for you.

547
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,280
Come on.

548
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,960
Calm down.

549
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,600
Three, two, one.

550
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Are you here to act?

551
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
I really want to know.

552
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,840
whether your school

553
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,200
love acting so much?

554
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,800
Who is this?

555
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,960
He is so arrogant.

556
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Are you scolding us too?

557
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,920
Six: What level is this girl? How dare you compete with Tong?

558
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,440
The prettiest girl in Qingyang: Tong, hit her hard.

559
00:27:59,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I can’t stand it.

560
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,920
Green, green, shave her head.

561
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,120
Who is this? He's so bad.

562
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:01,920
This is too arrogant.

563
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,380
Carbohydrated shrimp

564
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,120
White tea and wind

565
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,680
[Shindeok High School is indeed a weak school.]

566
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,120
You are bald.

567
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I'll eat you all.

568
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,320
Big Yao: You're bald.

569
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
function: She is a joke.

570
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,240
Coconut coconut coconut coconut Tong Tong is the best in the world.

571
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,160
He's so handsome. He's being chased.

572
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm so embarrassed.

573
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,020
Wang Mei Ru: Star, come on!

574
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,120
Wang Mei Ru: Star, come on!

575
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,580
Wang Mei Ru: Star, come on!

576
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,180
Wang Mei Ru: Star, come on!

577
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,720
Meitong.

578
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,560
They are broadcasting.

579
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,560

581
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,320

586
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,740

596
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
