1
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
Move! Move! Move!

2
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,320
Bad news!

3
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
Chuyu is in trouble.

4
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,160
She was suspended

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,520
because of violation of the student union system.

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,280
Look. It's a new product. It's a new product. It's a new product.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
Try my new product.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,250
I was fired from the student union.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
That's great.

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,120
How could you say that?

11
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,320
Xia Fan Xing.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,240
Are you here to laugh at me?

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,440
Am I wrong?

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,520
Lin Chuyu.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,400
Didn't you notice

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,479
you've changed since you joined the student council.

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,210
Especially after you became the vice president.

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,200
You're so official.

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
Have you forgotten

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
you joined the broadcasting station

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,160
enter the radio station

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,160
and the student union?

23
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,760
Qingsong is still

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
White snow floats

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
Let youth be with us

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,000
Let our beautiful wishes fly with the snow

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,200
in every corner

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
In the world

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
Never disappear

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
Have you noticed

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,120
things on radio are so boring?

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,460
Is there a radio in our school?

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,079
No one noticed what the radio said.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Isn't that how the radio station works?

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,160
The radio station serves the students.

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,840
Of course we should play something to serve the students.

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
For example?

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,600
Like this.

39
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,880
when they have lunch,

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,880
they can play something related to food.

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
Chinese on the tip of tongue.

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,560
can not only increase their appetite,

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,020
but also let them know Chinese food culture.

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
For example,

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,079
we can play some jokes before the monthly exam

46
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,480
so they don't need to be too nervous.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
It's okay to laugh

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,160
When they are lost,

49
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,560
bring them hope.

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Share their joy when they are happy.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Give them questions when they're confused.

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,640
Anyway,

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,240
A radio to serve the students

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
is a good campus radio.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,280
Wow.

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,200
Chuyu.

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
If that's the case,

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,560
everyone loves listening to the radio.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,680
That's right.

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Chuyu.

61
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,090
Go to the radio station.

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,360
Can I?

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
Of course you can.

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,120
Then our ears will be blessed.

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,480
Gosh.

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Please.

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,160
Have you ever

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,530
ever since you entered the radio station?

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,040
From that...

70
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,280
from

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
I became the director of the radio station

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
and became the vice president of the student council.

73
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,240
Have you forgotten

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,040
the original intention to serve the students?

75
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
Or

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,040
you want to serve your classmates?

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,480
are just your slogans.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,730
And you never thought that way.

79
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,300
I want to broadcast for the students.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,240
But after I entered the radio station,

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
I realized

82
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,000
broadcasting

83
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,560
It's not up to me.

84
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
Sir.

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,120
The seniors and seniors in grade 12 are going to take the exam.

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
I wrote a lot of things to ease their anxiety.

87
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Look.

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,320
Play this.

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,340
Let's do something generous.

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Leader.

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,280
These slogans usually shout

92
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
There's no need to shout at this time

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,880
I think it's most important

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
is the most important.

95
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
And...

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,880
This slogan looks familiar.

97
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,740
I've heard this in the middle school entrance exam.

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,880
Aren't you trying to perfunctory the students?

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
Lin Chuyu.

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,280
Are you the chief or me?

101
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
If you are so capable,

102
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,720
you can be the president of the student council.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,440
When you become the president,

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll be in your charge.

105
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,520
Now,

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
you're under my control.

107
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,890
Do it according to this script.

108
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,260
Breaking news.

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,480
Dear students,

110
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,640
This is the campus radio station.

111
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,880
[The countdown of the college entrance exam has been ringing.]

112
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,040
At the crucial moment of your life,

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,520
please allow me

114
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,120
to light the torch in your heart.

115
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Later,

116
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,680
I just wanted to go up.

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
Go, go, go.

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,080
I forgot why I set off.

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
Chuyu.

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,520
Do you still want to serve the students?

121
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
So what?

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,780
There's no chance.

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,620
I've been waiting for you to say that.

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Not only the student council

125
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
to serve the students.

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
What do you think?

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,280
Stop acting cool.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
Chuyu is coming.

129
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,120
Okay.

130
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Hurry up.

131
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,640
Don't open your eyes.

132
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,800
Here, Chuyu.

133
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,320
This is the radio station belongs to Chuyu.

134
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,680
This is a surprise we specially prepared for you.

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,610
Let’s play what you want to do here.

136
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,680
Liu Manxin.

137
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Do you want to try it again?

138
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,040
Nonsense.

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,240
Let's go. Let's go.

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,920
Please.

141
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,280
Chuyu.

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Chuyu.

143
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
The monthly exam is in two days.

144
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Here.

145
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
Just do what you want.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
But I really don't want to.

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,240
Chuyu.

148
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,600
You should see the gift we gave you before you leave.

149
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,240
Hurry up.

150
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,240
I was too naive.

151
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,890
I really don't want to broadcast anymore.

152
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
Open it first.

153
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,340
before you decide whether you'll continue to be naive.

154
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,280
Who are you?

155
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Hello.

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,880
We're good friends of the new broadcaster, Lin Chuyu.

157
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,520
She is very simple.

158
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
Please take care of her.

159
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
Thank you.

160
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,920
Please take care of him.

161
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,720
Okay.

162
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
Thank you.

163
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,200
Okay.

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,860
I'll take out the trash first.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Excuse me.

166
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
You can call us

167
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,640
you can call us.

168
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,970
We'll be there anytime.

169
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
I'll leave this to you.

170
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,800
Please take care of Lin Chuyu.

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Okay.

172
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Tangtang

173
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
I think so.

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,440
Chuyu.

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
You are not naive alone.

176
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
All of us

177
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,880
will be with you

178
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,600
and be naive forever.

179
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
If you don't do it,

180
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,960
Let's pack up.

181
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,960
Luo Qing.

182
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,000
Pack your things.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,760
Get to work

184
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,840
Hey.

185
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
I'm not your little brother.

186
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,160
I'll take it then.

187
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,690
I won't do it. I'll do it.

188
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,400
Do it.

189
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,440
Don't be nervous, Chuyu.

190
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm not nervous.

191
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,880
Can you turn on my face?

192
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Open it.

193
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,760
I told you to adjust it.

194
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,480
Didn't you turn on the beauty makeup?

195
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,360
Why not?

196
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Beauty...

197
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,480
Beauty.

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,480
Skinny face.

199
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,680
Like this.

200
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,040
This looks good.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
This is too much.

202
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,600
All right.

203
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,760
A narrow face.

204
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,560
What is this?

205
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,720
Yoo Manxin.

206
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,720
That’s too much.

207
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,560
All right.

208
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Skinny face.

209
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,040
Is this okay?

210
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay?

211
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,080
Action.

212
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,040
OK. Start.

213
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
Chuyu, come on.

214
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,720
I'm broadcasting.

215
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
Everyone.

216
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,600
Hello.

217
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,520
Hello.

218
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm Radio Lin.

219
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,160
Soon,

220
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,020
we will have the monthly exam.

221
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
To relieve your stress,

222
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,600
I want to tell you a joke.

223
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,000
One day,

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
The underwater world just finished the exam.

225
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,560
Crabs got caught

226
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,400
because of cheating.

227
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,660
The lobster teacher asked

228
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
Whose questions did you copy?

229
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,520
Crab.

230
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,160
I copied clams.

231
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Lobster said

232
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
It's a piece of cake. It's a piece of cake.

233
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
Who did you copy?

234
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,000
The crabs are wronged.

235
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,480
I copied clams.

236
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,120
I copied clams.

237
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
What do you mean?

238
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,380
I'm not talking about you.

239
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,200
You are...

240
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,560
laugh at me?

241
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,520
No.

242
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Great.

243
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Great

244
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,960
The teacher always says

245
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,640
exam

246
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,010
It's a battlefield.

247
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,260
If it's really a battlefield,

248
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,760
you are soldiers.

249
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,420
No matter what happens in the end,

250
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,360
as long as you go to the battlefield bravely,

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
You are all great.

252
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,760
Great.

253
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,080
Great.

254
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,200
Chuyu is the best.

255
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,140
When are you going to play with me?

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,820
I don't want to be a freeloader at your house.

257
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,760
You can eat whatever you want.

258
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,460
What are you doing?

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,480
I came to your house to play basketball with you.

260
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Since you don't want to play with me,

261
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,940
I'll force you to fight me.

262
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,000
What?

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,800
Hit me!

264
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Give me the beat.

265
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,490
Give it to me.

266
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,280
Come on.

267
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
How dare you hit me?

268
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,880
Hit me!

269
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,960
Hit me.

270
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,280
The ball!

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,920
Give it to me.

272
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,040
No.

273
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,120
Hit me.

274
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,440
Come on.

275
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,920
Hit me!

276
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,480
Stop!

277
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,280
Come on.

278
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
Next week's school anniversary.

279
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,890
Zhao Youlin.

280
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,640
Cheng Yao.

281
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,360
You signed up for the dance group, right?

282
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,120
Yes.

283
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,250
We're a team dancer.

284
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,050
Is there anyone in our class who wants to sign up for the show?

285
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,810
Xia Fan Xing.

286
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,900
Do you want to sign up for the show?

287
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,920
Mr Zhou Chuan.

288
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,480
The ping-pong game is about to start.

289
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,320
I must spend all my time on training.

290
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,280
I didn't participate last year.

291
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll be in grade 12 next year.

292
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,080
There won't be much time left.

293
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,280
Sir,

294
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,880
can you tell the school leaders

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to delay the school anniversary?

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
When I finish the ping-pong tournament,

297
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,400
In that case,

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,040
I can sign up for a show too.

299
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,960
Xia Fan Xing.

300
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you kidding me?

301
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm just asking.

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,840
What if something happens?

303
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,280
There's no "what if".

304
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,010
Xia Fan Xing.

305
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,000
Just be an audience.

306
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,680
Even if you attend the school anniversary,

307
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,480
This document

308
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,040
is the record of

309
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,000
This competition segment...

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
President, take a look.

311
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,720
Here's the thing.

312
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,560
We only have less than two months to prepare for the game.

313
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,850
Not only do we need to prepare singles,

314
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,120
but also doubles.

315
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,720
because they never cooperated.

316
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,760
Mr. Chang.

317
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
Shengyang and Stars will be fine.

318
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,080
There must be no problem in singles.

319
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,840
They can be each other's training partners.

320
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,360
But now it's mixed doubles.

321
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
We need at least two people to be their training partners.

322
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
The two of us.

323
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,580
I can do it with Liu Manxin.

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
You two.

325
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,250
don't seem to understand the teacher.

326
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,160
I mean training partner.

327
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
The training partner must be equal.

328
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,440
We're at the same level.

329
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,920
or you'll become a bad player.

330
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Did you play Go?

331
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,120
I...

332
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,160
I got it.

333
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
You mean she’s not good at cooking.

334
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,160
I’m not the only one.

335
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Who else?

336
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,260
Don't look at the teacher.

337
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,640
Are you talking about me?

338
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
Star.

339
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,640
Be honest.

340
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,760
Am I bad?

341
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
Stars

342
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,480
Stars, you are...

343
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,560
Why are you spacing out?

344
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
Starry can't attend the school anniversary.

345
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,560
It's a pity.

346
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
It's the school anniversary.

347
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,840
There will be more next year.

348
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,280
Right?

349
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,800
It's 12th grade next year.

350
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't participate.

351
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,520
Stars.

352
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
Why don't we just sign up for a show?

353
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,920
It doesn't matter actually.

354
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,520
No way.

355
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,460
How can you be distracted by this?

356
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,319
You must do your best in training.

357
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,920
Otherwise, how can you live up to your expectations?

358
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,440
Right?

359
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,480
That's great.

360
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm really happy

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
to think that way.

362
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,880
Like this.

363
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,079
After lunch,

364
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,800
You two

365
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
continue to get along.

366
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,980
Get along with each other.

367
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
Let's go eat.

368
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,840
In the position of doubles,

369
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,360
they usually use one left and one right position

370
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,680
to adapt to different

371
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,610
tactical needs.

372
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
I don't want to play doubles.

373
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,690
I want to play singles with Shengyang.

374
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,840
We’ll fight after the game.

375
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
You want to flirt with me again?

376
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,360
How about this?

377
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,920
Luo Qing,

378
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,120
If you need anything,

379
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,850
just tell me.

380
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,560
Okay?

381
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
A free training partner.

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,880
One day.

383
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,320
One hundred.

384
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,840
Don't look at me.

385
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,000
I spent a lot of money buying food for you.

386
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
I have no money.

387
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,880
Stop it, kids.

388
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,360
This is my salary.

389
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,840
I'm not married yet.

390
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,280
Sir.

391
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,360
That's great.

392
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,320
Mr. Wang is not married.

393
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,840
Just marry Mr. Wang.

394
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,480
Mr. Wang?

395
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,560
Mr. Wang is really good.

396
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,360
Mr. Chang, you have good taste.

397
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,720
Mr. Chang.

398
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,760
We'll help you chase Mr. Wang.

399
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,330
You paid Luo Qing to be your training partner.

400
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,520
When did I say I like Mr. Wang?

401
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,320
Forget it if you don't want to.

402
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,960
I mean...

403
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,560
Forget it if you don't want to.

404
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,520
I didn't say I don't want to.

405
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,960
right?

406
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
I think

407
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
100 yuan is too expensive.

408
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,520
Luo Qing,

409
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
I'll give you a price.

410
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,480
50.

411
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,560
Deal.

412
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,280
I applied too much.

413
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,120
I originally wanted 40.

414
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,400
I know you're good at bargaining.

415
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
So I'll pay 100 yuan a day.

416
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
How could you...

417
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
Mr. Chang.

418
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,320
You can't go back on your promise.

419
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,320
Okay.

420
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,080
50 is fine.

421
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
Remember,

422
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
It's for our Table Tennis Club.

423
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm not doing this for Mr. Wang.

424
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,720
Don't get me wrong.

425
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,240
Oh.

426
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,200
In that case,

427
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,600
we don’t need to match.

428
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,120
Yeah.

429
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,760
That'll save us trouble.

430
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,600
How dare you!

431
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
How dare you!

432
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,160
If you don't train hard,

433
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,000
the teacher will take back the 50 yuan.

434
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean

435
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
after lunch.

436
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,960
That guy

437
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,240
Well,

438
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,160
Mr. Chang, we understand.

439
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,520
Don't worry.

440
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,680
Leave it to us.

441
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,760
Mr. Chang.

442
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,240
Good boy.

443
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,700
Come on.

444
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,810
Start training.

445
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,280
By the way,

446
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,880
Luo Qing.

447
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,480
What about you?

448
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,740
team up with Tangtang.

449
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,080
Come on.

450
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,340
Let me take a video.

451
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,620
for your research.

452
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Move over.

453
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
Why?

454
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,040
Women, you're in my way.

455
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Tangtang

456
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,040
Give him a break.

457
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,040
I'll give Starry some face.

458
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,880
What?

459
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,480
Go on.

460
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,280
Here.

461
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm sorry.

462
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,880
How did you...

463
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,680
Go on.

464
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,200
Come on.

465
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,400
Who sent it?

466
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,600
Me or you?

467
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Go ahead.

468
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,160
Nice shot!

469
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,040
Take it.

470
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,400
Pick up.

471
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,880
All wrong.

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Not right.

473
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,560
Comrades.

474
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,480
Something is wrong.

475
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,560
Go on.

476
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,940
It's time for sugar to pick up.

477
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
What are you doing?

478
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,440
Okay.

479
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,000
Go on.

480
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,760
Serve!

481
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,160
Cut.

482
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
What are you doing?

483
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,880
What are you doing?

484
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,980
How about this?

485
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,880
I

486
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,560
study my tactics.

487
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,660
What about you?

488
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,640
Go back and cultivate your tacit understanding.

489
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,680
OK?

490
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,880
We need to cultivate him too

491
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,120
Tangtang.

492
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,760
You two are their training partners.

493
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,420
How can they improve if you don't make progress?

494
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,020
How about this?

495
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,680
The lunch break is almost over.

496
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,320
The class is about to start.

497
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,520
Go back to class.

498
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,720
We'll talk about the rest later.

499
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,280
Okay?

500
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,920
Well...

501
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,160
Sir.

502
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
Don't worry.

503
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
Mr. Chang.

504
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,680
I'll finish it for you.

505
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,680
Mr. Chang.

506
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,920
You can count on Liu Manxin.

507
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
Go back to class.

508
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
Tacit understanding.

509
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,880
Tacit understanding.

510
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,480
Okay.

511
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,360
Think about it.

512
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Okay.

513
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,200
You want to cultivate tacit understanding?

514
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,360
If I cultivate a cactus, it will die.

515
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
How can we work together?

516
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
It's hard.

517
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,600
I got it.

518
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,360
Looking for Chuyu.

519
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Just come to me.

520
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,720
When I was in the student council,

521
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,650
I often took them to team building.

522
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,400
But do you want to play basketball

523
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,600
is a little different from the student council.

524
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,530
After all, we need to be practical.

525
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,680
So,

526
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,400
your training

527
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
may be very painful.

528
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Chuyu.

529
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,040
Is it some hell training?

530
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,480
Don't worry.

531
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
It's not hell.

532
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,120
That's good.

533
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,520
It's hell.

534
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,980
What are you afraid of?

535
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,840
We have the spirit of

536
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,040
never give up.

537
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,680
That's not enough.

538
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,320
You have to swear.

539
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
What oath?

540
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,000
A tacit training.

541
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
Is it so troublesome?

542
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Troublesome.

543
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
You have to swear to get married.

544
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,120
You'll have tacit training next.

545
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,760
What if you don't make up your mind?

546
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
It's easy to give up halfway.

547
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes.

548
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Chuyu is right.

549
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,800
She trained hard for you.

550
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,280
You stopped practicing halfway.

551
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,600
It’s all for nothing.

552
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,020
Chuyu, tell me.

553
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,920
What do you want us to do?

554
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
We'll do it.

555
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,760
Manxin.

556
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,320
The vow is here.

557
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,360
Read it.

558
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,920
Is this really not marriage?

559
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,320
It's a faith for you.

560
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,640
Yeah.

561
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,400
Do you understand?

562
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,860
Show your determination.

563
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
Come on.

564
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
Get up.

565
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,360
From now on,

566
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,760
we're willing to be partners.

567
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Whether it's going well or bad,

568
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
Whether you go to school or after school

569
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,800
Eat or go to the bathroom.

570
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,360
we

571
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,400
together

572
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,880
together.

573
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,160
I announce

574
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,600
the hell-like tacit training

575
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,080
Let's begin.
