1
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,810
What does this mean?

2
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,440
Our school

3
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,240
this year

4
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,880
won't participate in the middle school table tennis tournament.

5
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,560
What?

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
What do you mean?

7
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,960
Mr. Chang.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
We participate every year

9
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,130
and finish last every time.

10
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,600
It's too embarrassing.

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,880
The school

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,450
cares about college admission rates.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
These meaningless activities serve no purpose.

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
Our school this year

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,440
will not participate in the middle school table tennis tournament.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,100
Principal,

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
how is this meaningless?

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,720
Isn't this about our school's honor?

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,640
Honor?

20
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,100
Where is the honor?

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,479
Come on, show me this honor.

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,850
If you had ever achieved any honor,

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,490
would I be withdrawing?

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,320
Principal,

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
the true spirit of sports

26
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,440
is never giving up

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
and never surrendering.

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,320
We've come this far.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
We can't just

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
raise the white flag so easily.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
How can we

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,720
teach children the right values this way?

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,440
Principal, let me report to you.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
Xia Fanxing

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,520
takes this competition very seriously.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,640
She's working extremely hard for it.

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,040
Although

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,920
last year

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,960
she injured her knee,

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,120
she has recovered very well this year.

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,480
With Shengyang joining the team,

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,240
our winning chances are rapidly increasing.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,200
We're about to achieve results.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,160
We can't do this.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,820
Principal.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
We've never achieved

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
any results in sports competitions.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,520
Do you know how others see us?

49
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,640
What they say about us?

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,900
They call us the physically weak school.

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Let them say whatever they want.

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
Our school's sports program

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
has always been weak.

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
Besides,

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,360
if you're so determined,

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
our table tennis club has existed for over ten years.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
If you had achieved results even once,

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,440
I wouldn't be making this decision.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,100
Principal,

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,120
not achieving good results in the past

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
doesn't mean we can't achieve them now,

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,600
or in the future.

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Right?

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,160
Let me give you an example.

65
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,960
Our country had nothing before.

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,920
No atomic bombs,

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,840
no aircraft carriers,

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
but we built them, didn't we?

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,880
And recently,

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
Chinese box office

71
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
had never made it into

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,600
the world rankings.

73
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,280
Right?

74
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,800
Look at Ne Zha 2 now,

75
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,480
it shot right up there.

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
I control my own destiny.

77
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Principal,

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,640
dear Principal.

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,240
Calling me 'dear' won't help.

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,560
The school leadership team

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
has already discussed this matter.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
This issue

83
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,079
has been decided.

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,079
Principal,

85
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm begging you.

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,880
Don't pull this stunt.

87
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
Principal, take some oxygen if you're not feeling well.

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,000
I think you're a bit

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,920
confused right now.

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,960
Think clearly about this.

91
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,360
Principal.

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,620
Don't try that with me.

93
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,960
What right does he have to stop us from participating?

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,080
Because he's the principal.

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
Even the principal can't do that.

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,600
Think about it.

97
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,960
Our school never wins the ping pong championship.

98
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,680
Last year we finally had a chance.

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,610
But then Fanxing accidentally fell in the bathroom.

100
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,720
Sorry about-

101
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,010
It was definitely my fault.

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,840
If I hadn't injured my leg last year,

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
I might have placed well

104
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,840
and the principal wouldn't be disappointed in us.

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,440
Fanxing.

106
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,320
It has nothing to do with you.

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
If I could have coached a team

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,480
that won any ranking,

109
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,140
things wouldn't be like this.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,159
However,

111
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,840
now we

112
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
have Shengyang.

113
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,880
Hey!

114
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,840
Is this your chewing gum?

115
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,440
So uncivilized.

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,840
He doesn't seem very reliable, does he?

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,480
I think he should be fine.

118
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
He's capable, he's capable.

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
He's really good.

120
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
Look.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,280
This is a video of him competing before.

122
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,480
He's amazing.

123
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,340
His skills are excellent.

124
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,160
Don't look at that one.

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,960
Look at this.

126
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
It's time for me to make my appearance.

127
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
This is your highest honor.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Be grateful.

129
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,720
You're not even from our school.

130
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,659
How can you join the competition?

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,159
Well.

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm planning to

133
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
work with the school teachers

134
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,960
and join forces.

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
We'll submit a joint petition

136
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,360
asking the principal

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,960
to approve

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
our participation in the competition.

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,040
As long as we can compete,

140
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,440
we definitely

141
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,850
have a chance to win.

142
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,440
Right?

143
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,560
Everyone.

144
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Good work.

145
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
What's the special occasion?

146
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes.

147
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
Have some fruit.

148
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
This isn't like you at all.

149
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
Yes.

150
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Good morning, Director.

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
Please stop scolding me.

152
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,720
Mr. Li.

153
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,280
Mr. Chang.

154
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,080
Good morning.

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,080
Ms. Wang.

156
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,920
Um...

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Let me peel an orange for you.

158
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
These oranges are so sweet.

159
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Mr. Chang,

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,640
you never

161
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
buy fruit for everyone usually.

162
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,060
What's going on today?

163
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,730
Need something?

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,460
Nothing, nothing.

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,360
It's just that

166
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
I heard the principal made a decision.

167
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,200
He decided not to participate in

168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,159
the

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,080
middle school table tennis tournament.

170
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,610
Mr. Wang,

171
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,810
what do you think

172
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,600
about this matter?

173
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:00,960
Oh my!

174
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,960
Mr. Wang,

175
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,600
let me wipe that.

176
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Thank you.

177
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Excuse me.

179
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,640
It's fine.

180
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,440
I'll do it

181
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
myself.

182
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Where was I?

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,320
Oh right,

184
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,180
about the principal's decision.

185
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
I think

186
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,600
we faculty members should unite and issue a joint statement.

187
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,860
We shouldn't say that.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,520
The principal is right.

189
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Otherwise, our school would rank last every year.

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
The principal would lose face

191
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,620
and it wouldn't look good for the school.

192
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
This should have happened long ago.

193
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
I suggested to the principal last year

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,640
that we shouldn't participate anymore.

195
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,200
No,

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,400
you can't say that.

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,080
Right?

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,840
It's a competition.

199
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
There are wins and losses.

200
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,659
Having wins and losses is normal.

201
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,800
The key is

202
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,400
we've never won.

203
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,320
Not winning is our school's style.

204
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,000
No, no.

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
That's because Teacher Chang is afraid of winning

206
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,000
and hurting relationships.

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,600
No, no, no.

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
You can't say that.

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Excuse me,

210
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,380
Teacher Chang.

211
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,320
Teacher Wang.

212
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,760
Teacher Wang.

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,800
Teacher Wang,

214
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,690
please wait.

215
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,760
Teacher Wang.

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,680
You see,

217
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
the children

218
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,200
really look forward to this competition.

219
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,080
We can't crush their hopes,

220
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,520
right?

221
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,400
We should lift them up.

222
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,280
Sorry.

223
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,960
Well,

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
what I mean is,

225
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,400
wouldn't it be better to help them get closer to the sun?

226
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,120
Mr. Chang,

227
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
I'm just a Chinese teacher.

228
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,880
I can't influence the principal's decision.

229
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,840
No,

230
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm not asking you to talk to the principal.

231
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,960
What I mean is,

232
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
I made a poster, right?

233
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,600
I just want all of us teachers to sign it together.

234
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
Then let the principal know

235
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
that we're always the strongest support for our students.

236
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Mr. Chang,

237
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,039
I'm not against students

238
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,370
having interest clubs.

239
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,680
But if they could focus more on their studies

240
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,760
and improve their grades,

241
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,840
I would be happier.

242
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,650
After all, their primary task is to study.

243
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,040
By the way, Mr. Chang,

244
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,640
Mrs. Wang,

245
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll be taking over your PE class this afternoon.

246
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I'll tell the children you're sick.

247
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Am I sick again?

248
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,740
I'm sick every day.

249
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,320
Fanxing.

250
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Just trust Mr. Chang.

251
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,040
I don't know if Mr. Chang can do it.

252
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I think we should forget about it.

253
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,800
Table tennis has always been our school's weakness.

254
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,130
Let's not participate,

255
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
so we don't embarrass ourselves.

256
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
Embarrassment is nothing,

257
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,880
but I'm worried about wasting time.

258
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,160
It's not necessary.

259
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,780
Can you smell that?

260
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,320
Why is it so foul?

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,840
Can you shut your foul mouth?

262
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Am I foul?

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes,

264
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,920
absolutely disgusting.

265
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,000
You're saying I have a foul mouth?

266
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,160
Are you saying I have a foul mouth?

267
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,280
Who are you calling foul-mouthed?

268
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,640
So what if I said you have a foul mouth?

269
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,200
Zhao Youlin,

270
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,760
what business is it of yours whether we play or not?

271
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,880
That's ridiculous.

272
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm also a member of Xinde High School.

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,720
It's my business if you go out and embarrass yourselves.

274
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
If you're so capable, bring back a championship for me to see.

275
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,520
Sure.

276
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
Go tell the principal.

277
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,840
Tell them to let us compete again,

278
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,720
and I'll bring back a championship for you.

279
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Then call me dad,

280
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,450
and I'll talk to the principal.

281
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,040
Go ahead then.

282
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,300
You all heard that, right?

283
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,720
Good girl.

284
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
When Dad's in a better mood,

285
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,610
I'll talk to the principal.

286
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,000
Shengyang,

287
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,820
did you do that on purpose?

288
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
You stepped on my foot.

289
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,890
Apologize to me.

290
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,440
I stepped on you?

291
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,880
Apologize.

292
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,720
Fine.

293
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,760
You guys only know how to act tough in your own little circle.

294
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,800
Why don't you show that energy on the court?

295
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,760
Of course.

296
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,840
If I make it to the top three this year...

297
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,440
If you could make the top three, you would have already.

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,560
All talk and no action.

299
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,240
Still here?

300
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,680
Childish.

301
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,330
Why am I even talking to you?

302
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,210
Chengyao, let's go.

303
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Bunch of kids.

304
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Well done.

305
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,240
This time we must participate.

306
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,480
We're not just participating,

307
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,120
but also,

308
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,780
Shengyang,

309
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,480
Fanxing,

310
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
we must make it to the top eight.

311
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,760
We must fulfill

312
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,640
our Xinde Table Tennis Club's

313
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,810
decade-long dream.

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,020
That's not the key issue here.

315
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,920
Now the principal, teachers and students

316
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,320
have no confidence in us.

317
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,920
We just need to restore their confidence in us.

318
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,840
Easier said than done.

319
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,520
We don't even have the qualification to enter the competition.

320
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,650
How can we make everyone believe in us?

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,120
Just like Zhao Youlin said,

322
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,720
we should put our skills to good use.

323
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,560
What do you mean?

324
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,200
Who was the previous high school ping pong champion?

325
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,440
We just need to play a match against them.

326
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,160
But we don't even have the qualification to compete.

327
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,040
How can we play?

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
We can do it.

329
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,520
It's not just about official competitions.

330
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,380
We can have friendly matches too.

331
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,840
That's great!

332
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,840
That's wonderful, Fanxing.

333
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,920
A friendly match.

334
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,200
Qingyang was the champion last time.

335
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,200
Their PE teacher was my classmate

336
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
and roommate.

337
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
Mr. Chang.

338
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,960
I'll contact him.

339
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,040
Just a moment.

340
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,000
Hello?

341
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Gouzi

342
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,920
Bisheng

343
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Your upper bunk.

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
Teacher, what did you just call him?

345
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
No wonder he hung up on you, Mr. Chang.

346
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,680
It's a nickname from college.

347
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Just his nickname.

348
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
It's okay, might be poor reception.

349
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I'll try again.

350
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,600
Wait.

351
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,480
Listen, don't be like this.

352
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,360
What's the rush?

353
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
He seems to have been playing all night.

354
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,000
Mr. Chang.

355
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,440
Old classmate.

356
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,640
Yes, it's me.

357
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,120
Yes.

358
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
Bisheng.

359
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,120
Who slept in your upper bunk.

360
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Right.

361
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,040
It's like this.

362
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,560
I'd like to

363
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,200
bring my kids to play

364
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,540
a friendly match with you.

365
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,640
You choose the time,

366
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,560
okay?

367
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,920
No.

368
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,480
Nothing.

369
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,120
No.

370
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,880
What did you say?

371
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,640
You...

372
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Mr. Chang,

373
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,120
what did he say?

374
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,060
What did he say?

375
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,760
He said he won't play with trash.

376
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
He said you're all garbage.

377
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,760
You're trash.

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,320
You're the trash!

379
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,800
You're garbage.

380
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
How could I be trash?

381
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,610
What are you saying?

382
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,280
My kids

383
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,680
could never be trash.

384
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,680
Exactly,

385
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,380
then who was he talking about?

386
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,520
Me.

387
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,560
But come to think of it.

388
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,280
I heard they've won several consecutive

389
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,740
middle school ping pong championships.

390
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,520
Not taking you seriously

391
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
is quite normal.

392
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Better to rely on ourselves than others.

393
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Since they don't take us seriously,

394
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,520
then we'll

395
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
force them to play.

396
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
You have a plan, Fanxing?

397
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
Qingyang High School Table Tennis Club.

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,640
Today, we officially

399
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,480
challenge you

400
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,720
to a head-to-head match.

401
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,520
We are

402
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,440
Xinde High School Table Tennis Club.

403
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,400
Let's see.

404
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Doesn't it lack some energy?

405
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,800
Should we do it

406
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
like this?

407
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,920
Or something?

408
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,620
Is that how we should do it?

409
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,760
And this video

410
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,720
looks understaffed.

411
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,920
What club only has three members?

412
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
Numbers.

413
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,760
Get more people.

414
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,480
Why are you still sitting there?

415
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,160
Shengyang.

416
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,760
I'm not going.

417
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,400
It's too embarrassing.

418
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,200
I won't go.

419
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I won't go either.

420
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm from Xinde High School,

421
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,640
the current vice president of the student council

422
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,440
and head of the broadcasting station.

423
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,800
Chu Yu,

424
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,080
the ping pong club matters

425
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,280
are student council business.

426
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,920
Get down.

427
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,640
Mr. Chang,

428
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,440
when you take the photo, pull the camera back a bit

429
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,800
so everyone fits in the frame.

430
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Oh, okay.

431
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,060
No problem.

432
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,880
Come on, turn around.

433
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,760
Everyone, show some enthusiasm.

434
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,600
When I say,

435
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,920
'We are...'

436
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,000
Chu Yu,

437
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,480
you should stand like this,

438
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
like this, okay?

439
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Just like this.

440
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
Sheng Yang,

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,599
you should

442
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,440
be like this,

443
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,200
alright?

444
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Everyone, show some enthusiasm.

445
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,800
This is so awkward.

446
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,200
Chu Yu.

447
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,079
This concerns our school's honor.

448
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,920
If you don't care about the school's honor,

449
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,599
then in the next election...

450
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
Who should we elect?

451
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,720
I didn't mean that.

452
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm just getting into the mood.

453
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,600
Very good.

454
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
You'll get what you want.

455
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Shengyang.

456
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Shengyang is

457
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,560
the youth champion.

458
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
Good.

459
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,780
Truly worthy of being a champion.

460
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,200
I'd rather die than cry out.

461
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,400
I knew you weren't as good as Shengyang.

462
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,960
Very well.

463
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,760
Come on.

464
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,840
Are you ready?

465
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,400
Let people

466
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,840
know what we Xinde High School students are like.

467
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,370
Alright.

468
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,860
Come on,

469
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,360
get ready.

470
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,680
Action!

471
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,280
Qingyang High School Table Tennis Club,

472
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,080
today

473
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
we officially

474
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,240
challenge you.

475
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,720
Let's have a showdown.

476
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,760
We are

477
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,240
Xinde High School Table Tennis Club.

478
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,200
How is it?

479
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,480
The view count doesn't seem very high.

480
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,080
Did you

481
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,520
tag Qingyang High School?

482
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:58,920
Yes.

483
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,600
I specifically tagged them,

484
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
but they're ignoring me.

485
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Could it be because it's too boring?

486
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,360
Who's boring?

487
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm talking about the video.

488
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,760
It's too dull.

489
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,920
Sorry.

490
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,160
Have you noticed

491
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,960
that

492
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,400
videos with lots of likes

493
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,530
are always those really bizarre ones?

494
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,800
If you keep recording like this,

495
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
when will it ever end?

496
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,530
I want to practice basketball.

497
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,880
Let's divide the work.

498
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
You focus on basketball practice,

499
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,720
and Tangtang and I will handle the videos.

500
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
Leave it to me.

501
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,280
Fanxing.

502
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
What are you all doing here?

503
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,240
Get back to class now.

504
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
Let's go.

505
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,720
What are you laughing at?

506
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,730
What's going on?

507
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,160
What are you looking at that's so funny?

508
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,020
Excuse me, let me through.

509
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,080
I've got news.

510
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,740
Our account has been blocked.

511
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,120
They call us

512
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,200
vulgar.

513
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,360
I told you your account was no good.

514
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,560
Quick, follow the top fan.

515
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,530
I said he's not good enough.

516
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,900
You really want to join the competition that badly?

517
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,240
Which athlete

518
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,640
wouldn't want to compete against such excellent opponents?

519
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,960
Besides,

520
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,520
this has been our table tennis club's

521
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,120
long-held dream.

522
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,920
Our school has always focused only on academics.

523
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,650
Sports have always been our weakness.

524
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,800
We haven't won any sports medals for years.

525
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,920
Do you know what other schools call us?

526
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,520
What do they call you?

527
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
The Weaklings.

528
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,480
We must get rid of this label.

529
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,760
We need to win

530
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,170
our school's first gold medal.

531
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,890
Yingting, you're running circles around us.

532
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,360
If you lose a point, get off the table.

533
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,040
You're the middle school table tennis boys' singles champion.

534
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,560
Who could possibly beat you?

535
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,360
Exactly.

536
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,760
Who's beaten who?

537
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,440
If you can't win, then practice harder.

538
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,440
Look at you all.

539
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,770
Every single one of you.

540
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,770
Still laughing?

541
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
What's so funny?

542
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
A whole group of you can't beat Yingting alone.

543
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,900
You're all wasting your food.

544
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,120
Yingting.

545
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,240
When Meitong arrives,

546
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,040
come to my office together.

547
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,920
Continue practicing.

548
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,520
Yes.

549
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,360
Keep practicing, everyone.

550
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,640
Shengyang.

551
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.

552
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,560
What are you doing at our school?

553
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,680
Just passing by.

554
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Wanted to see how my former opponent

555
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,400
has improved over the years.

556
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
You only beat me by 2 points in that championship.

557
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
Nothing to be so proud of.

558
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Since you're here,

559
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,810
let's go.

560
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,020
Let's play a match.

561
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,240
Sure.

562
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,840
However,

563
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,480
not here,

564
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,650
and not just between you and me.

565
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,890
Teacher.

566
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,520
Yingting.

567
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,490
What do you need?

568
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,440
Meitong.

569
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,080
Did you see the short video Xinde High School sent you?

570
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
The one from that weak school.

571
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,850
I never watch such mindless stuff.

572
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,960
Did you notice behind their funny videos

573
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,760
did you see

574
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,880
their strategy seems specifically designed against us?

575
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,640
So what?

576
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,970
Every year so many teams target us.

577
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,120
They all want the championship.

578
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
And what happens?

579
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,160
Besides,

580
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
Xinde High School

581
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,600
is just a weak school

582
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,050
terrible at sports.

583
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,680
What's there to worry about?

584
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
That's true,

585
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,240
but what's the biggest taboo in competition?

586
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,100
Underestimating your opponent.

587
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,320
Their PE teacher, Chang Bisheng.

588
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,450
That's my college roommate who slept in the top bunk.

589
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,020
His skills were mediocre.

590
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,480
Theoretically speaking,

591
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,280
there's nothing to worry about.

592
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,720
But Yingting said

593
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,080
their school has a transfer student named Shengyang,

594
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,720
who was the youth championship winner.

595
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
Most importantly,

596
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,560
they've added mixed doubles this year.

597
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,320
For our class,

598
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,920
we need to win both men's and women's singles,

599
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,020
and take the mixed doubles title too.

600
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,820
What does the coach think?

601
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,880
Chang Bisheng invited me to play a friendly match before.

602
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,840
But I turned them down.

603
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Now

604
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
I've changed my mind.

605
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,800
I want to go meet these people.

606
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
Is that really necessary?

607
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,400
In the 2024 Paris Olympics,

608
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,500
why did Japan lose to North Korea?

609
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,960
It wasn't because Japan was weak,

610
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,160
but because they knew nothing about North Korea's playing style.

611
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,960
The middle school table tennis league is in two months.

612
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,560
Getting to know our opponents in advance

613
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,360
and warming up

614
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,700
wouldn't be a bad idea.

615
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,720
Since you're so eager to play,

616
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,050
let's have a match then.

617
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,850
Let's crush them 11 to 0.

618
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,480
Then let's play a match against them.
