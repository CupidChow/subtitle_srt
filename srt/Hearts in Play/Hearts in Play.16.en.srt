That's it.

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,079
Back then,

33
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,440
when my mom had surgery,

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
to keep it from me.

35
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,420
Have you ever thought that

36
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,840
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,100
for the rest of my life?

38
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,880
Yes.

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Why not?

40
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
Of course I thought about it.

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,040
Then why did you do that?

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
Have you ever thought

43
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,300
if the operation was successful,

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,459
you gave up the competition because you saw her,

45
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,839
you'll feel guilty for the rest of your life.

46
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,360
is her.

48
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,770
So there will be regrets no matter how you choose.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,720
There are too many regrets

50
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,480
Many people

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,570
regret not seeing their family for the last time.

53
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,880
But the fundamental reason

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
is not

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880

Star's grandpa

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
must not want her to know.

I don't know.

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
You'll be blamed.

69

Meitong.

195
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
What are you doing?

196
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,400
You're disrupted.

197
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
Do you know

198
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,480
Coach.

199
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,040
She's like a lunatic.

200
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,440
She always smiles.

201
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,120
He laughs even when he wins.

202
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,440
Smile when you lose. Smile.

203
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,880
No.

204
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,760
Just play your ball.

205
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,240
Why do you care?

206
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,120
Meitong.

207
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,640
That should be her strategy.

208
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Don't fall for it.

209
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,600
Have some water to calm down.

210
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,440
She just wants to disturb you.

211
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,120
Like this.

212
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,920
She'll smile. You'll smile too.

213
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
Coach, I can't smile.

214
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,920
You have to smile even if you can't.

215
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
If she disturbs you,

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
You just disturb her.

217
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,440
Let me tell you.

218
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,360
This is the last round.

219
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
You can only win. You can't lose.

220
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,760
I don't want you to ruin

221
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,960
will be ruined by you.

222
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,560
I'll change the racket.

223
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,040
Referee.

224
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,620
Let's change the beat.

225
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,880
We need the referee's permission

226
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,080
is approved by the referee.

227
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,160
Let's see

228
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
what kind of punishment

229
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,600
will be punished.

230
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,720
Okay.

231
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,960
Okay.

232
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,250
Come on, play steadily and hit her forehand more.

233
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,400
Come on, Star.

234
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
Be bold.

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,400
In my life,

236
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
in my life as a commentator,

237
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,520
It's the first time I've met you after so many years.

238
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
Change the rubber

239
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
change the rubber.

240
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,720
I think

241
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,480
a secret weapon.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,920
Look at it.

243
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,250
What's the next result?

244
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,520
Meitong.

245
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,680
Smile.

246
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,360
Smile.

247
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,400
Great!

248
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,960
She also understands the essence of playing basketball.

249
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Xin Meitong.

250
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
Delay time for the second serve.

251
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,210
One point deducted.

252
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Referee.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,520
She smiled at me first.

254
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,500
I didn't say I won't let you laugh in the game.

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,360
Why did you give me one point?

256
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,560
Tell me.

257
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,160
Calm down.

258
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,400
It's just a game.

259
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,160
Come on.

260
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,080
Nice!

261
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
Come on. Come on.

262
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,560
Mr. Chang.

263
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,680
Ready. Ready.

264
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,680
Referee.

265
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,880
Time out!

266
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,080
Time out.

267
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
Star!

268
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,730
What's going on?

269
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
Why can't I catch one?

270
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
Her ball is weird.

271
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,840
It goes up and down.

272
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Her judgment is all wrong.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,760
Is there something wrong with her racket?

274
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
She changed the long pips.

275
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
That's cheating.

276
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,480
This is not cheating.

277
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,540
You can change the racket in the game.

278
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,960
You need to pay attention to her backhand.

279
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,420
Her backhand is long pips.

280
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,800
She's the opposite of

281
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,960
is the opposite.

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,320
Next, all the balls she plays horizontally

283
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,280
will sink.

284
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,640
Lower spin.

285
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,120
When she hits the upper spin, it becomes the lower spin.

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,400
But the ball she rubs becomes the top spin.

287
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,640
Understand?

288
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,560
How can she remember

289
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
so many knowledge?

290
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,520
You can do it.

291
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,760
Watch me.

292
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,690
Come on. Come on.

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,480
Go all out.

294
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,410
Don't be afraid.

295
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,319
The game continues.

296
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,319
Come on!

297
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,400
Keep it steady.

298
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
Nice shot!

299
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,320
Watch your serve.

300
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,560
The two of them

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
They were very anxious.

302
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,480
Now it's

303
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,010
Xia Fan Xing's match point.

304
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,760
Now is

305
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,090
Xia Fan Xing is serving.

306
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,420
She might need to prepare for a chop shot.

307
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,760
Take the risk.

308
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,160
This serve is very creative.

309
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,440
Very unexpected.

310
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,100
He dares to use squat serve at such a match point.

311
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
I think this serve

312
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,040
is actually

313
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,280
A secret weapon.

314
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
I've never used it before.

315
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,540
Let's go. Let's go.

316
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,960
at the match point

317
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,160
like this.

318
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,720
is actually

319
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,680
courage

320
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,240
to be brave.

321
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,320
The big score is 3:2.

322
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,640
Xia Fan Xing wins!

323
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,960
Congratulations to Xia Fan Xing from Xinde High School

324
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,360
on winning

325
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,240
[the 17th]

326
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
[The champion of women's singles]

327
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,800
[The champion of female singles.]

328
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,560
Xin De High School finally has a ping pong champion.

329
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
Xia Fan Xing.

330
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,800
Champion.

331
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,840
This is

332
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,120
a game

333
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,680
of Xinde High School.

334
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,160
broke Xinde High School.

335
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,920
and has never won

336
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,480
in sports.

337
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,090
The path to champion is never that simple.

338
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,960
Xinde Table Tennis Club

339
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,920
[of Xin De Table Tennis Club]

340
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,520
Finally

341
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,240
At this moment,

342
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,570
The flower is blooming.

343
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
They use actual action

344
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,520
Again,

345
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
He showed people

346
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,120
and never give up.

347
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,960
What are you doing?

348
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
What did you hit?

349
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,780
You can't even beat trash.

350
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
You're worse than trash.

351
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,410
Leave him alone.

352
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,920
Champion.

353
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
Where is my grandpa?

354
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,640
I didn't see him.

355
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,560
Haven't you finished talking with the principal?

356
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
Your grandpa...

357
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,880
I saw Meitong

358
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,280
crying in the corner.

359
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,120
Trash likes to cry.

360
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,840
You're a teacher.

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,000
You said your students are trash.

362
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,720
Then you are Trashcan.

363
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,640
Chang Pil!

364
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,320
You just won by luck.

365
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,000
What are you so proud of?

366
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,400
Next, there's a mixed doubles between men and women.

367
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,560
You have no chance to win again.

368
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
Doggie.

369
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,480
Do you remember this nickname?

370
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,610
Who are you calling?

371
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,880
When I was in college,

372
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,400
you often sang under the girls' dorm.

373
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,120
Singing again?

374
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,980
Dancing again.

375
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,360
Too licked.

376
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,520
That's why

377
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,240
I gave you this nickname.

378
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,920
Do you remember

379
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,560
who gave you the name?

380
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,320
Our counselor.

381
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,120
I remember you were very sad.

382
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,520
Tell me.

383
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,160
Why is there a teacher

384
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,920
that his students are dogs?

385
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,760
You said being a teacher

386
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,520
to be a teacher?

387
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
You said if you were a teacher,

388
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,480
you would love students the most.

389
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
But now,

390
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,360
You said your students are trash.

391
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,040
Have you ever loved them?

392
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,640
They are just

393
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,720
a tool for your honor.

394
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,960
Now,

395
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,920
to you

396
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,520
back to you.

397
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,960
Being a teacher

398
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,320
What a tragedy in education.

401
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,240
For grandpa

402
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,500
I bought eggs for grandpa.

403
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,200
The doctor said

404
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,760
Grandpa is fine.

405
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,120
He said

406
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,200
he exercises hard.

407
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,560
You have strong bones.

408
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,760
Let's go see grandpa.

409
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,040
Grandpa?

410
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,520
Xia.

411
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,600
Try the watermelon I bought for you this morning.

412
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,720
How sweet the watermelon is.

413
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,840
Xia can't eat too sweet now.

414
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,560
Don't you know that?

415
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,920
Xia needs nutrition now.

416
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,840
Xia.

417
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Have some soy milk I made for you.

418
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,160
This soy milk

419
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,240
this soy milk early in the morning.

420
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,560
Old Madam Zhao.

421
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,360
You're not a mill.

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
It's just a soy milk machine.

423
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,320
My dumplings are different.

424
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,200
I got up early

425
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,280
in the morning.

426
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
And dough

427
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,680
Add the filling.

428
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,880
It's peeled.

429
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
Try it

430
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,440
What are you doing?

431
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,720
Biography of Old Lady Zhen.

432
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,440
The setting sun is the Asura Field.

433
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,720
Amazing!

434
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm so jealous.

435
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,200
Good job.

436
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,080
Mr. Wang.

437
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
Mr. Shang.

438
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,320
What?

439
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,880
Mr. Wang.

440
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,880
I have PE class this afternoon.

441
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,480
I have to

442
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
Get sick.

443
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
No.

444
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,760
I think

445
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,420
I've gained weight recently.

446
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
So during lunch break,

447
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,160
during lunch break.

448
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,690
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
You have such a nice body.

450
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,560
You're perfect.

451
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,840
You're a woman. You're a woman.

452
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,760
I won't allow it.

453
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,820
You have a figure and you're anxious.

454
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,200
Fine.

455
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,480
Forget it.

456
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,080
Wait.

457
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,000
You mean

458
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
ping pong?

459
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,040
I have such a good body.

460
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,320
I don't need to exercise.

461
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,760
You have such a poor body.

462
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,360
Of course.

463
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,160
No.

464
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
I mean...

465
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm...

466
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,560
You mean...

467
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,360
Me?

468
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,560
The topic of love

469
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,640
is too difficult.

470
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,680
If

471
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
what happened to grandpa,

472
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,040
will you blame me?

473
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,760
Of course not.

474
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,440
My grandpa's wish

475
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,480
is to be happy.

476
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,480
and happy.

477
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,120
If I can't see him for the last time,

478
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,080
because

479
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,880
in regret and pain.

480
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,640
that would be against his wish.

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,520
But...

482
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
If this happens again,

483
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
if you dare to hide it from me,

484
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
I'll strangle you to death.

485
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,040
Do you hear me?

486
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
The mixed doubles game is about to begin.

487
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,040
Are you ready?

488
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,360
Trust them.

489
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,920
You are our pride.

490
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,320
You two are also my pride.

491
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,280
Love you.

492
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,640
The friendship between girls

493
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
It's really cheesy.

494
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,740
We can do it too.

495
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,800
Go away.

496
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,560
Okay.

497
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,800
Let's go practice.

498
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,480
Sure.

499
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,970
After the practice,

500
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,610
Yu Manxin will treat us.

501
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
Why me again?

502
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
Because you're the president.

503
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
The role of a president is to treat a meal.

504
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,240
Yes.

505
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,040
Yes.

506
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,170
I don't want to be it.

507
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Don't run!

508
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
Don't try to escape.

509
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,520
Let's go. Buy us dinner.

510
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,640
Wait.

511
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,120

512
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,320

No.

521
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,160
Actually,

522
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,840
just started.

523
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,480
The mixed doubles haven't started yet.

524
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,920

His story is amazing.

530
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,840
I also heard that

531
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,120

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,240
