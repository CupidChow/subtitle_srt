1
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,280
Look. It's here.

2
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
This is specially for me.

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,600
sugar seafood pancake.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
Tangtang, you have so much food.

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,039
You're a gourmet

6
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,720
Sugar

7
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,400
This is our local seafood pancake.

8
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,080
Try it.

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,600
Tangtang I'm allergic to seafood

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Don't make it next time

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,920
Come on. Eat this.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,520
Eat this

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,200
It's specially made for you.

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
Come on.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,600
Here you are.

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
By the way, Chuyu,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,240
when we were in the ping-pong club last night,

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,400
when we were in the ping-pong club last night.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,259
Ask Shengyang.

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,340
Shengyang, right?

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,479
We just heard the sound at the door.

22
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,740
We didn't really go in.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,920
There's no need to look at them.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,720
Look at them

25
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,240
Tangtang.

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,039
Hello. Hello.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm here. I'm here.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
were you playing basketball inside?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,520
I didn't have time to be here last night.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,220
I told you there really is a senior in our Table Tennis Club.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,440
And the vice president of the student council is sitting here.

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,240
Don't spread rumors in school.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,240
In physics,

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,880
is called

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
It's called "Neil". It's "Neil".

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,880
Come on. Come on.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,800
It's like this. It's like this.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
You're amazing.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,920
We've never learned this in the textbook.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,000
You can learn anywhere.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
You can learn short videos too.

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
But Chuyu,

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,050
our Table Tennis Club is really noisy.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,690
Zhong Wei Zi.

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
Anyway, let's call it a day.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,180
Don't spread rumors in school, okay?

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,440
What?

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,960
Go get my food

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,200
I want to eat.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,520
Why me?

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
You took my money.

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Who is Liu Manxin?

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,570
Why did you take money from him?

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,280
Nothing.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,120
We should help each other.

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll call you.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,920
Which class are you in?

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
I've never seen you before.

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you new here?

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Shengyang.

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,760
When will we fight?

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,360
I won't play anymore.

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
In this world,

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
apart from

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,760
who has a sweet voice,

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,440
no one dares to reject me.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,440
Are you talking about me?

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,720
Who said you?

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm talking to you.

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,660
Where's your manners?

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
We must play this game.

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,440
Give up.

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm talking to you.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
You have no manners.

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,120
Chuyu.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,960
Don't eat junk snacks.

77
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,220
None of your business.

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm talking to you.

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
It's okay.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,920
Stop running away

81
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,360
Face me bravely like a man.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
Let go.

83
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,280
Don't blame me if you don't let go.

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,079
Fine.

85
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,840
I'll fight to the end.

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
I'm asking you.

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,079
Don't.

88
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,440
You forced me.

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
What?

90
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,880
Chuyu.

91
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,360
He is a student from another school.

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,440
He's a socialiser.

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
You're an outsider.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,560
So what?

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,480
I want to play basketball with him.

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,360
Let go of me!

97
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,360
I want to play basketball with him.

98
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,400
Let go of me!

99
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,450
I want to play basketball with him.

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,760
Let go of me!

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,560
Gosh.

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,519
What are you doing?

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,120
What are you doing

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,240
Why did you throw it out?

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Failure is just a successful ambush.

106
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
Every time you fall,

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,159
every time I fall.

108
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,640
Oh my

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,200
Throw it out and pull it

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
Just throw it hard.

111
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,400
I will be back.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Shengyang.

113
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,880
You don't have to compete with Luo Qing.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,120
Hold it off.

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,520
I can get more rent.

116
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,080
Liu Manxin.

117
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,720
As the president of the Table Tennis Club,

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,720
can you think more about the Table Tennis Club?

119
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Why not?

120
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Think about it.

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
Love grows over time.

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,600
The longer I spend time with Luo Qing,

123
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
the easier we get attached.

124
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,320
When we have feelings,

125
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,440
he might transfer to our school.

126
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Isn't that good?

127
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
If you get him to the Table Tennis Club,

128
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
someone will represent you.

129
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
That's different.

130
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,580
Let me tell you.

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,280
I've been in the Table Tennis Club for so long.

132
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,760
I've never seen her god.

133
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,520
But

134
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,280
you saw him last night.

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
What does this mean?

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
It means she's a deity.

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,760
She thinks highly of you.

138
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,480
She bless you.

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
She hopes that

140
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,960
you can join the Table Tennis Club.

141
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,140
there are no ghosts in this world.

142
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,760
We saw it last night.

143
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,840
What did you see?

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,640
I saw that.

145
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
Stop it.

146
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Is there any?

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
We'll find out tonight.

148
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,320
It's a double day off tomorrow anyway.

149
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,560
Tonight,

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
as an adventure tonight.

151
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,440
Shengyang.

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,480
It's time for a duel.

153
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Let's see who's going to pee.

154
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,040
I can pee ten meters.

155
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
Hey, ping pong.

156
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,159
Have you heard?

157
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,840
There's a female ghost in the Table Tennis Club.

158
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,170
called Senior Goddess.

159
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
He's really good at ping pong.

160
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,300
Who are you? Who is talking to you?

161
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,140
I'm not talking to you either.

162
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
I was talking to myself.

163
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Luo Qing.

164
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,740
I'll fight you if you win the game.

165
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,960
You want me to fight a ghost?

166
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
Forget it if you're scared.

167
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,010
You're so clueless.

168
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm afraid of ghosts.

169
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm scared.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
Why is a idle person here?

171
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,880
What are you talking about?

172
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,200
Chu Yu.

173
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
He is my roommate.

174
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,520
He wants to play ping-pong with you.

175
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,760
We're firm materialism without theories.

176
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,160
How can we believe this?

177
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,080
Chuyu.

178
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
We should have some respect.

179
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,600
Just

180
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,200
as an adventure game with us.

181
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
Yeah, Chuyu.

182
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,600
We haven't had fun together for a long time.

183
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,680
It's exciting to think about it.

184
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,880
And I told my mom

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,560
we'll stay at Star's tonight.

186
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,000
It must be fun

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
Then why are we sitting here?

188
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Waiting for the dark.

189
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Have you seen ghosts during the day?

190
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,880
I've never seen a ghost before.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
I told you it's called Middle Wei.

192
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,680
How long do we have to wait?

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,680
When it gets dark,

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,480
we'll go in.

195
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,280
What about dinner?

196
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,680
Dinner?

197
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,440
Don't look at me.

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,300
I have no money.

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,080
I saw you

200
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,410
I saw you have five yuan.

201
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,040
five yuan is not enough for the six of us.

202
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
Why don't we gather together?

203
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,600
I have five yuan too.

204
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
I have 10 yuan too.

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,559
Tangtang.

206
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,140
I bought snacks with my pocket money.

207
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
Where are the snacks?

208
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm done.

209
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
My money is in my phone.

210
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
I don't bring my phone to school.

211
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,600
Don’t look at me.

212
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
I gave my money to Liu Manxin.

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Liu Manxin.

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,780
Where is the money?

215
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,600
I left it at home.

216
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Go get it.

217
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,520
It's too far from home.

218
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Your home is near the school.

219
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
You didn't bring the key?

220
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,960
I brought the key.

221
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Look.

222
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I have the key.

223
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
I changed the lock.

224
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
You changed the lock?

225
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,280
How are we going back tonight?

226
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,720
Can you stop talking?

227
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,760
It's not me.

228
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,920
How can we go back if you change the lock?

229
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,960
Enough.

230
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,680
Liu Manxin.

231
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,130
I want your money as if I want your life.

232
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,760
Twenty yuan.

233
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
The six of us

234
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
It should be enough.

235
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,360
What should we eat?

236
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,730
Let's eat pancakes.

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
Seven yuan one.

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
The six of us

239
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
Six, seven, twenty-four.

240
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Four yuan left.

241
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,920
You can beg the boss

242
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,120
to beg the boss.

243
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,480
Your school has no threshold.

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
What do they mean?

245
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
Can't you see?

246
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,720
They mean the boss won't agree.

247
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,160
What's her math score?

248
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,080
Heaven will destroy our Table Tennis Club.

249
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Alright, listen to me.

250
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,760
Stop dawdling.

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
If you're too shy to say it,

252
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
I'll talk to the boss.

253
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
No.

254
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Why are you laughing?

255
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,000
Boss.

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,440
They think

257
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,730
you don't want to sell six pancakes

258
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,840
you don't want to sell six pancakes to us.

259
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,360
Six, seven, twenty-four.

260
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,520
We have 20 yuan here.

261
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,720
Boss, please.

262
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Sell it to us.

263
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,360
You...

264
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,800
Look at you.

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,900
Are you looking down on me?

266
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,040
It's just four yuan.

267
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,560
Do I have to

268
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,980
to starve all the flowers in our country?

269
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
Thank you, boss.

270
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,760
Thank you.

271
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,120
What's going on?

272
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,780
I don't know

273
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,960
Have a sausage

274
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,640
See?

275
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,720
I told you

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
the boss won't argue with us

277
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,480
because of these four yuan.

278
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,080
is...

279
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
Thank you, boss.

280
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
Don't add too much sugar.

281
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,480
Boss,

282
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,410
We'll give you the 22 yuan we owe you tomorrow.

283
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,000
What?

284
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,720
I gave you 20 yuan just now.

285
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah.

286
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
You're not good at math.

287
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,120
Remember.

288
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,520
If you don't do well in math,

289
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
You'll have to work hard

290
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,520
in the future.

291
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,320
Got it.

292
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,160
Do you hear me?

293
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,320
Math is not as good as sugar and me.

294
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Okay.

295
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,520
Boss, this one.

296
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,360
Youtiao.

297
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,080
Please be careful.

298
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
You're not a deer.

299
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't rush into my heart.

300
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,520
You're crazy.

301
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
As the vice president of the student council,

302
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,960
I have to climb the wall with you.

303
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,960
Chuyu.

304
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
If we go through the gate,

305
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,320
the guard

306
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
won't let us in.

307
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
Right?

308
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Let's go.

309
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
Wait.

310
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,440
Did you hear

311
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,160
What's that sound?

312
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,800
What sound?

313
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,720
What a scary sound.

314
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,370
Could it be someone's heart was poked out?

315
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,920
I knew it.

316
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
She’s amazing.

317
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,920
Liu Manxin.

318
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,980
What are you doing?

319
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,000
I want to dye the atmosphere.

320
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,760
Yoo Manxin.

321
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,420
Turn it off.

322
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,600
Turn it off.

323
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,120
Chuyu.

324
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,600
Come on.

325
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,800
Yoo Manxin.

326
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,140
Why didn’t you bring your phone when we were eating?

327
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,760
Here's the thing.

328
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,520
I have a few words to say.

329
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,740
Because of this...

330
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,720
No.

331
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,200
You didn’t ask.

332
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Liu Manxin.

333
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,560
I’ll strangle you.

334
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800
Liu Manxin.

335
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
I’ll deal with you later.

336
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's go find Senior Shen first.

337
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,600
What?

338
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,160
What?

339
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
Behind you.

340
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
Where?

341
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,040
Yoo Manxin.

342
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
Wait.

343
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,280
Someone's here.

344
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,840
Grab my foot.

345
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
I can't lift my feet.

346
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,040
Could it be

347
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,280
a goddess?

348
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,120
Star.

349
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,840
Help me

350
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,210
Tangtang, don't be afraid.

351
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,840
I'll save you.

352
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,560
Senior, please.

353
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,720
Please let Tangtang go.

354
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,640
Senior, please.

355
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,560
I beg you.

356
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,920
Please let Tangtang go.

357
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,600
Please, Senior.

358
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,160
Please let Tangtang go.

359
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,180
Your shoelaces are stuck.

360
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,520
Hurry up.

361
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,280
Let's go.

362
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,880
Star.

363
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,740
I'll kneel down for you later.

364
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,600
Let's go.

365
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Wait.

366
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,700
What's wrong with you?

367
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,440
In horror movies,

368
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,600
in horror movies.

369
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
Shall we count the numbers?

370
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,120
Sure.

371
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,120
If we find someone missing in advance,

372
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,320
we can find it in time.

373
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes.

374
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,720
Xia Fan Xing.

375
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
You'll count it.

376
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,680
Okay.

377
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,530
Let me count.

378
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

379
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,800
Seven people.

380
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
When we came in,

381
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,920
six people.

382
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,040
So what?

383
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,370
Nothing to be afraid of.

384
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,120
Just...

385
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,120
One more.

386
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,120
Is it one more?

387
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,140
Do you want to count again?

388
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:44,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,120
Who told you to count?

390
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,520
It turns out that there are people

391
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,160
I didn't mean it.

392
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,880
Just scare yourself.

393
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,240
You guys

394
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
you'll be scared to death if you don't get to the Table Tennis Club.

395
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,040
Wait.

396
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,480
How about this?

397
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
Let's design a gesture.

398
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Everyone design one.

399
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,640
Make this gesture when you're scared.

400
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
Give each other strength.

401
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,720
How about this?

402
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,640
Good idea.

403
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,600
We each design one.

404
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Use the best one.

405
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,720
Come on.

406
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
One, two, three.

407
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,040
Star.

408
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,720
What do you mean?

409
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,040
Table Tennis.

410
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,240
Look.

411
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,840
When you lift it up to the sky,

412
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,880
like a sun.

413
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,600
Sun

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,080
can remove all fear

415
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,920
and darkness.

416
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,400
Did you hear anything?

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Sound?

418
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
Could it be...

419
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,760
Who is it?

420
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,520
Little Sun.

421
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,240
What are you doing?

422
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,440
Sorry, sir.

423
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,440
If you want to play basketball,

424
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,040
you should play it openly.

425
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,600
Why are you sneaking around?

426
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,200
Yes.

427
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
It's so dark.

428
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
You have good eyesight.

429
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,460
I don't want to do this either.

430
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,440
I'm a guard.

431
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,320
I have to be on duty tonight.

432
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,160
I should be loyal to my duty.

433
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,960
Right?

434
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,760
But sometimes when I think about ping-pong,

435
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,420
when I think about ping-pong.

436
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,200
I can't control myself.

437
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,210
I just want to play a few rounds.

438
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,480
but I'm afraid they'll find out.

439
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,760
So I sneaked here.

440
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,320
You still found out.

441
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,960
Sir.

442
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,680
You can play basketball during the day.

443
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,520
Yes, sir.

444
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,160
We're in charge of the Table Tennis Club.

445
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
If you want to play,

446
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
just tell us.

447
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
We'll let you beat us.

448
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,200
Uncle,

449
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,800
Do you like ping pong that much?

450
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,480
Love is one thing.

451
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,200
The point is

452
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
[has a special]

453
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,960
a special relationship.

454
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,760
Special?

455
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,520
My wife and I

456
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,100
we met when playing ping pong.

457
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,480
People from our era

458
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
no entertainment

459
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,160
I don't have any hobbies.

460
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,600
I just play ping pong.

461
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,600
After work,

462
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,800
go to the lounge in our unit

463
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,080
to play ping-pong.

464
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,960
My wife

465
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,620
also likes playing ping pong.

466
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,620
When two people are together,

467
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
The ball

468
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,480
more and more.

469
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,800
We got closer and closer

470
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,840
Then he got married.

471
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,360
Later, we fell in love with ping-pong.

472
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
We got married on April 10th.

473
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
April 10th?

474
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,080
Is it a special day?

475
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
[Table Tennis Diplomacy]

476
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
[On April 10, 1971,]

477
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
[the American Table Tennis Team Vienhua]

478
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,500
[became the first Americans]

479
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,960
the first batch of Americans who entered China

480
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,040
started a new chapter of Chinese and America diplomacy.

481
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,600
Sure.

482
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,760
Young man,

483
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,600
You're quite knowledgeable.

484
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Here's the thing.

485
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,440
So every time I played ping-pong,

486
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,520
I remember

487
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,160
when I was with my wife.

488
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Unfortunately,

489
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm the only one

490
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,800
in front of the table.

491
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,400
Sir.

492
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,130
Don't you want to play basketball?

493
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,680
I'm off today.

494
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,560
We'll play with you.

495
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
Fight as much as you want.

496
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,680
This is not good.

497
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
I've been out for a long time.

498
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,520
I have to go back to work.

499
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,320
I'm the guard.

500
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
It's okay.

501
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm the vice president of the student council.

502
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
On behalf of the student council, I allow you to play.

503
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,600
I'll watch the door for you later.

504
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Yes.

505
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm the president of this ping-pong club.

506
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,120
I agree to let you play.

507
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,480
They'll play with you later.

508
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
They are awesome.

509
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,360
Let them play with you.

510
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,560
Uncle,

511
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,640
I'll show you

512
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,120
Baodao Taiwan's skills.

513
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,980
Do you want to play?

514
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,880
Sure.

515
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,360
Come on.

516
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,520
Did I play well?

517
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,440
Sure.

518
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,240
It's my turn to be the president of the Table Tennis Club.

519
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,960
Uncle, it's my turn.

520
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,560
Do you know why ghosts

521
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,720
ghosts are afraid of seeing the sun?

522
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,320
Because the sun

523
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,000
can expel all fear and darkness.

524
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,760
and bring us hope and light.

525
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Stars.

526
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
What should we do when the sun is out?

527
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,640
Liu Manxin.

528
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
You're so bad at physics.

529
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,920
The sun didn't disappear at night.

530
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,560
However,

531
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,760
we can't see the sun for the time being.

532
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,720
The sun has always been there.

533
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Sometimes,

534
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,160
we become the sun of others.

535
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,040
Sometimes,

536
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,800
others will be our sun.

537
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,680
Please give me six pancakes.

538
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
Okay.

539
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,560
Here's the money.

540
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,280
No.

541
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,480
This is seven yuan for a pancake.

542
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,480
You buy six for 24 yuan.

543
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,640
Six, seven, twenty-four.

544
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,770
That's what the students just bought.

545
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,440
Those kids

546
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,960
are in trouble.

547
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,360
We're adults.

548
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,960
Right?

549
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,080
Okay.

550
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,010
I'll give you 50.

551
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Six.

552
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Okay.

553
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,840
When we become each other's sun,

554
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,400
the world will be warm.

555
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
Senior.

556
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,440
Where?

557
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,800
Star.

558
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,360
I checked the school's information last night.

559
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,020
There are two founders of the Table Tennis Club.

560
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,680
Everyone is alive and well now.

561
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,960
and have a baby.

562
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,840
[There's no senior god at all.]

563
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,120
This legend

564
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,440
is fake.

565
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,320
Does it matter?

566
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Not important?

567
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,240
What matters is

568
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,080
in order to take off

569
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,880
a weak school hat,

570
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,800
The spirit of sacrifice.

571
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,200
It's like a fool moving the mountain.

572
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,840
It doesn't matter

573
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,040
doesn't matter.

574
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
What matters is

575
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,880
the perseverance and determination

576
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,960
It doesn't matter if the legend is true or not.

577
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,440
The spirit in the legend

578
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,960
is the most precious.

579
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,480
Right?

580
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,960
Grandpa.

581
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,090
What do you want for breakfast?

582
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
Mrs. Wu

583
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,760
came back from the south

584
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,680
and brought many specialties.

585
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,080
I made a plate

586
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Let you try it.

587
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,000
My grandpa is the best.

588
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,400
Try it.

589
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,160
Delicious

590
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,280
Eat more.

591
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,240
Xia Fan Xing.

592
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,280
I'm going to be late.

593
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,240
Hurry up.

594
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,960
A ping pong player.
