1
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,090
the first founder of the Table Tennis Club

2
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,120
is an excellent senior who loves ping-pong.

3
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,160
She plays ping pong day and night.

4
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,120
She walks and walks.

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,680
[She walks.] [She walks.]

6
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,120
[One, two, three.] [One, two, three.] [One, two, three.]

7
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,479
[I also played]

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,440
[just to win glory in the high school ping-pong tournament]

9
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,800
and win a gold medal for the school.

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,280
[He took off the badge of a weak school.]

11
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
[but he lost again and again.]

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,640
In the end, he was extremely sad.

13
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,280
[He's depressed.]

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
The world is filled with joy

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,800
[She turned into a deity.]

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
God.

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,520
will bless everyone who joins the Table Tennis Club.

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
and their health.

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,960
Wish you good health.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
Good luck. Good luck.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
The winner

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
Because of her protection,

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,120
our Table Tennis Club

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
can thrive.

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,120
Everyone

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
happy.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,960
Sheng Yang.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,160
Do you want to be happy?

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,880
Do you want to be happy?

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,620
The sports club has changed to a cult.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,120
Senior, God is real.

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,280
Liu Manxin met

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,120
It's true.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,600
That was the night of July 14 last year.

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,040
I was going to practice.

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Who is it?

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,920
According to the law of security,

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,640
and spread rumors,

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
will be detained for more than five days and ten days.

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
I'm telling the truth.

41
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
500 yuan fine.

42
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,560
A fine?

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,440
What Liu Manxin said is true.

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,640
He doesn’t lie as the president.

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,360
And he really...

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,320
more than 5,000 words.

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,650
is the same as the rumor.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,760
Pull me.

49
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,160
He knows the law.

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
You...

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,959
Why are you so indifferent?

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,000
Class begins.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,720
Stand up.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,240
Hello.

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,400
Hello, everyone.

56
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,930
Sit down.

57
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,280
Take out your textbook.

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
Turn to page 26.

59
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,720
Today,

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,740
Zheng Chenggong's comeback.

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Open the hazelzelnut

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
It's been ten years since he revived the foundation.

63
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,240
Tian Heng has 3,000 customers.

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,120
I can't bear to leave him.

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
This poem

66
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Sung-yang.

67
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
I finally found you.

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
You and I have been enemies for years.

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,980
Which class are you in?

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,880
Ultimate Class 1.

71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,800
Why are you in my class?

72
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,520
Get out.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Sorry, sir.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Close the door.

75
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,520
Sorry.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Let's continue.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
It's for you.

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
That's strange.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
This isn't my school.

80
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
Why do I feel uneasy

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,400
when I see the teacher on the stage?

82
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
I knew it.

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,820
No matter how strong a country flower is,

84
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,560
they are afraid of gardeners.

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,450
The Taiwanese student wants to

86
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,210
It's for you.

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Let me take a look.

88
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,840
Why is he looking for you?

89
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,500
Did you steal his girlfriend?

90
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,930
I don't have puppy love.

91
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,290
Then why would I come to you?

92
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,480
You owe me money?

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
How much?

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
One million.

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,760
One million.

96
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,560
Why do you owe me one million?

97
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,120
How about gambling?

98
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

99
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,200
This time, I'll bet all my money on you. Okay.

100
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,160
I'll bet all of our money.

101
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,880
I'll make a fortune.

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,240
No!

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't!

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Star.

105
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,120
I won.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,160
I won many children.

107
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
Shengyang.

108
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,320
You can't gamble.

109
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,680
According to the law of security,

110
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,520
those who participate in gambling

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
will be detained or fined under five days.

112
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
If the situation is serious,

113
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,280
will be detained for more than ten days and fifteen days.

114
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,080
will be fined under 3,000 yuan.

115
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,280
Gambling is not only illegal,

116
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,160
but also make you go bankrupt.

117
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,720
Don't gamble.

118
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,090
Take some medicine to heal your brain.

119
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,520
You can't gamble anyway.

120
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I finally understand

121
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,320
why you can believe the ghost.

122
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
What do you mean?

123
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,240
You lied to me just now.

124
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,120
What else?

125
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Why would I gamble?

126
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,410
Then how did you owe me one million?

127
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,600
Shengyang is here.

128
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,560
How can a pure sheep run past a horse running?

129
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Shengyang, stop!

130
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Woman, you’re affecting my running speed.

131
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,560
You stained my lollipop.

132
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,920
What’s your relationship with Shengyang?

133
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
Not all women

134
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,360
can get the answer from me.

135
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
Can you talk normally?

136
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,240
Are you okay?

137
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,560
Don't try to get my attention

138
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,000
to attract my attention.

139
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
Not all bosses

140
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,840
are so naïve.

141
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
Please.

142
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,400
Can you talk properly?

143
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,160
Aren’t you looking for Shengyang?

144
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,360
You can come to me.

145
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,040
I have a special relationship with him.

146
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
You're his girlfriend.

147
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm his boss.

148
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
He's my soldier.

149
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,480
Call me if you need anything.

150
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,640
What club?

151
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,970
Table Tennis Club. Table Tennis Club.

152
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,520
[Table Tennis Club]

153
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,480
Now the game

154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,040
is in a very critical period.

155
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,600
Luo Qing serves.

156
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
The quality of the ball is good.

157
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
The following link.

158
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,360
[A backhand loop from the forehand position.]

159
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,000
Nice shot!

160
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
The score is

161
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,960
is two to one.

162
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
10 to 8.

163
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,970
It’s the match point of Shengyang.

164
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,970
Look at Shengyang’s serve.

165
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Nice shot!

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
Let’s congratulate Shengyang

167
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,320
for entering

168
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,400
in the next semi-final.

169
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
In this world,

170
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
I've never failed

171
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
I have never failed.

172
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,540
Shengyang.

173
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
I will come to you.

174
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Good luck.

175
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
Later,

176
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,760
I took a leave of absence.

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,860
Dad asked me to train in Mainland.

178
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,960
and see the prosperity of our country.

179
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,120
I take this opportunity

180
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,640
to find Shengyang.

181
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,600
to redeem myself.

182
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
I see.

183
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
Are you a good player?

184
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,400
To be modest,

185
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,760
No.1 in the world.

186
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Not really modest.

187
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,120
At noon

188
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,340
Let's try it. Okay.

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,200
1:0.

190
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,320
Two to zero.

191
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
OK. OK.

192
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,360
Three to zero.

193
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,480
What?

194
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,440
I played a game with Luo Qing before.

195
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
From what I know about her,

196
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,840
he is good at playing arc.

197
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,040
Stop talking.

198
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,570
I can't remember anything.

199
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Wait.

200
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,970
I'll call the stars.

201
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,320
Cut.

202
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,560
Stop.

203
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,450
Do you want some snacks?

204
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,640
You are born to be human.

205
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
It's not healthy to eat junk snacks.

206
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,500
Besides, you've eaten it before.

207
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
30,000 days in life.

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,680
Eating to death is my fault.

209
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,100
Why are you sneaking around here?

210
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,640
Based on my understanding of Luo Qing,

211
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,080
he is good at playing arc.

212
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
If you want to defend the loop,

213
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,440
you need to control the landing point.

214
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,520
and the height of the ball.

215
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,160
Don't lower it too much.

216
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
Oh.

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Okay.

218
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,640
Thank you.

219
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,040
Mr. Wang.

220
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,480
Mr. Wang.

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Mr. Chang.

222
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,340
What's the matter?

223
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,600
It's nothing serious.

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,360
It’s just that

225
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,680
It’s about Shengyang.

226
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
What's wrong with Shengyang?

227
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,400
He used to be the champion of the Youth Table Tennis Championships.

228
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,530
You know him, right?

229
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,480
The director showed me his file.

230
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,520
Great.

231
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,520
Here's the thing.

232
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,400
our Table Tennis Club is in need of talents.

233
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,600
In a few months,

234
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,920
in a few months.

235
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,880
I want you to persuade him

236
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,240
to join our Table Tennis Club

237
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,040
and take part in the competition on behalf of the school.

238
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,320
and win honor for the school.

239
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,120
Mr. Chang,

240
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,560
The most important thing for students is to study.

241
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,160
Sorry, Mr. Chang.

242
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,120
I have something to do.

243
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Let's talk later.

244
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,720
Mr. Chang.

245
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,560
Mr. Wang.

246
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,040
I'll take up the PE class in the afternoon.

247
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,680
I'll tell them you're sick.

248
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,640
I can't.

249
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

250
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,100
Are you sick again?

251
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,360
Are you sick again?

252
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,760
Mr. Wang.

253
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,960
Don't you think about

254
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
11 to 4.

255
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
He looks silly.

256
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,480
Not bad.

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,640
Alright.

258
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,840
Where is Shengyang?

259
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,040
I want to fight him.

260
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,880
Okay.

261
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Do you want to transfer?

262
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,440
Transfer to Xinde

263
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
and join our Table Tennis Club.

264
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
What do you think?

265
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,170
women have to keep me by their side.

266
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,599
But I just want to fly

267
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
in the sky.

268
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
Shengyang.

269
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,770
The defence loop you taught me is really good.

270
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,720
I blocked several balls at once.

271
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,080
But...

272
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,440
I'm not good at it yet.

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,440
Let's practice harder.

274
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,300
Practice hard.

275
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,400
I need someone to teach me to practice hard.

276
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,920
How about

277
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,360
be my coach?

278
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Where is Luo Qing?

279
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,000
Luo Qing.

280
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,720
Luo Qing was taken away by Liu Manxin.

281
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,680
by Liu Manxin.

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,880
My house is close to the school.

283
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,720
It's convenient for you.

284
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,080
Think about it.

285
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,120
You rent such a big house.

286
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,880
It costs at least 300 yuan a day.

287
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,690
You can stay in my house.

288
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,290
We're sharing the rent.

289
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
I only charge you 100 yuan a day.

290
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Here.

291
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
It's a gas bill.

292
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,940
Here's the water bill.

293
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,740
And the electricity bill.

294
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,480
property and elevator fee.

295
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,520
We have to split.

296
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,040
A for dinner.

297
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,880
But I have high requirements for food and accommodation.

298
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,680
It's not five-star.

299
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I won't live here.

300
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,920
God.

301
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,360
My house is much cleaner than a five-star hotel.

302
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,080
What I want is not clean.

303
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm just obsessed with five stars.

304
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,200
For example,

305
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
I understand you.

306
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,320
Come on. Come on.

307
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,880
Roommate

308
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,920
You want to practice?

309
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,880
What's the use of this?

310
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
What should I do?

311
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,850
Why don't you practice with me?

312
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,760
Here.

313
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,690
You'd better practice with it.

314
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,280
I didn't ask you to join the Table Tennis Club.

315
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,240
I mean practice with me.

316
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,500
Practice by yourself.

317
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,500
If you can't do it, you can ask that senior god to train with you.

318
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
Don't talk about people during the day.

319
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
or ghosts at night.

320
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
You're a high school student.

321
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,780
Why are you so superstitious?

322
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,660
What are you afraid of?

323
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm not afraid.

324
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,360
Didn't you say that the deity will bless you?

325
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes.

326
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Please bless me.

327
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
Keep practicing.

328
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,800
I want to go to the toilet.

329
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,460
Do you want to go to the toilet?

330
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,280
Think about it.

331
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,120
There are the most ghost stories in the toilet.

332
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,530
Haven't you heard of it?

333
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,040
In the past,

334
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
someone

335
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,000
When he was in the bathroom,

336
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
he suddenly

337
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,080
and asked him

338
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,280
Do you want it?

339
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
Paper.

340
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,160
You're so timid.

341
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,690
and listen to these things.

342
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
I'm cheap.

343
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,880
There are no ghosts in the world.

344
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,200
Don't scare yourself.

345
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,720
It's true.

346
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,800
When I was practicing in the ping-pong club last night,

347
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,040
there was a ping pong ball.

348
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,560
Like this.

349
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,400
He's dancing on the table.

350
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Why are you looking at me?

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,200
You won't let me go in with you, will you?

352
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,520
If

353
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,520
a hand

354
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,160
asked me if I needed tissue.

355
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,040
You have to go in and save me.

356
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,720
Go now.

357
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,360
Don't think too much.

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
Shengyang.

359
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Are you there?

360
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm a good student.

361
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
Don't scare me.

362
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,360
Xia Fan, are you ready?

363
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Xia Fan!

364
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,570
Xia Fan, if you don't say anything, I'll go in.

365
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,320
Xia Fan Xing.

366
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,480
This is the ladies' room. It's inappropriate to go in.

367
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,240
What if something happens to her?

368
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
Xia Fan Xing!

369
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,320
Xia Fan, stop it.

370
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,780
Xia Fan Xing! Xia Fan Xing!

371
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,040
I am

372
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,480
I just

373
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,520
if you're really scared.

374
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,440
Why are you so reactive?

375
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,500
You deserve it.

376
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,240
You're so mean! You're so mean! You're so mean!

377
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,480
Why did you leave?

378
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,420
You don't even hold the wall. I'm convinced.

379
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,120
Wait.

380
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Listen.

381
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,400
Don't you hear

382
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,240
hear the sound of ping pong?

383
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,080
Maybe someone came to practice.

384
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,560
Impossible.

385
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,320
Tangtang and Liu Manxin

386
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,520
wouldn't have come to practice so late.

387
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,520
Besides,

388
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,120
no one wants to join the Table Tennis Club.

389
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,760
Why is someone practicing so late?

390
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,520
You'll see.

391
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,100
Don't scare yourself.

392
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,480
Wait.

393
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
Is there

394
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,440
Could it be...

395
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,920
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

396
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,280
Help!

397
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Help!
