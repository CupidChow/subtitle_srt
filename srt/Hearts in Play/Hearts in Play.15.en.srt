1
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,240
What's this dish

2
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,880
Coming

3
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,610
Steamed pork

4
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,560
What is this?

5
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,120
This is a dish I specially made for you two.

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,160
called

7
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,840
Perfect life.

8
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,920
These two meatballs

9
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,800
not only means you two will get full marks in the future,

10
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,720
and

11
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
it means you two

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,440
in the future.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
Tangtang, you're amazing.

14
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,680
Come on

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,060
Let's have a toast.

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,360
Cheers!

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
Wish all of us

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
have

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,160
happiness.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
[It's a perfect life.]

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
[It's a perfect life.]

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,440
Perfect.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Wait.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,640
I also have a gift for you two.

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,320
One for each.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,840
Purple underpants.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,600
It means

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,639
Choose the winner.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,600
Liu Manxin.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
Are you crazy?

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,120
Liu Manxin, what do you think?

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,600
I spent a lot of money.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,880
How much?

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Thank you.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Manxin.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,880
You are our president.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
Please.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
do something meaningful?

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,320
But I think you should take it seriously.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,520
After all,

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
you have to play five more games to enter the finals.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,520
Don't worry.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,040
I've already recorded

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,200
of our next game

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,680
of the contestants.

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
We can study Shengyang and Stars later.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,200
Really?

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,800
It's rare.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,640
Is it so efficient?

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,600
Of course.

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
As Mr. Chang said,

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,880
I am an excellent president.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,200
Okay.

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,920
Hi. Hi.

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,520
Luo Qing,

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,760
You need to learn how to play

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,240
imitating the opponent's playing style

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,040
and be their training partners.

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Fifty yuan a day won't let Mr. Chang spend it for nothing.

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
Anyway,

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,000
life is

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,840
is hard.

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
We can make it to the final.

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Go!

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,160
Come on.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's eat.

67
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,160
This is mine.

68
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,520
Don't take it from me.

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Let's eat.

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,520
Don't grab.

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,640
Me too.

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,240
Eat it while it's hot.

73
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,760
Shengyang.

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
Your dad made you nutritious breakfast.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,460
We're celebrating your passing.

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,440
Eat up.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,720
Sheng Yang.

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
Have a bite.

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,120
I already ate.

80
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
You guys eat.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,560
It's been so long.

82
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
You should let it go.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,970
It's not you.

84
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160
Of course you can.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Do you think I'll feel better?

86
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,810
I have a competition tomorrow.

87
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you sure about this?

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,080
It affects my mood.

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
Okay.

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,760
I'll eat everything you cook.

91
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
You can eat him.

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,000
Hello, everyone.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,660
I'm Yan'an.

94
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Welcome to the 17th

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
[the 17th Middle School Table Tennis Tournament.]

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
The commentator seat

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,400
[Today,]

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,720
The list of players

99
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,600
of the top 32.

100
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
Congratulations to Xia Fan Xing from Xinde High School

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,370
will enter the top 32 of the men's singles respectively.

102
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,240
It's going to be the key game between 32 to 16.

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
Let's cheer for them.

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,080
OK?

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,760
OK.

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,520
Star, come on!

107
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,640
[Two dark horses]

108
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,920
two dark horses appeared.

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
They are

110
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,680
from Xinde High School.

111
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,280
of Xinde High School

112
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,340
Let's go! Let's go!

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Nice shot!

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,600
[Xinde High School's best result]

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
in the previous high school

116
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,080
is to stop the top 64.

117
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,760
Before this competition,

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,760
Xinde High School

119
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,520
[I wanted to]

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,280
give up this competition.

121
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
to participate in this competition

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,800
because of their persistence,

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
they won

124
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
for myself.

125
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,159
It proves that

126
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,920
they didn't

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,880
of Xinde.

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,200
Xia.

129
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,860
Have a bite.

130
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,800
Look! Another one!

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,440
Good boy.

132
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,640
Xia.

133
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,360
They use their tenacity and superb skills

134
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,840
[with their tenacity and skills]

135
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,000
[He successfully entered the Final of the National High School Table Tennis Tournament.]

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,080
[will compete with Zheng Ying Ting and Xin Mei Tong of Qingyang High School.]

137
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,140
Congratulations.

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
Oh, my. Oh, my.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,680
This is...

140
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,159
Mr. Chang.

141
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,720
Your little losers

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,120
are quite lucky.

143
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,440
I got into the final.

144
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,840
Are you crazy?

145
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,880
Chang Pil Sheng.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,600
Sun Wei.

147
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,760
You can call me a loser.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
but you can't say my child is a loser.

149
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,400
If I hear it again,

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll press your head into the pool.

151
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,640
It’s just the final.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Chang Pil Sheng, why are you so arrogant?

153
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,620
You can defeat my students first.

154
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
Mr. Sun.

155
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,860
You've made a big mistake.

156
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
My student's enemy

157
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,600
is not your students,

158
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,600
but themselves.

159
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,440
It's them.

160
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,240
Look at you.

161
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:33,200
Champion.

162
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,880
Thank you for your kindness.

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
But don't put so much pressure on us.

164
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,240
Let's enjoy the game.

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,720
You two represent Xinde High School.

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
How can you just enjoy yourselves?

167
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
Yeah, so irresponsible.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
How selfish.

169
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
You promised us to take off our school hats.

170
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
You can't break your promise.

171
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,760
Yes.

172
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,240
Come on. Come on.

173
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
Don't worry.

174
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,440
We will win the championship for you.

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,760
Come on.

176
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,720
Go away.

177
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,240
Hurry up.

178
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm cutting the video.

179
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

180
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,540
Look at this. Look at this.

181
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,840
Relax.

182
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,520
Come on.

183
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
Remember,

184
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,570
You are yourself first.

185
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,960
and then others.

186
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,410
What do you mean?

187
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,660
What about you?

188
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,160
First, Xia Fan Xing,

189
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,960
and then Xinde School.

190
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,520
So?

191
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

192
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,480
Just relax.

193
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,600
Shengyang is right.

194
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,880
Do our best and leave it to fate.

195
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
We can only do what we can.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
As for the result,

197
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,160
it's up to God

198
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Right, Tangtang?

199
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,760
Yes.

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Star.

201
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
Just ignore them.

202
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,480
They've been malnourished since young.

203
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
They can't say anything nutritious.

204
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
Yeah.

205
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
You've entered the finals.

206
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
So many schools and opponents.

207
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
You've made it to the final.

208
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,800
What else do you have to worry about?

209
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,160
I've studied it.

210
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,240
Xin Meitong and Zheng Cherry

211
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,120
have changed their way of playing this year.

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
We need to adjust it quickly.

213
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,020
Come on.

214
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,960
Let's take a break.

215
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,680
Come on.

216
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,400
Stars

217
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm fine.

218
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
Now we're watching

219
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
[of the 17th City Middle School Table Tennis Tournament.]

220
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
[Women's Singles Singles Final.]

221
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Today's match is divided into two games in the afternoon.

222
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,040
The final of men's singles.

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,700
Zheng Ying Ting from Qingyang High School versus Shengyang from Xinde High School.

224
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,840
Shengyang.

225
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,840
Sheng Yang. Come on.

226
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
In the competition,

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,880
pay attention to your manners.

228
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
We represent Xinde High School.

229
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,960
Stop screaming.

230
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,720
It's a joke.

231
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,320
Do you hear me?

232
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,720
Got it.

233
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,240
[Shengyang, Second Round: No.1, Second Round: No.3, Second Round: No.3, Second Round: No.3, Second Round: No.3, Second Round: No.1, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.3, No.

234
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,920
Friendship first.

235
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
Competition number two.

236
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
Show the style of Xinde.

237
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,360
Okay.

238
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Did you hear him?

239
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,520
Principal.

240
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Who is that?

241
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
No.

242
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,100
Ask your fans to pay attention to their quality.

243
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,400
It's okay. I'll talk to him later.

244
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,480
Shengyang.

245
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,360
Hit him like this.

246
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Hit him.

247
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,160
Principal

248
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,040
Watch your manners.

249
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Watch your manners.

250
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,760
Nice shot!

251
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,960
Nice shot!

252
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,720
Nice!

253
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,760
Well done!

254
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,760
Shengyang. Shengyang is the strongest.

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
Shengyang.

256
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
The strongest surface.

257
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,400
Shengyang.

258
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,880
Listen.

259
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,280
Don't be affected by the outside world.

260
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,140
Especially...

261
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,040
That one.

262
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
our fans.

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Shengyang.

264
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,220
Our principal.

265
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Don't be influenced by him.

266
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,720
Come on.

267
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,380
Shengyang.

268
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,360
Principal.

269
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,720
Don’t scream in the competition later.

270
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,000
It will affect the competition in Shengyang.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,600
Like this.

272
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,200
Okay.

273
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Okay. Okay. Okay.

274
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,400
Well...

275
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,480
Later,

276
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
Pay attention to the sound.

277
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,840
Well...

278
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,560
Which class?

279
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
If you scream again,

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,680
Which class?

281
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,340
Don't take the flag next week.

282
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,480
Nice shot!

283
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
Yes!

284
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,480
Good!

285
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,160
Nice shot!

286
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Nice shot!

287
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,490
Let's do it! Let's do it!

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,440
Nice shot.

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Now let’s see Shengyang’s serve.

290
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,160
Nice serve!

291
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,720
After Shengyang serves,

292
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,650
[Shouting down from side to side.]

293
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,120
This ball is also amazing.

294
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,640
In such a critical score,

295
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Shengyang is also

296
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,840
Very bold.

297
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
using this.

298
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,130
tactics.

299
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,120
It's a very intense game today. Let's go.

300
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,640
intense.

301
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
Very anxious

302
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,500
Now let's see Jung Young-jeong's serve.

303
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,320
High school table tennis.

304
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,880
High school table tennis.

305
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,080
He learned ping pong.

306
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,960
Is he a fool?

307
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,359
Silly

308
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,720
Jung Young-jeong's ball is also very interesting

309
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,400
I want to imitate it.

310
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,480
Shengyang scored just now.

311
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,280
But

312
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,359
What a pity.

313
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
The ball made a mistake.

314
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,359
In the competition,

315
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,079
it's not just about the skills of two people.

316
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,599
but also the pressure resistance at critical moments.

317
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
and decisive.

318
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
Now the big score is two to zero.

319
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,560
Shengyang is leading.

320
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you doing?

321
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you here to play basketball?

322
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
not to show off.

323
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
Play well.

324
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,600
If we win another round,

325
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
we'll be the champion.

326
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Come on.

327
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,720
Come on.

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,520
Come on!

329
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,680
Come on.

330
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,960
Steady.

331
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,840
Ready. Ready. Ready.

332
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,240
Nice shot!

333
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,560
Nice shot!

334
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,600
It's okay.

335
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,850
Just do it like this.

336
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,400
Maybe I saw Shengyang

337
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
I was a little distracted.

338
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,560
the following wins

339
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,000
will affect his overall state.

340
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,720
So sometimes,

341
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,840
athletes should

342
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
in the game.

343
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,960
I don’t know what happened

344
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,080
what happened in Shengyang.

345
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:08,720
Coach.

346
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,360
I hope he can adjust himself as soon as possible

347
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,600
to avoid continuous losing points.

348
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,660
As we can see, we're at Jung Young-jeong's party point.

349
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
OK

350
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,080
The big score is two to one.

351
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,410
Jung Young-jeong wins.

352
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,400
It's okay.

353
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,840
Did you

354
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,520
didn't rest well

355
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:26,920
or something.

356
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,600
What's wrong?

357
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,240
I’m tired.

358
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,160
While Shengyang is not in good condition,

359
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,840
kill the ball quickly.

360
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,600
Take this game.

361
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,760
Don't delay.

362
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Adjust yourself.

363
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
We're still in the lead

364
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
we are still in the lead.

365
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,960
Come on.

366
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
It's okay.

367
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,520
Focus.

368
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Shuangxi.

369
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,040
Shuangxi! Shuangxi!

370
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,440
What's wrong with him?

371
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,840
Uncle.

372
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,290
Where are you going?

373
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
I’m affecting Shengyang.

374
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,040
I’d better go back.

375
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Big score.

376
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
Two to two.

377
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,920
Zheng Yingting wins.

378
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,520
It’s OK, Shengyang.

379
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,280
Focus.

380
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
Pull your attention back.

381
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
Wake up.

382
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,260
Don't be confused.

383
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,720
Good job.

384
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,640
Let's pull him back

385
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Pull him back.

386
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,480
Pull yourself back.

387
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,400
OK?

388
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,860
We still have a chance to turn things around.

389
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,600
Come on.

390
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,200
Uncle.

391
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,240
Come with me.

392
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,880
Forget it.

393
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,440
I won't watch it.

394
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,080
Uncle.

395
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,760
Let me take you somewhere.

396
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,020
You can watch the game.

397
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,440
Besides,

398
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
We won’t be found in Shengyang. Let’s go.

399
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,960
Let’s go.

400
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,400
Both of them did a great job today.

401
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,680
The competition is very fierce.

402
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,840
to the final round.

403
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,900
in the final round.

404
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,240
Now it's five-point change.

405
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,600
Let's see the performance

406
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,380
after changing the venue.

407
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,600
Nice shot!

408
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,120
We're not gonna get caught, are we?

409
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,760
It's okay.

410
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,520
Who knows which team we are on?

411
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,320
Right?

412
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,120
It's okay.

413
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,160
Why are you looking at us?

414
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
Mind your grade.

415
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
I know you guys.

416
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,860
Watch the ball.

417
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,720
Unfortunately,

418
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,160
Shengyang missed it.

419
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,760
Hit him! Hit him!

420
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,440
Win! Win! Win!

421
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,120
The commentator

422
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,480
Now we're at Jung Young-jeong's match point.

423
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,240
The commentator

424
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,600
The game is over.

425
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:45,960
The commentator competition.

426
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,920
Let's see if we can get the next point.

427
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,240
in the next point.

428
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,370
Now it's Jung Young-jeong's serve

429
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
Wipe the ball

430
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,280
No.

431
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,080
The eaves.

432
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,410
The referee is the roof.

433
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,000
The roof.

434
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,440
Down

435
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,880
Look up

436
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,360
Let's see

437
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,040
Who will win?

438
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
The referee is...

439
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,560
Just now,

440
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,720
very clearly.

441
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,760
He hit the eaves.

442
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,440
All of us are looking at the roof.

443
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,920
The roof.

444
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,400
The roof.

445
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,930
Referee.

446
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,680
I want the Eagle Eye to play back.

447
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,800
I am Hawkeye.

448
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
Please leave the venue now.

449
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,280
Or you will be disqualified

450
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,740
all your qualifications.

451
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,080
You're amazing.

452
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
So what?

453
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,400
Winning is the way.

454
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,320
Look at you.

455
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,640
We don't have this replay

456
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
This technology.

457
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,200
So,

458
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,880
the score of this ball depends on the referee.

459
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,800
I announce

460
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,080
The game is over. Let’s go. Let’s go.

461
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,410
Jung Young-jeong wins!

462
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,200
League.

463
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,840
We won.

464
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,880
Good job.

465
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,920
Shengyang.

466
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,480
Bandit Yang.

467
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Chengyang.

468
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,640
Shengyang.

469
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,440
The teacher lost.

470
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,240
It's okay.

471
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,940
Let's go. Let's go.

472
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,800
It's okay.

473
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,800
Cheer.

474
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,320
It's not for the champion.

475
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
It’s your exclusive.

476
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,760
Shengyang.

477
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Since...

478
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Shengyang.

479
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,840
I'm here. I'm here.

480
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,160
Shengyang.

481
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,640
Are they stupid?

482
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Why are you so happy?

483
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,840
A group of losers.

484
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Q's spirit.

485
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,640
Ignore them.

486
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,680
Meitong.

487
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,040
It’s your turn.

488
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,360
You're my pride.

489
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,490
Don't embarrass me.

490
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,480
Sir.

491
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,320
Okay.

492
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,560
I'll get you a champion trophy.

493
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,120
Don't underestimate your enemy.

494
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,880
Okay.

495
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Good luck.

496
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,760
You played

497
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,840
Great.

498
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,480
Grandpa, I think

499
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,360
It's fun.

500
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,440
Just a runner-up.

501
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,200
So what?

502
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
There are so many people in the world.

503
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,240
no matter what they do,

504
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
I can be the second.

505
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,400
That's amazing.

506
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,080
Let's hurry.

507
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,450
I suddenly have a stomachache.

508
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,040
Grandpa, slow down.

509
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,800
Grandpa.

510
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Are you his family?

511
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,720
No.

512
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
His daughter and son-in-law are out of town.

513
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,640
Only his granddaughter is on the court.

514
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,880
Inform his family.

515
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,160
Don't tell Star.

516
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,960
Please.

517
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,920
This is

518
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,280
It's her dream.

519
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm fine.

520
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,680
Don't tell the stars.

521
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,040
Please.

522
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,570
[This is her dream.]

523
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,880
It's her dream.
