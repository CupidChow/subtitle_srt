1
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,960
Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,930
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,180
You used a month to compare me to Xia Fan Xing.

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,120
You clearly want me to be her training partner.

5
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
You can quit if you don't like it.

6
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
You're so arrogant.

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,520
You can leave if you don’t like it.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,039
Shengyang, don’t go too far.

9
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,400
You don’t like it?

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,520
I like it.

11
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,490
What do you like? Are you crazy?

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,000
The more arrogant you are,

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
When I defeat you in the future,

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,660
the more I feel accomplished.

15
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,240
I hope you have a chance to compete with me.

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,080
Stop, I haven't finished yet.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Just say it.

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,400
I haven't eaten yet.

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,760
Me too.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
Then go eat.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
I want to eat with you.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
What?

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,760
I want to move in with you.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,960
You want me to be Xia Fan Xing's training partner?

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't afford to spend my own money.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,520
My house is different from Yoo Manxin’s.

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,760
I live with my dad.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,180
Aren't you afraid of embarrassment?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,360
I don't mind.

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,010
I've never seen anyone with numb legs.

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,680
Self...

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Sheng Yang.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
What a lame leg.

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
Luo Qing

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,840
Why isn't she back yet?

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,480
It's nothing.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Since you are classmates,

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,760
you must be good friends too.

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,160
If good friends are in trouble,

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,490
we must help each other.

41
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,680
Young people don't know much

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,040
If the house is decorated,

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
formaldehyde will hurt people.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,480
You can stay here.

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,160
I cook for you every day.

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Although this dish is really ordinary.

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
In the past,

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,170
when his mother was around.

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
Come on.

50
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Have some meat.

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,690
You're welcome.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Thank you, uncle.

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,680
I won't change.

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,760
The green water flows forever.

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,440
In the future,

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,480
if you need me,

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,960
just let me know.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
Go to Weihai.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
and set fire.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
I'll do anything.

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,160
You scared me.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,040
You...

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,880
Have a seat.

64
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,480
Let's eat.

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,410
You're welcome.

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Make yourself at home.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,610
Okay.

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
Thank you.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's eat.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,019
By the way, Shengyang,

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,079
after we finish,

72
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
you go to Liu Manxin’s house with me.

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
That’s too much.

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm Xia Fan Xing's training partner now.

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,800
Who is Xia Fan Xing?

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,400
My son's classmate.

77
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,400
Hands off.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Get off.

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,840
Go up by yourself.

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,620
I'll wait for you downstairs.

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,640
But how can I tell him?

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,560
Tell him the truth.

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
You don't understand.

84
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
After all, I've lived with him for so long.

85
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
I really can't say it.

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Don't waste time.

87
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,600
No, I'm not.

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
Whatever.

89
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
Why are you back so late?

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,290
I came back to pack my stuff.

91
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,720
Why are you packing?

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
I'm going to leave here.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you going back to Taiwan?

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
No.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,530
I've found someone who can take me in for free.

96
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,440
Luo Qing, what's wrong?

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
We were fine two days ago.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,600
Why did you suddenly leave?

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Liu Manxin.

100
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
I’m sorry.

101
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,200
I don't want to hear you say sorry.

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
Did I do something wrong?

103
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,440
I can change.

104
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Luo Qing.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,480
Am I too strict with you?

106
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
How about this?

107
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,720
Come back whenever you want.

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
You can go to the bathroom

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
or use the bathroom.

110
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,560
It's already like this

111
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
Let me ask you.

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,850
I want to live in your house.

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
Can you not pay?

114
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,440
is my bottom line.

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Luo Qing,

116
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,640
Are you sure?

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,140
If you leave this door,

118
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
don't ever come back.

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,440
Forget it.

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,080
There are things

121
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,960
can't be forced.

122
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,760
I made it clear.

123
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,680
Let's go.

124
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,170
Today we're talking about Li Qingzhao's slow voice.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
Looking

126
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
and lonely.

127
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,160
and miserable.

128
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,640
Looking for the meaning

129
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,360
He was very lonely and hesitant.

130
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
and lost.

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,840
and miserable.

132
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Sad and sad

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,920
It's hard to rest when it's still warm

134
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
Tangtang.

135
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,380
Liu Manxin, what's wrong?

136
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,960
It feels like he’s lost his soul.

137
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,420
He can't be like this even if he lost his soul.

138
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,240
I think he lost money.

139
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
Lost money?

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,480
So what?

141
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,080
It's mainly because of her death after she went south.

142
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,400
I've never seen him like this.

143
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Xia Fan Xing.

144
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,880
Tangtang.

145
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,610
What are you whispering about?

146
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,000
You like talking so much.

147
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,960
Come forward.

148
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
Come on.

149
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,180
I'll give you this chance.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,410
What are you looking at?

151
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
Come up now.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,080
Share the content

153
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,840
with everyone.

154
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,840
Hurry up.

155
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Walk a few steps

156
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
Tangtang

157
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,840
Let's start.

158
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,840
What's wrong with Liu Manxin?

159
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,800
Why are you

160
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,440
lost his soul?

161
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,850
You can't do that even if you've lost your soul

162
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Louder.

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
What's wrong with Liu Manxin?

164
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,480
You look like you lost your soul.

165
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
I don't know.

166
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
You can't do this even if you lose your soul.

167
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,560
I think he lost money.

168
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,640
Liu Manxin.

169
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,980
Tell me what happened.

170
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,360
He stole my tenant.

171
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,760
Is he talking about Shengyang?

172
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,160
Just because of Luo Qing going to Shengyang?

173
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,880
Luo Qing will stay in Shengyang for free.

174
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,740
to save a lot of money for Luo Qing.

175
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
He's trying to steal the opportunity.

176
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,160
Where did you learn so many dirty words?

177
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
Luo Qing is my new client.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,280
But Shengyang took her away.

179
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,480
Does it make sense?

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,240
Shengyang is just to help him.

181
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,840
Recently, because of Luo Qing,

182
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,560
because of Luo Qing.

183
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,480
Shengyang, please let me have Luo Qing.

184
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
Please.

185
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,730
He insisted on staying at my place.

186
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
If he wants to live with you, you should let him stay.

187
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,360
Why are you so casual?

188
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,680
He's training with Xia Fan Xing.

189
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll help him if he's in trouble.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,860
Will you help me if I'm in trouble?

191
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
Isn't his problem money?

192
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,800
I have no money.

193
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,210
I'll stay at your place too.

194
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Are you sure?

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
sleep like this tonight?

196
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,480
If it's too crowded, you can sleep at my place.

197
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
I can give you 20% off.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,080
It's okay.

199
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,520
It's more comfortable to sleep like this

200
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,080
Sure, I'll sleep like this.

201
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,760
Okay.

202
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
Do I really have no chance?

203
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
Xin.

204
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,880
Let bygones be bygones.

205
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Qing,

206
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,440
Tell me if I did anything wrong.

207
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,680
I can change.

208
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,760
Go back with me.

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
I can’t live without you.

210
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,880
Liu Manxin.

211
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Why are you talking to me in Taiwanese?

212
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,680
Because I want you to feel kind.

213
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,520
That's how you feel at home.

214
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,000
That's not an ordinary house.

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
That's home.

216
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,680
Who pays 100 yuan a day?

217
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,360
Haven't you heard of

218
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
A good family needs business.

219
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,760
You're talking about real money, right?

220
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,680
Alright.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
Xin,

222
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,040
Please stop pestering me, okay?

223
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,360
We're not

224
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,240
the relationship between the tenant and the landlord.

225
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
We're over.

226
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,920
It's over.

227
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Ching.

228
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,560
You can't be so heartless.

229
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
I'm heartless?

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,040
You're the one who's being unreasonable.

231
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,840
Qing,

232
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Come back with me.

233
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,840
Let's pretend nothing happened.

234
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
I'll be good to you.

235
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,160
Don't do this.

236
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,960
It's impossible.

237
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,680
Come on.

238
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Stop arguing.

239
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,780
You have school tomorrow.

240
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,720
Get out of here if you keep making noises.

241
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
Who farted?

242
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
It’s him.

243
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,780
Liu Manxin’s home.

244
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,320
Do you need money?

245
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,080
Liu Manxin.

246
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,920
He said his parents work in another city.

247
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,160
He never told us anything else.

248
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,680
He seems reluctant to tell us about his family.

249
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,520
Is he really sleepy?

250
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,290
A super sleepy student.

251
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,360
You are so smart.

252
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,040
Shengyang.

253
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,880
Why didn't I think of that before?

254
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,520
We can apply for him.

255
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,380
In this way,

256
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
he can relieve his burden.

257
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,280
Right?

258
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,770
Go find the teacher.

259
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,520
Let's go.

260
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Let’s go.

261
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,840
About Liu Manxin’s family,

262
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,700
They specifically told me

263
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
it's their family business.

264
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,560
Sir.

265
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Liu Manxin.

266
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,480
It should meet the requirements of particularly sleepy students.

267
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
Can I apply?

268
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,480
Yes.

269
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,080
The school should

270
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,160
take special care of Liu Manxin.

271
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,080
I told you not to worry.

272
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,680
If you have time,

273
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,240
do more tests.

274
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:33,960
Me?

275
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,560
There are a few sets.

276
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,280
You three

277
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,320
Do it.

278
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,200
It's all your fault.

279
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Do you deserve it?

280
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm cheap.

281
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Mr. Zhang.

282
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,440
Mr. Chang.

283
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,290
I'm here to pick someone up.

284
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,760
Come in.

285
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,650
Luo Qing, right?

286
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,160
It's me.

287
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,920
Come on.

288
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,240
Luo Qing.

289
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,280
I am

290
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,780
Xia Fan Xing and Sheng Yang's PE teacher.

291
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,800
My name is Chang Pil Sheng.

292
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,000
Just call me Mr. Chang.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,880
Mr. Chang.

294
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,840
I heard them say

295
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,680
you're good at ping-pong.

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
Compared to the world champion,

297
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,800
it's still a little far.

298
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,360
Gosh.

299
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
You're quite arrogant.

300
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
If he's not crazy, he'll be wasted.

301
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
I also heard that

302
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,720
Did you lose to Shengyang?

303
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,840
Let me tell you.

304
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,160
winning or losing

305
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,840
is a must for a soldier.

306
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,810
Oh my!

307
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,600
Kid.

308
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,520
What's wrong?

309
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,620
You have congenital disease.

310
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
You can't play ping-pong.

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,860
I can't take the responsibility.

312
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm fine.

313
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,720
Oh you're fine

314
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,360
You scared me.

315
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
Let me continue.

316
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,880
There's no problem

317
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
is not a problem.

318
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,640
But

319
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
don't take it too seriously.

320
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,760
This is bad.

321
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,610
This was found in Yu Manxin’s desk.

322
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,000
What?

323
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,720
What is it?

324
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,120
He wants to donate sperm.

325
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,600
I heard that

326
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,000
70 percent of college students

327
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
70% is not qualified.

328
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
So you mean

329
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
the responsibility of donating sperm

330
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
for donating sperm.

331
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,320
Shengyang.

332
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
Take care of yourself.

333
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,880
From now on,

334
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,440
will be on you.

335
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,440
It says he needs to be 18 years old.

336
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,120
He's so poor that he needs to donate sperm.

337
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,240
No.

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,120
We still need to help him apply for sleepy students.

339
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,720
We'll go to his house tonight

340
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
and take some photos.

341
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,800
and keep the evidence

342
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,960
while he's not around.

343
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,290
and apply to the school.

344
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,960
You two go together.

345
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
has nothing to do with me.

346
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,680
Fine.

347
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,400
If you don't go,

348
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
He's staying at your place tonight?

349
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,300
Right away.

350
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,080
Wait.

351
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
Why is he here?

352
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,240
Is he here to work?

353
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,000
He's a thrifty worker.

354
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,280
It's not easy.

355
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,600
Let's go.

356
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,920
Let's buy some mop.

357
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,980
and water buckets.

358
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,760
I can help him with some work.

359
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,220
He gets off work early.

360
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,320
Okay.

361
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,640
Here we go. Here we go.

362
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,400
Oh.

363
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,200
Why are you here?

364
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,720
We're here to help you.

365
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,320
Surprise.

366
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,960
Where should I start?

367
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,200
Don't say I owe you anything after today.

368
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,680
I've never done housework at home.

369
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,840
You're lucky today.

370
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,200
Tangtang.

371
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,120
Let's clean the furniture.

372
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,760
You...

373
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,880
Go over there.

374
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,200
Stop sweeping.

375
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,920
Stars

376
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,980
What are you doing?

377
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,600
We'll help you clean.

378
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,880
Then you can get off work early.

379
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes.

380
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,920
Liu Manxin.

381
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
You can tell us

382
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,040
you can tell us.

383
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,080
Liu Manxin.

384
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
You have a good relationship with the employer.

385
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,580
They all have your photos.

386
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,760
Isn't this

387
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Uncle Liu?

388
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,040
Yoo Manxin.

389
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,370
Why do you put your family photo in someone else’s house?

390
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,720
That's not good.

391
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,290
There's only one possibility.

392
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,360
This is...

393
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,800
Yoo Manxin’s home.

394
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,120
Isn’t your dad working at a construction site?

395
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,760
Your dad works at a construction site.

396
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
and lives in such a big house.

397
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,920
and these drawings.

398
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,800
Your dad is...

399
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,960
Mr. Bao.

400
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,400
Your dad is a bald man.

401
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,560
Your dad is bald.

402
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,880
Your dad is Baldy Qiang.

403
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Your dad is the second one.

404
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,280
My dad is a contractor.

405
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,800
And...

406
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,120
Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone.

407
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,580
Don't reveal your wealth.

408
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Then why did you donate the sperm?

409
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,280
Who donated sperm?

410
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
Stop pretending.

411
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,880
In your drawer,

412
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,040
in your drawer.

413
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,240
donation leaflets.

414
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,200
You're going to donate your life.

415
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
What?

416
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,560
I picked that up.

417
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,920
as a draft paper.

418
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,240
Are you crazy?

419
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Liu Manxin.

420
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,680
Why are you hiding these from us?

421
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,240
If everyone knows my family is rich,

422
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,920
this guy borrowed money from me today.

423
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,160
The one who asked me to buy tomorrow.

424
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
Do you think I'll lend it or not?

425
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,400
Will you?

426
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,600
My dad told me

427
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,000
to make a fortune in silence.

428
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,460
Don't reveal your wealth.

429
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,860
Even if you don't want others to know about your family,

430
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,650
your family is already so rich.

431
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,760
Why do you always think about making money?

432
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,680
My dad told me

433
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,880
River God took out a golden axe from the sea

434
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,840
A silver axe and a iron axe.

435
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Tell me.

436
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,080
which axe is yours?

437
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,080
If you say

438
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,560
it's all mine.

439
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,640
If I didn't throw the iron ax into the sea,

440
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,280
I wouldn't have caught them.

441
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,280
The Axe is my investment capital.

442
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,600
Axe and silver ax

443
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,560
are my profit.

444
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,480
What if River God doesn't give it to me?

445
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
Then give him the silver ax.

446
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,640
You helped him.

447
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,200
You can't help him. You can't help him.

448
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,640
Anyway,

449
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
you can make money

450
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,200
you can make money.

451
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,480
Remember, son.

452
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,920
Go.

453
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
Think about it.

454
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,360
If you two get married,

455
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,920
the betrothal gifts will be a huge expense.

456
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
If he gives birth,

457
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,840
we should find him a good school.

458
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
Think about you two.

459
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,600
What if you get sick

460
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,000
and get sick,

461
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,800
I lost all my money.

462
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,560
If we don't work hard,

463
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,960
we can't live happily.

464
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,920
Uncle Liu.

465
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,320
I only taught you how to make money,

466
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,380
but I didn't teach you how to be happy.

467
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,130
That’s called poor happiness.

468
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,240
Liu Manxin.

469
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,840
I had no money.

470
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,320
If you're not happy,

471
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,330
Then there's nothing left.

472
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,040
Follow me.

473
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Look at Tangtang

474
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,320
Her happiness

475
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
and how much money

476
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,000
with the amount of money?

477
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,800
Tangtang is an exception.

478
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,930
Who would be so happy just because of eating some skewers

479
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
Come on.

480
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,560
I have one yuan.

481
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,720
I have two yuan.

482
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
I have no money to eat with you.

483
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,200
Landlady

484
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,060
I want skewers.

485
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,120
Okay.

486
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,400
Be careful, it's hot.

487
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,280
Thank you.

488
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,640
It's delicious. Thank you.

489
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,000
Kid.

490
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,920
No.

491
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,610
Look at Luo Qing.

492
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,400
Look.

493
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,610
He'll be happy if he has ping-pong.

494
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,720
How can he be happy?

495
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm happy when I see a fool.

496
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,440
Don't look at me.

497
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I'm not stupid to look at him.

498
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,440
What else?

499
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,120
Look.

500
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,520
Have one.

501
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,440
And there.

502
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Look.

503
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,320
Let's drink.

504
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,320
Have a sip.

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,760
Are you done?

506
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,840
I can post it on my Moments.

507
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,000
Eat more.

508
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,840
Liu Manxin.

509
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,560
There are so many classes

510
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,960
in our life.

511
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,850
We have to learn how to take the exam

512
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,240
how to work,

513
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
and how to make money.

514
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,160
and how to be a human.

515
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,540
There are so many things to learn.

516
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,120
But only one class

517
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,280
that we didn't pay attention to.

518
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,880
That is

519
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,680
how to be happy.

520
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,320
The sooner

521
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,920
the sooner you will.

522
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,200
The better life is.

523
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,520
If you learn this lesson,

524
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,640
you'll be happy with ten yuan.

525
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
100 yuan will make you happy.

526
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,680
You'll be happy when you're ten.

527
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
50 years old

528
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
when you're 50.

529
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
I hope you learn

530
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Happy lesson.

531
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,880
Cheers.

532
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
I've heard of cheers

533
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,250
I've never heard of skewers

534
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
It's like life.

535
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
Every paragraph

536
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
is like every step of life.

537
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,560
Dried skewers.

538
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,000
Well said.

539
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,000
To life.

540
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,760
Cheers.

541
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,400
Wish us all learn to be happy.

542
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,040
and be happy.

543
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,600
Brother and sister.

544
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,680
Grandpa and Grandma

545
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,320
Brother.

546
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,480
You can wish my best friend

547
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,120
my best friend

548
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,040
Be happy.

549
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,520
Happy.

550
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,520
Wow.

551
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,970
What does this mean?

552
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,520
Our school

553
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
[won't]

554
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,000
[I won't participate in the High School Table Tennis Tournament.]

555
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,960
What?

556
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,760
What do you mean?
