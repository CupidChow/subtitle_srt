1
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,240
Good morning.

2
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
Fanxing,

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,240
have some milk tea.

4
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,920
Xia Fanxing,

5
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,850
have some candy.

6
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,400
Dong Chaolin.

7
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,440
Wait for me,

8
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,880
Dong Chaolin.

9
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you blind?

10
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,840
I didn't do it on purpose.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,759
So that makes it okay?

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,970
Then I'll apologize to you.

13
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,000
If apologies were useful,

15
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
why would we need police?

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,479
What do you want then?

17
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,960
What do I want?

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,980
What are you doing?

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Let go!

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,320
Hey you!

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,600
Which class are you from?

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,130
Why are you hitting people?

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Isn't this our ping-pong club's big hero?

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,560
What's going on?

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,240
Is insulting people also under your ping-pong club's jurisdiction?

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
Of course.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm now a discipline committee member.

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,680
I have to intervene when you hit and insult people.

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
Which class are you from?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why do you care which class I'm from?

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
You should

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,840
just mind your ping-pong club.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,640
Don't you walk away.

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
Tell me which class you're from.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
Let go!

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
Or I'll hit you!

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,760
Let go.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,280
I won't.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,600
Zhang Peng.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
Zhang Peng.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,040
Chu Yu.

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Classmate Chu Yu.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,200
You're something else.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,160
Why are you bullying classmates again?

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,120
No, no.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,880
We were just fooling around.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,600
Please.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,080
Please don't tell my homeroom teacher.

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,880
If my homeroom teacher finds out,

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm done for.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Since this is your first offense,

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
I'll give you a chance to mend your ways.

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,500
Be more careful next time.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,160
If it happens again,

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
I won't let you off so easily.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,360
It won't happen again.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
There definitely won't be a next time.

58
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
I'll be going now.

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm leaving.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Fanxing,

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,120
your current problem

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
is quite serious.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,240
What's wrong with me?

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
You're too nice.

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
You can easily be taken advantage of.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,480
How can you maintain school discipline like this?

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm quite authoritative.

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
As your good friend,

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,780
I'll teach you a trick.

70
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,160
You must.

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,880
When you punish him,

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,120
make sure the whole school knows about it.

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,160
This way,

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,560
everyone will know how formidable you are.

75
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,760
Isn't that too harsh?

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Why not start with someone you're close to?

77
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,440
First,

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,770
you won't feel awkward.

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
Second,

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
let everyone see that

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
you're putting principles above personal relationships,

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,280
being fair and strict.

83
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
Chuyu.

84
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,760
Aren't we supposed to

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,600
serve our fellow students?

86
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,600
Serve?

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,440
Once you make an example of someone

88
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,400
and establish your authority,

89
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,730
everyone will fear you.

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Then won't you be able to

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
better manage school discipline

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,080
and serve your fellow students?

93
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,580
Think about it.

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,440
Think carefully.

95
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
Tastes good.

96
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,360
I meant think about what I said.

97
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,000
How do we make an example of someone

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
by targeting those with good connections?

99
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Liu Manxin.

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,010
Yesterday I was looking in the lockers at the ping-pong club

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
and I saw Liu Manxin's.

102
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,520
Why would there be cigarettes in Liu Manxin's locker?

103
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,840
Liu Manxin.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,840
Since you dare to smoke,

105
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,160
don't blame me

106
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,200
for making an example of you.

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,200
Liu Manxin

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,690
Where are you going?

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,420
I'm going to the bathroom.

110
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
What would I do in the bathroom?

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,460
I'm going there to eat, of course.

112
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,680
Nothing good comes from bathroom trips in broad daylight.

113
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,720
I think you're heading to the bathroom.

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
Xia Fanxing

115
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,480
What are you doing?

116
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,340
Student council investigation.

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,130
Is anyone else in there?

118
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,480
I just saw Liu Manxin go in.

119
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,320
You're crazy.

120
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,960
Liu Manxin

121
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
come out.

122
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
Don't move.

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,090
What are you doing in there?

124
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
What do you think?

125
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,680
I suspect you're smoking.

126
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
I think you've lost your mind.

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,800
Come out.

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
What's this?

129
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
A cigarette pack.

130
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,080
I know that.

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm asking what this is doing here.

132
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
It's a cigarette pack.

133
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,040
I know.

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,370
Then why are you asking?

135
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
What I mean is,

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,320
why do you have a cigarette pack in your pocket?

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't you know students shouldn't smoke?

138
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Who's smoking?

139
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,050
I collect cigarette cards.

140
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,300
You really have nothing better to do.

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,040
I heard that collecting cigarette cards is very popular among elementary school students lately.

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,240
So I threw away all my dad's cigarettes,

143
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,800
made the empty packs into cigarette cards,

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,520
and planned to sell them to elementary school kids.

145
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,320
That's so many.

146
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
Liu Manxin.

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,400
Look,

148
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,640
even though you don't smoke,

149
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,679
these are still cigarette cards.

150
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,010
And cigarette cards...

151
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,159
You selling cigarette cards

152
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,840
just doesn't seem right to me.

153
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,320
It's not illegal.

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,039
Who says it's not illegal?

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Selling cigarette cards

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,440
not only violates the Tobacco Monopoly Law

157
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,040
but also the Trademark Law.

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,600
Selling them to elementary school students

159
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,640
also violates the Minor Protection Law.

160
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,360
Those children

161
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
who buy these cigarette cards

162
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,640
might get used to the tobacco smell

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,600
after frequent exposure,

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
and they could eventually

165
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,200
start smoking.

166
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,560
That's terrible, isn't it?

167
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,820
You want to become an excellent businessman in the future.

168
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,080
Shouldn't you have some

169
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,760
social responsibility

170
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,960
and accountability?

171
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,290
You can't just make money by any means.

172
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,690
What should I do with these?

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,130
For the sake of the children's future,

174
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,440
destroy them.

175
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
But this is all money.

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
Liu Manxin.

177
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,490
In ancient times, Lin Zexu destroyed opium at Humen.

178
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,360
Today, we have Liu Manxin.

179
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
New virtue.

180
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Destroy.

181
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,640
Cut!

182
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
If this gets out,

183
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,840
it would make quite a story.

184
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,010
Still haven't found the right person.

185
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,300
I need to try someone else.

186
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
Someone close to me.

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
Only Tangtang and Shengyang left.

188
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,680
What's wrong?

189
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,280
Passing love letters.

190
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,560
This Shengyang...

191
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,520
Could it be puppy love?

192
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,160
You, Shengyang,

193
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,570
how dare you have a premature romance!

194
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,240
I must

195
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,640
make an example of you.

196
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,300
What are you doing?

197
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,360
I...

198
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,460
Why are you going through my cabinet?

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,800
I wasn't going through your cabinet.

200
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,680
I just noticed it was a bit messy

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,770
and thought I'd help tidy it up.

202
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,120
Messy?

203
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,080
Yes.

204
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,680
This notebook

205
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,320
seems to

206
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
have something to do with me.

207
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,480
The competition is coming up soon.

208
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
I made training and recovery plans for you,

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
but this isn't the final version.

210
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,890
It will be adjusted based on your future training progress.

211
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,320
Oh, right.

212
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Just now,

213
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,280
when I went back to the table tennis club,

214
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,120
a student from Class 4, Grade 2 gave us a thank-you letter.

215
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,840
It was supposed to be delivered to the table tennis club,

216
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,800
but they happened to run into me and gave it to me.

217
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,080
A thank-you letter?

218
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,620
What are they thanking us for?

219
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
His sister was also a member of Xinde Table Tennis Club.

220
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,000
She was moved after watching our match against Qingyang.

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,600
She hopes we

222
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,080
will carry

223
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,600
the dreams of all Xinde Table Tennis Club members

224
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,660
and continue to bravely forge ahead.

225
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Come on!

226
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,040
Got it.

227
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
Find typical cases.

228
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,840
Liu Manxin.

229
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,840
Ziyi.

230
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Chengyang.

231
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Those who were close to me

232
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,000
only Tangtang is left.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,960
Tangtang,

234
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Things are getting tight around here lately.

236
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
We need to be careful.

237
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,360
Do we really need to be that careful?

238
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,880
My friend just became some kind of disciplinary committee member

239
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,960
and is acting crazy about it.

240
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,320
New officials always start with a bang.

241
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,360
It'll calm down in a few days.

242
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,160
Hurry up.

243
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,490
Did you bring the stuff?

244
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Cash on delivery.

245
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,360
Is the count right?

246
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,480
Five packs of gummy candy.

247
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,210
Why do you need so many candies?

248
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,080
Candy...

249
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,880
Don't blame me then.

250
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,090
Mind your own business.

251
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,560
Candy!

252
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,040
Zhang Peng!

253
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
Give it back to me!

254
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,080
Wow, candy!

255
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,280
You bought so many gummies.

256
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,810
Can you finish them all?

257
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,320
Let me eat one pack for you.

258
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,920
Give it back to me!

259
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,970
You little brat!

260
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,800
Fanxing.

261
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,440
Tangtang.

262
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,540
Which class are you in?

263
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,280
Which class are you from?

264
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
Fanxing.

265
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,880
He's Zhang Peng from Class 2, Grade 10.

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,330
Apologize to Tangtang.

267
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,640
What if I don't?

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,680
Well.

269
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,080
You stole snacks

270
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,210
and hit a classmate.

271
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,520
As the discipline monitor, I'll report this to the teacher

272
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,320
and the school administration.

273
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,360
You're asking for trouble, aren't you?

274
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,720
So you dare to beat up a discipline committee member?

275
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,650
I've finally found a perfect example of someone who disregards rules.

276
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
Discipline committee member.

277
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,440
What discipline committee member?

278
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
Ouch!

279
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,040
Ow!

280
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,440
You two just wait!

281
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,360
Fanxing,

282
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,560
you're amazing!

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,960
Tangtang.

284
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,080
Why did you buy so many candies?

285
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,640
Can you even finish them all?

286
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Aren't you afraid of cavities?

287
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,280
These aren't for eating.

288
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,160
Haven't you been under a lot of stress lately?

289
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,920
These are to help you relieve stress.

290
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,680
Here.

291
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,720
Just squeeze them like this when you feel tense.

292
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
How is it?

293
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,780
Feels good, right?

294
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,960
Chuyu

295
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,160
Vice President Lin

296
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,000
I need to tell you

297
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,080
I've caught someone red-handed today.

298
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,560
That person

299
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,600
completely disregards school rules.

300
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,530
We must give them

301
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,400
monthly punishment.

302
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,440
Fanxing,

303
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
calm down first.

304
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,120
Xiao Liu,

305
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,500
go order some milk tea.

306
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
The usual,

307
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,200
Energy Taotao,

308
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,760
Coconut Mochi Tiramisu Boba Milk Tea.

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,680
Get one for Xia Fanxing too.

310
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,410
Don't forget Monitor Zhang's.

311
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,400
Okay.

312
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,680
Does Student Xia have any dietary restrictions?

313
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,280
No green onions or cilantro.

314
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Got it.

315
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Chu Yu,

316
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
why aren't we eating

317
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,280
at the cafeteria today?

318
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,040
Why did we come to this bubble tea shop instead?

319
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,120
Today,

320
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,600
I wanted to introduce you to a classmate.

321
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,880
Classmate?

322
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Chu Yu.

323
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,839
What are you doing here?

324
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
Don't misunderstand.

325
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,839
Let me introduce you to each other.

326
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,560
This is

327
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,200
Xia Fanxing.

328
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,960
Class Monitor Zhang must have heard of her.

329
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,079
Of course I have.

330
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,099
She's our school's famous table tennis player.

331
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,880
It's an honor to meet you.

332
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,800
And this is

333
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
the monitor of Class 4,

334
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,160
Zhang Fei,

335
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,760
who is also

336
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,440
Zhang Peng's twin brother.

337
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,280
Have a seat.

338
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,720
Everyone,

339
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,780
let's sit and talk.

340
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,760
Xia,

341
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,760
um,

342
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,560
my brother was being immature

343
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,200
and had

344
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,260
a little misunderstanding with you.

345
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,760
I was thinking,

346
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,440
since we're all classmates,

347
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,720
you could let bygones be bygones

348
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,930
and not hold it against him.

349
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,480
Could you remove his name

350
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,520
from your

351
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,800
discipline record book?

352
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
Cross it out, please.

353
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,480
Why should I?

354
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,600
I don't care if you're Zhang Fei,

355
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,660
or even Li Kui, the answer is still no.

356
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,290
Zhang Fei has made many contributions

357
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,560
to our student council.

358
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,520
So what?

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Zhang Peng's issue is very serious.

360
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,920
Yes, yes, yes.

361
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,250
I completely agree with what Xia said.

362
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,040
Zhang Peng's behavior is unacceptable.

363
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,000
He has caused

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,730
some harm to our classmate Xia.

365
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,520
Fanxing,

366
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,840
that's enough.

367
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,880
We're all on the same team.

368
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,680
No need to be so serious about it.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Same team?

370
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
I am the discipline officer.

371
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,400
His brother has violated rules multiple times,

372
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
and each time it gets worse.

373
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,400
If we don't punish him severely, how can we face the other students?

374
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,120
Besides, we're supposed to serve all students.

375
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,840
He's not just any student.

376
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Chu Yu,

377
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
when you talk about serving students,

378
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
it's exactly for students like him.

379
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,880
Miss Xia,

380
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,840
please adjust your attitude.

381
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm resigning

382
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,660
as discipline committee member.

383
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,640
Xia hasn't had her milk tea yet.

384
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
Has everyone basically mastered

385
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,970
the vector method in plane geometry from today's class?

386
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,040
I'll find some practice problems later.

387
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,600
And have our math class representative

388
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
assign them to everyone.

389
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
Please take another careful look at the problem on the blackboard.

390
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,440
And take notes,

391
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,440
alright?

392
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,080
Fanxing.

393
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,480
Going to the store

394
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,520
to buy something?

395
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,000
I need to use the bathroom.

396
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,360
Fanxing seems to be

397
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,160
avoiding me lately.

398
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,880
Same here.

399
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
She runs away whenever I talk to her.

400
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,480
Fanxing,

401
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,940
Liu Manxin and Tangtang are looking for you.

402
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,840
Hmph.

403
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
Some discipline committee member she is.

404
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
She thinks she's so important,

405
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
but who cares about her?

406
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,480
Exactly.

407
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
Nobody takes her seriously.

408
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,640
Isn't this weird?

409
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,800
I yelled at Xia Fanxing in the ping-pong room a few days ago.

410
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,920
And guess what?

411
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
I've been tripping on the stairs for several days in a row.

412
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,880
Don't you know?

413
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,720
Xia Fanxing is protected by the senior goddess.

414
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,040
Anyone who goes against her

415
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,370
will face retribution.

416
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,120
I don't believe that.

417
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,000
I hit Xia Fanxing the other day

418
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,640
and nothing's happened to me yet.

419
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
Then you'd better be careful.

420
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,560
This is what happens when you offend Xia Fanxing.

421
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,880
Help me!

422
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,920
Help!

423
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,080
Headshot!

424
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
Save me!

425
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,680
Got him in the head!

426
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,480
Star Sister.

427
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,280
I'm sorry,

428
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,120
I was wrong.

429
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,200
Please,

430
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,680
please don't let senior blow up my head.

431
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,760
Xing.

432
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm sorry,

433
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,280
I was wrong.

434
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,560
I know I've

435
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,720
offended you before.

436
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,560
Please,

437
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,600
please don't let senior blow up my head, okay, Xing?

438
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,120
I'm sorry, Xing.

439
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

440
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,800
I was wrong, Xing.

441
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,840
I want to apologize

442
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,440
for what happened before.

443
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,760
Xia Fanxing,

445
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,240
you didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,760
We made mistakes.

447
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
You stopped us in time.

448
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,370
You did the right thing.

449
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
That's right.

450
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,680
And as a discipline committee member,

451
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,080
you're supposed to enforce rules fairly,

452
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,340
even if it means turning in your friends.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,680
But my motives weren't pure.

454
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,720
I caught you

455
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,800
just to establish my authority.

456
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,960
Let's practice basketball.

457
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm apologizing seriously.

458
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Let's talk after we finish playing.

459
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,480
Fanxing Xia.

460
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,320
Come here,

461
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,850
hurry up.

462
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,700
I've been looking forward to watching you play.

463
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,800
Fanxing.

464
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,880
Come on!

465
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,200
Fanxing.

466
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,760
When playing ball, you need to look forward.

467
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,960
Always looking back will only make you miss the next ball.

468
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
Let the past be the past,

469
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,000
okay?

470
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,600
Come on.

471
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,560
Hey!

472
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,120
Did you guys upset Mr. Chang recently?

473
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,780
Why do you say that?

474
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,080
What's wrong?

475
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
I just ran into Mr. Chang.

476
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,280
I asked him to come to the ping pong club.

477
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,920
I found SION.

478
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,180
He wasn't happy at all.

479
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Why not?

480
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
I have no idea.

481
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
He just said something like

482
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,760
they can manage without me.

483
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,820
They don't need me.

484
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh no.

485
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,880
I think I understand what's going on now.

486
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,480
The ping pong club's achievements

487
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,800
are inseparable from the PE teacher,

488
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Chang Bisheng's patient guidance.

489
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,320
He guides our training

490
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,440
and witnesses our growth.

491
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
And our homeroom teacher,

492
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,840
Ms. Wang Meiru,

493
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,840
also constantly gives us encouragement and support,

494
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,240
allowing us to stay relaxed

495
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,770
when facing competitions.

496
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
Ms. Wang,

497
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
your students

498
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
are praising you.

499
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,960
This guy,

500
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
when did he become so smooth?

501
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,360
Why do I detect a hint of

502
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,400
sincerity?

503
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,320
Especially in

504
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,980
the part about the PE teacher.

505
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,320
What do you think,

506
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,280
Mr. Li?

507
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,290
We often train until late at night.

508
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,280
The security guard at the gate

509
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,480
tirelessly

510
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,280
watches over us,

511
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,960
making us feel safe.

512
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,840
None of this would be possible without our principal

513
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,900
and the wise leadership of our school administration.

514
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,440
We will bring

515
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,200
our fullest enthusiasm

516
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,490
to the upcoming middle school table tennis tournament.

517
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,880
We will bring honor

518
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,120
to our school.

519
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,840
And all this honor

520
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,320
belongs to

521
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,040
all faculty and students of Xinde.

522
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,240
Excuse me.

523
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,320
Sure.

524
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,360
Let's go there later then.

525
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Something terrible happened!

526
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,720
Chu Yu is in trouble.
