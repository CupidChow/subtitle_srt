1
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,520
Tangtang.

2
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,120
What's wrong?

3
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,800
Fanxing,

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,680
you're so amazing.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
You actually got on stage

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,840
during your basketball practice break.

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,360
Unlike me,

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,039
I can't do anything.

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm just like garbage.

10
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,680
Tangtang,

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,770
everyone has their own strengths.

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
We don't have

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,520
your talents.

14
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,200
That's right,

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,860
you're really good at eating.

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,520
What's so special about knowing how to eat?

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Fanxing, this fish seems off.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Don't talk nonsense.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
It's from the cafeteria.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,600
It really is bad.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,360
Smell it.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,500
It seems fine to me.

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,440
This fish has a foul smell.

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,520
Tangtang.

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Isn't fish supposed to smell fishy?

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,600
It's rotten.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,880
Not just fishy.

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,120
If seafood goes bad,

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,000
you'll get diarrhea at best,

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
or end up in the hospital at worst.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,640
Stop eating.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
You all stop eating too.

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
Zhao Youlin, Cheng Yao, stop eating.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
I can't believe this.

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Why can't I eat what I paid for myself?

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,320
Zhao Youlin.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,960
Can't you tell what's good for you?

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
Tangtang is looking out for you.

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,920
Stop spreading rumors here.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
Let's hurry to the cafeteria.

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,520
Tell them to stop selling this stuff.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Tangtang.

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
Are you sure about this?

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,720
If nothing happens,

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
we might get demerits.

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,280
Chuyu.

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't you trust Tangtang's taste buds?

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,320
We need to trust Tangtang.

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Exactly.

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,490
It's just a demerit.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
But if there's really something wrong with the fish,

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,050
it could cost lives.

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,250
Shengyang is right.

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,600
How can you achieve greatness by being timid?

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,360
Let's go.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait for me.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm coming with you.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,800
His statement is roughly at this position.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,520
Mr. Wang,

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,880
Mr. Wang,

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
your students

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,370
are causing trouble in the cafeteria.

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
How is that possible?

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,220
What happened?

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
It's about Tangtang.

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
She had fish for lunch

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
and said it had a fishy smell.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
She's worried it's spoiled and might cause food poisoning,

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
so she's blocking the food counter

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,640
and preventing them from selling it.

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,560
And Xia Fanxing

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,800
is stopping students who already bought the fish

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
from eating it.

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
These students are really bold,

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,960
spreading rumors in the cafeteria.

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,890
Let's go deal with this right away.

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,600
Though Tangtang's grades aren't great,

79
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
when it comes to food,

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,570
she does have a real talent.

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,399
If she says there's something wrong with the fish...

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,640
Then it's almost certainly true.

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,280
Mr. Wang,

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,960
quickly notify the school leaders

85
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,800
and contact the cafeteria manager.

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Mr. Wang,

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,240
this has become such a big issue.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,400
What if it's all a false alarm

89
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,920
and there's nothing wrong with the cafeteria?

90
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,040
What should we do then?

91
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
They are my students.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,080
If anything happens,

93
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,610
I'll take responsibility.

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
Wow!

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,640
You guys are really something,

96
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,500
daring to do something like this.

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,520
So what?

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
We just believe in Tangtang.

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,250
What's wrong with that?

100
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,120
Don't you know

101
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,320
our school cafeteria

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,120
is famous for its cleanliness?

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,530
How could something like this happen?

104
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,960
You guys

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,720
should prepare to be disciplined.

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,640
If anyone gets a demerit, it should be all of us.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,840
None of your damn business.

108
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,320
Exactly.

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,400
You think you're so great.

110
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,760
Let's go.

111
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Tangtang.

112
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't be afraid.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
If anyone gets punished, we all get punished together.

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,320
That's right, Tangtang.

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,760
Everything will be fine.

116
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Even if there's trouble,

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,450
we'll all face it together.

118
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,960
That's right.

119
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,120
It's just a demerit.

120
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,920
No big deal.

121
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,900
Don't be afraid, girl.

122
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,180
If anyone dares to give you a demerit,

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll deal with them.

124
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,040
They're all comforting you,

125
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,370
so I'll comfort you too.

126
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,680
It's nothing.

127
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Who was just

128
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,130
shouting about bad fish in the cafeteria?

129
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
It's fine.

130
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm the principal.

131
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,360
And me.

132
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,159
Me too.

133
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,760
Which class are you from?

134
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,820
Why aren't you wearing your uniform?

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Class One.

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Your class

137
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,620
can forget about winning the red flag next week.

138
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,600
Principal,

139
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,020
I was actually the one who said it.

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,860
I was the first to point out the fish problem.

141
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
You're Tangtang, right?

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,050
Do you realize how serious this matter is?

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,650
Will you dare to do it again?

144
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,320
No, I won't.

145
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Principal, I'll never do it again.

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,360
I won't dare.

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,520
As students of Xinde School,

149
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,050
do you back down so easily in the face of truth?

150
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,760
We've already inspected the cafeteria.

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,720
Due to the cafeteria purchaser

152
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
being sick today,

153
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,200
they failed in their duty to check the quality,

154
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,800
which resulted in a batch of spoiled fish

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
entering the cafeteria.

156
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,080
This incident

157
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,159
is very serious.

158
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Thanks to you,

159
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
we avoided an accident.

160
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,320
They say education is about imparting knowledge

161
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,400
and teaching is about knowledge,

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
while nurturing develops character.

163
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,480
As a school and teachers,

164
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,320
we can't just teach without nurturing character.

165
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,880
I hope all students at Xinde

166
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,159
can be like student Tangtang,

167
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,120
growing into individuals with social responsibility

168
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,380
and a sense of justice.

169
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,520
Therefore, we've decided that at next week's flag-raising ceremony,

170
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,320
in front of the entire school,

171
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,680
we will commend student Tangtang.

172
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,440
Tangtang.

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
Why are you crying?

174
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,600
No one has ever praised me my entire life.

175
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,900
You're afraid of social anxiety, right?

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,720
How about next week's flag-raising day,

177
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,600
we won't praise you publicly.

178
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,260
- No.
- Wait.

179
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,600
Credit should be given where it's due.

180
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,440
Principal.

181
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,640
Alright.

182
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Commendation next week.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,520
Mom,

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm home.

185
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,800
My daughter's home.

186
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Come in.

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
Hurry inside.

188
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,280
You're looking prettier every day.

189
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,160
Big star.

190
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
Have a seat.

191
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Tangtang is really impressive now.

192
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
What's wrong?

193
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
My Tangtang

194
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
is just being modest.

195
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
She's already popular now,

196
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
yet still being humble.

197
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
No need to be modest.

198
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,400
Tangtang.

199
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,080
Look,

200
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,720
your aunt

201
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,200
and your other aunts and sisters just saw it.

202
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,760
See?

203
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh.

204
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
Tangtang is becoming more and more successful.

205
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Really.

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Tangtang, you're amazing.

207
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
Well, my daughter

208
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,760
has a natural talent

209
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
when it comes to food.

210
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
No matter what she eats,

211
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,159
just one taste

212
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,240
and she can tell

213
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,039
the seasonings

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,880
and cooking time and all that.

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
That's just incredible.

216
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,560
She has a golden tongue.

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,120
Really?

218
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Show your aunts a demonstration.

219
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Try our braised pork.

220
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,360
Yes, show us.

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,090
You really should show us this.

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,660
Tangtang, try some braised pork.

223
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,480
Take a bite.

224
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,050
Hurry up.

225
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,890
Show it to your aunt and others.

226
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Yes, show us something.

227
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,920
Come on, quickly.

228
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,200
This one.

229
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,730
Try this.

230
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,560
Hurry.

231
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,280
Eat this one.

232
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,160
Come on, Tangtang, eat it.

233
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,920
How is it?

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,320
Too salty.

235
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,840
Did I put in too much salt?

236
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,840
I told you my daughter is amazing.

237
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,760
She can even taste when there's too much salt.

238
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,120
Tangtang, you're incredible!

239
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,000
You're awesome.

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,760
Tangtang.

241
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,720
Try this quickly.

242
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,800
My dream.

243
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
What is my dream?

244
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,200
My dream.

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
All along,

246
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
I've felt that

247
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm not as good at ping pong or as popular as Xia Fanxing,

248
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,360
not as smart or capable as Lin Chuyu,

249
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,960
not as good with numbers or business-minded as Liu Manxin.

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Compared to them,

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm just a sidekick.

252
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,920
Until today, I finally realized

253
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,520
that in this world,

254
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,240
no one is just a supporting character.

255
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,840
Everyone is the protagonist of their own story.

256
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
From today on,

257
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,120
I have a dream.

258
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,720
I want to get into China Agricultural University.

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
I want to be like Grandpa Yuan Longping

260
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,450
and work hard for humanity's food supply.

261
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,360
I want all mankind

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
to have access to

263
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,840
healthy

264
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,320
and hygienic food.

265
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Well written, Tangtang.

266
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,040
You've set a goal to strive for.

267
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
But Tangtang,

268
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,920
do you know

269
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
that China Agricultural University's minimum score

270
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,520
is around 600 points?

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Can't it be a bit lower?

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,760
China Agricultural University

273
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,320
isn't a farmers' market.

274
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,800
Then I'll apply

275
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,740
to a culinary school instead.

276
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
Tangtang

277
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,160
Two more years.

278
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
Why don't we

279
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,680
give it a try?

280
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,880
Let's try.

281
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,330
Let's try it.

282
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,520
Let's try.

283
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,120
Little foodie.

284
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Give it a try.

285
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,760
Tangtang

286
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,480
Try it.

287
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Just give it a try.

288
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,520
Let's try.

289
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Come on. Only two weeks left until the preliminaries.

290
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Nice shot!

291
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,800
You're starting to master it now.

292
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
But just a little bit.

293
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,440
Not quite there yet.

294
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,240
Very good.

295
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,240
Good.

296
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,280
You're right, Mr. Chang.

297
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
That's exactly how it should be.

298
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,320
After I finish cooking,

299
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,560
I'll go to the community center.

300
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,000
Grandpa.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Say hello to them.

302
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,480
Fanxing is back.

303
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,880
Who are you talking to?

304
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
Your teacher Chang.

305
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,440
Teacher Chang says

306
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
you should play with Luoqing and Tangtang,

307
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,880
but their playing style is too simple.

308
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,080
He wants me to tell you

309
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,240
to go to the community center

310
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,800
and play with those ping-pong enthusiasts

311
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,600
there.

312
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,200
Sure.

313
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,960
I haven't played with those uncles and aunties

314
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,820
and grandparents for a long time.

315
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,520
Great.

316
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,880
OK.

317
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
Are you sure

318
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,220
you want to play against them?

319
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,100
Yes, of course.

320
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,320
These two gentlemen in front of you

321
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,760
are known in our neighborhood as

322
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
the Ping Pong Terrors.

323
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,000
They used to crush me when I was little.

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,660
They do look

325
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,840
like real experts.

326
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,840
Fanxing,

327
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,920
it's been a while since you played with us old men, hasn't it?

328
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,400
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

329
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,330
Little Fanxing,

330
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,540
I heard your boyfriend is a youth championship winner.

331
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,760
No, Grandpa.

332
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
This is my

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,330
classmate and partner.

334
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,260
High school students don't date.

335
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,480
Date early

336
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,160
and enjoy life first.

337
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,080
Are you two going to play or not?

338
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,040
We're waiting in line here.

339
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
Fanxing.

340
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,380
Your grandfather showed me your videos.

341
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
You play well.

342
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,120
Uncle Zhao and Aunt Zhao

343
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,520
want to challenge you two.

344
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
No problem.

345
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,280
After I finish playing with Grandpa,

346
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,080
I'll play with you guys next.

347
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,340
Uncle Zhao, Aunt Zhao.

348
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,700
This is like a relay match.

349
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
That's right.

350
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
I used to play with them like this when I was little.

351
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
Good.

352
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,000
Alright.

353
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,560
Let's go.

354
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,840
Wait a moment.

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
That's a

356
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,360
fake move.

357
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
This is...

358
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,880
Cerebral thrombosis.

359
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,080
He's had it for years.

360
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
If you want to control the ball,

361
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,540
you must first control your hand.

362
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
Wait a moment.

363
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,600
What's going on?

364
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,520
You startled me.

365
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,000
I almost threw my back out.

366
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm at the community center.

367
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,640
I'll go back right away.

368
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
Right away.

369
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,280
My eldest grandson has come home.

370
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,599
I need to go home and cook something delicious for him.

371
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,160
I'll come back to play with you all after dinner.

372
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,839
I'm leaving now.

373
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,440
Bye-bye.

374
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
What am I supposed to do when you leave?

375
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,200
Mr. Sun, just go already.

376
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,599
You're just wasting our time.

377
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:23,960
Here.

378
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,040
You take over.

379
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,080
Mixed doubles means one man and one woman.

380
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,000
Xiao Fanxing,

381
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,480
we old couple can play a few matches with you young couple.

382
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,080
Mrs. Zhao,

383
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
I've told you we're not a couple.

384
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,100
This is my classmate and partner.

385
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,600
I understand.

386
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,140
Mrs. Zhao has been through it all.

387
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,440
Back then,

388
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,040
Mrs. Zhao and Mr. Zhao

389
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,810
also started dating when we were classmates.

390
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,080
Afraid our families would object.

391
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,880
We kept it secret from our families.

392
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,210
Mrs. Zhao, we really are just classmates.

393
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,040
Right,

394
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
just stick to your story that you're classmates.

395
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,080
Don't admit to any other relationship.

396
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,980
Are we going to play or not?

397
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,340
Why are you in such a hurry?

398
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,400
The kids aren't even in a rush.

399
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,460
What's your hurry?

400
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
Do you want to

401
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,200
finish the game early

402
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,640
so you can go on a date with your old deskmate?

403
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,800
What old deskmate?

404
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,600
Don't think I don't know.

405
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,600
Ever since you came back from that class reunion.

406
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,440
You've been constantly texting your old deskmate.

407
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,360
Do you regret dating me

408
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,260
instead of your deskmate?

409
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,280
Are you trying to make

410
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,680
your withering heart

411
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,880
bloom again?

412
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,800
Like a dead firework trying to sparkle one more time?

413
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,480
Is that it?

414
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,200
In front of the kids,

415
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,920
why are you saying all this?

416
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm just saying.

417
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,840
What's wrong with me saying it?

418
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,480
Woman, don't you dare hit me!

419
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,360
Oh my!

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,480
You want to hit me, don't you?

421
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,280
I'll show you!

422
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,880
Calm down.

423
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,080
Mrs. Zhao.

424
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,760
Take it easy.

425
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,280
It's okay.

426
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
You've come at the right time today.

427
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,760
Let me tell you about

428
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,920
the art of ping pong.

429
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,440
Playing ping pong isn't just

430
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
about hitting a ball.

431
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,880
Not at all.

432
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
It's about social skills.

433
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,240
Especially at work

434
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,480
when playing with your boss.

435
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,080
When to win a point,

436
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,410
when to let them win one,

437
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
it's all strategy.

438
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,400
Those who understand ping pong

439
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,160
know

440
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
how deep this art goes.

441
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,840
Well,

442
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
isn't there a saying?

443
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,060
If I lose to you,

444
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,480
what does it matter if I win the world?

445
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,200
So,

446
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,880
beating your boss is like losing the world.

447
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,920
Baby, your serve.

448
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,800
Baby, your serve.

449
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,360
Baby, you serve.

450
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,200
You serve, baby.

451
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,520
Alright then.

452
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,320
What a fruitful day.

453
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,640
Indeed.

454
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,520
At least we gained some happiness.

455
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,280
It was truly fun.

456
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,640
Brother and sister,

457
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,040
can you play with us?

458
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,760
Kids,

459
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,280
go play by yourselves.

460
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
We're not just playing around.

461
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,800
We want to play seriously with adults.

462
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
No problem.

463
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,080
But we won't go easy on you.

464
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,720
Don't look down on us.

465
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,640
We'll see

466
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,240
who will be

467
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,760
the killer of the giraffe.

468
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,440
What?

469
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,400
It's 'may the best man win'.

470
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Whatever.

471
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,680
Fine.

472
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,360
Let's see

473
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,720
who exactly

474
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,520
will be the killer of the giraffe.

475
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,680
You're here.

476
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,890
You're playing very seriously today.

477
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Of course.

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,800
When I was little, I was just like them.

479
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,520
I desperately wanted adults to respect me.

480
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,280
Sweetie.

481
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,920
What's wrong?

482
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,720
I really want to play

483
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,370
a proper match with adults,

484
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
but they just treat me like a child.

485
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm sorry you feel that way, sweetie.

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,200
Would you like grandpa to play with you?

487
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,580
Grandpa will stay with you, sweetie.

488
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,600
Your grandfather must love you a lot.

489
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,480
My parents have always worked away from home.

490
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,680
I was raised by my grandfather.

491
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,960
No wonder

492
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,560
You even took his surname.

493
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,370
Why didn't your grandfather come to watch us play today?

494
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
He said he had a medical checkup today.

495
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Otherwise, he would definitely have come.

496
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
I'm the most important person in my grandfather's heart.

497
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,520
Old Xia,

498
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm really sorry,

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,880
troubling you to come all this way to pick me up from the airport.

500
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,800
It's nothing.

501
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,800
You've been away for so long.

502
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,760
Just got back.

503
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,000
Of course I had to come pick you up myself.

504
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I heard Fanxing went to play ball at the community center today.

505
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
Sorry for keeping you from cheering her on.

506
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
She can't compare to you.

507
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,760
Let me tell you,

508
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,720
I've learned two new dishes recently.

509
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,600
I'll show you my skills later.

510
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,080
I have to say, you're something else, old Xia.

511
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,680
There's not a single old man in our neighborhood better than you.

512
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
That's right.

513
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,320
You're making me blush with your compliments.

514
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,120
I can't handle praise well.

515
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,400
I'm shy.

516
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
Xia Dade.

517
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,640
Hello, Grandma.

518
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,400
Fanxing.

519
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,560
Why are you back so early?

520
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,280
Fanxing.

521
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,240
Your grandfather is cooking for me later.

522
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,440
You should join us.

523
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,160
Dinner?

524
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,460
Just now when we were playing ball in the community,

525
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,160
Mrs. Wang mentioned that

526
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,960
you two are going to the movies tonight.

527
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,000
So which is it? Dinner with Mrs. Li

528
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,760
or movies with Mrs. Wang?

529
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,800
You made plans with Mrs. Wang?

530
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,860
Then I won't keep you from your movie.

531
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,040
Oh, right.

532
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,200
Remember to get front row seats.

533
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,720
Mrs. Wang can't see well.

534
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,520
Cataracts.

535
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
She can't see from the back rows.

536
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
Everyone, listen up.

537
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
Now,

538
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
the middle school table tennis league

539
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,840
has added mixed doubles

540
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,880
to the competition.

541
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,480
The committee

542
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,560
has separated singles and mixed doubles

543
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,820
to help players adjust to the intensity.

544
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,200
This Saturday will be the men's and women's singles

545
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,330
qualifying rounds.

546
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,560
The qualifying rounds

547
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,440
will select

548
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,600
the top 64.

549
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,920
From the top 64,

550
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,360
we'll select 32,

551
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,920
then 16,

552
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,180
then move to the quarter-finals,

553
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
the semi-finals,

554
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,680
and finals.

555
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,420
After we finish with the singles,

556
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
it will be time for mixed doubles.

557
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
It's time

558
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,440
to let everyone know

559
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,600
how amazing our Xinde table tennis team

560
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,720
really is.

561
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,960
Are you all confident?

562
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,400
Fanxing,

563
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,480
I believe in you.

564
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,080
You'll definitely crush Qingyang High School

565
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,480
and make it to the finals.

566
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,440
Don't waste all my practice sessions with you.

567
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,400
No problem.

568
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Absolutely no problem.

569
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,240
We'll definitely meet them at the top,

570
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,300
right, Shengyang?

571
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Of course.

572
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,200
Liu Manxin

573
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,760
What matter needs to be kept from Shengyang and Fanxing?

574
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,800
Those two

575
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,640
have a secret.

576
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,200
A secret?

577
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,520
Are they really together now?

578
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,380
It's much more serious than that.

579
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,520
Serious?

580
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,440
Have you noticed

581
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,880
that when Fanxing is alone,

582
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,560
compared to when she's with us,

583
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,220
she's completely different?

584
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,080
Xia Fanxing.

585
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,440
Xia Fanxing.

586
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,920
Manxin.

587
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,970
Why are you sitting here alone?

588
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,290
I'm watching my classmates play ball.

589
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,240
So what's the problem?

590
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,540
I didn't think much of it at first,

591
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
until a few days ago,

592
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,060
when I overheard her conversation with Shengyang.

593
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,800
They said her problem was very serious,

594
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
something about genetic mutation,

595
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,200
depression and things like that.

596
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
Depression.

597
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
That's impossible.

598
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,680
Absolutely impossible.

599
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,280
Don't we know Fanxing?

600
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,460
She's such an optimistic person.

601
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Even if all of us were depressed,

602
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,540
she would never be.

603
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,640
Not necessarily.

604
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,600
I know there's a condition called

605
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,720
smiling depression,

606
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,740
also known as masked depression.

607
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,240
This condition is deeply hidden.

608
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,940
They always appear lively and cheerful in front of others.

609
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,960
Only when they're alone

610
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,160
do they reveal their true selves.
