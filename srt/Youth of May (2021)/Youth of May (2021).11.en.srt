The police are investigating an unidentified skeleton-

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,540
found at a construction site in Gwangju this morning.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,660
The police have sent the skeleton to the National Forensic Service-

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,430
for DNA analysis in order to identify the victim.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,450
Those in the political circles are saying-

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,850
the skeleton may belong to one of the victims of the Gwangju Uprising-

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,080
and that the blood sample may need to be compared with the families

00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,990
of those who disappeared during the Gwangju Uprising.

10

Who's he? Another relative of a missing person?

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,890
No. He's an informant.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,540
- An informant?
- Yes.

13

Father!

Why are you outside? Why didn't you come inside?

15
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,440
I didn't even know you came!

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,010
I'm fine.

17
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,210
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

18
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,930
Should I go inside and get my bag?

19
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,380
No, it's okay.

20
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,450
You wait here a little longer.

21

I'm going to go get your sister.

22
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,100
Can I go with you?

23
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,420
It's dangerous outside. Don't go out and stay here.

24
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,430
I'll be back soon. Okay?

25
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,440
Aren't you Jung Tae's mom?

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,820
Why aren't you going inside?

27
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,100
I'm sorry, but can you get Jung Tae for me?

28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,660
Yes.

You're going to regret this. Come with me to Naju.

33

Don't say that. You don't understand.

You never came down to Gwangju.

No matter how much you try to hypnotize me,

80
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,030
the fact that I was in Gwangju won't change.

81
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,320
Then, I can get rid of the evidence that you were in Gwangju.

82
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
For example,

83
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,280
that girl at the hospital.

nurses, and even the patients there.

86
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,580
A lot of people would have seen me there.

87
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,910
Are you going to explode the hospital then?

88
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,010
That's not bad either.

89
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,200
We can wipe it clean and say it was a mission completed by the spies.

90
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,460
Why? Is that not good enough?

91
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,590
Then, what about saying it was a clean-up of all the spies?

92
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,030
I must have become your Achilles' heel.

93

In your busiest time,

94
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,900
seeing as you're trying so hard to get rid of me,

95
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,340
the fact that I'm in Gwangju

96
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,180
must be a great feat for you.

97
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,910
Is it not?

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,390
Let me go.

99
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,870
If you let me go,

100
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,610
I'll disappear from not only Gwangju, but your life too.

101
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,890
You're just as expected.

102
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,950
You're smart, but you're bad at reading someone's mind.

103
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,510
Once you think you know your opponent's

104
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,910
moves and get cocky,

105
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,240
it's practically the same as exposing your next move.

106
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,350
You've lost.

107
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,720
Stay here until the situation is over.

108
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,300
Myeong Hee, I requested the search team

109
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,780
to look for him extra carefully.

110
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,950
Doesn't the search team

111
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,160
only look for dead people?

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,050
What are you saying? It's not.

113
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,440
They're even finding fugitives that are on the run.

114
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
They said he was dragged away after being hit by the car.

115
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,840
It's probably his father's doing.

116
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,970
If it really is Hwang Gi Nam's doing,

117
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,740
he probably wasn't taken to Defense Security Command.

118
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,260
- But first, calm down.
- There's nothing I can do.

119
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,920
He must have bled a lot, too.

120
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,260
I don't even know if he's dying somewhere.

121
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,030
There's nothing I can do.

122
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,760
Kim Myeong Hee, snap out of it.

123
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,590
Why is there nothing you can do?

124
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,600
You need to wait for Hwang Hee Tae!

125
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,020
Just...

126
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,100
Just wait for him like this?

127
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,210
Hwang Hee Tae will come back for sure.

128
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,770
Until then, Myeong Hee,

129
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,470
you need to withstand the time.

130
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,110
Okay?

131
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,600
Hee Tae, you don't have to leave us on purpose.

132
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,430
I'll just drop by the hospital nearby.

133
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,610
I have nothing to say to my father.

134
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,420
Can you not go and just stay here?

135
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,850
I'll be right back, so wait for me.

136
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,910
Myeong Hee. Kim Myeong Hee!

137
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,560
Hurry and come with me. We need to go before it becomes too late.

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,690
Myeong Soo and your mom are waiting.

139
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,130
I'm going to the hospital.

140
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,630
What are you talking about? The hospital?

141
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,760
Why would you go back there?

142
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,510
He said he'll come back to the hospital.

143
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm going to wait for him there.

144
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,050
You hurry and take Myeong Soo out of here.

145
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,350
What do you mean?

146
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,600
In what world would a father leave without their child?

147
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,960
I can't leave without him either!

148
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,730
Oh, goodness.

149
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh, dear. My gosh, what happened?

150
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,190
My poor baby.

151
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,950
My poor baby, what happened to you?

152
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,650
Soo Chan has arrived safely thanks to you.

153

We're indebted to you yet again.

154
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,740
Thank you so much, Mr. Hwang.

155
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,010
No need to thank me. Let's each take care of our own children from now on.

156
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,000
All right, I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,540
We were unfortunate this time—

No, not regarding you son, but your daughter.

159

What? My Soo Ryun is in Seoul—

160

She's in Gwangju right now.

161
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,980
I found my son and have him with me.

162
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,620
You look for your daughter yourself.

As of this moment, Operation Choongjung

164

167
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,390
Any rebel that disobeys orders is to be shot immediately.

168
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,270
They were looking at us like we were human-killing hunting dogs.

169
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,290
What?

170
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,230
You know those soldiers from the other unit that we passed by.

171
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,440
I don't know if it's because of my guilty conscience,

172
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,510
or if people can tell when you have blood on your hands.

173
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,300
Will we be able to go back there?

174
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,020
Will we be able to...

175
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,950
return to Gwangju?

176
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,620
Hello, ma'am. You must be working really hard.

177
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,350
Soo Chan, are you hurt? What happened?

178
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,590
Well, it's... Don't worry about it.

179
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,590
The thing is I came here to ask you something.

180
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,550
What is it?

181
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,780
Soo Ryun and Hwang Hee Tae,

182
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,140
they're in Gwangju.

183
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,290
You already knew.

184
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,220
Then, do you know where Soo Ryun is?

185
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,300
- Well...
- Please tell me if you know.

186
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,850
I must find Soo Ryun before Mr. Hwang hurts her.

187
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,680
They already found Hwang Hee Tae and have him.

188
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,620
It's only a matter of time before they find Soo Ryun.

189
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,250
Did they really say that? That they have Hwang Hee Tae?

[Gwangju Peace Hospital]

191
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,750
Are you going to stay here? Until Hwang Hee Tae comes back?

192
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,360
Mr. Hwang took Hee Tae. You know what that means, right?

193
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,400
It means if you keep staying here, you don't know when you'll fall in danger, too.

194
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,490
I'm worried about you...

195
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,880
as much as Soo Ryun, Myeong Hee.

196
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:55,860
When I was younger, my father would remind me every time we went to the market.

197
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,540
In case that I ever lose him, for me to stay right where I am.

198
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,150
He told me I'd go missing if we both wandered around looking for each other.

199
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:14,030
He told me to stay put until he found me.

200
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,910
I'll stay right here even if lightning strikes...

201
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,540
So that Hee Tae can find me.

202
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,930
Myeong Hee.

203
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,320
I really like this about you.

204
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,060
You were always brave and strong.

205
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,100
Take care of yourself.

206
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,610
If you need help, you can call me whenever.

207
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,430
Thank you.

Are you awake?

210
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,390
Hurry and get ready to come downstairs to eat. Your father will be home soon.

211
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,010
Didn't I tell you not to stomp on the stairs?

212
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,840
You didn't wash up yet?

213
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,320
I don't feel like eating.

214
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,230
Even if you don't feel like eating, you haven't seen your father in a few days, you should eat with him.

215
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,170
Hurry and wash up.

216
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,900
Don't ever open this door again.

Are you crazy?

218
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,780
What's going on in our house?

219
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,520
I told you, it's for the family.

220
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,950
- For the family? What's inside is your child.
- No.

221
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,650
No. What's inside is a bomb, just like your father.

222
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,120
Thanks to your mighty father, we've been stuck in this countryside for ten years now.

223
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,000
It's my first chance in ten years. Do you understand?

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,410
I can't be hugging a bomb just because we're family. I won't make that stupid mistake again.

I expected this.

230
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,930
Since they took Hwang Hee Tae, I'm next.

231
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,500
But everyone here is just as in danger as I am from Hwang Gi Nam.

232
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,330
I can't go back home, just so I can be safe.

233
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,300
What about Father? I won't tell you to come for good.

234
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,930
But don't you think you need to see Father at least once?

235
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,960
If I see Dad right now, I don't think I can come back out.

236
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,470
Soo Ryun, I know why you're being this way.

237
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,040
But there's no need to turn your back on family. More so in times like this—

238
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,270
All of these were posted by people who've lost their families!

239
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,190
Without even knowing whether they're dead or alive,

240
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,650
they cut out pictures of them and made these posters.

[Name - Kim Seong Wook]
[Age - 18 years old]

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,300
I heard from Soo Ryun.

246
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,590
By the looks of it, you haven't slept or eaten.

247
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,610
Do you think this will make people praise you for your loyalty?

248

I can't fall asleep and I'm not hungry.

249

Don't worry too much.

250
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,560
I doubt even the evil Hwang Gi Nam could harm his own child.

251
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,530
He is the type to do something.

252
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:40,320
Still, they're father and son. What kind of parent would kill his own child?

What are you talking about?

You...

255
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,040
Do you know what kind of person his father, Hwang Gi Nam, is?

256
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,760
I know.

257
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,590
You know?

258
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,020
You know... and you still met him?

259
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,300
It's not what Hee Tae did.

260
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,320
- His only fault is that he's his father's son.
-That's precisely the problem.

261
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,400
Do you think he'll be any different from his savage father?

262
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
He's the same type of person!

263

After being stigmatized all you life yourself...

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,800
You should stop here. He's going to ruin your life in the end.

He's not the one that ruined my life. It was you!

- How could you...
- Stop it, both of you!

Don't fight! Stop!

271
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,620
Don't waste your energy. No one can hear you from outside.

272

The people in this house will hear me, at least.

Aren't you curious about what's happening outside?

The martial law army has retreated, so everyone's celebrating.

276
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,330
They have no idea it means isolation, not liberation.

277
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,520
Gwangju is now a rat trapped in a cage.

278
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:59,120
They'll slowly bleed to death unless they surrender. Just like you.

279
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,160
I finally understand.

280
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,820
My mother said she'd rather let her lungs rot...

281

than receive treatment with your money.

282
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,410
I think I understand her now.

283
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,190
I don't understand why both you and the morons outside

284
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,760
are so stupid.

285
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,440
As long as you keep quiet and behave, you'll be let go sooner or later.

286
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,650
What's the point of being let go?

287
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,530
You'll just lock me up again when you feel anxious.

288
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,560
That's not the same as being let go. I'm just on a longer leash.

289
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,970
I am not your pet dog.

290
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,590
So stop interfering with my life.

291
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,520
I cannot do that. I have already paid the price.

292
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,500
Oh, that's too bad.

293
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,210
I don't think I can go on playing the good son.

294
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,430
I think I should start with protesting.

295
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,030
I was already arrested before.

296
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,680
The repentant Head of the Anti-Communist Investigation's son?

297
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,860
That would paint a pretty picture.

298
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,880
Or should I go for disguised employment? Teach students at night—

299
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,200
You should know when to stop fighting back.

300
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,720
You're not the only reason who can ruin my life.

301
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,460
So stop interfering with my life.

302
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:05,110
You were an orphan and I took you in; yet, you forget your place and act up?

303
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,790
Why am I an orphan when my father is alive and well right here?

304
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,470
Don't get the wrong idea. I chose you to be my son.

305
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,790
If not for my selection, you are an orphan.

306
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,780
The orphan who begged for funeral expenses.

307
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,640
The corpses in the street at least have families to get them.

308
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,470
No one will look for you as you bleed to death in here.

309
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:46,040
And then nothing will happen,

310
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,560
as if you never existed in the first place.

311
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,120
The orphan is not me but you.

312
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,290
No one will choose you to be their family.

313
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,300
Sir, there's an emergency call. You must head back.

314
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,720
Father, when are we going to Naju?

315
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,410
Should we kidnap Myeong Hee?

316
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:08,020
You grab her arms and I'll grab her legs. Then we could take her back to Naju.

317
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,960
It's no use taking just her outer shell with us.

318
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,840
Her spirit will remain here.

319
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,400
What's with her anyway?

320
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,220
No matter how much she likes Hee Tae,

321
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,910
isn't family the most important in the world?

322
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,460
This watch. Do you know who I received this from?

323
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,680
Isn't it something Grandpa passed down to you?

324
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,150
No way.

325
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,570
No, actually, it was passed down

326
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,000
to my older brother.

327
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,820
Then as he was leaving home, he passed it down to me

328
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,460
when I was just about your age.

329
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,950
Why did he leave home?

330
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,660
My brother had something more important to him than family, too.

331
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,650
Just like your sister.

332
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,820
You never know what'll happen when you grow up. You might also find something that matters more.

333
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,580
I don't think so. To me, my family will always matter more than anything.

334
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,770
Goodness, come here...

335
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,550
My son!

336
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,710
What did you think of Mudeung Stadium?

337
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,760
Wasn't it so much bigger than your school's field?

338
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,480
Of course, the schoolyard can't compare with Mudeung Stadium

339
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,870
It's the same thing.

340
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,160
Family is definitely important.

341
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,510
But sometimes, you find things in life that are

342
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,210
much larger and more important, like Mudeung Stadium.

343
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,210
It's not that family isn't important to your sister,

344
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,550
but she can't leave because there's something more important.

345
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,740
Here.

346
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,940
Hello?

347
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,240
Jung Tae? It's me, Myeong Soo.

348
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,950
Kim Myeong Soo. Did you arrive in Naju?

349
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,690
No. I'm still in Gwangju because of my sister.

350
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,480
Your sister?

351
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,420
What about her?

352
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,810
She's waiting

353
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,940
for Hee Tae. She won't step outside the hospital.

354
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,730
So I want to ask you. Has Hee Tae come home?

355
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,140
Have you heard anything?

356
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,830
Brother Hee Tae...

357
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,450
might die.

358
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,950
What?

359
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,290
What are you talking about?

360
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,090
My father...

361
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,360
What he did to Brother Hee Tae—

362
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,640
Are you really not going to tell me who called?

363
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,940
Hwang Jung Tae!

364
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,060
Aren't you concerned?

365
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,520
What?

366
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,440
The sound that used to come out from the study. You can't hear it anymore.

367
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,950
What if Brother Hee Tae is already dead?

368
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,340
If Father can do this to his favorite son,

369
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,260
who knows if he'll lock me up too in the future?

370
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,340
That would never happen, Jung Tae.

371
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,690
Your brother and Father just argued for a little bit.

372
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,290
Mom...

373
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,870
Mom, can't you let him go?

374
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,080
Father's not even home right now.

375
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,710
I can't.

376
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,950
Father will let him go as soon as he calms down.

377
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,700
Don't worry.

378
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,970
I...

379
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,570
I'm going back to the camp.

380
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,480
What? Do you know how dangerous it is outside?

381
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,370
Anywhere...

382
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,280
Is not as scary as our home.

383
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,760
Wait.

384
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,430
Can I...

385
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,480
ask you for a favor?

386
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,390
Please...

387
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,750
call the hospital.

388
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,100
If Myeong Hee is still there,

389
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,680
tell her that I'm safe and well, and for her to go to Naju first.

390
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:41,170
I'm sorry, but I can't do that for you.

391
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,070
Even if you look at me like that, there's no point.

392
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,090
You already know that I can't do anything in this household.

393
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,470
The only thing I can give you...

394
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,990
is barely this cup of water.

395
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,580
Even though you might resent and hate me...

396
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,350
Mother.

397
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,850
I don't resent you.

398
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,500
I never hated you either.

399
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,960
I understand you, Mother.

400
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,350
Then, can I ask for something else?

401
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,410
Take Jung Tae...

402
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,800
and leave this house.

403
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,980
Jung Tae is still young.

404
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,720
Hey. Wake up.

405
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,850
Wake up.

406
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,830
I'm going to kill all of your family.

407
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,230
What?

408
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:39,380
10-33 Wolhyang-ri, Wolhyang-myeon, Hampyeong-gun. Your grandmother's place, right?

409
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,470
It's a desolate area and just perfect for your ailing mother.

410
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,180
Unless she's there like your father to look after your grandmother,

411
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,560
no one will know who lives there.

412
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,810
Naturally,

413
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,600
no one will know who dies there.

414
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,080
Jung Hye Gun.

415
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,220
Let's end this quickly. Isn't it tough on you?

416
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,760
Let's go and see your parents.

417
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,830
Hey. Say I'm taken by the Defense Security Command.

418
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,690
If I drop your name, will your father get me out?

419
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,270
Will he?

420
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,930
Give it a go. The moment you even say one syllable of my name,

421
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,070
my father will kill you.

422
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,420
Father.

423
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,390
Hee Tae's father.

424
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,170
It's me. Hee Tae's friend Hye Gun.

425
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,440
What is this fool saying?

426
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,000
Father, why are you pretending not to know me?

427
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,140
You said you'd let me off if I mentioned Hee Tae.

428
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,520
It's me, Father.

429
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,210
I'm Hye Gun, Hee Tae's best friend.

430
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,120
Let go.

431
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,900
Let go.

432
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,830
Darn you. Let go of me, punk.

433
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,950
You deserve to die.

434
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,350
How dare you threaten me?

435
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,880
Who said you could say that to me?

436
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,880
Just die.

437
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,120
Die already. Just die.

438
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,870
Dr. Yoo was discharged.

439
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,680
His family came and took him home.

440
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,380
Goodness, he went home?

441
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,800
That's great. I was worried he was badly hurt.

442
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,640
Does Hwang Hee Tae not have any family?

443
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,010
What?

444
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:01,210
I mean, he went missing but no one is asking or looking for him.

445
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,690
Is there no one around him?

446
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,100
The militia got us medical supplies.

447
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,060
If you need anything for the ER, come and get it.

448
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,690
This is just great.

449
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,960
I'll go and get it.

450
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,160
I look forward to May every year.

451
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:06,290
Why are you working on your own and tiring yourself out?

452
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,530
♫ In the night sky, those beautiful stars ♫

453
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,380
♫ I’m dreaming they’re so close that I can reach them at the tips of my fingers ♫

454
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,310
♫ But at this moment, you’re here with me ♫

455
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:26,160
♫ I feel your warm breath ♫

456
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,680
♫ When time passes, everything changes ♫

457
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,320
♫ so my eyes and my heart won’t be able to remember ♫

458
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:45,900
♫ but what will eternally remain in my heart ♫

459
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:54,690
♫ are the beautiful memories of you ♫

460
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:02,850
♫ To me, you are the one person.
The one I’m happy to have by my side ♫

461
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,130
♫ Even if the entire world changes, our love is eternal ♫

462
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:16,830
♫ Words I could not finish, something words cannot explain ♫

463
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,720
I haven't left my position, minus the time I used the restroom.

464
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,300
It was you.

465
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,970
It was you.

466
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,730
Jung Tae, go to your room.

467
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,030
Hwang Jung Tae, hurry!

468
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,810
No, don't get up.

469
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,920
[Regular savings account]

470
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,230
It's the money I saved so Myeong Hee can go to college.

471
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,040
And I saved the money that Myeong Hee would send me.

472
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,260
It's not a lot, but it should be enough to get you settled.

473
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,060
You should give this directly to Myeong Hee.

474
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,000
No, you take care of it.

475
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,560
Myeong Hee won't accept it.

476
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,680
It's money that both of you will use anyway.

477
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,660
Father.

478
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,090
And...

479
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,400
Give this to her.

480
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:29,210
Myeong Hee met the wrong father and had a difficult life,

481
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,200
but she is a really special,

482
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,560
a really special child.

483
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:43,680
I hope you both forget about the tragic past...

484
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,150
and cherish each other and live happily.

485
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,520
We will.
