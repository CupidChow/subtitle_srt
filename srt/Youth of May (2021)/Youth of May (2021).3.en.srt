1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,500
Over here.

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,830
Put that in the back seat.

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,330
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,930
If you bribe someone like this, you'll be caught right away.

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,460
I guess you could call this a bribe.

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,480
Today is your future father-in-law's birthday.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,250
What?

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,950
I'm already thankful that you came to wish me a happy birthday.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,340
You didn't have to bring all this.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,300
Soo Ryun, come here.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,500
Mr. Hwang sent us this precious gift.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,070
Gifts? What gifts?

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,410
Their son brought them himself.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,340
We must expel–

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,220
We must expel all government-funded professors, who have lived as parasites of the Yushin dictatorship

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,900
from our sacred campus!

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,920
You must be surprised because I came without notice.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,990
Miss Soo Ryun.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,540
What are you doing? Come sit.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,610
I said come and sit.

21
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,000
Then I will go first...

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,210
What? You should eat with us before you leave.

23
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,780
No, it's fine. You have a guest.

24
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,200
Oh, is it a little cumbersome?

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,390
It's fine by me.

26
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,390
Please do as you are comfortable.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,930
I will leave first.

28
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,700
Myeong Hee!

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,170
Where are you going? You should eat first.

30
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,690
No, it's fine.

31
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,370
Come on. I even bought cake.

32
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,560
Don't be like this. Eat before you leave.

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,060
Who...?

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,680
Soo Chan.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,810
This is Mr. Hwang's son who I told you about the other day.

36
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,860
Oh, the one that Soo Ryun is seeing?

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,550
I'm Hwang Hee Tae.

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,620
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm Soo Ryun's older brother, Lee Soo Chan.

40

[Episode 3: Your One Month]

41
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,710
Yeah!

42
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,300
Congratulations!

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,020
- Congratulations.
- Eat up.

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,010
- Yes.
- Let's eat.

45
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,520
Go ahead and eat.

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,560
Goodness. I'm sorry that all we did was put an extra spoon on the table.

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,510
If you had told us you were coming, we would have caught a brood hen in advance.
(T/N: Offering a brood hen to a guest is an act of respect; a brood hen for a son-in-law means a successful marriage.)

48
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,950
Dad, what are you talking about?

49
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,290
Father, if we add a brood hen on this table, it will collapse.

50
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,570
We don't have much, but I hope you enjoy.

51
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,570
Yes.

52
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,550
But, Hee Tae,

53
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,130
why are you interested in Soo Ryun?

54
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,570
And don't say basic stuff like "everything."

55
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,350
What part of her?

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,770
We don't accept just anybody.

57
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,350
Can we trust you?

58
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,140
Miss Soo Ryun had a very strong first impression.

59
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,350
As soon as we met, she asked to go print flyers together.

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,870
What? What will we do with her?

61
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,020
Then, Soo Ryun, what do you like about Hee Tae?

62
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,380
You're crazy. Why are you asking these sorts of questions?

63
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm curious as well.

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,020
I want to know how you've felt about me until now.

65
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,010
To be honest...

66
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,310
Whatever, never mind. Let's just eat.

67
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,660
Look at her. Looks like she's ready to be married off.

68
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,940
The legendary Lee Soo Ryun is getting shy and all.

69
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,270
I told you it's not like that!

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,210
Goodness, you and your temper.

71
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,010
Myeong Hee, you know him well. Right?

72
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,660
What?

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,930
Oh, the rice cake shop that you said you visit often.

74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,640
I have to buy rice cakes to gift once I open my business.

75
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,820
Do you think I'll be fine going there by myself?

76
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,610
Then, I'll go in your stead.

77
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,200
It's close to my house anyway.

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,110
Let's go together then!

79
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,170
How about we meet there tomorrow before you go to work?

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,310
Okay. Let's go.

81
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,510
Father, should we tell them to come inside now?

82
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,160
No. Leave them be. You'll ruin the mood.

83
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,330
I'll be informal since we're the same age.

84
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,340
What are you trying to do here?

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,610
Me? I came to ask you what you're trying to do.

86
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,440
What your intentions were in doing this, and

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,860
what your future plans are.

88
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,880
My intentions and plans are simple.

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,610
Not marrying you. You should reject me first.

90
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,600
There seems to be a misunderstanding, but

91
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm the one who found your weakness.

92
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,040
Reject? Why would I do such a thing?

93
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,870
All I have to do is expose what you did.

94
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,740
Do it then. Why are we having this conversation then?

95
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,040
Since it puts Myeong Hee in a difficult situation.

96
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,580
Why are you mentioning Myeong Hee all of a sudden?

97
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,940
What does she have to do with you?

98
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,750
Because I like her.

99
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,950
What? You...

100
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,640
You? Like Myeong Hee?

101
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,380
Yes. I like her. Why?

102
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,340
Myeong Hee only went there to get rejected by you in my stead.

103
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,640
Exactly. If you wanted to get rejected, you should've come yourself.

104
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,400
Why did you send someone like Myeong Hee instead and make things difficult?

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,770
You're funny.

106
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,080
I think you have a misunderstanding.

107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,840
Don't you dare hit on her.

108
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,750
Myeong Hee doesn't have any emotions towards you. Actually, she doesn't like you.

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,800
I don't know... Your words aren't that credible.

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,940
It doesn't look like you have an interest in other people's matters.

111
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,060
She went for the money.

112
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,410
What?

113
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,960
Myeong Hee met you all this time so she could make money.

114
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,150
Did you think that Myeong Hee was meeting you because she liked you?

115
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,080
Yes.

116
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,300
Why is she like that?

117
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,920
Did you guys have a lover's quarrel?

118
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,810
Thank you for today.

119
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,390
And I would like to congratulate you once again.

120
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,080
Oh my, look at me.

121
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,350
I almost sent him home with empty hands.

122
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,310
Oh right! We packed you some food. Wait a little bit.

123
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,650
I'm fine...

124
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,400
Is your leg okay?

125
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,920
I did think about how I missed you, but

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,890
I didn't think we'd meet again here.

127
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,620
Hee Tae.

128
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,620
Then I will see you again next time,

129
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,520
Myeong Hee.

130
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,940
Hee Tae.

131
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,350
You didn't have to.

132
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,420
Hee Tae, this isn't much so don't feel burdened.

133
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,430
- Yes, thank you.
- Come again next time.

134
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,080
Yes.

135
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,580
Anyhow, I'm afraid we'll have to maintain this situation for the time being.

136
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,550
You... are going to keep lying?

137
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,640
I mean, it's not a lie.

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,480
To be exact,

139
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,910
we are just omitting.

140
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,490
If I tell my father that I am going to meet him,

141
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,080
he'll be okay with it no matter if it's day or night.

142
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,000
Why don't we get what we need out of it

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,740
and worry about the aftermath later?

144
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,170
You're crazy! Crazy! Crazy!

145
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,490
What if the situation gets worse later! What will you do?

146
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,900
I don't know!

147
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,030
Anyway, let's stop talking about that.

148
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,100
Myeong Hee, let me ask you one thing.

149
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,270
What?

150
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,350
Do... you happen...

151
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,220
to like Hwang Hee Tae?

152
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,230
Like him? No way!

153
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,960
Right? Then it's settled.

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,210
I told him so that he'd understand.

155
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,070
What did you say?

156
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,380
That you met him so you could earn some money. That you have no feelings whatsoever!

157
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,820
You really said it like that?

158
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,580
Yeah, why? It's the truth, so it doesn't matter. Not like you'll see him again.

159
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,180
Did you make plans to see him again?

160
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,850
No!

161

[Tonight at 7:00 p.m. Music Cafe Hee Hee Nak Rak]

162
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,030
What is that?

163
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,880
Is something the matter? You've been acting strange since earlier.

164

But my best friend doesn't like that other friend.

So I said I wouldn't play with them.

Then, meet secretly!

But then, I'll be lying to my best friend!

322
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,810
Gosh, seriously...

323
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,140
Hey, Hee Tae. What are you doing here?

324
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,810
What do you want to do? Do you want to be humiliated here in front of everyone?

325
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,450
Government-funded professors must resign!

326
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,170
- Government-funded professors must resign!
- Government-funded professors must resign!

327
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,590
Gosh.

328
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,690
- Myeong Hee.
- Myeong Hee!

329
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
What happened? Why do you have a concussion?

330
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,820
No, I'm totally fine, but this guy dragged me here anyway!

331
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,010
She was fooling around on the edge of a rooftop and fell.

332
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,000
Hey! I only fell because you grabbed me!

333
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,660
Both of you be quiet!

334
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,540
So did you get a CT scan?

335
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,980
Yes, everything's fine based on the CT scan, except for a minor concussion.

336
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,250
Myeong Hee, please help me leave soon.

337
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,840
- The protest must be heated right now.
- You're still trying to play hero?

338
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,780
Hey. The protest will continue just fine without you.

339
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,900
- Stop it, seriously!
- Both of you, stop it!

340
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:02,070
I'll go check and see if you can leave, so wait here.

341
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,270
- You little–
- Will you–

342
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,730
- Don't you dare fight, you two.
- Okay.

343
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,810
I should just...!

344
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,710
Behave, okay?

345
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,630
I said, stop it.

346
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,700
Stop it!

347
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,700
- Why is there so much dust?
- Did you just hit me?

348
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,320
What? No, I didn't.

349
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,530
Don't you think they're pretty similar?

350
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,340
Couples like that may fight sometimes, but they live well.

351
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,040
I'm serious, stop it.

352
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,390
- Hey, I'm being serious.
- Why? What?

353
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,760
Myeong Hee.

354
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,100
I wasn't going to wait for you.

355
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,170
I just had some business at the hospital and the timing–

356
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,770
- What about Soo Ryun?
- I don't know. She probably went somewhere.

357
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,390
You're hungry, aren't you? Should we get something to eat first?

358
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,200
Then I can sing you the song I wrote, like I promised yesterday.

359
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,430
I don't like that.

360
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,370
- What do you mean?
- You're going to tell me that we shouldn't meet anymore. I don't like that.

361
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,540
Did you know that your fathers are discussing your marriage?

362
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,390
Both you and Soo Ryun have a lot to figure out.

363
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,600
I don't want to make things any worse for you guys.

364
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,780
Forget me and Soo Ryun. What about you?

365
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,760
Tell me how you feel, and I'll make everything simple.

366
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,250
I'm going abroad to study.

367
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,920
What?

368
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,360
That's what I was trying to tell you yesterday.

369
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,860
I'm leaving in a month.

370
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,740
I only went on that blind date with you to earn my airfare.

371
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,890
When... When will you come back?

372
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,990
My plan is to move there permanently.

373
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,000
So let's not do anything we'll regret later on.

374
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
Let's end this here

375
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,140
so we can only remember the good things.

376
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,180
Wait, Myeong Hee.

377
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,160
♫ Not sure who it's shining for ♫

378
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:04,560
I'm glad to have met you. I really mean it.

379
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,180
♫ I suddenly started to miss you ♫

380
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:19,110
♫ Because I couldn't see you ♫

381
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:27,920
♫ In my journal I keep ♫

382
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,150
♫ Writing your name ♫

383
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:40,290
♫ Night when the stars are strewn ♫

384
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:47,380
♫ A single starlight reminds me of you ♫

385
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:54,000
♫ I hid it in my pocket ♫

386
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,980
♫ I will deliver it to you ♫

387
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,740
A month?

388
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,330
At this point, even that's a really optimistic opinion.

389
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,700
Her recovery is slow. I can't say how long she'll hold out.

390
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,540
Can't she still be transferred?

391
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,250
That's beside the point.

392
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,980
She's unconscious. To her, it'll make no difference whether she's in Seoul or Gwangju.

393
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,240
Don't you think it's selfish to make her take this risk?

394
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,180
Hey. You seem to have many secrets these days.

395
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,890
What was that earlier? What's going on between you and Soo Ryun.

396
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,410
Why do you want to know that? I barely know her.

397
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,490
It didn't seem that way, though.

398
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,620
Do you like her?

399
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,590
Is it even allowed to develop romantic feelings for a comrade?

400
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,520
Nonsense. Stop being absurd.

401
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,640
Can you play something else already? You've been playing the same thing over and over!

402
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,280
This is plain torture!

403
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,530
My gosh. What is it now?

404
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,630
Why doesn't anything ever go my way?

405
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,370
Hey, is something up?

406
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,580
Let's pretend.

407
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,160
You met the person who is your destiny.

408
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,890
But she says she is going to leave in a month and never come back.

409
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,930
What would you do?

410
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,690
Did Soo Ryun say she's going somewhere?

411
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,970
I said it's not Lee Soo Ryun!

412
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,230
A destined love who is leaving forever.

413
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,730
Then I would give up.

414
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,640
Why?

415
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,500
It's better to feel regret your whole life than miss her your whole life.

416
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,120
I hate heartaches.

417
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,450
Just live the way you used to.

418
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,600
Do whatever you please. Isn't that your philosophy?

419
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:00,290
That's when it's my life. It's completely different when it involves someone else's life.

420
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,630
Wow. Our Hee Tae is all grown up.

421
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,700
You're even thinking of someone else.

422
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,950
If you have a headache, why not try the solution from our high school days?

423
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,360
Goodness. You startled me.

424
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,000
You're late.

425
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,790
Since when did you smoke?

426
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,580
This is...

427
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,020
Go to bed early. We have somewhere to go tomorrow.

428
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,110
Father, your lighter.

429
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,960
Keep it. Make sure you carry it at all times.

430
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,870
You said Father was going to bring your clothes to the dorms?

431
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,560
Yes, on the next market day.

432
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,120
Why are you wearing those and not your new shoes?

433
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,430
Yeah. It's hard to tie shoelaces.

434
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:17,710
They keep getting tangled.

435
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,290
You wear worn-out shoes because shoelaces are a hassle?

436
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,270
Wear these.

437
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,450
Come on.

438
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,970
I don't want to. I don't want to!

439
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,130
Puppy Kim.

440
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,880
It's all tangled! I'm screwed!

441
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,540
All the boys are jerks and the coach doesn't like me either.

442
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,890
If it's tangled, you can untangle it.

443
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:59,950
You can untangle the knots one by one, and retie them again.

444
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,800
If you leave them tangled from the beginning, only you will suffer.

445
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,500
Both shoes and training; running forward is the most important thing.

446
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,900
Jung Tae, are you mad that we didn't let you live in the dorms?

447
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,050
You know how your father is.

448
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,270
We were barely able to convince him about missing school and training.

449
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,740
No, it's not that.

450
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,130
I'll be back.

451
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,150
I'll come and pick you up before Father gets off work.

452
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,460
Don't come all the way to the dorms.

453
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,890
I'll come out here myself.

454
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,170
Hey, don't run!

455
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,670
[Changsoo Lodging]

456
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,150
Ju Bin, room 1.

457
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,220
Yes!

Yes.

461
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,280
Hwal Myung Soo, room 4. Let's train hard.

462
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,330
Yes!

463
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,430
- Attention.
- Attention!

464
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,070
- I can't hear you. Attention!
- Attention!

465
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,320
I'll give you 3 minutes.

466
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,500
Unpack your things and change into your training clothes.

467
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,330
Ready.

468
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,260
Quickly, quickly!

469
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,950
Yes, coach!

470
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,140
Jung Tae, are you also in room 4?

471
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,820
Out of all the rooms...

472
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,530
Get out of my way.

473
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,110
1 minute left!

474
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,370
The last one gets a punishment!

475
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,580
Change quickly!

476
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,500
Hey, Hwal Myung Soo.

477
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,570
What?

478
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,330
Take that off. Those are my clothes.

479
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,800
You and I have the same clothes. What are you talking about?

480
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,930
Give them to me.

481
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,700
Let go!

482
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,790
Give them to me!

483
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,350
I said let go of me!

484
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,780
- I said these are mine.
- Let go!

485
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,550
Let's come to our senses.

486
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,300
Let's come to our senses.

487
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,060
Let's come to our senses.

488
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,230
Let's come to our senses.

489
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,600
I can't hear you guys.

490
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,470
Do you want to do 10 more rounds?

491
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,370
Let's come to our senses.

492
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,690
Let's come to our senses.

493
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,790
Let's come to our senses.

494
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,540
Let's come to our senses.

495
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,850
If you leave them tangled from the beginning, only you will suffer.

00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,170
Let's come to our senses.

497
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,260
Let's come to our senses.

498
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,070
Let's come to our senses.

499
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,580
Let's come to our senses.

500
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,070
They even sent something from Gyung Joo Petroleum.

501
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,690
I know. There's limited space, so it'd be better to leave them here.

502
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,580
Yeah, yeah. That's perfect.

503
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,150
Oppa, no one else is supposed to come, right? Then I'm going to head out.

504
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,630
Where are you trying to run off to?

505
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,300
Family members should stay until the end.

506
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,730
Aunt is right.

507
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,690
What? Do you have another date?

508
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,900
You had a date?

509
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,280
You should have told me.

510
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,130
My gosh, Mr. Kim! You made it!

511
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,440
Is anyone here?

512
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,340
Gosh, Mr. Hwang!

513
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,290
I'm sorry we're a little late.

514
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,030
Congratulations, Hyung-nim.

515
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,420
Thank you.

516
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,630
Here.

517
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:16,450
But I heard you had a date. You couldn't wait and came to see her yourself.

518
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,380
My goodness. You keep showering us with such precious gifts and don't give us a chance to repay you.

519
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,500
You already gave us the most precious thing from your household, your daughter.

520
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,150
Myeong Hee!

521
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,930
I didn't know there would be

522
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,640
so many guests.

523
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,810
You didn't have to buy anything.

524
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,600
- Soo Chan, show Mr. Hwang around.
- Right.

525
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,870
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

526
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,940
Mr. Hwang, I'll give you a little tour.

527
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,730
This way, please.

528
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,040
Soo Ryun, what are you doing, leaving your husband alone?

529
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,730
Go and get him some coffee.

530
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,060
Aunt, what do you mean by husband?

531
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,030
I'll make the coffee.

532
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,040
Go take a seat.

533
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,920
Enjoy the food, everyone.

534
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,230
Yes, thank you.

535
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

536
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,360
[Changhwa Pharmaceuticals Aerial View]

537
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,980
You're buying a patent from abroad and producing them yourself.

538
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,440
Is this more cost-effective than importing?

539
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,850
Yes, of course.

540
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:58,250
If we no longer have to rely on imports, it will also help our national power.

541
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,910
You have such an amazing son.

542
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:06,260
It's easier said than done. We still have a long way to go.

543
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,090
We underestimated building a pharmaceutical factory. It costs a fortune.

544
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,440
We happen to have some in-laws who are looking into investing somewhere.

545
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,040
Shall I introduce them to you?

546
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,080
What?

547
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,310
We are thankful, but there is no need.

548
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,940
It is no longer someone else's affairs. It is family affairs now.

549
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,980
You are going to be our in-law soon.

550
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,570
Two cups of coffee, please.

551
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,090
Without the sugar.

552
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,750
Okay.

553
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,330
Isn't he...

554
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,960
the man-whore who is supposed to marry Soo Chan's sister?

555
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,710
From what I hear, he's not just a man-whore, but the son of a courtesan.

556
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,770
I feel bad for Soo Chan's sister.

557
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:02,220
No matter how unruly your daughter is, how could they marry her off to a guy like him?

558
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,140
But I still hear he's a med student. And he's got quite the looks.

559
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,700
He's the son of a courtesan. Of course, he's got to be good-looking.

560
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,560
Talk quietly. I bet he can hear you.

561
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,910
I was born out of wedlock,

562
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,220
but is that a bad thing?

563
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,950
Thanks to that, we grew up strong and funny, you and I.

564
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,350
My goodness. If you let this year go by, it'll be too late.

565
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,370
There's time for everything.

566
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,430
You won't be an eligible bachelorette forever. Why would you put it off?

567
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,410
Two cups of coffee.

568
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,560
Oh right. Thank you.

569
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,740
Miss, are you a bookkeeper?

570
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,790
I'm Soo Ryun's friend.

571
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,760
My gosh. You kept making coffee over there, so I thought you worked at a coffee shop.

572
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,560
Because you're pretty.

573
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,700
University friends?

574
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,830
Do you have a boyfriend?

575
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,530
She's my guest.

576
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,710
Is that so?

577
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,650
Myeong Hee, let's go out. I'll see you off.

578
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,270
Enjoy.

579
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,940
I'll leave first.

580
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,620
Aunt, we have something to do so...

581
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,110
We'll be off.

582
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,160
All right.

583
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,130
You should never force yourself to do what you're not used to.

584
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,420
If I keep forcing myself like this, I may actually fall ill. Let's end this here.

585
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,820
What?

586
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,150
Hey, you're also...

587
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,610
I'll give you three days.

588
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:12,290
Whether you tell the truth or another lie, do what it takes to deal with your family.

589
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,070
If it goes any further than this, then there's no getting out.

590
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,750
What will you do if I say no?

591
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,680
If you say no, I'll do as I please.

592
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,210
What? Med school?

593
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,860
Wow, Myeong Hee, you're really amazing.

594
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,040
It's nothing amazing.

595
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,310
The med schools here only admit those who will become doctors,

596
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,510
whereas everyone gets admitted in Germany, but few survive.

597
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,340
I have to do a good job once I start school.

598
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,090
People who are overly modest can be annoying.

599
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,090
So when are you leaving?

600
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,560
It's scheduled for one month from now.

601
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,940
What? One month?

602
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,240
It all depends on the situation, so it might change

603
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,290
but for now.

604
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:17,060
You're leaving too fast– I mean, earlier than I expected.

605
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,930
One month is really soon.

606
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,510
Oppa, you've got gray hair!

607
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,790
What? I've got gray hair?

608
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,190
Hold on, I'll pluck it.

609
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,100
Shall we go?

610
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,130
Myeong Hee.

611
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,720
You idiots.

612
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,180
I told you to interrogate him, not butcher him.

613
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,540
Who will take responsibility if things go south in this day and age?

614
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,520
We're sorry, sir.

615
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,260
Sir, please spare me.

616
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,160
Don't kill me!

617
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,250
Sit up!

618
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,610
Please, I really didn't do anything wrong.

619
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,120
Hey.

620
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,560
I really didn't do anything wrong! I did nothing wrong!

621
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,530
Dad.

622
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,690
I'm sorry, sir. We'll quickly...

623
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:53,660
Forget it. Have someone tail him.

624
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,040
The student council executive? We're already on it.

625
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,510
No.

626
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,990
My son.

627
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,940
My goodness, I'm in the main sector again.

628
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,830
It's already May. Time moves so fast.

629
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,890
[I'll pass the exam this year no matter what!]

630
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,360
Darn, a year has passed and I can still smell my brother's stink.

631
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,330
Dad!

632
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,140
Dad!

633
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,960
- Dad.
- What?

634
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,500
What is it? I'm busy.

635
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,360
Can you give me some of those mothballs? I need to get rid of that horrible stink.

636
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,640
I already put mothballs in that room a long time ago. Seriously.

637
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,180
- Come on.
- I'm so busy. Goodness.

638
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,830
Come on. Hurry.

639
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,990
Yes!

640
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,910
Yes, who is it?

641
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,420
Hee Tae.

What?

670

My dream is to become a radio producer. I want to produce a music show like ''Forgotten Nights.''

Oh, is that so?

672

But, Jin Ah, do you know?

673
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,830
I have to be good at Math if I want to become a producer?

674

No.

675

You're already destined to be good at math.

676

- I am?
- Yes.

677
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,240
Listen. Pythagoras, who is known for his famous theorem, was the first to create a scale.

678
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,980
And the father of music, Bach, composed songs based on mathematical calculations.

Do you know what that means?

680

It means that math is music.
