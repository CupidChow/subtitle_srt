00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,160
No, when did this happen?

2
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,650
The reservation at 4:00 p.m.?

3
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,910
Gamecock.

4
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,100
Sorry I'm late.

5
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,830
I'm Lee Soo Ryun.

[Episode 2: The Shoe that Fits Me]

7
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,630
Listen well and take notes.

8
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,100
99.9% possibility of rejection.

9
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,510
My special set of dating rules, created after many of these blind dates.

10
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,060
If you just do as I coach you,

11
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,830
getting rejected

12
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,150
is just a matter of time.

13
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,840
I'll have a coffee, black.

14
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,930
For me...

15
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,950
First, with your menu selection:

16
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,060
set the tone.

17
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,690
I'll have a beer.

18
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,870
One black coffee and a beer, understood.

19
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,670
You must like alcohol.

20
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,120
Yes, I can't live without it.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,690
You see, my hands tremble when I sober up a little.

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
All right.

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,660
[Beer]

24
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,070
May I have a sip?

25
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,260
- What?
- Because you are enjoying it so much.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,270
They have good beer here.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,000
For your reference, this could backfire if he loves to drink.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,180
So quickly make the next move, "The Modern Woman."

29
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,870
When it comes to men, not a single one of them

30
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,550
can stand any offense to the patriarchy.

31
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,510
You're here to find someone to marry, right?

32
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,760
That's usually the purpose of these blind dates, isn't it?

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,730
Did you come out for a different purpose?

34
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,370
No, I'm also here to find a suitable husband.

35
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,980
But my conditions are quite particular.

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,900
First of all, I have never done household chores and the likes.

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,030
Being a supportive wife? I can't.

38
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,660
Because my career comes first.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,810
Sounds good.

40
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,130
My ideal type is an ambitious woman.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,730
I also have no thoughts of having children.

42
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,230
Women should have children only if they want to. I have no intention of pressuring anyone about that.

43
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,920
I also have no plans to serve my in-laws.

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,930
You really don't have to worry about that one.

45
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,830
I am an outcast in my family.

46
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,770
Your conditions aren't as particular as I thought.

47
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,290
Looks like we are a good fit.

48
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,890
If he happens to be a scammer who responds positively to anything you say,

49
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,190
then you move on to the next level: "The Philosopher."

50
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,460
Avert your gaze

51
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,970
and sigh deeply as if everything was meaningless.

52
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,330
What exactly is this thing called marriage?

53
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,130
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,580
What a profound question.

55
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,590
But...

56
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,980
do you know you still haven't asked what my name is?

57
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,930
Your name is?

58
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,140
It's Hwang Hee Tae.

59
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,310
Hwang Hee Tae.

60
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,300
Hwang Hee Tae?

61
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,900
Are you the Hwang Hee Tae who was admitted to Seoul National University Medical School with top scores?

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
It appears you saw the banner.

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,490
Is there anyone in Gwangju who didn't see that banner?

64
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,150
"Congratulations to Hwang Hee Tae, admitted to Seoul National University Medical School with top scores."

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,970
I'm glad my father hung that banner,

66
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,190
seeing how you are expressing interest.

67
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,780
I have no interest.

68
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,350
Stop drinking on an empty stomach so we can leave and go get some food.

69
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,690
Food?

70
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,220
Yes, food.

71
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,140
If he suggests that you two go together to eat,

72
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,300
it means something went very wrong.

73
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,090
If that happens, so that he will reject you with no regrets,

74
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,760
you have to disturb his basic senses.

75
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,600
His sight, smell, and hearing.

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
Mobilize against all his senses

77
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,790
and offend them all.

78
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,410
Oh my, that scared me!

79
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,430
Guys who come to these blind dates

80
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,870
are all pretty much the same.

81
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,070
They all grew up pampered, after all.

82
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,630
Thank you.

83
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,660
All right.

84
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,730
What's wrong? Eat up.

85
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,410
You brought me here because you thought I wouldn't like it, right?

86
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,300
Excuse me?

87
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,940
I guess this was the best you could do, huh?

88
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,930
I know plenty of places that are even worse.

89
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,560
It looks like you did grow up pampered as the daughter of Changhwa Industries.

90
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,410
I am not...

91
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,380
the delicate "young master" that you are thinking of.

92
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,490
I grew up eating leftover drinking snacks.

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,360
What's wrong? Eat up.

94
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,060
If he eats well without being bothered,

95
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,800
then...

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
he is a very powerful enemy.

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,430
Why? That means he's a guy who likes cool, easy-going women.

98
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,120
If a guy like that saw us eating plain soup and rice...

99
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,650
But, Myeong Hee, it's all right.

100
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,410
There's a solution.

101
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,890
For guys who are into cool, easy-going women,

102
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,800
there is one thing that they really hate.

103
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,550
Let's go shopping.

104
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,660
Shopping? Right now?

105
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,890
I have an ironclad principle to shop once a day no matter what.

106
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,490
All right. Is there somewhere you want to go?

107
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,160
I have a shop I frequent, so let's go there.

108
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,490
Guys who are obsessed with cool, easy-going women

109
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,350
have conniptions when they even hear the letter "L" in "luxury."

110
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,050
Oh, dear! What to do?

111
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,500
I forgot my wallet.

112
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,970
Would you buy it for me?

113
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,240
To commemorate our first date.

114
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,860
All right. Pick whatever you like.

115
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,430
If he still acts like this is no big deal?

116
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,780
Then throw the next bait!

117
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,660
Would you show me the most expensive items here?

118
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,310
Would you take a look here?

119
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,720
These are the most expensive items here?

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,900
I don't know whether it's because they're expensive,

121
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,850
but I love all of them.

122
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,610
Soo Ryun?

123
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,130
Yes.

124
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,860
Pick all of them. Don't think about the money.

125
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,960
What kind of purse is worth my three months' salary?

126
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,530
Try it out.

127
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,830
It's the same brand as the clothes you're wearing,

128
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,960
so you can match it beautifully as a set.

129
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,230
No wonder it felt so familiar.

130
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,410
I have it at home.

131
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,490
I'll take a look at some other things, too.

[Madonna Boutique]

133
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,230
You said you didn't have a passport, and yet you bought a passport wallet.

134
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,680
You have such a unique taste.

135
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,910
I like buying unnecessary things.

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,020
Then, for today...

No, why are you–?

138
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,420
- Why are you getting in?
- To take you home.

139
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,690
Ah, what? It's all right. I can get home by myself.

140
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,120
My father ordered that I escort you right up to your front door.

141

We'll be heading to her place first, and then I'll head home.

142
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,100
All right. Where are we going?

143
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,930
Gwang-nim... I mean.

144
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,390
Please head to the Myeongdong neighborhood.

145
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,530
You must be busy because you're in school.

146
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,140
What kind of courses do you take in law school?

147
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,260
What kind of university students take classes at a time like this?

148
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,550
Because of the boycotts, everyone's taking time off.

149
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,980
Ah, I see. Taking time off...

150
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,680
So you must not be busy.

151
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,120
Then, what about you? You're an intern so you don't even have shut-eye time.

152
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,360
How do you have the luxury to go on a match-making date in Gwangju?

153
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,300
I have a lot of free time because I'm not an intern.

154
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,240
I haven't exactly graduated yet.

155
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,490
You haven't graduated yet?

156
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,300
Oh my! You must have failed your boards.

157
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,160
I heard sometimes one or two guys don't make it.

158
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,720
It's my first time seeing one in real life.

159
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,380
I feel bad about telling you because you like it so much, but...

160
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,920
I passed my board exams.

161
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,460
Then, what other reason is keeping you from graduating?

162
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,660
When we become closer, I'll let you know then.

163
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,720
This is enough, right? In front of the house. You can head out now.

164
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,330
This was the most entertaining day I've had as of recently.

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,570
Ah, and also... this.

166
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,630
What is this?

167
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,120
I thought you might need this during our next meeting.

168
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,670
Next meeting?

169
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,830
You said we had to see each other at least three times.

170
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,780
When should we meet again?

171
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,720
I'm not sure. When will I have time again?

172
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,110
Ah, are you... rejecting me?

173
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,850
No, that's not–

174
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,780
I hope you're not rejecting me. I want to keep seeing you.

175
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,520
Yeah, yes. Me too! Then you should head out now.

176
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,900
- Uh, we're seeing each other again, then?
- Yes, yes. Contact me, contact me.

177
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,370
But then, how will I contact you?

178

Mister, start up the car! Start it up.

179

No, but–

181
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,250
Ah, Soo Chan. Are you heading in now?

182
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,340
What is this? Why are you heading in with Myeong Hee?

183
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,390
We met outside the door. Should we have headed in separately?

184
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,400
But, Soo Ryun, didn't you go on a matchmaking date? Why do you look so shabby?

185
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,790
Looks like Myeong Hee went to the matchmaking date in your stead.

186
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,430
- What?
- What?

187
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,460
What?

188
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,540
I was just saying that because Myeong Hee looks different from usual.

189
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,800
It doesn't suit me, right? These are all Soo Ryun's. That's why.

190
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,700
They suit you. The clothes seem to have met their owner.

191
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,740
You must have gone somewhere.

192
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,130
What? Yeah, she went on a date. A date.

193
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,030
We're heading up then.

194
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,590
Date?

195
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,600
How did it go?

196
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,230
Even after you did as I coached?

197
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,200
He's not a normal guy, that one.

198
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,190
No matter what I did, he wasn't fazed.

199
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,070
Crazy bastard.

200
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,760
But what are all these?

201
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,110
Did you have to resort to the shopping stage?

202
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:45,080
For the sake of my consciousness, I chose the cheapest one I could find.

203
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,050
And this... I don't know. He gave it to me.

204
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,290
What are these heels? Try them on.

205
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,090
They fit perfectly! Wait! How did he know your shoe size?

206
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,630
- You're right.
- That bastard! What if he's a pervert?

207
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,060
You know, those perverts that are obsessed with only feet.

208
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,230
He did seem a little odd... but he didn't look like a pervert either.

209
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,180
First off, send these back.

210
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,780
Why?

211
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,640
Why? Are you sending him the "okay" sign with your feet?

212

- Next time, act a little more–
- That's it.

213

It's not like we have a connection or anything. It's harder for me.

And, for me, it doesn't matter whether it's three or even ten times.

Speaking of which. What are you going to wear next time around?

220
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,030
I need to pick out a few outfits in advance.

No. I don't think so.

Our family's prestige relies on this marriage.

226

She is a girl that goes around doing commie activities.

227

No, it's not like that.

412
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,670
The money must be because the factory went on strike. It's been a few months.

413
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,960
A strike?

414

No, but, if she comes to Gwangju.

419
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,000
What about her factory work?

420
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,950
Seok Chul isn't in the condition to work right now.

421
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,320
This isn't much, but...

Please add this towards your living expenses and medicine.

Well damn.

424
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,730
You think the cost of medicine is the problem here?

425

426
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,950

428
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,710

429
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,100
I heard the other household

430

431

Tell us.

451
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,930
You were the one arrested while holding all those flyers.

Everyone was hiding from being on the wanted list.

If all of you were to get caught, too—

So why not ask your father to get them off the wanted list, too?

Yes. We're all gathered here to fight.

And now you're arguing about our social positions as if you didn't know.

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,110
Elder?

470
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,000
How dare you jaywalk right in front of a police officer?

471
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,020
Aren't you the one who got arrested red-handed?

472
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,500
Is committing crimes your hobby or something?

473
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,150
Your father can't get you out of this one.

474
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,320
There is something called social reputation.

475
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,510
Those who have more should set better examples—

476
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,170
What I meant was...

477
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,010
Why is she crying?

00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,420

481
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,560
You know...

He's going to run in the National Sports Festival.

483

So please give me the best shoes you've got.

484
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,480

These ones.

487
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,850
And this one.

488
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,710
Pick the one that you want.

489
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,400
This one?

490
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,910
You don't take after your father. You have good taste.

491
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,300
Do you want to try them on?

492
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,240
Let's try the right foot first.

493
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,820
There you go.

494
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,180
But, Father,

495
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,870
I really don't need them.

496
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,120
- I guess he doesn't want to buy them. Forget it.
- No.

497
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,330
Let's try on the left foot.

498
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,400
You have to try running in them first.

499
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,600
Hurry and run before your dad changes his mind.

500
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,680
That's right. Try running.

501
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,670
How is it?

502
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,870
I think it's around here.

503
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,260
What is that, Father?

504
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,260
The recipient is

505
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,480
Kim Myeong Hee?

506
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,650
I brought it so I would know your sister's address.

507
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,040
Dad, did you write a letter to Sister?

508
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,650
Let me see that.

509
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,210
If I give it to her, you will save money on stamps.

510
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,210
Doing this to your father?

511
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,680
That tickles, boy.

512
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,680
It's sister. Sis!

513
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,590
I'm going to leave now. Here are your shoes.

514
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,950
I will bring your clothes to the training camp.

515
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,580
What? Aren't you going to greet Sis?

516
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,300
Your sister is waiting, so hurry and go.

517
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,200
Sis!

518
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,990
Lord, so that we can help those weaker than us,

519
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,170
please help us focus on virtuous business.

520
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,460
And within the power and abilities you've granted to us,

521
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,920
please help us fulfill the mission

522
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
that you've entrusted to us.

523
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,870
All this, in our Jesus Christ's name,

524
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,180
we pray ardently.

525
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,410
- Amen.
- Amen.

526
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,460
I apologize for being late.

527
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,990
So you're late. You should greet them properly.

528
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,390
Yes.

529
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,330
Hello.

530
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,110
I'm sure you're already familiar with me due to my father's boasts.

531
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,040
But it is my first time meeting you.

532
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,720
I am Hwang Hee Tae, the eldest son.

533
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,730
Just looking around this dinner table,

534
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,750
you are very blessed with your family, Mr. Hwang.

535
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,270
The prettiest wife in all of Gwangju.

536
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,230
And your son who attends the best university in our nation.

537
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,270
And your youngest son is so cute.

538
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,630
You must be so fulfilled with all your blessings.

539
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,520
I wonder what the second son's dream is.

540
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,580
Do you want to be a doctor like your older brother?

541
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,730
I...

542
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,500
In fact, today, Jeong Tae became the Jeonnam representative–

543
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,290
He said his dream is to become a soldier.

544
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,430
He wants to attend a military academy.

545
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,910
He's already training for it.

546
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,840
Taking after his father, isn't he?

547
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,030
What a family full of blessings.

548
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,250
Wait.

549
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,510
Don't scarf it down and burn yourself again.

550
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,470
Go ahead.

551
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,640
You know,

552
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,610
if anyone asks me to pick one thing to eat before I die,

553
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,890
I would pick the remen that you made for me, Noona.

554
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,680
Hurry and eat.

555
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,900
Eating it without even kimchi.

556
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,970
I told you I'd prepare dinner.

557
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,260
Gosh, thank you.

558
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:02,960
Eat up.

559
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,610
I'm home!

560
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,000
You're home?

561
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,240
Smells like ramen!

562
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,630
It's hot.

563
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,150
Who is this? Is this your hidden child?

564
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,940
Ouch!

565
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,760
You really have no filter!

566
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,960
He's my youngest brother.

567
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,030
He came to train for track and field.

568
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,490
Hello. I'm Kim Myeong Soo.

569
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:40,550
Unlike you, he has a gentleness to his personality.

570
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,320
Gentle, you say?

571
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,090
Take off your shoes

572
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,890
and wash up.

573
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,800
That hurts!

574
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,970
I am obviously hitting you so that it hurts.

575
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,120
I mean for it to hurt!

576
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,270
- You...
- I'll take off my shoes.

577
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,810
Here. Are we good now?

578
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,380
Sis, if you leave the country, when will you come back?

579
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,880
When your grandchild gets married, Myeong Soo.

580
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,020
You're leaving because you hate our family, aren't you?

581
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,760
What nonsense are you saying, suddenly?

582
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,970
Can you not go? If you go, you won't see me get my medal.

583
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,680
Father doesn't even know that you are leaving.

584
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,600
You shouldn't interfere with the business of your elders.

585
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:57,140
Just... I wish that you would make up with Father.

586
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,490
Like in the past.

587
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:06,000
You used to smile a lot at home, just like you do here.

588
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,440
Little guy...

589
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,290
Go to sleep.

590
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,460
Madam, please get home safely.

591
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,310
A couple more dinners and you'll even quit smoking.

592
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,660
I thought I had told you to not be late today. Where were you?

593
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,040
I was with Soo Ryun.

594
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,500
You encouraged me to see her soon. I will be seeing her again tomorrow.

595
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,460
Unni! Can I get–

596
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,950
You still haven't learned to tie your shoes when you'll be in middle school soon?

597
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,240
It's my first time wearing shoes with laces.

598
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,200
Don't tie it so tight. My feet will explode.

599
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,060
You have to tie it well so it doesn't come undone while you're running.

600
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,700
There.

601
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,920
Are you sure I don't need to go with you?

602
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,870
I'm not a baby. I'll look at the map.

603
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,770
You know I'm great at finding my way.

604
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,600
Sis, I'll be off now.

605
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,620
Be careful of cars and come right home when you're finished.

606
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,860
Well, lookie here.

607
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,170
Why are you dressed that way when the weather is so warm?

608
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,830
Well, I suffer from cold hands and feet.

609
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,390
Cold hands and feet.

610
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,110
I'll be back!

611
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,990
Who should I go with?

612
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,580
- Go with Nurse Choi.
- I wonder if she has time?

613
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,290
Myeong Hee! Are you going somewhere today?

614
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:32,390
Why are you so dressed up coming into the hospital? Who are you trying to impress?

615
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:37,110
It's not you, so continue smoking your cigarette.

616
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,910
That–

617
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,080
Rock, paper, scissors.

618
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,100
Rock, paper...

619
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,750
You're here for the training, right? Stand here.

620
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:08,830
He's–

621
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,730
Be careful, and make sure to eat all your meals.

622
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:16,060
- Don't overwork yourself. Call me, if anything happens.
- Okay.

623
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,130
Even his mom is beautiful.

624
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,700
She'd outshine even Jeong Yun Hui.

625
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,930
She must have become a mistress because she is pretty.

626
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:29,300
My mother said that Hwang Jeong Tae is a mistress' child.

627
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,260
A mistress?

628
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,790
Good to see you guys!

629
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:51,230
I am the coach that will be managing your physical training and living quarters.

630
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:52,830
My name is Park Cheol Beom.

631
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:57,040
I will make sure that this month of May will be

632
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,150
the hottest time of your lives,

633
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:04,140
through the Spartan training.

634
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,240
And now, group yourselves by your event.

635
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,890
- Attention!
- Attention!

636
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,430
Look at your movement!

637
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,600
Are you two wearing the same shoes?

638
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,080
It's not the same. You can tell his are cheap.

639
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,800
- What?
- They're fake.

640
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,910
You bought these at the marketplace, right?

641
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:39,710
Why do you care what I buy from where?

642
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Hey, don't you smell that beggar scent?

643
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,200
What?

644
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,430
You jerk.

645
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,470
You there, Hwal Myeong Soo, Hwang Jung Tae.

646
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,570
Come here!

647
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,770
Our best sponsor is also our youngest.

648
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,230
I will make sure to spend your money on good causes.

649
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,950

651
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,430
Thank you.

652
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,010
We should be thanking you.

654
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,800
Excuse me. When will you check on this?

655
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,270
One second!

656
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,310
Please, give me a moment.

657
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,040
Nurse.

658
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,510
You're working so hard.

659
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,310
Soo Chan Oppa, why are you here?

660
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,610
Are you hurt?

661
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,940
I come here often, even if I'm not sick.

662
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,930
You're almost done with work, right?

663
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:25,500
I'll be waiting outside. Let's have dinner.

664
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,020
What should I do? I have an appointment with someone today.

665
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,310
Appointment?

666
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,620
Oh, that date from last time?

667
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,950
It's not a date. Actually...

[Emergency Room]

669
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,470
Um, Oppa, I'm working right now.

670
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,330
Oh, right! I bothered you when you're busy. Sorry.

671
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,900
Work hard.

672
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,940
Please be on your way.

673
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,700
Thank you.

674
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,200
Excuse me.

675
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,260
Which utensil should I use to eat? There are so many.

676
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,940
This is the salad fork.

677
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,760
You can use this for the main dish.

678
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,660
Thank you.

679
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,630
Aren't you used to these things?

680
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,800
I thought you came from a rich family.

681
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,410
I don't know much,

682
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,840
but we're here because I heard it's expensive and famous.

683
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,920
I wanted to win some brownie points from you, Soo Ryun.

684
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,990
Oh, right. Token.

685
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,090
What are these? Brass coins?

686
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,860
Anyway,

687
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,940
whenever I see you, I feel like I'm catching up on all the smiles I missed out on in the last few years.

688
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,440
You say things like that to all the girls you see, don't you?

689
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,570
No. This is my first time.

690
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,780
After living intensely every day,

691
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,170
it's like a breath of fresh air when I see you.

692
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,840
You're most definitely a special person.

693
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,900
Yes, I am the daughter of Cheonghwa Industries. Of course, I am special.

694
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,930
The shoes I gave you last time, did they fit well?

695
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,900
Well, actually...

696
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,100
This is nice, isn't it?

697
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,640
It took a month to make a reservation.

698
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,300
Wow, why'd you go through all that trouble for?

699
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,120
Why? Shall I order something else?

700
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,240
I suddenly feel thirsty.

701
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,000
What kind of drink do they have?

702
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,220
I can't believe it's just us two

703
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,910
Is your hand trembling? Shall I order some beer?

704
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:35,200
No, I'll just have water.

705
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,060
Go on and eat.

706
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,500
You can come with her next time.

707
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,070
"Her" who?

708
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:44,220
You know, that nurse from the ER that you're hitting on.

709
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,520
That cold-hearted girl.

710
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,770
Oh, her? Cold-hearted, my foot.

711
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:51,970
It turns out she's a total vixen.

712
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,510
She's just wagging her tail to marry into a rich family.

713
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,330
What a true surprise.

714
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,640
You know, that guy who supplies our hospital with imported medicine.

715
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,310
Don't force yourself to eat. You'll get sick.

716
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:07,040
- I'm not feeling well...
- But you know,

717
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,640
- Can we...
- no matter how hard she tries, no rich man will want her.

718
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,610
Shouldn't a person know their place?

719
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,220
- You know what I mean, right?
- Soo Ryun,

720
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,960
- I'll go get some water.
- Why is she trying so hard?

721
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,130
Let's just choose our menu.

722
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,700
I'll have the New York steak course.

723
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,530
I'll get the same thing.

724
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,240
What the...

725
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,940
- Are you crazy?
- Oh my goodness.

726
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,740
I'm sorry, it must've slipped from my hand.

727
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,010
How could it have slipped on my head?

728
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,960
I'm so sorry, I'll pay to get it cleaned.

729
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,070
I can't believe this.

730
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,850
Hey, Myeong... wait...

731
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:54,240
Use this to get it dry-cleaned and watch your mouth from now on.

732
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,700
Soo Ryun!

733
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,740
Are you okay?

734
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,810
Can you get up?

735
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,910
I'm fine. It's just a sprain.

736
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,190
Let me carry you.

737
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,050
I'm fine.

738
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,890
I can walk.

739
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,130
How can you walk wearing this–

740
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,680
I said I can walk!

741
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,210
What are you doing?

742
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,320
You need treatment. Let's go to the hospital.

743
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,350
No.

744
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,730
Not the hospital.

745
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,000
Lift your foot.

746
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,820
Look at these flower petals.

747
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,600
I took an introductory course in botany,

748
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,900
and I bet all these flowers will wither by next weekend.

749
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,280
So that means...

750
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,340
we must meet again before next weekend.

751
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:51,920
Does your father keep forcing you to meet me?

752
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,280
I'm the daughter of Changhwa Industrial, so you must marry me, is that it?

753
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:09,520
To be honest, it wasn't my first time seeing you at the hotel.

754
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,760
I witnessed the car accident in front of the hotel.

755
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,660
The whole time I was waiting for you in the coffee shop, I was thinking

756
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:32,490
"Who cares about this date? I should've talked to that girl from earlier."

757
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,320
But then...

758
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,880
♫ I will hold your hands ♫

759
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,120
You walked in...

760
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,300
as my date.

761
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,300
♫ Make me feel complete ♫

762
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,880
You didn't have to be Lee Soo Ryun the daughter of Changhwa Industrial.

763
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,830
Uh...

764
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:49,490
Even if you were Song Mal Ja or Kim Bok Soon,

765
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,950
it would've made no difference to me.

766
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:56,720
♫ You're always there ♫

767
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:01,630
♫ I close my eyes ♫

768
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,070
♫ because of the blinding sunlight ♫

769
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:05,930
♫ Then people ♫

770
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,110
It's done.

771
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:12,340
♫ whisper silently ♫

772
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,890
♫ I breathe heavily once ♫

773
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:19,520
♫ I breathe heavily twice ♫

774
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,170
♫ It comforts me who couldn't breathe at all ♫

775
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:26,030
I can see that you received good training.

776
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,180
If only you had passed the exam, you would've made a great doctor.

777
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,780
Gosh. I said I passed.

778
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,360
Why can't you believe me?

779
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,950
It's not that I failed to graduate. I chose not to.

780
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,030
Why would you choose not to?

781
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,300
Do you want to know why?

782
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:52,030
But If I tell you, it'll mean we're close.

783
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,800
I'm entering the University Song Festival.

784
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,460
What?

785
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,000
If I graduate, I can't attend.

786
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,690
I can only enter it because I'm still a student.

787
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:32,170
I can sing for you sometime. Can we meet again before the flowers wither?

788
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,490
Is it self-composed?

789
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,300
Yes.

790
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,870
Then I'd love to.

791
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,970
The more I think about it, the madder I get.

792
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:22,420
To think how proudly they pointed their finger at me like they were independence fighters or something.

793
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,420
They'd find fault with whatever you do. Don't let it bother you.

794
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,130
What's in the bag?

795
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,790
I wanted to return what I wore.

796
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,830
I'll return the blouse after I wash it.

797
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:45,070
Did you see him?

798
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:50,060
When? Where? I ignored his calls.

799
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,020
I happened to see him.

800
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:57,170
I couldn't get a hold of you, so I met up with him.

801
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:00,470
I couldn't answer the phone because I was too upset.

802
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,880
Nothing happened, right?

803
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:07,950
We made plans to see each other again soon.

804
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,310
But I don't feel comfortable about continuously lying to him.

805
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:16,810
Why did those punks have to kick at the tofu I brought?

806
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,830
They could've just returned it to me if they didn't want it.

807
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,430
Sorry, what makes you feel uncomfortable?

808
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:32,910
We made plans to see each other again soon.

809
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,360
You don't have to see him anymore.

810
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,930
Huh?

811
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,560
That's enough.

812
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,450
I only asked you to meet him to get those punks out.

813
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:51,430
I'll give you money for the airplane ticket as I promised, so don't you worry.

814
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:55,710
Myeong Hee, you went through a lot because of me.

815
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,870
Soo Ryun! Come down for a second!

816
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,930
You didn't have to bring all this.

817
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:12,760
Soo Ryun, hurry up!

818
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,210
Mr. Hwang sent us this precious gift.

819
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,590
A present? What present?

820
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,670
His son brought them over himself.

821
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,120
You must be surprised that I came without notice,

822
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,260
Soo Ryun.

823
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:56,430
[Youth of May]

824
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:09,470
This is Mr. Hwang 's son

825
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,630
- Myeong Hee, you two are well acquainted, right?
- Huh?

826
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,870
What plans brought you here?

827
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:14,330
I came to ask about your plans.

828
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,310
I wanted to apologize.

829
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,060
You know Myeong Hee?

830
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,160
Can you write your number here ?

831
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,820
I'll write it with a permanent marker.

832
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,640
Are you here to order rice cakes for your wedding?

833
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,500
Marriage?

834
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,380
It seems like our parents are talking about it.

835
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,090
My in-laws are looking for a business to invest in.

836
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,890
Hee Tae! How did you know how to come here?

837
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,500
- Hold on.
- Can you drink well?

838
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,510
I'll have just one drink, Father.

839
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,820
Are you drunk?

840
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,430
Can you sit next to me for a bit before I go?
