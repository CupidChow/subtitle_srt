1
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,080
Your heart returning back to May of that year

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,910
is not a strange thing at all.

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,170
Even if you lose an umbrella that you cherish,

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,910
you think about that umbrella every time it rains.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,240
Let alone,

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,860
if the season you lost your loved one returns each year...

7
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,320
of course,

8
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,670
our heart goes back to that time.

9
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,870
Just as if it happened yesterday.

10
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,840
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but...

11
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,380
Yes.

12
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,190
Did you get my text message?

13
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,130
We found them.

[Episode 12: The First May]

15
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,730
Sorry! Sorry!

16
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,130
Please, save me!

17
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,300
Here! There's a kid over here!

18
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,350
Oh, my!

19
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,020
Don't look at it!

20
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,760
Your writing is so small that I can't see it anyway.

21
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,170
What's the point of writing it so small when we're going to read it to each other anyway?

22
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,470
Can't we forego the prayer?

23
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,990
Isn't the exchange of vows enough?

24
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,390
There's no officiant or guests.

25
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,370
And we didn't prepare outfits, wedding gifts, or anything.

26
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,010
We need to exchange something for our wedding.

27
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,720
I'm not good at writing long texts.

28
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,640
Who said to write something long?

29
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
Just write your expectations.

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,580
The power of our prayers is probably really good because He feels bad about us marrying with nothing.

31
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,860
What about you, Hee Tae? Why aren't you writing anything?

32
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,550
I already memorized it. There's a prayer that I say every day.

33
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,500
What do you pray for?

34
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,480
When I die...

35
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,390
I want you to be buried with me.

36
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,900
As in buried alive with you? Pray for something else!

37
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,060
You said your prayers are powerful!

38
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,660
Then you can pray that you won't be buried alive.

39
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's put to test whose prayers are heard.

40
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,790
What are you doing in my office?

41
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,090
We got a tip that your son is closely connected

42
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,210
to the main suspect of this incident.

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,470
I think you are mistaken. The suspect only said—

44
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,270
Stop. You can defend yourself during the investigation.

45
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,410
An inspector...

46
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,230
should always stay objective.

47
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,600
Until the investigation is over, I will take charge of the steering wheel.

48
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,200
All right! Next up, is the exchange of vows from the bride and groom.

49
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,010
Starting with the groom.

50
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,670
Yes!

51
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,150
I, Hwang Hee Tae, accept Kim Myeong Hee as my wife.

52
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,900
Forever, with love and respect, I will cherish her.

53
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,100
I solemnly swear before the Lord.

54
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,970
Does the bride, Kim Myeong Hee, who's known to be terrible with words, swear the same?

55
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,330
Your voice is too little!

57
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,210
Yes!

58
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,510
That's good.

59
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,080
All right. Then, lastly, the bride and groom will exchange their prayers.

60
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,480
I heard that the bride was tormented by the agony of creation.

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,340
Shall we hear it?

62
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,790
Why doesn't the groom that memorized it already go first?

63
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,100
All right.

64
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,110
Lord,

65
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,030
no matter what happens,

66
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,070
we will not let go of these hands we finally get to hold. I pray we can overcome the hardship.

67
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,380
More than anything, I pray that you give me

68
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,450
worse pains instead of Myeong Hee.

69
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,940
In God's name, I pray.

70
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,040
Amen.

71
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,140
Amen.

72
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,090
Darn it. My prayer's sloppy.

73
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,390
You said you'd pray that I be buried alive with you.

74
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,170
I, Kim Myeong Hee...

75
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,130

76
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,940

Sister.

79
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,960
No.

80
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,710
That can't be my father.

81
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,320
Hee Tae, take a look.

82
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,410
My father isn't that small.

83
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,850
Father.

84
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,980
Father, wake up.

85
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,550
Stop playing around and wake up.

86
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,510
It's cold. Why are you laying down like this?

87
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,110

88

How...

90
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,870
How could you do this?

91
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,320
Till the end...

92
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,940
Why do you make me suffer like this till the end?!

93
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,480
No. I can't let you go like this, Father!

94
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,490
Father!

95
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,790

So, you're telling me...

100
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,050
our son hasn't died but has been arrested?

101
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh, my!

102
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,090
But...

103
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,720
didn't you say you were arrested with him? How were you released?

104
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,310
I was, w-well...

105
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,110
Brother!

106
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,720
If it's because you feel guilty—

107
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,080
Three days.

108
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,130
The world I believed in crumbled in just three days.

109
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,500
I was dragged away and treated like an animal.

110
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,390
When I was released alone, thanks to Mr. Hwang and lied down in my bed,

111
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,980
do you know what I thought?

112
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,220
I felt comfortable.

113
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,410
I didn't even know if the people who were arrested with me were dead or alive.

114
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,610
But I felt so cozy and comfortable.

115
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,430
That's why I feel ashamed.

116
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm ashamed of lying down, eating,

117
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,460
and even wearing this kind of suit and breathing this air.

118
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,880
I feel like a total coward.

119
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,340
I'm so embarrassed I could die!

120

there's nothing we can change,

but there are still things we can do.

123
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,440
I'll go find a way to contact your family in Naju

124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,370
and ask about the funeral procedure.

125
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,150
Myeong Hee, you stay here by your father's side.

Myeong Hee, this is a savings account of the money that you've been sending.

131
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,190
It's in your name.

132

All you need to do is take your stamp to find the money.

133
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,260
Myeong Soo said this one time...

134
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,890
That the runner who runs way in the front

135
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,020
does nothing but block the wind for the others.

136
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,090
He said it was your loss if you stood in the front from the beginning.

137
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,160
Perhaps, I lived my life...

138
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,520
always in the front blocking the wind with my whole body.

139
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,620
I was that runner who was in the front.

140
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,180
I was afraid you'd be hit by the wind like me.

141
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,560
What if your wings were hurt from the hardships of this world?

142
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,930
I hoped you wouldn't stand in the front like me...

143
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,880
and always tried to hold you back.

144
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,420
But your wings were strong enough to endure any kind of wind.

145
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,970
If I just let you be,

146
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,770
you would have ridden the wind and flew up high into the sky.

147
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,040
Since everything that happened wasn't your fault,

148
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,640
just leave it behind with me.

149
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,930
And from now on, let your wings carry you freely...

150
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,290
wherever you want to go.

151

She's currently at Sangmugwan with your son.

152
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,220
Don't send our own men. Use one of our spies in the militia to get rid of her.

153

Make it look like an internal conflict broke out and do it near the government building.

154

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

168
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,770
I have an urgent message for you.

169
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,730
Hwang Hee Tae asked you to come quickly to this location.

170
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,440
[Message from Hwang Hee Tae: Come to the service center now.]

171
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,110
Hee Tae did? For what reason?

172
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,670
I got this as a message, so...

173
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,060
Since it's the service center, I guess it's about the funeral.

174
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,290
[Divorce Agreement]

175
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,210
Divorce?

176
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,130
- Are you crazy?
- I'm the most sane I've ever been.

177
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,280
I won't put up with this nonsense.

178
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,300
I'll mail you the papers again. If you want to talk to me, contact Attorney Choi from now on.

179
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,770
I'm going to take Jung Tae.

180
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,710
If you're going to leave, go by yourself. I have no intentions of giving you any child support.

181
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,770
Then we'll have Jung Tae choose who he wants to live with.

182
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,490
What? Choose?

183
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,710
Jung Tae, come down!

184
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,760
You better stop crossing the line.

185
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,820
Jung Tae! Hwang Jung Tae!

186
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,330
Ma'am, your son left urgently a while ago.

187
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,630
What's wrong?

188
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,350
Excuse me. Have you seen the girl that was over there?

189
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,490
Did you miss each other? She left as soon as she received the message.

190
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,260
What message?

191
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,160
You sent her a message to come to the service center.

192
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,130
Kim Myeong Hee! You're here to see Hwang Hee Tae, right?

193
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,350
Yes. What's wrong?

194
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,210
The militia got the long-distance calls working again. Let me show you the way.

195
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,200
Go straight and make a right.

196
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,500
What is this bastard?! Let go!

197
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,790
- Jung Tae!
- Noona!

198
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,640
Noona, run!

199
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,950
I said, let go!

200
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,060
Jung Tae!

201
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,960
- Jung Tae!
- Jung Tae! Jung Tae!

202
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,470
Which bastard is it? Who said to shoot my kid?

203
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,650
- Who did this to my son?!
- It's you again?

204
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,020
Is this what you did for your family?

205
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,170
What have you done now?

206
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,510
- Jung Tae!
- Don't come any closer!

207
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,770
Don't lay a finger on us.

208
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,040
Hee Tae.

209
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,340
You brought your car. Right, Mother?

210
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,800
Let's get to the hospital first.

211
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,740
Jung Tae, can you hear me?

212
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,990
Jung Tae!

213
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,890
Jung Tae... Jung Tae!

214
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,350
The orphan is not me but you.

215
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,940
No one will choose you to be their family.

216
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,430
Soo Ryun, bring that over there.

217
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,670
Load it all up.

218
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,730
I have another rat in my storeroom now.

219
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,930
Father.

220
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,210
Did you two decide to consider me a living corpse now?

221
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,490
Father, it's not like that.

222
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,310
I insisted we do it.

223
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,070
When I was little, you said this to me all the time.

224
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,730
"It's pointless to prosper alone."

225
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,160
"We should grow together with the City of Gwangju."

226
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,950
I admired you for that and it really made me proud of our company, Changhwa Industrial.

227
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:41,080
In my opinion, right now is the time.

228
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,340
What can you possibly do with a cartful of supplies? Open all our storerooms.

229
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,920
Take everything we have.

230
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,870
Father!

231
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,980
Where did my sister go?

232
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,200
Oh, are you awake? Your sister went to see Hee Tae real quick.

233
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,450
My goodness! You still can't reach Mr. Park?

234
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,970
The phone lines are cut off and the roads are blocked. There's no way we can reach someone outside the city.

235
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,320
Then, will she be cremated right away? There won't even be a funeral?

236
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,310
What can we do?

237
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:07,130
Dead bodies are still pouring in. We can't keep her here much longer.

238
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,890
Poor woman. She can't even see her family one last time.

239
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,080
I feel so sorry for her.

240
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,640
Mother... Grandma...

241
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,210
Do you have a map?

242
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,770
The map you gave my father last time.

243
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,860
Map? Why do you need a map all of a sudden?

244
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,050
Excuse me. Can I report a missing person here?

245
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,550
No, not here.

246
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,420
Just a second. Why don't you try at the provincial government office?

247
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,710
Thank you.

248
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,890
Shouldn't we be there until Jung Tae is out of his surgery?

249
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,170
The doctor said he'll pull through. Once your father—

250
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,720
Myeong Hee, Myeong Soo...

251
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,190
Myeong Soo disappeared.

252
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,610
What?

253
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,530
He probably went this way.

254
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,210
I'll look that way just in case.

255
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,180
Try not to go this way since the army is standing post there.

256
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,220
- Myeong Soo.
- Myeong Soo!

257
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:00,070
- Kim Myeong Soo.
- Kim Myeong Soo!

258
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,060
Myeong Soo!

259
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,110
- Myeong Soo!
- Kim Myeong Soo!

260
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,050
Gosh, where did he go?

261
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,100
Myeong Hee.

262
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,510
The road splits.

263
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,260
I'll go this way. Myeong Hee, you look that way.

264
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,270
Sun Min told us not to go that way.

265
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,740
It's not marked on Myeong Soo's map, so there's no knowing which way he went.

266
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,320
Then, I'll go that way. Hee Tae, you go this way.

267
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,470
Did you already forget my wedding prayer?

268
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,360
I'm never going to do anything dangerous that will leave you behind.

269
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,840
I'll go quickly just to check if Myeong Soo is there.

270
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:10,510
Five minutes. Let's look separately for just five minutes and meet back here.

271
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,510
Just five minutes.

272
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:38,770
We'll meet here in five minutes, okay?

273
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,400
I'm sorry.

274
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,560
It's our business.

275
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,980
See you later.

276
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,480
Myeong Soo.

277
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,740
Kim Myeong Soo!

278
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,000
Put your hands up.

279
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,130
Look thoroughly!

280
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,630
Go to Naju first.

281
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,050
I'll be right behind you.

282
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,780
I don't want to.

283
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,880
I'm not going to go alone.

284
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,980
Kim Myeong Soo.

285
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,560
Father said he would be back too, but he didn't.

286
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,490
Let's go together, Sister!

287
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,270
It's more dangerous to go with you.

288
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,610
I'm a nurse, so no one will attack me.

289
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,560
I'll explain it well to the army men and follow right behind you.

290
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,480
On the count of 3, you're going to run to Naju without looking back.

291
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,790
- Got it?
- I don't want to.

292
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,650
I don't want to!

293
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,840
Kim Mutt!

294
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,040
Listen to me carefully.

295
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,050
I'll follow right behind you.

296
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,510
Promise.

297
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,870
Promise?

298
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,510
You promise you'll come right after me?

299
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:04,770
Sister always keeps her promises.

300
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,580
Don't you know?

301
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,490
You're going to run on the count of 3.

302
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,340
1,

303
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,450
2,

304
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,000
3! Run!

305
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,970
What are you doing? Aren't you going to catch him?

306
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,790
I'll go get him!

307
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,050
That bastard, again.

308
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,360
No!

309
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,180
Go!

310
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,030
Hurry and go!

311
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,060
What are you doing? Go! Run!

312
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,410
Who is this bastard?

313
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,560
Seoul National University Medical School? What is an SNU med student doing here?

314
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,040
I'm from Gwangju.

315
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,760
I was here because it's my hometown.

316
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,390
Hey, cut it out.

317
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,790
You came here to lead a rebellion, didn't you?

318
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,340
No.

319
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,650
I'm really a Gwangju citizen.

320
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,340
If you look at my identification card...

321
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,830
Hey,

322
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,070
just shoot.

323
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,770
Hwang Hee Tae?

324
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,440
It is him.

325
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,390
The one who went to SNU with top marks. Hwang Hee Tae.

326
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,920
- Is he someone you know?
- He's a big brother from my neighborhood.

327
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,190
I'm a Gwangju citizen.

328
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,320

00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,290
I now realize that I was the one who chose to do all of that.

493
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:03,720
In May of that year, I chose to go to Gwangju

494
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,870
and chose to love you with all my heart.

495
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:15,140
I prayed every day that worse pains in life

496
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,130
would come to me instead of you.

497
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:26,720
If I had been the one to die in the crossroads of life and death and you had lived,

498
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:33,270
you would've experienced the tides that I had experienced all this time.

499
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,160
The life of the one who was left behind.

500
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,720
Hence, I've finally realized...

501
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:47,680
that what I experienced all this time was the Lord's way of answering my prayer.

502
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,430
Those lonely and painful 41 years were merely...

503
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,030
my love for you.

504
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,820
[To Grandpa Myeong Hee]

505
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:27,420
The remaining years of my life will be an answer to your prayer.

506
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:34,290
No matter how many more times the rising tide pushes me back to that May,

507
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,760
I have you here now.

508
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,750
Until the day we meet again, I'll keep on swimming.

From Hwang Hee Tae, of the First May.

517
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:40,190
Thank you for your love and support for the Youth of May.
