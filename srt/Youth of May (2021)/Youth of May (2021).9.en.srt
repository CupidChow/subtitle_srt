00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,650
We'll arrest everyone on the list before the night is over.

2
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,310
We must find out who is behind all this, so round them all up.

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,610
Every disaster is preceded by warning signs.

4
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,800
Spies from the North have infiltrated Gwangju to incite a coup.

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,330
If you encounter anyone who seems suspicious of defying the government, arrest them immediately.

- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

7
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,330
Just like you can smell gas before an earthquake,

8
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,580
and just like animals ascend the mountains before a tsunami.

9

- Stop right there!
- The strange, ominous feeling-

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,610
that only those who are sensitive can pick up.

13
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:33,210
Because I grew up with anxiety, I was always sensitive and alert.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,210
And now that I had someone to protect, I had to be more alert to sense such warnings.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,710
Why are you praying first thing in the morning?

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,780
I prayed that

00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,940
you wouldn't snore.

18
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,130
Liar.

19
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,190
Do I snore?

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,370
Sleep some more.

21
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,420
It's still early in the morning.

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,400
Why are you changing the subject? I asked you if I snored.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,500
You don't snore.

- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

27
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,540
I was wondering why it was so quiet for a few days. I guess we'll cry our eyes out again.

28
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,620
If they want us to do this, shouldn't they at least give us some gas masks? Goodness.

29
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,400
I'd like to report a missing person.

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,050
My goodness! You lost a kid so early in the morning? How old?

31
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,390
Well, it's not a kid.

32
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,020

So, the missing person is a 26-year-old woman.

No, it's a man.

Oh my! So your friend is missing.

Come on! I bet she's just busy.

They're probably looking around real hard to find a new house.

Gosh, they're not babies.

They're probably doing just fine.

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,060
Jung Hye Gun!

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,220
You—

99
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,360
Hwang Hee Tae?

100
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:36,480
Hye Gun told me to come over last night, and we were supposed to meet here.

101
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,650
But when I came, this place was totally empty.

102
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,760
The door wasn't locked, and the chairs were all busted up.

103
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,580
They enforced martial law nationwide last night.

104
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,440
The martial law was in effect the whole time anyway.

105
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,530
Are you stupid?

106
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,680
This means that the new military regime is on the verge of starting a coup.

107
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,390
I know. But what does that have to do with Hye Gun's disappearance?

108
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm afraid the Defense Security Command is behind this.

109
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,300
So I was thinking—

110
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,960
No.

111
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,680
What? I didn't say anything yet.

112
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,090
It's obvious.

113
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,670
You want me to ask my father if Hye Gun was taken, right?

114
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,070
Do you still not know what kind of man my father is?

115
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,910
If I ask him, he won't stay still and make matters ten times worse.

116
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,730
Things will turn more dangerous if I get involved.

117
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,830
Then, what will you do now?

118
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,320
You said Myeong Hee will be in danger if she gets involved with you.

119
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,280
That's why Myeong Hee and I are leaving today.

120
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,690
What? Where to?

121
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,170
Anywhere. As long as it isn't Gwangju.

122
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,540
If you're going to keep fighting, go do it in Seoul.

123
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,190
If you're thinking of staying here, wear a hat at least.

124
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,690
Park Sun Min?

125
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,940
Where's Hye Gun? Did he not come home?

126
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,380

My little Mutt, you don't have training today?

128
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,850
We're human, too! Sundays are for resting.

129
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,700
Why are you here unexpectedly?

130
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:54,710
Myeong Soo, I'm... not going to be in Gwangju for a while.

131
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:01,310
What? Why not? Where are you going? When are you coming back?

132
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,030
I'll call you at your dorm later.

133
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,350
Sis, you're going to study abroad, aren't you?

134
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,020
You said last time that you wouldn't go.

135
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,510
I'm not studying abroad.

136
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,110
I promised I'd watch you run at your competition.

137
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,480
I keep my promises all the time. You know, right?

138
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,990
Are you going by yourself?

139
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,390
With a friend.

140
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,010
Then, it's fine.

Goodness.

143
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,570
We need to take a detour because of the protest. Passenger headed to Geumnam-ro or Gwangju Station

144
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,900
- need to get off at this stop...
- Those darn demonstrations.

145
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,980
Don't they ever get tired of it?

146
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,420
- Darn it.

- Follow me!
- Let go! I told you I'm not a college student!

152
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,580
I told you! Do you think this is a joke?

What are you guys doing! Catch them!

Are you okay? Are you hurt?

158
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,560
I'm all right, but what is going on?

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,820
I don't know. I heard something about martial law. The situation seems pretty serious.

160
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,850
Let's go to the train station. If we take a detour, avoiding the main street, it should be okay.

161
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,190
- Hee Tae! Hee Tae!
- What? What's wrong?

162
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,840
Damn. What is this?

163
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,560
I told you I'm okay.

164
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,050
Hey, Myeong Hee. What brings you here?

165
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,330
Hello. I'm seeing you often.

166
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,130
- Myeong Hee, why are you here? Aren't you off today?
- As a guardian.

167
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:41,470
What? Who's this man that Myeong Hee is the guardian of?

168
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,730
Seeing you have a guitar, is he a singer? But seeing his head, he looks like a college student.

169
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,160
My boyfriend.

170
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,090
Boyfriend? Myeong Hee, your boyfriend?

171
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,840
Yes, so can you hurry and check him?

172
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,020
Uh-Uh... Yes. Take a seat.

173
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,760
Let me take a look.

174
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,990
Stitches aren't necessary, but we should take a CT scan.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,280
Doesn't it take some time to take a CT scan?

176
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,320
It might not be till evening until we can take a CT scan.

177
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,270
All of the patients coming in have been patients with their heads getting hit.

178
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,880
Then, I'll just get it disinfected.

179
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you a doctor?

180
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,220
Myeong Hee's boyfriend, Hwang Hee Tae.

181
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,840
Why does your name sound so familiar?

182
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,460
It's from the banner! Are you that Hwang Hee Tae who went to SNU with top marks?

183
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,320
Oh my. Then, you are a doctor.

184
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,380
Then, according to his self-evaluation, just disinfect him.

185
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,920
Please take a CT. We'll wait.

186
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,500
Myeong Hee!

187
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,600
- Get the CT ready.
- Yes.

188
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,540
This is the CT room, right? What's the wait time—

189
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,480
Myeong Hee, I'm really okay. It's just a scratch!

190
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,650
But that scratch is on your head! You need a CT.

191
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,620
All right! Then! Let's get out of Gwangju first.

192
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,950
As soon as we arrive in the other city, I'll get a CT scan.

193
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,840
Why would you do that when we're at a hospital right now? You can't leave until you get a CT scan.

194
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,050
Myeong Hee, really!

195
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,560
Really what?

196
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,620
What's with that face?

197
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,260
If you have a problem, then you should say it!

198
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,870
Stay still!

199
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,700
Let me ask you once more. Who is behind the recent torch protest?

200
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,490
I told you already.

201
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,250
College students... It was all college students who came out voluntarily—

202
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,300
Are you kidding me?

203
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:16,440
I know there is someone behind you all who instigated the rebellion.

204
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,280
What are you talking about?

205
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:28,270
I've never even met such a person.

206
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,530
I guess I've been too easy on you.

207
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,650
Dunk him.

208
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,830
No! I'm sorry!

209
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,070
- Get off me.
- I'm sorry!

210
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,080
Go on in.

211
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,340
Gosh!

212
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,610
Here!

213
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,600
Eat that, at least. You didn't get to eat earlier.

214
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,910
Thank you.

215
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,580
If I were home, my dad would prepare so much food the table would collapse.

216
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,650
Do you live nearby?

217
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,290
I was born and raised here.

218
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,290
Anyway, I wonder how those spies crossed the border.

219
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,350
And why did they have to crawl all the way down here to Gwangju?

220
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,750
By the way, Corporal Lee.

221
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,920
How do we tell rebels apart from ordinary students?

222
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,790
Do you want to skip dinner tomorrow, too? Just follow the orders.

223
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,700
Sorry.

224
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,590
Always the smart ones.

225
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,800
They think too much.

226
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,560
- You don't have to stay here with me.
- Forget it. The test results aren't out yet.

227
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,490
I told you I'm okay.

228
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,940
You've waited a long time!

229
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,940
Here you go. Since you're a top student, I'm sure I don't have to explain anything to you.

230
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,510
Doctor!

231
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,060
Take it easy. I was just joking. It's a concussion.

232
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,150
Luckily, there's no internal bleeding. Are you still feeling dizzy and nauseous?

233
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,560
I'm perfectly fine!

234
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,440
But still, you shouldn't shake your head like that.

235
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,250
All right, then.

236
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,220
- What is this noise?
- Curfew.

237
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,460
What? It's not curfew time yet.

238
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,920
Didn't you know? With the martial law expanded, the curfew has been moved up.

239
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,390
Wait a minute. Then, what about us?

240
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,390
What about you? Spend the night at the hospital until morning.

241
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,730
What?

242
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't go out during curfew and come back with broken skulls.

243
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,890
There's a lobby and some empty rooms.

244
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,860
Hurry and empty that hospital bed, won't you?

245
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,250
I've never met anyone as stubborn as you.

246
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,430
I've never seen a grown man throw a tantrum like you either.

247
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,720
I didn't throw a tantrum.

248
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,260
If only we had gone straight to the train station when I said—

249
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,620
Then you would've thrown up on a moving train

250
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,260
from that concussion you have.

251
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,630
Exactly. If we'd stayed together this morning, I wouldn't have had a concussion in the first place.

252
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,330
So what? Are you saying it's all my fault?

253
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,470
No, that's not it.

254
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,540
I don't like your tone.

255
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,650
Whatever. Just hurry up and lie down. Come on.

256
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,560
I'll go check if there are any extra beds.

257
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,160
Wait a minute.

258
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,200
Why do you need an extra bed? We can share the same bed.

259
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,240
Have you lost your mind? We can't do that.

260
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,160
What are you talking about? Last night —

261
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,490
- Gosh.
- You're embarrassing me. Keep it down.

262
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,660
Last night, we shared a bed even smaller than this one. So what?

263
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,830
Fine. You sleep in this bed. I'll go find an extra bed.

264
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,550
Come on. Forget it.

265
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,030
I'll go, you're a patient right now.

266
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,160
Stop talking and lie down.

267
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,430
- I can help you.
- Just lie down.

268
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,440
What a stubborn woman.

269
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,850
I like that.

270
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,550
Hello.

271
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,740
Brother, it's me.

272
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,340
Soo Ryun, why is it so hard to reach you?

273
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,210
Sorry, I was a little busy.

274
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,950
What about dad? Is he okay?

275
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,610
Yea, he just took medicine and is sleeping now.

276
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,650
What about you? Is everything okay?

277
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,330
Of course. What about you?

278
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,410
I heard there was chaos in Gwangju today.

279
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,630
Hello?

280
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,580
Lee Soo Ryun, where are you right now?

281
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,260
Where would I be? I'm at my place in Seoul.

282
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,420
Then, hang up for a second. I'm going to call you.

283
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,990
You can't!

284
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,740
Hwang Hee Tae is sleeping.

285
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,370
He's a light sleeper.

286
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,360
And I'm going to sleep now, too. I'll call you tomorrow.

287
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,910
Good night!

288
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,000
Lee Soo Ryun!

289
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,520
Did it break earlier?

290
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,280
No, just a slight scratch.

291
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,880
Sorry, did you wake up because of me?

292
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,210
I had a dream.

293
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,810
Why? Did you have a nightmare?

294
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,550
It was about what we saw earlier in the day.

295
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,980
Why do you think the soldiers did that?

296
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,670
Myeong Hee, this is a secret...

297
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,850
but I've been hit by lightning before.

298
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,440
Really?

299
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes. I went underneath a car to hide from the rain

300
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,910
and it hit right next to my elbow.

301
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,510
Crazy, right?

302
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,290
I couldn't believe it either. So all I did was study how lightning works for a while.

303
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,700
But the reason was simple.

304
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,950
I was right next to a payphone, that's why.

305
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,000
So, even now, when it rains, I avoid phone booths.

306
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,460
The same goes for what happened today. It's like being struck by lightning.

307
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,650
We just happened to be standing next to a payphone.

308
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,430
Everything will be fine once we leave Gwangju tomorrow.

309
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,760
What if it's not just in Gwangju?

310
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,580
Don't worry.

311
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,110
My intuition is always on point.

312
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,380
I'm almost like a human canary.

313
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,460
Okay, Mr. Human Canary.

314
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,940
Yep!

315
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,630
Play the guitar. Make sure there's nothing wrong with the sound.

316
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:34,810
Okay. But promise that we'll go straight to the train station as soon as we wake up.

317
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,230
All right.

318
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,070
- Attention!
- Attention!

319
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,270

479
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,280
Sorry, excuse me.

480
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,400
[Nurse Station]

481
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,970
Send them to the OR in this order. For this, just suture the wounds.

482
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,370
Excuse me, Doctor. When will Kim Bong Seok get his surgery?

483
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,900
Kim Bong Seok...

484
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,820
Oh, we booked his surgery just now.

485
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,360
Really? Thank you so much.

486
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,070
Doctor, we need to book an emergency surgery.

487
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,080
A stab wound of the femoral artery.

488
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,060
What? What are you saying?

489
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,820
Who are you to change the order?

490
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm sorry, but we must prioritize emergency surgeries—

491
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,090
My son needs urgent care, too. He needs to undergo surgery immediately!

492
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,140
This patient will die if he doesn't undergo surgery now.

493
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,160
Sir, please let go of this and—

494
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,110
Who do think you are? The Almighty? Are you the Almighty?

495
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,860
Who are you to decide who should go first?

496
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,200
If my son dies because he can't get surgery now-

497
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,570
If my son dies,

498
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,530
will you take responsibility for it if he dies?

499
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,120
Will you take responsibility for his death?

500
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,900
Goodness, calm down!

501
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,330
This will only delay your son's surgery.

502
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,510
Hee Tae, we've finished triaging all the patients, so go back to ambulatory care.

503
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,760
- Let's go
- Thank you, doctor.

504
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,230
Ms. Kim Bo Yeon?

505
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,300
I'll first disinfect your wound and then do your stitches for you.

506
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,780
Hee Tae oppa!

507
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,730
Jin Ah.

508
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,090
Wow. Getting to see Hee Tae Oppa in a doctor's gown.

509
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,520
You have such clear and brilliant light around you.

510
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,310
Is this what you would call aura?

511
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,630
Will you shut up?

512
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,640
The stitches are done. Just wait for me to find an open CT scanner for her.

513
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,010
Wow, look at this precision.

514
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,510
It's like you used a sewing machine!

515
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,150
By the way, did you not get hurt at all, Jin Ah? Are you okay?

516
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,500
Nope! Unlike her, I'm quick!

517
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,550
You know you got hit on the head! Hard enough for me to hear it.

518
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,590
You got hit on the head?

519
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:39,590
It's no big deal. It was just like getting a little smack in class.

520
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,450
Let me see.

521
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,040
Follow my finger, Jin Ah.

522
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
Oh my goodness! Oh no, look at all this!

523
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,320
Wow, you crazy girl! Your friend is trying to treat you

524
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,720
and you get a nosebleed watching him move a bit?

525
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,440
Do you want to die?

526
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,350
Oppa, I'm not bleeding from excitement or anything!

527
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,760
Jin Ah, you need to get checked out too before you go.

528
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,960
Myeong Hee is over there so head there and ask her to look you over. Got it?

529
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,290
Doctor, this patient needs stitches as well.

530
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,820
Got it.

531
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,370
Make sure you get looked at!

532
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,080
Okay.

533
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,440
Gosh, what are we going to do?

534
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,930
Why? Did something happen?

535
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,020
I went to the new supermarket to get groceries for dinner.

536
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:44,300
The supermarket owner is from Gwangju. Apparently, there's chaos in Gwangju right now.

537
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,430
In Gwangju?

538
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,130
What kind of chaos?

539
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,500
Military men are everywhere in Gwangju.

540
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,910
It's like some kind of warzone down there.

541
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,900
What nonsense.

542
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,260
If there was a war, it would be at the frontline, why would it be in Gwangju.

543
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,450
I don't know.

544
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,740
Whatever the case, soldiers are beating young people and arresting them.

545
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,420
It's absolutely nuts down there!

546
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,300
Bo Yeon? It's time to move you for your CT scan.

547
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,140
Where's Jin Ah?

548
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,290
She went to make a call to my house real quick.

549
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,400
Did she get looked at?

550
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,230
Excuse me.

551
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,310
Oh, In Young! Is there any other public phone outside of this one?

552
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,870
There's one in the annex.

553
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,370
Go through that hallway.

554
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,360
Thank you.

555
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,370
I told her to get checked out. She never listens.

556
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,780
Her stubbornness, really.

557
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,540
Jin Ah!

558
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,170
Jin Ah!

559
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,710
Jin Ah? Jin Ah!

560
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,810
Hello?!

561
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,350
Is anyone there?

562
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,220
Hee Tae!

563
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,520
Please save Seok Chul!

564
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,730
Please save Seok Chul!

565
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,940
Jin Ah, what's your dream?

566
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,910
I want to be a radio producer.

567
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,220
Can you show me around Seoul?

568
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,300
I want to see all the tv broadcast stations. And your school!

569
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,570
A present for Teacher's Day.

570
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,780
So that you can write the grand prize song for the college music festival.

571
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,940
Hee Tae!

572
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,350
Save her. You have to save her.

573
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,660
In Young, have you seen Hee Tae?

574
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,300
He went to the annex to make a call home.

575
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,000
Why didn't he use the phone at the nurse's station?

576
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,590
Please.

577
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,490
Jin Ah, please.

578
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,790
You said you wanted to go to the TBC broadcasting station together.

579
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,920
Please come back.

580
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,910
Over here!

581
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,680
Somebody! Please help!

582
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Hee Tae!

583
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,980
Myeong Hee.

584
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,640
Myeong Hee, please call for help.

585
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,680
Jin Ah, please!

586
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,330
Please come back, please.

587
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,380
Jin Ah!

588
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,310
Jin Ah, are you awake?

589
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,140
Just bear with it for a moment.

590
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,560
Take your time.

591
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,000
Here, Sun Min.

592
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,350
Are you okay?

593
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,910
Please bear with me.

594
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,170
What are we going to do?

595
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:01,470
Excuse me! Excuse me!

596
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:09,120
Excuse me!

597
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,910
What did you say?

598
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,170
Hold on!

599
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,420
Excuse me!

600
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,390
I once caught you red-handed...

601
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,800
What?

602
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,660
It's nothing.

603
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,650
Can you write your number here?

604
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,660
Look up.

605
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,260
Police officer?

606
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,650
Mister, are you okay?

607
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,770
I'm okay. Go on ahead.

608
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,850
Mister!

609
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,430
Mister!

610
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,830
Mister!

611
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,810
Mister! Mister!

612
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,370
Please don't do this.

613
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:01,500
Why do you keep telling us not to do that? Did we do something?

614
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,150
I know, right?

615
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,330
Please stop.

616
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:10,370
She's obviously a young student. Why would you do this to her?

617
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,690
Who are you?

618
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,330
Please let her go.

619
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,480
I can vouch for her.

[Life Insurance]

621
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,040
Hee Tae.

622
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,270
The surgery went well and the vitals are strong.

623
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,870
They were just transferred to the recovery room.

624
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,170
Thank you.

625
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:10,890
If the CPR was done even a little late, it would have been difficult for her to make it.

626
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,940
You saved Jin Ah.

627
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,430
We are already short on beds, and we're having to put mats out in the lobby!

628
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,620
How can we accept any more patients?

629
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,750
But we can't turn away patients in this situation either!

630
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,350
Deputy Director, we don't know the identities of over half of them!

631
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,040
Medical bills are an issue, too,

632
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,660
but I heard the soldiers are attacking hospitals claiming we're working with the protestors!

633
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,810
If we don't accept any patients, would it be a hospital?

634
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,740
Deputy Director.

635
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,620
Close the main entrance and accept the patients.

636
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,570
Soldiers will see, so turn off the lights everywhere but the operating rooms and emergency rooms.

637
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,920
Eat, even if you don't feel like it.

638

You haven't eaten anything all day.

00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:33,800
Hee Tae, you really do have a good hunch on things.

640
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,680
I saw Jin Ah earlier and even had a quick conversation with her.

641
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,010
I couldn't see any signs. Heck, I didn't even know she had been hurt.

642
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,620
She was just like her normal self.

643
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,200
I told you,

644
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,010
I'm a human canary.

645
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,920
Sorry.

646
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,310
About?

647
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,450
I was being stubborn.

648
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,440
For making you go through something so difficult.

649
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:15,800
Yesterday and today, too, had we followed your instinct and left,

650
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,650
then we might not have experienced all these things.

651
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,610
But, Myeong Hee, thanks to your stubbornness, Jin Ah is alive.

652
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,800
Innately, I'm the type of person that tries to escape danger beforehand.

653
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,750
But, Myeong Hee, you're the type of person that will continue to fight even if you've been hit by lightning.

654
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:55,420
Anyways, thanks to you, for the first time in my life, I didn't run away

655
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,250
I was able to stay by Jin Ah's side when she had collapsed.

656
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:06,310
So, Myeong Hee, your stubbornness saved Jin Ah.

657
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,460
It's almost time.

658
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,320
Should we start heading to the train station?

659
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Let me tell you one thing as a human canary.

660
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:40,920
The fact that there are more stabbing victims is not a good sign.

661
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,390
Let's put out the urgent fires first and then leave.

662
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,850
Until Jin Ah is awake.

663
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,340
Would that be okay?

664
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,830
I don't know. I think I became fearless after getting hit by lightning.

665
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,560
The belief that we can do anything as long as we're together.

666
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,790
That inexplicable belief that trumps all warning signs.

667
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,910
But I couldn't have yet known.

668
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:42,870
Welcome.

669
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:47,550
That lightning was just a mere warning sign.

670
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:56,420
What we were about to face was a great typhoon.

671
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,140
We'll be turning the lights off.

672
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,450
And in front of that typhoon,

673
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:12,010
the only thing we could do was

674
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,110
holding each others' hands so that we wouldn't fly away.

675
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:30,680
[Youth of May]

676
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:38,100
♫ You, who would smile with sad eyes ♫

677
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,950
How many times do I have to tell you? Don't volunteer yourself.

678
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,110
I got it, so stop nagging!

679
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:46,920
Nagging?

680
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,800
Someone has collapsed over here!

681
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,670
♫ I hope you'll fade away like a dream ♫

682
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,530
I have to go over there right now!

683
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,230
Are you crazy? The soldiers are shooting!

684
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,660
That's Myeong Soo's shoes!

685
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,270
You want to fight against armed soldiers?

686
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,270
They're committing a massacre. Do we have to stay perfect?

687
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,960
You were right.

688
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,747
I'm a hypocrite.
