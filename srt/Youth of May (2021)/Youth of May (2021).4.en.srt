00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,510
Her recovery is slow.

2
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,220
I can't say how long she'll hold out.

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,220
Hee Tae! You're going to become a great doctor.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,850
I accepted you as a son

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,550
because I believed you would prove yourself useful.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,590
Hee Tae!

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,820
Please, save Seok Cheol!

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,530
Oh, are you awake now?

9
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,780
Don't you need to cure your hangover?

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,390
Okay.

11
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,510
Where's Myeong Hee?

12
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,750
Myeong Hee,

13
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,930
I'm prepared to get hurt.

14
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,230
Do you want to go out with me just until the end of May?

15
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,690
Later.

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,150
Later, when you're sober, I'll answer then.

17
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,810
Ms. Kim Myeong Hee!

18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,740
The manager wants you to stop by the meeting before lunch.

19
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,370
Oh, okay.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you have a fever?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,700
Your face is a little red.

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,040
Maybe I got a little burnt from the spring sun.

[Episode 4]
[Crossing the Line]

24
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,180
Jeesh.

25
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,210
Okay! So the transfer may take place next week?

26
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,330
I thought you had something important to discuss, coming here so early in the morning.

27
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,330
It is important. They tell me to get confirmation from Gwangju,

28
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,200
and Gwangju is telling me to get confirmation from Seoul. Delaying things by going back and forth.

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,120
Anyway, I'll relay this date to them in Seoul.

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,260
By the way, what's your relationship with Ms. Jang Seok Cheol?

31
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,160
According to the documents, you're not related or married.

32
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,680
What is the reason for putting in so much effort, time, and money?

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,930
I'm getting curious about why you're so involved.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,670
We're offender and victim.

35
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,160
Let's just leave it at that.

36

What are you doing?

38
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,390
Didn't I tell you to be more discreet?

39
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,270
Private Kim Kyung Soo.

40
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,630
I... wasn't studying.

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,290
Hand it over.

This dimwit.

43
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,160
Why are you always one step behind and driving me crazy.

44
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,010
Here it is.

45
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,570
Look at that. A letter?

46
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,440
Are you planning a secret meeting with your comrades outside?

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,580
For you, sending letters

Answer me!

50

Yes, I understand!

51
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,350
Yes. I'm trying to transfer patient Jang Seok Cheol.

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Yes, I've considered all the risks before making this decision.

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,000
The hospital in Gwangju says next week is available.

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,590
15 days?

55
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,480
Is there any way to hurry it up a little more?

56
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,130
As you know, the patient's condition–

57
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,040
Aren't you going to eat?

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,240
- You go ahead first.
- Okay.

59
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,820
Yes, I know that as well.

60
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,080
So–

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,350
So–

62
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,480
Thank you, professor.

What brings you to the hospital?

65
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,020
I've got a hangover.

66
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,330
So I thought I'd get an IV from the emergency room.

67
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't think that's it.

68
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,530
Why? Is there something wrong?

69
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,510
No, it's nothing.

70

Myeong Hee, you're so mean.

71
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,040
You should have woken me up when you were leaving!

72
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,330
Leaving me behind and disappearing like that?

73
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,070
It was because you were so sound asleep.

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,130
By the way, if it's something to do with the hospital–

75
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,010
Because I was sound asleep?

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,810
Myeong Hee, did you come and watch me while I was sleeping?

77
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,970
Who said I was watching?

78
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,390
You were obviously sound asleep!

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,150
All right, let's just say that's how it was.

I have a tutoring session later, I'll see you later at home.

81

Saying it like that makes it seem like we're living together, doesn't it?

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,610
No way.

83
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,670

Oh, that's right.

101
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,180
I guess I should tell Myeong Hee we need to meet somewhere else.

102

Why would you need to do that?

103

There's a lot to eat here, you can meet here at home.

I don't want to hear aunt's nagging.

I'll probably hear her nagging now that you're going to get married.

Who said I'm getting married?

107

Of course, you'd be the one. It wouldn't be me.

Why? Did you two have an argument?

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,180
Who do you think you're yelling at, huh?

166
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,360
Then choose one yourself!

167
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
There are always naive guys like you who let cunning girls

168
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,390
coax them into bringing them home.

169
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,150
Aunt, stop it and get up now.

170
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,730
Are you kicking me out right now?

171
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,560
I'll take care of my own business, so stay out of it, Aunt.

172
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Soo Chan! How can you do this to me?!

173
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,740
You're not going to let go of me?

174
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,670
Am I not your aunt? I asked if I'm not your aunt!

175
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,320
Sorry.

176
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,300
She's not shy about saying what she wants to.

177
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,800
She's just doing all that to find you a good match.

178
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,270
From what I heard, they all seem like good candidates.

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,900
Your aunt must've been having a hard time, since your standards are so high.

180
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,040
It's not that I have high expectations. I just don't want to be set up.

181
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,640
It's not like a person can meet their soulmate

182
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,890
through some silly matchmaking cards.

183
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,100
I'll try to look around, too. My workplace is full of women.

184
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,450
Do you have an ideal type?

185
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,280
A person that's like a wildflower?

186
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,460
No matter how hard it gets, she never gives up on her dreams,

187
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,160
and never complains about devoting herself to her family.

188
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,020
A strong person who doesn't need to be sheltered?

189
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,880
But that's you.

190
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,170
See, I'm right. Your ideal type is a female version of yourself.

191
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,000
Gosh, it's not easy to find someone like that.

192

196
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,800
Then who's Myeong Hee's favorite singer?

197
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,720
I'm not sure. Bae In Sook?

198
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,040
Bae In Sook.

199
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,240
Then what's Myeong Hee's favorite snack?

200
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,350
Sweet bean jelly and butter bread?

201
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,910
Sweet bean jelly and butter bread.

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,130
But what does this have to do with math?

203
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,890
These are necessary questions to figure out your studying pattern.

204
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,480
Your previous tutor was Myeong Hee, right?

205
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,630
If you don't review your past, you can never move forward to the future, Jin Ah.

206
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,280
Jin Ah, I have a new dream.

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,660
If I win a prize at this year's University Music Festival,

208
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,400
I want you to play my song on the radio show you produce in the future.

209
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,970
And then the DJ will say

210
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,770
"Our program's producer discovered this musician before anyone else."

211
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,820
What do you say? Will you help me achieve my dream?

212
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,580
Then, will you help me achieve my dream too?

213
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,840
Will you give me a tour around Seoul this summer?

214
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,600
Show me around TBC's broadcasting studio and your university, too.

215

- I promise!

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,930
Okay. From here... to here.

217
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,010
- You want me to do... all of this?
- Yup.

218
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,830
If you start now, you'll be able to finish it by the day after tomorrow.

219
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,390
- You can do it!
- I can do it!

220
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,060
Jin Ah, you can do it! Say it three times!

221

It's tomorrow.

226
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,360
If your fake cough is that bad, aren't you really sick, then?

227
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,790
Should we go to the bakery and get some butter bread?

228
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,340
Or we could go to the coffee shop and listen to some of Bae In Sook's songs.

229
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,340
If not, we could go to the bookstore and read some poetry.

230
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,360
I wonder who really tutored who.

231
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,370
So, you're still not going to tell me why you were at the hospital?

232
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,880
I said it was nothing.

233
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,970
That's awfully suspicious.

234
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,250
I didn't think you were the secretive type.

235
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,630
I wonder what it is that you can't tell me.

236
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,410
If you answer me first, then I'll answer.

237
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,810
- Answer?
- Yes, answer me.

238
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,150
I'm sober now.

239
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,980
Later, when you're sober, I'll answer then.

240
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,430
Oh! What?!

241
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,900
You should get going.

242
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,300
Why? You're not going to answer today either?

243
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,310
I need to study later.

244
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,680
And I'm tired from my early shift at work.

245
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,890
Anyway, you should get going for today.

246
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,860
- All right, then. Do you have time tomorrow?
- No, I don't.

247
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,010
Lies!

248
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,750
Really! I have to go somewhere tomorrow.

249
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,780
I want to go, too.

250
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,670
You don't even know where I'm going.

251
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,180
Why not? Is it someplace I can't go?

252
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,810
Do whatever you want, then.

253
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,600
Really? You mean it, right?

254
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,850
See you at the bus stop at 11:00.

255
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,510
You volunteered to go first.

256
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,650
Okay!

257
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,270
We've run into each other at an unexpected place.

258
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,580
I didn't think I'd see you here.

259
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,950
You should eat first. You can only hold out if you're full.

260
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,450
I don't know anything.

261
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,000
If you're referring to the fugitive student you were with,

262
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,850
he's been caught.

263
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,540
I guess you're pretty trusted by your group.

264
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,640
He kept talking without doubting you for a second.

265
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,320
Were you watching me on purpose?

266
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,660
Let's just say your future father-in-law was interested in his future daughter-in-law.

267
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,410
Who said I'm your daughter-in-law?

268
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,870
Do you remember Bongdeok Brewery?

269
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,400
About 10 years ago, they were the number one company in the Honam region.

270
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,860
In an effort to expand throughout the country, the chairman even arranged a marriage between his daughter and a man from the KCIA.

271
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,080
In the end, the company underwent a series of tax audits and closed its doors.

272
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,890
The son-in-law was demoted to a branch in South Jeolla Province.

273
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,660
That's how it is in this field.

274
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,050
They don't pester you until you go in the direction they want you to.

275
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,220
They just slowly suffocate those around you until you move in the direction they want you to.

276
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,950
But the funny thing about human nature is that,

277
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,760
more than the ones doing the suffocating,

278
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,270
the ones who hold out until the end seem like worse people.

279
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,300
So...

280
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,700
try to hold out

281
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,860
as long as you possibly can.

282
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,300
Right now, your father must be busy with his new factory,

283
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,360
so let's start with an engagement ceremony, shall we?

284
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,510
Also...

285
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,340
this is my limit,

286
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,110
so be careful not to cross any lines next time.

287
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,700
Get some rest, or meditate.

288
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,630
Hee Tae, please save Seok Cheol.

289
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,030
Hee Tae! I beg you, please save Seok Cheol!

290
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,980
Hee Tae!

291
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,840
Please, save Seok Cheol!

292
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,710
Is my body getting weaker?

293
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,390
I'm even hearing things now.

294
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,570
Jung Tae.

295
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,500
Jung Tae, please open the door.

296
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm joining the camp.

297
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,670
Later. Later, okay? Your father's been sensitive lately.

298
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:15,470
Later when? You'll probably make me quit track next year.

299
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,550
Why are you being so childish?

300
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,900
Do you really want me to look like a complete fool?

301
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,030
Why? You don't have to.

302
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,210
This is why people call you a mistress behind your back.

303
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,680
What?

304
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,900
Hey, I'm going to use the bathroom.

305
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,130
What about Jung Tae? Don't tell me he's still sleeping.

306
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,750
He went to school. He left early this morning.

307
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,880
A grade school student... went to school this early?

308
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,510
He said he had to leave early to do some homework.

309
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,210
Homework?

310
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,700
I saw him leaving earlier. It wasn't about homework.

311
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,490
I recommended some books for him to read before he enters middle school.

312
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,890
You recommended books to Jung Tae?

313
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,860
It wasn't really a friendly recommendation.

314
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,060
I told him that focusing solely on sports would make him stupid,

315
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,090
and he ran straight to the library.

316
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,410
I guess he's still just a kid.

317
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,200
Maybe in this house. At his age, I was already earning my keep.

318
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,320
You shouldn't coddle him so much.

319
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,330
Myeong Hee!

320
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,550
All right. First off, a boiled egg.

321
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,670
And some cider for when we get thirsty.

322
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,270
Last but not least, your favorite butter bread.

323
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,490
You don't even know where we're going. Why did you pack a picnic bag?

324
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,760
Every day can be a picnic with you.

325
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,970
What did you bring, Myeong Hee? Show me.

326
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,310
I didn't really bring anything.

327
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,420
What do you mean you didn't bring anything. It looks like you packed quite a bit.

328
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,620
Let's see it.

329
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,910
- No.
- No? You don't like me?

330
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,440
- That's not...
- Just hand it over. Come on.

331
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,060
- I just–
- Let me see.

332
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,200
Look at this. It's so heavy.

333
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,650
Sweet red bean jelly.

334
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,780
Okchun?
(T/N: A traditional Korean sweet made with flour.)

335
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,040
Herbal breath refresher? Are you trying to quit smoking?

336
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,990
No! That's... just in case I get car sick.

337
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,840
Oh, man.

338
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,270
The more I get to know you, the more you seem like an old man.

339
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,190
Give it back! You're not all that either.

340
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,870
Grandpa Myeong Hee.

341
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,540
I'd better peel an egg for Grandpa Myeong Hee.

342
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,520
What? Grandpa?

343
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,270
I have to say, you're always so chipper.

344
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,340
That sounds like you're being sarcastic.

345
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,500
No, I meant it as a compliment. Do I sound sarcastic when I speak?

346
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,450
No.

347
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,240
Here you go.

348
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,900
But, really, where are we going?

349
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,000
Tell me!

350
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,930
Oh! It's the witch!

351
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Were they talking about you just now?

352
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,320
Because I gave them their flu shots last time.

353
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,970
Sister!

354
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,550
Myeong Hee!

355
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,770
I didn't think you'd be able to come. Aren't you busy?

356
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,200
No. Have you been well?

357
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,520
Of course I have.

358
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,520
But who is this?

359
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,920
Oh, this is...

360
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,850
- I'm Myeong Hee's boyfr–
- He's a doctor.

361
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,560
- What?
- Oh my, you're a doctor?

362
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,960
That's great. We happen to have a few children who need checkups.

363
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,620
- No, I'm not yet...
- He's a brand new doctor, who just got his license.

364
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,630
Let's go inside.

365
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,120
Sure.

366
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,840
Myeong Hee, I can't see a patient. I told you that I haven't even graduated–

367
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,730
You already passed the medical license exam. And you only delayed your graduation because of the University Song Festival.

368
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,530
No. I really can't do it.

369
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,470
Have me do something else instead.

370
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,130
Cleaning or something that requires using strength.

371
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,040
Ah, I'm good at looking after kids.

372
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,950
You don't have to treat them, just do a basic checkup. Did I ask you to perform surgery?

373
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,470
Just examine the kids to make sure they're healthy. I'm sure you've done that much, right?

374
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,550
Well then, I have a lot to do.

375
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,450
I leave them in your care.

376
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm going to listen to your stomach, okay?

377
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,090
I think you'll be okay.

378
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,710
Say, "Ah."

379
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:49,640
All right, look up for me. Just a bit more, like this.

380
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,090
This might sting a little, please bear with it.

381
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,880
- He'll get better soon.
- Thank you, doctor.

382
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,890
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

383
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,140
Kids are twice as difficult as adults, right?

384
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:41,530
Why are you more tired than me when I did all the hard labor?

385
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,300
Are you okay? I saw that you were sweating a lot before.

386
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,740
Ah, that was because... of low blood sugar.

387
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,350
This is great.

388
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,590
I was just considering whether to eat grass or dirt.

389
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,560
As I thought, it's like we can communicate through telepathy.

390
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,530
I'm full of energy now!

391
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,010
I guess you can't be a pediatrician in the future.

392
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,930
I'm going to go finish up some more work, so rest here awhile.

393
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,680
- Oh, I'll help you.
- It's okay.

394
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,810
It's just paperwork. Enjoy the bread!

395
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,580
My goodness.

396
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,520
Hi.

397
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,730
I'm seeing you for the first time today.

398
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,130
You also want to eat bread?

399
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,700
Here.

400
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,410
Eat slowly.

401
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:18,800
But what's your relationship with the handsome doctor?

402
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,400
It's the first time I'm seeing you come with someone else other than Hae Geon or Seong Min.

403
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:31,360
For a nun, you're pretty interested in other people's relationships.

404
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,340
Oh my! So I'm right. It's a man and woman relationship?

405
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,720
No. Speaking biologically, we are man and woman so it's a man and woman relationship.

406
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,900
Myeong Hee.

407
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,270
There's something... something wrong with the kid.

408
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,750
Young Mi! Young Mi, open your eyes.

409
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,510
Young Mi?

410
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,590
By any chance, did you feed her something?

411
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,330
Bread. The bread you gave me earlier.

412
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,080
She was fasting because of enteritis.

413
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,170
It's okay. Aigoo, it's okay. It's okay.

414
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,640
You can throw up more. Keep going.

415
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,810
It's okay, Hee Tae.

416
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,110
Hee Tae.

417
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,460
Hee Tae!

418
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,540
Yes.

419
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,310
I said it's okay. It's not a big deal. It's all right now.

420
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,460
I'll go get some water.

421
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,760
I'll go get it.

422
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,790
Sit and rest a bit. I'll be right back.

423
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,390
Hey, hey, hey!

424
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,480
Hey, this is unreasonable during exam season.

425
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,800
Go to the hospital.

426
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,180
You know that we came here because we can't go to the hospital.

427
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,000
Gently, please.

428
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Even if you go to the University Hospital, there's no one who's going to stitch this any more gently than this.

429
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,420
You're right, Hyung. He's the ace of our med school. Hua Tuo.
(Hua Tuo was a famous Chinese physician who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty.)

430
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,000
What Huo Tuo? I should just stitch your mouth shut.

431
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,130
Hua Tuo? Did Hua Tuo specialize in treating fugitives?

432
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,310
If rumors about this spread and I get expelled, will you take responsibility?

433
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,700
I'll have to take responsibility. I'll be the lyricist and you'll be the composer.

434
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,490
We can just win the grand prize at the University Music Festival.

435
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,490
Geez, you troublemaker.

436
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,310
At this rate, we'll be dragged to Namsan first before we make it to the University Song Festival.

437
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,850
Jeez! Try not to move while I'm stitching the wound.

438
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,960
Be careful.

439
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,250
Hwang Hee Tae! You're going to become a great doctor.

440
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,850
Go write some songs instead.

441
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,110
Don't use the night school as an excuse to date.

442
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,630
Hey, what are you saying?

443
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,130
What do I mean? It's obvious from the lyrics you're writing these days.

444
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,120
Hey, don't bring any more. Okay?

445
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,510
- Thank you.
- Bye.

446
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,520
- Bye.
- Okay.

447
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,610
Hey, do you know what time it is?

448
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,920
Hee Tae, please save Seok Cheol!

449
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,770
Her pulse is weak... and she's lost a lot of blood.

450
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,790
- I think going to the hospital would be–
- Hospital... Hospital...

451
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,910
I know, you came here because you can't go to the hospital. Okay.

452
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,750
You know the small clinic down the street, right?

453
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,310
Knock on the door. Someone should be inside.

454
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,960
- Tell them I sent you. My senior should be there.
- Okay.

455
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,950
Hee Tae,

456
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,280
save her. You must save her.

457
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,030
All right, so just go quickly.

458
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,250
Darn it.

459
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,870
Ah, I'm going crazy.

460
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,880
Stop right there!

461
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,200
Let go! Let me go!

462
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,890
Cuff this punk.

463
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,750
Please! Please, anyone, just come.

464
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,630
Hee Tae?

465
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,210
Hee Tae?

466
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,110
I have no right to be a doctor.

467
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,490
I started this because I wanted to heal sick people,

468
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,030
but if I touch them, everything gets ruined.

469
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,550
Maybe your heart is the thing that is broken.

470
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,060
You know, we don't decide who lives or dies.

471
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,880
That decision is up to God.

472
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:29,120
All we can do is do our best within the lines drawn by God.

473
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,550
And if I may share my opinion as someone

474
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,710
who's working in the same field,

475
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:48,920
I know for a fact that you'll be a great doctor.

476
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,940
You're beating yourself up like this because you're a very responsible person.

477
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,660

Just because. I didn't want to see him.

00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,540
Your attitude is terrible. Did you hear what Coach said before?

640
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,410
He said, "Don't cross the line."

Why did you have to get yourself in this mess?

You must not have heard everything Coach said.

What?

644
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,170
In long-distance track, it's okay to cross the line.

645
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,910
Knowing when to cross the line will make you a good runner.

Yes, it's already agreed upon.

Then, please transfer the amount without any mistakes.

Your dear Seok Cheol will be transferred to Gwangju soon,

Her transfer can't get you out of the army

nor can it help her recover faster,
