Yes, that's right.

647
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,660
That's why I'm telling you this, but

648
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,400

Father, we need to talk. Okay?

651
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:43,900
Go to your room. I have nothing to talk about.

652

653

How can I go on a blind date with the son of a horrible man?

660

Out of all people, it's the son of Hwang Gi Nam!

663
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,120
He was once the Head of Anti-communist Investigation.

664
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,400
So what? All you have to do is sit with him for a while, then turn him down.

665
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,980
Imagine if someone sees me with a powerful anti-communist's son?

666
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,320
Joan of Arc will be burned at the stake immediately.

667
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,390
What can you do?

668
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:50,550
It's the only way to get your friends out.

669
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,540
Oh yeah! Didn't you say that you had something to tell me?

670
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:05,010
I feel bad for sharing good news when you're so devastated.

I can do it on my own. Don't worry about it.

You go to the blind date in my place.

And I'll buy the plane ticket in your place!

705
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,890
You just need to meet him 3 times.

706
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:50,210
And if he doesn't want to meet again, you can even shorten it to 1 time.

707
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,510
We've never met, so there's no way we would get caught.

Why? Do you not want to go on the blind date?

Going on a date isn't a big deal.
