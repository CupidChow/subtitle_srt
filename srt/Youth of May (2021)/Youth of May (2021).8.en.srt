00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,080
What about the papers from the pharmaceutical agency?

165
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,300
Here you go.

166
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,880
By the way, the site manager asked if you can visit the site today?

167
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,850
I need to go to the other office today.

168
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,910
Then, tell them I'll go by tomorrow afternoon—

169
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,880
I thought I made it clear that I refuse to accept the joint management.

170
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,030
I'm just trying to help.

171
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,630
The situation has changed a lot since last time.

172
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,000
Will you be able to handle Changhwa Pharmaceuticals on top of Changhwa Industrial...

173
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,400
on your own?

174
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,940
If I need help, I'll ask for it myself.

175
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,430
Will you ask for help only when it's necessary?

176
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,930
What happened to Soo Ryun's request?

177
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,860
Are you talking about that girl studying abroad?

178
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,430
I don't think you should be worrying about a girl right now.

179
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,290
You won't even keep your promise regarding that one girl,

180
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,130
how can I trust you?

181
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,180
Well, the thing is, it's actually not such a simple matter.

182
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,480
Then is joint management a simple matter?

183
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,710
Trust is something

184
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,810
that is earned mutually.

185
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,450
But it seems to me...

186
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,420
that you're just trying to force me to put my faith in you.

187
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,590
Geez, I'm so hungry I think I'll die.

188
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,150
Look at how flat my stomach is.

189
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,250
I really hope meat is part of the menu today.

190
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,590
How can you talk about meat while looking at my stomach?

191
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,450
Myeong Soo!

192
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,670
Sister!

193
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,970
Here, take this to Coach.

194
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,350
You go.

195
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,880
My sister brought it.

196
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,470
Kim Mutt!

197
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,970
Eat a lot, before Myeong Soo comes back.

198
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,670
Thank you for the food!

199
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,610
Here, Jung Tae.

200
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,440
Hurry and eat some too.

201
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,340
You need to eat if you want to grow taller.

202
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,740
Here.

203
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,900
How could you start eating without me!

204
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,760
Too bad. Come here and dig in.

205
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,750
It's so delicious.

206
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,460
Why are you walking me out?

207
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,890
You should be getting ready for training instead.

208
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,670
You brought fried chicken, as you promised.

209
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,440
This is the least I could do.

210
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,340
Goodness.

211
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,230
My gosh, mutt!

212
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,880
Look at how greasy your lips are.

213
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,530
Why did you break up with Brother Hee Tae?

214
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,150
What are you talking about?

215
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,130
There are no such things as breaking up between friends.

216
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,150
Come on.

217
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,520
Why are you pouting after eating all that fried chicken?

218
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,860
I wanted you and Brother Hee Tae to get married.

219
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,950
What? Marry?

220
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,390
Marriage is stronger than an engagement.

221
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,740
And if you get married, you wouldn't study abroad.

222
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,560
All right. Maybe I should give up on it, after all.

223
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,790
Give up on what?

224
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,350
Studying abroad. Since my little mutt hates the idea so much, I should probably forget about it.

225
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,550
You're teasing me, right?

226
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm serious.

227
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,760
Maybe I should just go and watch you compete in the Sports Festival.

228
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
When is it again?

229
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
Are you sure you're not fooling with me?

230
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,640
Are you really not going to study abroad? Seriously?

231
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,490
Goodness.

232
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,870
"Consequently, the student council held an emergency meeting,

233
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,930
in which they had a heated discussion for an hour and a half before coming to the decision to disband.

234
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,280
They also persuaded the student demonstrators around Seoul Station to disperse and go back to school."

235
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,070
Gosh, those darn cowards in Seoul.

236
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,030
What a way to lose momentum.

237
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,890
If they've backed down in Seoul, will our efforts go up in smoke?

238
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,470
Nothing's changed in Gwangju.

239
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,240
Kwang Hyun...

240
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,940
I finished talking to the police commissioner.

241
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,540
The police will cooperate...

242
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,350
with today's torch protest.

243
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,490
I'm sure more citizens will be participating today. Let's hurry up and get prepared.

244
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,760
Just smash it all, why don't you?

246
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,120
What is it? Are you angry about Seoul?

247
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,530
Do you know that Lee Soo Ryun is in Seoul now?

248
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,340
She's in Seoul?

249
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,570
Did she protest at Seoul Station yesterday?

250
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,640
It's not to protest, but to get married to your friend, Hwang Hee Tae.

251
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,790
What?

252
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,680
Who said that?

253
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,800
There are no secrets in this small town.

254
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,860
So she didn't even tell you?

255
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,130
What about Myeong Hee?

256
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,240
After being so harsh to Myeong Hee and taking Soo Ryun's side, are you worried about her now?

257
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,930
I don't know. I can't reach her.

258
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,070
I'm sure she's pretending to be fine somewhere.

259
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm sorry, Myeong Hee. Have you been waiting long?

260
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,500
Not at all, I just got here.

261
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,110
I'm the one who asked to meet,

262
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,400
but I couldn't get here on time because something came up.

263
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,690
I'll have the same as her.

264
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,290
My gosh, why are you in such a hurry?

265
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,580
Catch your breath first.

266
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,650
Thanks.

267
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,950
So? Why did you want to see me?

268
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,740
Myeong Hee, your passport application is being processed again.

269
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,540
My friend at Foreign Affairs just confirmed it.

270
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,140
You don't have to worry about my departure anymore.

271
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,130
I won't be able to leave this year anyway.

272
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,970
Actually, I asked around a bit.

273
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,710
There are other ways besides the Catholic Foundation scholarship.

274
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,880
These are not the only options either.

275
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,480
It's fine. Even if I get a passport, I still have to wait for my visa.

276
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,040
If you don't want to go abroad, you could study in Korea. I'll support you.

277
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,380
Starting with preparations for the exam—

278
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,530
Soo Chan Oppa,

279
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm really fine.

280
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,750
I'm not.

281
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,050
I was being nosy and because of me, you...

282
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,710
Come on. How many times must I tell you?

283
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,740
It's not your fault.

284
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,070
If you keep trying to help me, I'll only feel worse.

285
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,460
Myeong Hee,

286
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:44,360
can't you just let me help you?

287
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,790
I can't stand this.

288
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,650
I'm doing this for my own good.

289
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,620
So can't you please let me help you?

290
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,880
You've already given me enough.

291
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,860
Even if you give me more, my hands are already full.

292
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,930
Trust me, I'm really fine. Don't worry about me.

293
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,160
We're good to go!

294
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,760
- To Hyewa neighborhood, please.
- It's a warm, sunny May day.

295
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,080
As we get started, here is a song you might want to share

296
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,510
with someone as sweet as sunshine.

297
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,710
♫ You fill up my senses  ♫

298
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,980
Wait. It's the song I requested!

299
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,510
I don't regret it.

300
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,860
But just because I don't regret it, doesn't mean that it's not difficult.

301
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,840
Even if we're not always strong and at our best,

302
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,480
I would like us to be able to show each other everything.

303
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,440
♫ Like a sleepy blue ocean ♫

304
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,950
I can sing for you sometime. Can we meet again before the flowers wither?

305
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,520
Then I'd love to.

306
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,930
Myeong Hee,

307
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,580
do you want to go out with me just until the end of May?

308
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,940
♫ Let me drown in your laughter ♫

309

♫ Let me die in your arms ♫

310
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,410
I'm not okay. I don't want this May to pass by without you.

311
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,230
♫ Let me always be with you ♫

312
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,600
♫ Come let me love you ♫

313
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,060
♫ Come love me again  ♫

["Troubling Political Situations Due to Protests'']

316
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,090
More than 100,000 took to the streets. How could they tell us to go back to school?

317
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,470
What is the council even thinking?

318
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,570
They don't want to give the government an excuse.

319
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,190
They actually brought armored cars. Weren't you scared?

320
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,520
To be honest, I was relieved when we were told to disperse.

321
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,610
I didn't say I wasn't scared.

322
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,710
But no matter how scared we are, there are things to be done.

323
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,470
- They must get done.

I didn't know you were so famous, Seok Chul.
