Hwang Jeong Tae, do you not want to eat?

3
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,280
Pardon?

4
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,360
It's not that.

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,880
He's eating fine. It's because he just woke up.

6
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,150
That's all because he has been eating 3 full meals every day without starving once.

7
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,700
See how it feels to fill your stomach with only water for a few days. You'll stop picking at your food.

8
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,610
Teacher, what brings you here at this time?

9
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,910
I thought it would be nice if Jin Ah read this book. Here you go.

10
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,900
Such a precious thing!

11
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,380
But can Jin Ah read this?

12
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,800
Of course.

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,610
- These days Jin Ah's skills are growing day by day.
- Aigoo!

14
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,820
Thank you.

15

Jin Ah has midterms today, so school ends early.

Why don't you have something to eat while you wait?

17
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,560
Then should we call Myeong Hee, too?

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,900
- Myeong Hee?
- Yes.

- Night shift?
- Yes.

22
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,700
But she didn't work yesterday.

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,230
She didn't come home last night, so I thought she was working.

24

She didn't come home at night?

25

Yes.

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,600
Or maybe she could have come past the curfew and left really early.

27

Yes.

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,700
She took an unauthorized leave today.

39

She usually doesn't even take a half-day, I wonder what's going on that she didn't even call.

No, she didn't.

45

Well, maybe something urgent came up at night.

46
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,750
If that was the case then she would have contacted the hospital.

Is there something you think that might have happened?

Why would you ask me that? You know that better than me, right?

Just apologize.

No, she's an adult. She's 26.

What's your relationship with the missing person?

She's my girlfriend.

How long has she been missing?

70

About 15 hours.

71
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,520
If it's 15 hours, then you saw her last night,

72

but she went missing in the middle of the night?

73

Yes. I definitely left her in front of her house yesterday

- Wait!

- Have you considered the fact that

77

she might not be missing but she might be avoiding you?

78
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,140
She's not home and even took an unauthorized leave from work.

79
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,880
She might have had an accident on her way to work.

82

Also, if it's only been 15 hours, we can't register her as missing. That's just called going out.

83
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,790
No, no. She isn't someone who would do that without saying anything.

84
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,830
But how can you be so sure that she's the type of person that would or wouldn't do that?

85
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,060
All right, let me be blunt.

She could've seen her late grandparents in a dream and went to visit their graves.

Why would it be unplugged?

101
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,830
It's unplugged sometimes. Because of my grandma.

102

But did my sister go to Naju?

I was going to find that out by calling, but the phone is unplugged.

Do you know when the phone will be connected again?

105

That would be according to grandma's state.

Maybe for half a day? The whole day?

163
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,080
I'm sorry you came all the way here but couldn't meet Myeong Hee.

164
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,360
Seeing you're here on a weekday instead of at work,

165
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,960
I guess you're a college student.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,430
Well, that is...

167
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,350
I'm about to graduate from college soon.

168
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,640
You're the same age as Myeong Hee but haven't graduated yet?

169
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,130
You must've taken a few years off.

170
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,430
Actually, I didn't take time off.

171
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,030
It takes six years to graduate from my department.

172
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,870
Six years?

173
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,960
Then you must be a medical student.

174
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,010
Where? Chonnam National University? Chosun University?

175

No. I-It's—

190
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,280

191
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Okay. I look forward to seeing you again.

192

Grandma, I'll see you next time.

193
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,170

She's not here either. Where on earth is she?

196

No, it'll be okay. Her mom told me not to worry.

Do you think I came all the way here to have fun?

204
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,090
You weren't at home or at work so I thought you might've come here—

205
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,020
I know it may creep you out. I know,

206
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,650
but put yourself in my shoes.

207
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,060
- How could I remain calm—
- How did you find out my address?

208
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,980
I asked Myeong Soo.

209
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,420
I know this may creep you out too. I know, but—

210
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,750
Myeong Hee, what's wrong?

211
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,700

We don't need your money. Your body will do fine.

223
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,140
I wonder how much we'll get for you. It's a waste to sell you off to an island.

You see, compared to other countries,

Germany's visa screening process is a lot stricter.

243

There are communists who try to defect to North Korea through East Germany from time to time.

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,190
Why did you never tell me?

323
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,660
I had no idea. I've blamed myself for everything all my life.

324
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,050
I've regretted everything I've ever done.

325
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,160
You could've—

326
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,960
You could've told me it wasn't my fault at least once.

327
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,390
- Myeong Hee.
- If only you'd told me—

328
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:25,930
If you'd only told me why I must live in silence once.

329
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,810
Then I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up for nothing.

330
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,300
Why did you have to make a fool out of me?

331
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,950
Why do I have to get shoved into the ground without knowing? Why?

332
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,460
Answer me! Answer me, Father!

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,010
You despicable little wench!

334
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,920
Were you sent by Hwang Ki Nam, too?

335
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,430
- Go away!
- Mother, please calm down!

336
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,460
- Let go!
- Hurry up and unplug the phone.

337
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,290
Take Mother away.

338
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,150
- Mother, calm down.
- How dare you show up here?

339
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,690
- That's enough!
- Take me instead!

340
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,690
- Mother!
- Get lost!

341
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,140
Mother!

342
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,310
My goodness. My son is innocent. Why are you taking him?

343
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,370
Sir, just a second, please.

344
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,520
Mother, they're just going to ask me a few questions.

345
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,700
Like you said, I'm innocent. You don't have to worry.

346
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,330
Honey, see you later.

347
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,490
- Be careful.
- Hyun Chul.

348
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,560
You're Hwang Ki Nam, right?

349
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,900
It's been a while, Hyungnim.

350
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,460
Goodness, Ki Nam.

351
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,300
My leg hurts so much. I didn't do anything wrong.

352
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,910
You know that.

353
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,400
My father passed away.

354
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,930
My brother has been out of reach for years.

355
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,230
Your father defected to North Korea during the war.

356
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,170
Your communist partisan brother talks to you regularly.

357
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,960
That's what I heard.

358
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,440
- What?
- That's what you said.

359
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,150
You told me that yourself.

360
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,530
Hwang Ki Nam, you scumbag!

361
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,770
[Statement, Kim Hyun Chul]

362
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,800
Just admit it already.

363
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,320
If you end up with more injuries, your mother will be so worried that she'll fall ill again.

364
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,920
Your poor mother.

365
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,700
[Statement, Kim Hyun Chul]

366
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,190
Gosh, Mother.

367
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,900
That's all. But that's how things were back then.

368
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,530
So that was all

369
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,600
Hwang Ki Nam's doing?

370
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,800
I was going to tell you when you left for Germany. Who told you about it?

371
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,530
Don't tell me you can't study abroad because of your father.

372
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,240
I should get going.

373
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,260
Myeong Hee!

374
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,320
I thought it would end if I just stayed quiet.

375
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,480
I didn't want you to have to worry about such stigma.

376
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,890
I did it because I wanted everything to end with me.

377
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,650
But it didn't end with you.

378
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,000
Myeong Hee—

379
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,610
She still hasn't come home yet?

380
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,030
She must be working overtime.

381
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,830
I called the hospital, and they said she wasn't there. And I can't reach her family in Naju.

382
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,090
She must be on a trip or something. Myeong Hee isn't a kid.

383
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,160
Why is everyone making a fuss looking for her?

384
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,550
Go on home, okay?

385
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,250
If you give me a chance, I'll take responsibility and sort everything out.

386
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,900
Then how long will the process take? Several months?

387
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:47,020
I see. Then please call me as soon as you find out about the part I asked about earlier.

388
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,400
Brother, what's going on here?

389
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,210
Soo Ryun, I'm a little busy right now. Let's talk at home.

390
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,610
What's this?

391
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,730
Passport... Visa...

392
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,220
Is this about Myeong Hee?

393
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,570
What is it? Brother!

394
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,560
The Defense Security blocked her passport and visa applications.

395
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,900
What?

396
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,490
It's all my fault.

397
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,900
You don't have to worry about it, so just go home.

398
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,280
Hey.

399
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,790
I have something to tell you.

400
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,380
It's about Myeong Hee and Hwang Hee Tae.

401
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,930
I don't know how you found out they're seeing each other, but—

402
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,840
I lied from the beginning.

403
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,910
Are you saying it was all lies, even the blind date?

404
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:16,720
Then when Mr. Hwang asked, why did you tell him you didn't know anything?

405
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,420
I was scared.

406
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,430
I didn't know things would get out of hand.

407
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:38,380
Lee Soo Ryun, do you realize what you have done?

408
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,290
Brother, I was just scared that something bad would

409
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,870
- happen to our family because of me.
- Look what happened because of your immature behavior!

410
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,010
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

411
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,340
Expedite the political process!

412
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,770
- Expedite the political process!
- Expedite the political process!

413
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,920
Guarantee workers' rights!

414
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,480
Go home, you punks.

415
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,890
Yushin remnants, step down!

416
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,310
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

417
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,670
End martial law!

418
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,830
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

419
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,340
Myeong Hee.

420
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,750
Myeong Hee!

421
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,150
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

422
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:14,900
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

423
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,240
Myeong Hee!

424
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,610
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

425
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,950
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

426
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:35,410
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

427
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,900
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

428
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,660
Myeong Hee, can we talk for a second?

429
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,650
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

430
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,100
Myeong Hee!

431
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,860
- End martial law!
- End martial law!

432
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,060
What are you doing?

433
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,220
You saw me. Why did you run away?

434
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,010
You were following me, that's why.

435
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,320
Tell me what happened.

436
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:30,060
If I've suddenly become someone you have to avoid overnight, there must be a reason.

437
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,320
Must I tell you the reason?

438
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,710
Yes, I need to hear it.

439
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,550
I kept racking my brain, but I can't figure out why you're suddenly treating me like this.

440
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,440
I don't want to be by your side. I hate it.

441
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,940
I don't want to be called a minx who stole someone's fiancé, and I don't want to hurt those around me!

442
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,300
I can't do this anymore.

443
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,890
Did something happen between you and Soo Ryun?

444
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,760
Or is it because of Soo Chan?

445
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,020
I just don't want to do this anymore.

446
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,560
There, you heard it. Are we good now?

447
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,260
Do you seriously expect me to believe that? You said you wouldn't regret it.

448
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,620
You said we should tell each other everything.

449
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:31,010
You said that yourself yesterday. Then you suddenly disappeared and had me worried sick.

450
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,480
What is going on? What are you trying to hide?

451
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,940
Go ask your father!

452
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,760
My father?

453
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,890
I can no longer study abroad because I've been seeing you.

454
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,170
Why am I running away? It's because I'm scared.

455
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,800
I don't know what could happen if I stay with you.

456
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,240
My life could get a lot worse than it already is!

457
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,400
I ran away because I was scared.

458
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,200
Hee Tae, I am scared of you now.

459
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,240
Father, you're home.

460
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,670
You made a mistake, Father.

461
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,600
I heard you met that girl.

462
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,310
I was only seeing her to have some fun.

463
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,870
You didn't have to waste your time like that. You told me before

464
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,360
that men should date a lot before settling down.

465
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,550
What's your point?

466
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,820
I just wanted to have some fun before she left the country.

467
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,320
But now that you bothered to disapprove of her,

468
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,700
she thinks this is like the love story of the century! She's acting like she's in a tragic love story. My goodness.

469
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm worried she'll now cling to me forever.

470
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,650
Just let her leave the country, Father.

471
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,540
I never thought I'd see you pull such a dumb trick on me, Hee Tae.

472
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,420
Seeing you act this desperate

473
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,480
makes me realize I should nip it in the bud.

474
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,220
Wait.

475
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,420
Please let her leave.

476
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,880
Wouldn't you be relieved if she left the country?

477
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,400
There are many things I could do to be relieved.

478
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,920
I-I insisted that we keep seeing each other.

479
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,840
She kept saying no, but I made her—

480
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,300
She just—

481
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,810
Her only fault is that she got involved with me.

482
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,760
You really don't need to do this!

483
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,500
I'll get married.

484
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,190
I'll get married right away if that's what you want.

485
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,250
Of course, you'll get married as planned.

486
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,240
Did you think you could use it to strike a deal with me?

487
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,610
Hee Tae.

488
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,530
This is why you shouldn't kneel down often.

489
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,280
Okay?

490
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,850
It'll have no weight when you actually need to do it.

491
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,630
I told you.

492
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,530
The only thing you can block is...

493
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,030
only this hand, nothing more.

494
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,600
And you're in the palm of my hand.

495
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,540
It's too early to get scared. I haven't even begun yet.

496
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,320
What is it that you want?

497
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,650
I'll do anything you want.

498
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,100
I'll behave myself and live my life the way you want.

499
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,270
I'll do anything you say, so please—

500
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,430
Please let her—

501
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,400
Please just let her live her life.

502
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,710
Get ready to go to Seoul at once, and

503
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,370
don't come back until I tell you to.

504
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,710
As for that girl,

505
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,210
I'll decide what to do depending on how you behave yourself.

506
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,330
What do you mean?

507
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,150
You want to send them to Seoul?

508
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,070
They should get a place to live near the hospital in Seoul anyway.

509
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,080
Let's have them move there and get a place first.

510
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,600
The wedding can happen as soon as we decide on the date.

511
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,520
You talked big that you'd get everything sorted out.

512
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,750
But were you just planning to push forward with it?

513
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,670
Well, the woman problem has been taken care of.

514
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,320
You don't need to worry anymore.

515
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,070
How do I believe you that it's been taken care of?

516
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:01,570
Their marriage isn't a business merger. You can't force it.

517
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,210
Let's take some time and see how the situation unfolds.

518
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,970
Are you hoping, perhaps,

519
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,470
the wedding will be called off?

520
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,850
We should put the broken pieces back together for both families' sake.

521
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,740
Those broken pieces could become weapons.

522
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,550
Is this a threat?

523
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,710
No, I'm offering you a word of advice

524
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,870
to help you make a wise decision.

525
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,660
Seoul?

526
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,950
So?

527
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,320
I said, no way.

528
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,280
Gosh, I must've been out of my mind.

529
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,560
I practically walked into the tiger's den.

530
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm grateful to the girl he cheated on you with.

531
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,140
At least we had that to protect us from being eaten up.

532
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,150
Don't give him iced water.

533
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,800
Hey, it's just one glass. Don't make such a fuss.

534
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,160
Father, there's something I must tell you.

535
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,030
What is it? Is it about work?

536
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:34,310
It's something you should know.

537
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,950
Are you saying you planned the whole thing from the get-go?

538
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,140
Why you... Lee Soo Ryun! You little...

539
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,310
Father, no!

540
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,110
Father. Father.

541
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,490
Forget it.

542
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,720
Talking about who's at fault will only upset me more.

543
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,100
It may be a blessing in disguise.

544
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,990
The situation has worked out in our favor.

545
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,830
Father, we should tell them the truth.

546
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,480
What do you mean?

547
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,210
Are you saying we should tell Hwang Ki Nam about this?

548
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,070
I told you.

549
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,560
If we don't do anything, Myeong Hee will be made the scapegoat.

550
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,720
Listen, Soo Chan. Myeong Hee—

551
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,130
I know it's unfortunate.

552
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,580
But we must save our family first and compensate her somehow later.

553
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,920
That's what Soo Ryun was thinking when she started this.

554
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,090
This all happened in order to save our family, so we must set things right.

555
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,580
No, we can never do that!

556
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,140
If we suddenly reveal that, it's practically throwing our family at Hwang Ki Nam as prey.

557
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,880
So what you're saying is you want to throw Myeong Hee instead and put an end to this?

558
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,370
What's wrong with that?

559
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,770
To be frank, she's not even family.

560
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,890
Father!

561
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,370
I'm sorry.

562
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:11,430
I'm afraid I can't obey you this time.

563
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,470
What?

564
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,670
Hey, Lee Soo Chan! You—

565
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,330
Father!

566
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,620
- Father!
- Father!

567
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,460
Father, open your eyes.

568
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,940
- Father!
- Father!

569
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,800
He was lucky this time.

570
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,700
Like I've always told you, stress is the most deadly disease for patients with angina.

571
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,500
He may suffer a cardiac infarction, so you must make sure he gets absolute rest.

572
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,950
How long has Father been like that?

573
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,170
Why didn't you tell me?

574
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,940
If I did, would it have made a difference?

575
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,540
Don't tell...

576
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,840
Hwang Ki Nam.

577
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,050
Lee Soo Ryun, how could you still—

578
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,870
I will—

579
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,560
I will go to Seoul.

580
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,430
Since I started all of this,

581
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,930
I'll take responsibility.

582
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,220
Both Myeong Hee and Father did nothing wrong.

583
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,720
Yes, you made the right choice.

584
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,170
My son has a house in Seoul,

585
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,850
so they can stay there until they find a new home.

586
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,560
Yes. Then I'll make the preparations for them to leave immediately.

587
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,730
Yes, okay.

588
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,900
It's nothing?

589
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,560
So I canceled all my plans on my day off and covered for you for nothing?

590
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,840
Hey, Kim Myeong Hee. Are you acting up now that you're quitting soon?

591
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,130
No.

592
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,150
Why do you bother working here?

593
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,020
It seems like your heart's already overseas.

594
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,780
If you're going to skip work like this then just don't bother coming at all!

595
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,090
I'm sorry.

596
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,180
Are you sure nothing happened yesterday?

597
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,860
I'm sorry. You must have had a tough time because of me.

598
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:41,440
No, it's okay. But did you get in contact with Mr. Hwang Hee Tae?

599
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,210
He came to the hospital looking for you yesterday.

600
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:53,160
I said something to him for no reason and made him awfully concerned.

601
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,340
[Hee Tae's Song Writing Book]

602
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,400
It's a Teacher's Day present.

603
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,540
Write a song that will win at the University Song Festival.

604
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,790
I also have a present for you.

605
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,850
You do?

606
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,100
Here you go. This is for your upcoming finals

607
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,260
and these are for next year.

608
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,250
And...

609
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:30,340
this is a math concept notebook I wrote for you. It will be more useful for you than your reference books.

610
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,780
Why are you already giving me books for next year?

611
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,970
You can just give it to me next year.

612
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,690
Because I can't give it to you next year.

613
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,660
Today's our last lesson.

614
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,470
You can just listen from there.

615
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,310
I came to say a short goodbye.

616
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,300
I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.

617
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:25,160
I will probably never come back.

618
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,240
Okay.

619
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,490
I wanted to thank you before I left.

620
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:49,770
The few weeks we spent together...

621
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,560
were the happiest moments in my entire life.

622
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,740
Thank you.

623
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,900
Can I come a little closer to you for a second?

624
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,870
I'm sorry.

625
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,240
I tried my best to be careful but...

626
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,670
I broke it.

627
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,560
That's the way I am.

628
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:21,190
Everything that comes close to me keeps breaking.

629
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,770
I hope you continue to...

630
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,120
bravely go down

631
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,910
the path you wanted to take.

632
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,500
You are a...

633
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,280
strong person that isn't easily broken by others.

634
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,210
You too.

635
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,740
I hope you stay strong.

636
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,480
Bravely live your life.

637
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,780
Look back.

638
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:26,460
Turn around.

639
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:30,030
Turn around.

640
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,240
Turn around.

641
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,670
Turn around.

642
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,730
Turn around...

643
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,300
♫ Suddenly thinking when I passed by at sunset ♫

644
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,260
♫ I was so immature and innocent ♫

645
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,540
♫ I stop at the corner of my memory ♫

646
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,560
You'll ruin everything.

647
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,310
Just like how your father ruined your life,

648
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:35,330
you'll ruin Hee Tae's life the same way if you continue to stay by his side.

649
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:40,110
He's your son.

650
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:46,280
If you're curious, just stay by his side and watch

651
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:53,700
how far I can go.

652
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,980
Hee Tae...

653
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,260
Please leave him alone.

654
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,380
♫ ...wipe away my tears ♫

655
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,650
I'll break up with him.

656
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:12,740
♫ Can you find my childhood ♫

657
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:19,870
♫ hidden by the traces left by time? ♫

658
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:28,000
♫ The starlight that shined on me in the night sky ♫

659
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,630
♫ are you still there? ♫

660
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,670
[Youth of May]
♫ The sound of falling raindrops ♫

661
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,700
♫  ...that helps me to sleep ♫

662
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:10,210
♫ I was reminded of the time when I was so happy... ♫
