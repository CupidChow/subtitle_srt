00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,840
So, why do you keep provoking them? They think you're the bad guy.

2
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,620
I don't care what they think.

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,640
The more I think about it, the more baffled I get.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,190
There are plenty of seniors. How dare they order you to protest?

5
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,570
They're obviously trying to dump it all on you because they don't want to be dragged to Namsan.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,690
It's my choice. I'm not doing it because they're making me.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,850
Sure. Whatever, Mr. Fighter.

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,790
Everything you do bothers me.

9
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,990
And why's your taste in music so bad?

10
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,940
You told me to request a song I want to listen to.

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,420
Why must you nitpick about everything?

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,480
We really don't see eye to eye.

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,810
You say that all the time. Why did you team up with me, then?

14
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,170
Why do you think so?

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,860
Because there's no one to write the lyrics.

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm sorry, but there are plenty of people who can write the lyrics.

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Then what? Because I'm nice?

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,950
Wow, saying you're nice with your own words. Are you nuts?

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,810
Everyone says I'm nice except for you.

20
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,810
They say they like me because I'm like a saint.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,150
Wow.

22
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,640
Kim Kyeong Soo, don't be fooled.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,260
You're no saint.

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,640
You punks, do you think you're on a picnic now?

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,440
Hurry up! You're all so slow.

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,660
You slackers.

27

The Martial Law Army Headquarters... can't you write it properly? What is this?

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,350
Did you count it properly?

32
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
It should be right.

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,540
Didn't you go up to Seoul to get married?

35
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,670
I'll be on my way after I grab some medical supplies. So mind your own business.

36
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,210
Why? Did your father-in-law ask you to keep an eye out on what's happening here?

37
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,370
What?

Am I wrong?

Are you the Grim Reaper? Everyone who sees you disappears.

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,640
Did Hye Gun also go missing after meeting up with you?

41
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,390
It wasn't her. It was me.

42
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,680
The person he met before he disappeared was me.

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,610
Then, does that make me the Grim Reaper, too?

44
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,080
Why are you taking your anger on preventive custody out on her?

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,420
That's because her fiance—

46
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,160
She ran away from home.

47

She ran away from home. Can't you tell by looking at her?

Both of us haven't even been able to take a shower for the last few days, taking care of the injured.

59
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,130
- He passed the exam with the highest score, you know.
- Don't blatantly stare at him.

Is there anyone that's free? Can anyone take care of Kim Deok Bae?

Yes, his symptoms aren't getting any better.

142
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,190
No, Sir. The officials who were present at the meeting wrote them—

143
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,300
Mr. Hwang, we are in positions that require some legwork.

How will you control the situation if you sit behind a desk and simply receive reports?

This really troubles me.

I mean it's safe to say that martial law has been expanded mainly because of Gwangju.

- I'm sorry, sir.

I just couldn't get myself to shoot—

156
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,680
Do you think I fired that shot because I wanted to?

157
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,670
Hey, Kim Kyung Soo. Do you think that makes you a nice person?

158
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,750
This is the army. If you don't shoot, I have to.

159
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,620
Can you call yourself nice if you force things on others to keep your own hands clean?

160
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,800
That's what you call being selfish.

161
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm sorry, Sir.

162
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,890
If you don't want to shoot anyone, arrest them as quickly as you can,

163
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,420
before someone else shoots.

164
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,050
What on Earth is that sound? I've been hearing it all day.

165
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,680
Don't worry. It's probably nothing.

166
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,320
Brother, it's time to take your medicine.

167
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,820
Did Soo Chan really go to work this morning?

168
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,380
Why? Is he not answering the phone at the office?

169
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,950
Did you actually see Soo Chan leave?

170
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,300
Tell me. What is going on?

171
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,480
Brother, you need to calm down first.

172
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,050
Tell me! What happened to Soo Chan?

173
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,520
Sir.

174
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,510
Over here. A person has collapsed.

175
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,340
A man has collapsed. Please...

176
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,890
- My Gosh.
- Who told you to move?

177
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,660
Do you want to die? Get back to your position.

178
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,640
What are you all looking at? Eyes down!

179
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,680
Take him away.

180
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,890
Hey, get back to your position, you punk.

181
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,860
What? Who was arrested?

182
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,160
Soo Ryun's older brother. I'm not sure,

183
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,930
but can you check if he's really been arrested?

184
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,250
What a hassle.

185
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,110
Tell them I'll check.

186
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,210
But what is going on?

187
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,230
People are calling all day, asking me to find people.

188
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,010
There's no need for you to know. Just keep to the house for now.

189
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,510
By the way,

190
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,050
has Hee Tae called?

191
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,280
No.

192
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,440
You should check on him first. Don't sit back and do nothing just because he doesn't call first.

193
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,010
Father never asks about me.

194
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,290
Why aren't you asking about Jung Tae?

195
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,610
Why are you asking me that out of the blue?

196
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,290
Jung Tae is your son, too.

197
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,960
You haven't seen him in days. Aren't you worried about him?

198
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,270
Do you think I have the time to worry about the kid?

199
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,990
That's enough of your nonsense. Just give me that.

200
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,800
I finally got in touch with Mr. Lee.

201
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,630
He'll be here early in the morning.

202
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,590
That's a relief.

203
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,160
Once he gets here, let's leave immediately.

204
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,560
Immediately?

205
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Our plan was to stay here until Mr. Lee comes to get Jin Ah.

206
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,160
What's with that face?

207
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,760
It's not like that.

208
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,930
Then, what is it? If something is bothering you, just tell me.

209
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,440
It's just that...

210
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,800
if we leave, the ones left will have to do more work.

211
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,650
That's what I was worried about.

212
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,330
What? Were you thinking that I'm a pushover?

213
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,910
No way. I was thinking you are such a good person.

214
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,730
But listen, Myeong Hee. If you really want to be good, you must put yourself first.

215
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,480
If you put others before yourself, that's hypocrisy, I think.

216
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,390
Don't people normally call that a sacrifice?

217
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,800
That's what other people would call it.

218
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,190
But to someone who loves you, it's hypocrisy.

219
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,010
So, for now, let's put you and me first.

220
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,540
Okay?

221
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,960
We'll be training indoors again today. Get ready and come out as quickly as you can.

222
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,970
Gosh, I feel so cooped up.

223
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,460
Why can't we go out?

224
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,800
It's my birthday today and I'm stuck indoors all day.

225
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,440
Oh, my. Is it your birthday today, Sung Il?

226
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,330
Gosh, then we should celebrate.

227
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,400
You said you love comic books, right? Should we go borrow some comics?

228
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,530
If we can't even train outside, how can we go to the rental store?

229
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,680
My gosh, we have two fast runners here. You two can rush over there and borrow some.

230
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,230
Gather around. I have a plan.

231
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,820
I'm going grocery shopping.

232
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,840
See you.

233
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,270
Excuse me, Coach. Do you have any digestive medicine?

234
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,500
I think I have an upset stomach.

235
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,670
You have an upset stomach? You, Jin Kyu?

236
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,760
- Then let me prick your fingers.
- What?

237
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,710
I think some medicine will do.

238
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,810
Medicine won't do any good. Pricking all the fingers is the best remedy.

239
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,470
It's still not going through?

240
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,760
Are all the phones in town not working?

241
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,370
No, just Gwangju.

242
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,940
I can't take this. I need to go.

243
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,150
Where? To Gwangju?

244
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,150
By yourself?

245
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,350
My Gosh, but the rumors are so disturbing.

246
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,150
That's why I need to go.

247
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,780
I hope there's nothing wrong.

248
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,410
Hyun Cheol! Where are you going?

249
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,290
Mother, I need to go to Gwangju. I'll be back soon.

250
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,440
Don't go. Stay with me.

251
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,470
Mother, have a seat.

252
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:32,130
I'll be back as soon as I check that my kids are well.

253
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,300
My gosh.

254
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,360
My mother is so pretty.

255
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,690
I'll be back.

256
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,080
Don't come out.

257
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,360
Be careful!

258
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,000
Hey! Let's buy a Choco Pie, too! Instead of a cake.

259
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,600
Is it your birthday?

260
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:33,040
Pl-Please stop! You'll kill someone like that. That's enough.

261
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,970
Grab everyone that's here!

262
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,490
- Lift the emergency martial law!

270

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,290

♫ Rose of Sharon, thousand miles ♫

277
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,940
Take aim!

278
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,560
- What's that?
- What's going on?

279
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,510
What is this noise?

280
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,280
Run! Run!

281
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,140
Go! There are no tickets! No tickets!

282
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,950
What are you all doing gathered here?

283
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,180
What do you mean? How could there be no tickets at a bus terminal?

284
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,450
My goodness. All the buses going into Gwangju have been suspended.

285
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,990
Then, what do I do if I want to go to Gwangju?

286
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,710
The only way is to walk since all the cars are prohibited from entering, too.

287
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,980
There are no buses?

288
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,170
My goodness, there aren't any.

289
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,320
What am I going to do?

290
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,400
Excuse me. If you have a map, can I borrow it?

291
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,590
To walk?

292
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,610
Gwangju is shedding blood. Why would you go there?

293
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,010
With legs like that, it'll take at least 10 days.

294
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,980
Lee Jin Ah?

295
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,200
J-Jin...

296
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,930
Myeong Hee!

297
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,790
Jin Ah...

298
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,540
My goodness...

299
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,640
Jin Ah!

300
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,650
Jin Ah! Dad is here!

301
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,490
Jin Ah!

302
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,140
Wake up!

303
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,460
She's regained consciousness.

304
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,770
She's asleep right now because of the medication, so don't worry.

305
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,700
Thankfully, the surgery results look good, too.

306
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,180
I heard from Myeong Hee.

307
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,020
Thank you, Doctor.

308
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,490
I didn't do anything.

309
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,250
If it weren't for Hee Tae, things could have gone very wrong.

310
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,720
Life savior.

311
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,300
Thank you, Doctor!

312
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,120
My goodness! For saving my Jin Ah!

313
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,590
Myeong Hee,

314
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,260
go to the ER and say your goodbyes first.

315
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,790
I'm going to see Seok Cheol while I'm here.

316
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,140
Go ahead. Take your time.

317
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,070
Myeong Hee!

318
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,510
Earlier, I couldn't say anything because things were so hectic.

00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,530
On my way here, I passed the protest crowds

320
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,350
and I saw the soldiers beating people up, shooting them. It's a total mess out there.

321

You must have been surprised, not knowing what was going on.

What about my brother?

No matter how I think about it,

326
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,080
I think I saw your brother earlier in that messy crowd.

327
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:45,980
The way he looked, and even the trainers he was wearing. He looked just like your brother.

328

I was busy dodging bullets in that hectic situation, so I couldn't take care of him.

What is it? Why are there so many patients with gun wounds?

339
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,170
The military is firing ammo in groups!

Firing ammo in groups?

Are these all the patients?

There's a truckload of patients that are left in the streets.

No one wants to go help either because they're even shooting at ambulances!

What? Shooting at ambulances?

346
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,820
They're even shooting at young children! They're not thinking about who or what they're shooting at.

Let's go out!

We can't leave patients out in the street like that!

We'll take the cars

350

There are people on the streets wounded by gunshots.

Are they the only ones on the streets? The military is everywhere, too.

The good people are always the ones that reflect on their actions.

482
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,920
The bad ones see no fault.

483
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:16,760
Real hypocrites don't even consider themselves hypocrites.

484
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,480
I didn't say anything about Myeong Soo on purpose.

485
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,310
Because I thought you wouldn't let me go.

486
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,360
You did good.

487
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:35,210
If I knew it was because of Myeong Soo, I would have never let you go.

488
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,320
I would have gone by myself.

489
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,060
I can't be in danger, but it's okay for you?

490
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,190
Because there's nothing left for me.

491
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,360
Even if something happens to me, you would still have Myeong Soo and

492
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,740
your parents.

493
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,230
But if I lose you, I have no one.

494
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,610
So let me be the one to handle the dangerous things.

495
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,690
I'm not telling you to do this or that, I'm asking you for this favor.

496
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,920
Don't worry.

497
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,610
It's because it's cold.

498
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,690
What happened?

499
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,060
Did the People's Army really come?

500
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,510
They're not the People's Army.

501
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,040
They were our country's military.

502
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm telling you they were the People's Army. Why would our military shoot our people?

503
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,620
Why did the military turn into villains suddenly?

504
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,790
Hey, even in Mazinga Z. The real villain is

505
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,660
Dr. Hell who is trying to take over the world.

506
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,560
Wouldn't the military men also have someone behind them who's the real villain?

507
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,020
Catch that bastard.

508
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,130
Hurry.

509
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,600
Follow me!

510
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,570
Follow me!

511
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,270
Follow me!

512
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,130
Come here!

513
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,230
Take that bastard.

514
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,730
Then, who's the real villain?

515
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:15,270
What are they trying to overtake?

516
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,590
I can't stand this childish conversation!

517
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,510
Mr. Hwang...

518
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,380
You ended up in a situation in which you need my help.

519
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,580
I can't help you twice, so be careful.

520
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,130
By any chance, do you know where your sister is?

521
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,270
I can't contact her.

522
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:15,680
The car is waiting outside. Don't go out in the meantime and just rest.

523
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,250
Sir...

524
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,220
Please let the others go, too.

525
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,350
Please, they are all people who've been dragged here with no sins.

526
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,010
Those that are hurt.

527
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,800
Or at least the young ones.

528
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,780
Stop with the gibberish and live quietly.

529
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,450
I really want to throw your entire family in there but I'm holding back.
(Gwangju dialect)

530
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,080
Stick 'em right into the ground!

531
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,990
Mr. Private First Class Kim Kyung Soo still isn't ready to use his gun.

532
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,300
Open your eyes. Look at me properly.

533
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,460
You have to see the mess everyone's in, all because of you.

534
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,540
How about now? Are you ready to use your gun now?

535
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,520
Oh, right.

536
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,960
Whether your comrades die or not,

537
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,700
you still care more about the rebels.

538
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,370
Damn it.

539
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,950
Kim Kyung Soo, you're not a virtuous person.

540
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,340
There is no such thing as a virtuous person.

541
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,840
It's about always making the best possible decisions.

542
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,180
And the thing is, you don't hand over the burden of making those decisions to someone else.

543
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,820
That isn't being virtuous. That's being strong.

544
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,550
I like you because you're strong.

545
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,500
She was a nurse.

546
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:33,670
What?

547
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,150
I cannot shoot someone who isn't a rebel.

548
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,230
Myeong Hee! What are you doing? Hurry and get in!

549
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,320
Hwang Hee Tae!

550
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,140
Hey, stop the car!

551
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,840
Seok Cheol is alive.

552
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,580
She's in Gwangju right now.

553
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,840
You don't have to give us a ride.

554
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,250
I'm just dropping you off on my way to picking up blood supplies.

555
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,010
We're comrades who fought together through life and death. Of course, I can do this much.

556
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,390
You just need to be dropped off at the train station?

557
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,150
Let's go see Myeong Soo before going to the station.

558
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,990
Can we?

559
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,760
You'll only be relieved after you see him.

560
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,280
And we can return Myeong Soo's shoe.

561
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,190
Ah, my blood sugar's shooting up.

562
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:36,350
Then where is it. Where should I drop you off?

563
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,760
Before the terminal—

564
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,810
Myeong Hee!

565
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:52,350
Why are you here?

566
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,040
Follow me, quickly. Myeong Soo is waiting, too.

567
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,880
We were on our way to the dorms, too.

568
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,980
Let's go to Naju.

569
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,320
This is not the place to be anymore.

570
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,170
Take Myeong Soo. I'll take care of myself.

571
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,090
Kim Myeong Hee!

572
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,740
Then I shall go and help Dr. Yoo with something...

573
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,360
No, you don't have to do that.

574
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,460
I was in need of an extra pair of hands!

575
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,140
I'll get the car going.

576
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,570
Why don't you two talk in private?

577
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,990
Why's a relationship between a father and a daughter that cold?

578
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,500
Looks like you'll suffer quite a bit once you get married.

579
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,900
I wondered where Myeong Hee got her stone-cold attitude. Now I know she got it from her father.

580
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,910
What do you mean, stone-cold. She's too much of a softie, that it makes me upset.

581
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,840
You're already blinded by love, I see.

582
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,180
Nothing can beat that, nothing.

583
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:32,680
But how did the station receive enough blood supply to share?

584
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,360
Blood donations.

585
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,860
There were that many employees' blood donations?

586
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,730
No, regular citizens.

587
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:44,160
I made some announcements that we were short on blood, and there were a ton of people who volunteered to donate.

588
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,270
Why? Is it a song you like?

589
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:03,330
Not me, but my friend.

590
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,350
What is this?

591
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,860
[Gwangju Peace Hospital]

592
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,610
How many times do I have to tell you I'm not going!

593
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,290
Why? Did that guy ask you to be with him?

594
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,040
Does he want to get married?

595
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,120
Don't worry about how I live my life.

596
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,450
What about his parents?

597
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,520
Do they know you're seeing each other?

598
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,430
How can you trust someone that won't even introduce you to them?!

599
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:57,270
Don't regret this later. Let's go to Naju.

600
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:01,290
You don't know a thing, don't say that...

601
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,260
Ma'am!

602
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,620
Dr. Byeong Cheol and Hee Tae...

603
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:23,360
♫ You, who are too beautiful it hurts ♫

604
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,000
♫ You, who would smile with sad eyes ♫

605
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,190
♫ You, who came to me like destiny and gave your love to me ♫

606
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,850
What are you talking about? They went out together!

607
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,460
There was only one person at the scene!

608
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,090
I don't even know if he's dying somewhere.

609
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,690
But there's nothing I can do.

610
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,030
I heard they found Hwang Hee Tae and are holding onto him.

611
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,340
Did they really say that?

612
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,330
He'll end up ruining your life, too!

613
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,880
He's not the one that ruined my life. It's you!

614
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,750
I'm going to kill your entire family.

615
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,530
Brother Hee Tae might die.

616
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,700
What do you mean?

617
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,280
Even if the lightning strikes here, I won't budge.

618
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,023
So that you can find me.
