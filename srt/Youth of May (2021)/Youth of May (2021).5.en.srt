Oh, it must be here somewhere...

You know how my mom was. I take after her, you know.

That may not be true seeing what you did today.

- No, it's just that I think you're really cut out for it.
- What?

294
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,650
You find a target, cook up a hypothesis, and pretend it's a fact.

295
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,590
That's what my father does all the time.

296

What did you just, punk?

297
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,800
There you go. I knew you'd grab me by the collar.

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,510
- Come here.
- What? What are you doing?

299
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,550
Pretend we're friends.

300
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,670
If it looks like we're fighting, you see the two cars over there?

301
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,800
You guys might get arrested.

Gosh.

Hey, let's go. Come on.

Don't know, maybe.

309
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,560
They want you to pick out your dress today. The fitting takes time.

310
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,130
Come on.

311
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,950
What are the odds of us running into each other in Seoul? At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that?

312
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,490
I know. Without your help, I would've had to forget about studying abroad.

313
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,270
Is that so? Then I shouldn't have helped.

Anyway, your passport will be ready soon. Just apply for your visa in time.

Okay.

Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

318
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,610
Myeong Hee, would you like something to eat?

319
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,530
We won't arrive until well past lunchtime.

Let me get you something.

321
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,180
Hold on. Are you trying to humiliate me? Come on. Forget it.

322
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,840
I mean it, It's my treat.

323
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,130
Seriously. Don't do this.

324
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,480
This isn't enough. Buy me something more expensive another time.

325
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,650
- Fine.
- Here.

326
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,490
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

327
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,710
Can I get something?

328
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,270
Let me see. Some bread,

329
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:04,760
butter cookies, soda–

330
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,630
- I'll take eggs, too.
- Sure.

331
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,870
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

332
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,950
I shall peel an egg for Grandpa Myeong Hee.

333
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,940
What? "Grandpa Myeong Hee?"

334
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,110
Myeong Hee.

335
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,180
Thank you.

336
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,370
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

337
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:18,984
No.

338
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:23,064
It says here that Y is a natural number.

339
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:27,734
X is greater than 36, and Y is a natural number. So which quadrant is it?

340
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:33,924
The first quadrant.

341
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:36,784
Right, the first quadrant. The first quadrant.

342
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:38,694
Hold on.

343
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:43,184
Where is the third quadrant?

344
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:51,324
Jin Ah, didn't you learn this in middle school?

345
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:53,664
I don't know!

346
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:57,914
My brain isn't functioning as we've been doing this for three hours.

347
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:00,144
Sit up.

348
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:01,924
Come on.

349
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:07,444
At this rate, you can't go to Seoul during your school break.

350
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:10,064
You said you wanted to check out TBC.

351
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:13,364
I should've just gone to Seoul with Myeong Hee.

352
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:16,354
Seoul? What's she doing in Seoul?

353
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:19,774
She went to the capitol building to get her passport made.

354
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:24,324
I should've tagged along to see Gyeongbokgung Palace and tour around Seoul.

355
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,004
Are you going somewhere?

356
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:29,324
Oh, I have to go Seoul.

357
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:41,354
How will you solve functions when you don't even know quadrants?

358
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,134
Open your book.

359
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:56,214
Thank you for the ride. You helped me out so much all day today.

360
00:30:56,214 --> 00:31:00,394
Come on. Your place is on my way home anyway.

361
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:04,944
Thank you so much again. I'll be sure to return the favor.

362
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:07,214
Get home safely.

363
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:09,254
All right. Good night.

364
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:16,544
Myeong Hee.

365
00:31:18,074 --> 00:31:22,854
If you have some time tomorrow, can you help me with something?

366
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:39,844
Hee Tae, what are you doing here?

367
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:44,314
Are you on your way back from Seoul?

368
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,454
Yes.

369
00:31:48,454 --> 00:31:50,494
With Lee Soo Chan?

370
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:53,274
How did you know?

371
00:31:53,864 --> 00:31:57,004
You could've asked me to go with you.

372
00:31:57,694 --> 00:32:00,094
How could I do that knowing you're getting engaged?

373
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:01,974
Why not?

374
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:04,624
All you had to do was ask me, but you didn't.

375
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:05,854
Look, this is—

376
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:08,374
All you had to do was ask!

377
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:10,304
You know that I waited for you to say–

378
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,144
Exactly. So how can I, knowing that?

379
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:19,974
If we went to Seoul together, what about your engagement preparation?

380
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:23,604
What will you say to your family as well as to Soo Ryun's?

381
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,164
What do you expect me to do when there's nothing I can do?

382
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:29,794
Why do you say there's nothing you can do?

383
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:34,694
Do they have something on you? Is someone threatening you?

384
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:37,434
- Hwang Hee Tae.
- No, right?

385
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:40,614
You just don't want to be a bad person!

386
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,814
Do you think I'm not afraid of anything?

387
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:50,794
You probably think I don't even care what people think of me.

388
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:53,174
I'm trying to hold back every single moment.

389
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:55,194
Because it's you.

390
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:57,924
Because I believed you felt the same way about me.

391
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,994
We only have a month.

392
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:07,914
I don't even want to let a day pass by like this.

393
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:15,034
I thought you were holding back, too.

394
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,884
But I guess you're–

395
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,024
I guess you're okay.

396
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:25,384
I'm done writing letters to someone who won't write me back.

397
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:39,804
♫ The wind was weeping ♫

398
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:47,404
♫ That winter that seems to be long gone ♫

399
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:55,314
♫ Splendid flowers on the streets, filled with spring's scents ♫

400
00:33:55,314 --> 00:34:02,724
♫ Even those flowers, I cannot feel a thing for them ♫

♫ You, who are too beautiful it hurts ♫

♫ You, who would smile with sad eyes ♫

♫ I hope you'll fade away like a dream ♫

405
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,974
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

406
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:49,844
What brings you by so late?

407
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:52,944
Well, here.

408
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:55,444
Can you give this to Soo Ryun?

409
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:01,974
What is this? You can give it to her yourself.

410
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:06,094
Well, I'm not invited to her engagement ceremony.

411
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,014
Plus–

412
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:11,174
She won't want to see me because it'll be awkward.

413
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,444
[Declaration for Democracy]

414
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,724
Soo Ryun wrote it.

415
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:24,254
She worked so hard on it, so she should see how it turned out.

416
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,094
Make sure she gets it.

417
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,614
Hey.

418
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,984
So? What can I help you with today?

419
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:21,804
I need to borrow your fine taste. Let's go.

420
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,804
We have many places to check out.

421
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:27,114
What about this? This will go with everything.

422
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:29,264
Myeong Hee! Myeong Hee.

423
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:31,084
What's your shoe size?

424
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:33,664
230mm. Why do you ask?

425
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,584
Oh, these happen to be 230mm.

426
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,564
Here. Try them on.

427
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:43,334
Why should I? We're here to buy your shoes.

428
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,494
Well, this is j-j-just, just try them on.

429
00:36:47,494 --> 00:36:49,464
Come on.

430
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:54,574
Here.

431
00:36:54,574 --> 00:37:01,544
♫ I know, that's how you and I will become one ♫

433
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:06,384
How pretty.

434
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:12,414
♫ Get into the rhythm shared between us ♫

435
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:14,604
Myeong Hee! Myeong Hee!

436
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:19,114
This one. This too.

437
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,474
And this one too. Go try them on.

438
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:23,734
Why do you keep doing this? Pick out things for yourself.

439
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:27,954
Goodness. Just go try them on.

440
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,574
Go on. We don't have time.

441
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:32,344
Hurry. Go.

442
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:34,854
- I'm really okay–
- Go on!

443
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,774
- Watch out.
- My gosh!

444
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,394
What's going on?

445
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:03,694
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

446
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:06,174
Those punks.

447
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:07,714
Are you all right?

448
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:09,504
- Gosh.
- Yes, I'm okay.

449
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,314
Goodness.

450
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:14,464
What's going on though?

451
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:16,364
Obviously,

452
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:21,344
they're trying to catch the kids who protested. What a mess.

453
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:26,734
Goodness. I see your daughter is having a lot of fun lately.

454
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:31,144
Keep a good eye on your daughter. She's not a kid anymore.

455
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:41,014
I thought we came to pick out your clothes, but these are all for me.

456
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,494
You're making me uncomfortable.

457
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:46,144
Just consider it as a gift for your help. Look, I'm choosing my clothes now.

458
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:50,624
I came to repay my debts, but I feel like I've only gained more.

459
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,274
Come on, it's just a dress. There's no need to say that.

460
00:38:54,274 --> 00:38:58,614
Myeong Hee, you're almost like a sister to Soo Ryun.

461
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:02,674
It's completely normal for siblings to buy each other an outfit for their engagement.

462
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,454
How does this look?

463
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,044
It looks more like what the groom would wear.

464
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:18,054
What about this? This will look good on you.

465
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,094
I like it. It's nice and neat.

466
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:23,284
Ma'am, can I try this on?

467
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:26,424
Oh, there's someone in the dressing room right now.

468
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:27,504
Can you wait for a second?

469
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:29,054
Sure.

470
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:51,094
Hey, future brother-in-law!

471
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:52,434
Hello, Soo Chan.

472
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,194
Did you come to get your suit fitted?

473
00:39:55,194 --> 00:40:00,504
Gosh. What a great choice, you look like a prince.

474
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:03,904
Are you going to try that on?

475
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:07,074
Yes. I'll go try this on.

476
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,634
Okay.

477
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:35,514
Hey, look at this.

478
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:39,544
It's so tight that I can't even breathe–

479
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:47,114
Myeong Hee.

480
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,534

Gosh, that looks perfect on you.

I don't think it's a marriage. Just a promise saying you'll get married.

Isn't promising to get married basically a wedding?

00:57:56,754 --> 00:58:00,244
No. I shouldn't have popped up from behind.

647
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:03,634
Don't worry. It's really fine.

648
00:58:03,634 --> 00:58:05,644
Go and eat some more.

649
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:24,514
My, the groom is so good-looking.

650
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:26,464
She wouldn't need any wedding gifts!

651
00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:27,934
I know.

652
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:30,874
Soo Ryun is such a lucky girl.

653
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,894
He's handsome, and he's a doctor on top of that.

654
00:58:32,894 --> 00:58:36,994
It's a mystery that he didn't get snatched up sooner, you know?

655
00:58:36,994 --> 00:58:39,144
It is a mystery indeed.

656
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:42,054
He's so good-looking.

657
00:58:42,054 --> 00:58:44,654
- She is such a lucky girl.
- Oh my.

658
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:47,774
What a fine young man.

659
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,264
I know. He's very handsome.

660
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:51,864
Even the grasshoppers aren't helping me today.

661
00:59:55,054 --> 01:00:00,684
I look most forward to May every year.

662
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:07,244
On a May night, even if you sing badly, the grasshoppers help you out.

663
01:00:07,244 --> 01:00:08,694
The grasshoppers?

664
01:00:08,694 --> 01:00:13,914
Whenever I think of you, Myeong Hee, I can't help but sing.

665
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:22,294
Myeong Hee, do you want to go out with me just until the end of May?

666
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,634
Are you okay?

667
01:00:55,874 --> 01:00:57,834
No.

668
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:02,174
I'm not okay.

669
01:01:05,324 --> 01:01:08,334
I don't want this May

670
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:11,824
to pass by without you.

671
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:18,594
♫ Above this pitch black night sky ♫

672
01:01:21,234 --> 01:01:26,134
♫ One brightly shining star ♫

673
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:34,524
♫ Although I don't know for whom it is shining ♫

674
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:40,334
♫ It lingers there all alone all night long ♫

675
01:01:42,184 --> 01:01:47,114
♫ I suddenly miss you ♫

676
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:54,314
♫ But since I cannot see you ♫

677
01:01:56,504 --> 01:02:03,534
♫ I write your name over and over again ♫

678
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:08,434
♫ in my diary ♫

679
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:43,244
♫ A starry starry night ♫

680
01:02:44,144 --> 01:02:50,614
♫ One of the shining stars resembles you ♫

681
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:57,334
♫ So I'll hide it inside my pocket ♫

682
01:03:00,024 --> 01:03:04,874
♫ and gift it to you ♫

683
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:13,134
♫ Even when I close my eyes, it seeps through ♫

684
01:03:13,134 --> 01:03:20,274
♫ What shall I do about you? ♫

685
01:03:21,934 --> 01:03:24,484
♫ A night, blooming like a dream ♫

686
01:03:24,484 --> 01:03:26,894
Do you think you can bear me now that you're grown up?

687
01:03:26,894 --> 01:03:28,314
What would you have done if someone from our families had seen it?

688
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:29,734
Why are you so angry?

689
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:31,794
You can't say that when you ran away from your engagement ceremony.

690
01:03:31,794 --> 01:03:34,544
Why did he drink so much?

691
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:35,554
I'm off today and tomorrow.

692
01:03:35,554 --> 01:03:36,854
Then let's hang out the whole time!

693
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:41,174
What a coincidence. I can't believe Hee Tae's brother is your roommate, Myeong Soo.

694
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:42,794
What is your relationship?

695
01:03:42,794 --> 01:03:43,774
Joint management?

696
01:03:43,774 --> 01:03:45,714
It's so the investors can put their worries to rest.

697
01:03:45,714 --> 01:03:46,904
Call off the engagement.

698
01:03:46,904 --> 01:03:49,968
Hwang Hee Tae is seeing someone.
