No.

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,110
I'm not okay.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't want this May

What brings you here?

8
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,850
It's nothing.

[Congratulations to Hwang Hee Tae and Lee Soo Ryun on their engagement!]

10
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,570
Thank you for coming such a long way.

11
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,790
When your children get married,

12
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,390
- remember to invite me.
- Yes, of course.

13
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,000
Congratulations, again.

14
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,840
Whenever you hold a family event, don't forget to invite me.

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,770
I'll be the first to congratulate you.

16
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,190
Thank you.

17
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,770
Once again, thank you so much for coming.

18
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,130
Child, the guests are leaving. Where is Hee Tae?

19
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,350
He's been missing since earlier. Is he not feeling well?

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
I sent him home first.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,610
What do you mean you sent him first?

22
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,440
He said he wasn't feeling well since this morning.

23
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,090
So I told him to go home first and rest.

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,390
But still! How could he go home?!

25

[Episode 6, A cough, love, and...]

27
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,500
What's wrong with Hee Tae?

28
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,840
It seemed like he had cold symptoms.

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I see.

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,050
Myeong Hee was coughing all day, too.

31
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,640
It must be due to the seasonal changes.

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,230
It was so hectic that I didn't even realize Myeong Hee had left.

33
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,500
Did you say goodbye to her?

34
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,530
It was both hectic for both you and me,

35
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,430
so she must have left quietly.

36
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,590
Myeong Hee isn't the type to have others worry about her.

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
- Soo Ryun.
- Yes?

38
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,010
You did great today.

39
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,960
It would have been nice if Mom was there, too.

40
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,320
Why can't I walk you to the front of your house?

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,640
We're practically already there.

42
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,150
And... just in case—

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,560
You don't want Jin Ah to see us and cause a fuss?

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,860
All right.

45
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,360
What are you doing tomorrow?

46
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,510
Tomorrow, I'm going to go to church before going to work.

47
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,250
Then, I should hold tomorrow's tutoring session in the evening.

48
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,320
So I can see you around the time you end work.

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,320
You should just give me your work schedule.

50
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,010
I'll plan our dates around your work schedule.

51
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,440
All right.

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
This must be why lyrics are written.

53
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,320
I can't call you,

54
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,850
and I don't even have a picture of you to think of you.

55
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,090
The night is too long.

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,690
Can I at least take this with me?

57
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,220
So I can think of you, Myeong Hee.

58
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,270
Then shouldn't you give me something, too?

59
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,530
I don't have anything I can give you. Do you want at least this button?

60
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll make do with this.

61
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,780

63
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,580
Sorry.

64
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,140
If you're not going to grab a room, go on home.

65
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,480
- Yes, yes. Sorry!
- It's just how the law is.

66
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,820
Sorry!

67
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,520
I'll be on my way.

68
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,540
Okay, okay. See you tomorrow, Myeong Hee.

69
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,340
Get home safely!

70
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,040
Father, did you sleep well?

71
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,410
You were feeling sick yesterday?

72
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,770
Are you feeling better now?

73
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,590
Yes.

74
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,910
Now that you're older, you think you can stand up against me, don't you?

75
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,240
Don't kid yourself.

76
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,580
The only thing you can stop is my hand.

77
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,540
And no matter how much you try, I have you within the palm of my hand.

78
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:02,030
Also, if you ever disappoint me as my son

79
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,590
in front of people like that again,

80
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,720
then I won't stop with just a slap on your face.

81
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,540
Do you understand?

82
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,550
Sir! A guest is here.

83
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,130
It must have been so hectic with the engagement yesterday. You didn't have to.

84
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,480
I wasn't able to greet you before the engagement.

85
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,800
My father said I should deliver the dowry in person no matter what.

86
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,500
Such precious things!

87
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,140
Please make sure to send our gratitude to your father.

88
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,650
I will.

89
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,290
- Is the food ready?
- Yes.

90
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,150
What about Jeong Tae?

91
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,370
Jeong Tae went on a church retreat. He'll be back tomorrow evening.

92
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,460
Let's go eat.

93
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,510
- You!
- Hold on!

94
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,250
If you're going to hit me, this side.

95
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,440
How could you disappear like that without saying anything?

96
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,990
Do you know how flustered I was, trying to come up with an excuse to tell the elders?

97
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,180
Sorry. I had something come up yesterday.

98
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,700
I saw you yesterday.

99
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,970
Leaving with Myeong Hee.

100
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,790
What are you two going to do from now on?

101
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,600
It doesn't really matter to you what we do, does it?

102
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,770
We're engaged as you wanted,

103
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,300
and we'll maintain this until the factory is completed.

104
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,230
Our relationship ends there.

105
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,800
Why would it not matter?

106
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,690
Like you just said, we have to maintain this situation.

107
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,410
If people find out about your relationship, the engagement and everything else will be ruined.

108
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,650
All right, I'll be careful from now on.

109
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,990
This isn't someone else's problem!

110
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,550
And just saying, but thank goodness I was the only one that saw you two.

111
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,680
What would have happened if someone else had seen you?

112
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,680
How am I supposed to explain that?

113
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,120
What are you so mad about?

114
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,140
Who said I'm mad?

Come in and have some dessert.

- Okay.
- Okay.

117
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,870
Why don't you show me your album?

118
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,780
Let's see how ugly you were when you were younger.

119
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,090
I don't have any albums.

120
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,410
Of course, you don't.

My mom.

What?

Not the mother downstairs, but my biological mother.

127
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,720
That's the only picture I have of her before she got sick.

128
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,940
Why do you have your mother's picture shoved in a corner?

129
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,580
You should have it in a frame.

Then, what about you? You don't have a single picture of your mom at your house either.

131
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:18,680
That's because I put her picture away so that I'm not constantly thinking about her.

132
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,740
It's the same for me, too.

You were too young.

- It must have been hard because of all the events.
- Events?

137
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,200
Well, like athletic competitions, welcoming ceremonies, graduations.

138
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,180
You must have thought about her then.

139
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,420
The only event that I had to deal with without my mother was my high school graduation,

140

166
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,730
Hello?

167
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,370
Brother-in-Law! Are you feeling better?

168
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,250
I feel like we haven't spent enough time together.

169
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,320
How about we meet up this evening, just us guys?

170
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,230
Well...

171
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,370
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.

172
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,540
Come on, don't be like that. Please free up some time.

173
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,110
I promise it won't take long.

174
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,480
Well...

175
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,580
[Resume]

176
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,930
The cousin I mentioned before.

177
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,160
I noticed that the president of Changhwa Pharmaceuticals lacks experience.

178
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,010
Wouldn't joint management be helpful?

179
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,710
I appreciate your thoughtful opinion,

180
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,110
but his father, Mr. Lee Chang Geun, is already participating in the management.

181
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,070
I don't think they'll be interested in joint management.

182
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,130
This isn't like you.

183
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,110
Are you already trying to protect your in-laws?

184
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
It's not like that, sir.

185
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,940
Thank you.

186
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,580
You know the president left for the Middle East yesterday, right?

187
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,730
Emergency martial law will be expanded soon.

188
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm saying that the boat is about to set sail.

189
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,110
To get into the same boat, this is your only chance.

190
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,100
Mr. Hwang, do you think the new government

191
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,250
will only last for five years?

192
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,750
You need to look far ahead. You're too good to be stuck where you are now.

193
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,350
You're absolutely right. I'd like to pour you one as well.

194
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,950
Good.

195
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,620
Let me pour you one.

196
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,580
One more?

197
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,880
- Another bottle, please.
- Coming up.

198
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
Cheers.

199
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,880
This is nice. You can slow down if you want.

200
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,880
You don't have to drink as fast as I do.

201
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,140
Goodness, you don't have to worry about me. Have two, okay?

202
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,580
So, what's your plan now?

203
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,990
The wedding and everything. Where will you live?

204
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,550
I guess we will go with what our parents want.

205
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:44,120
Is that also why you had an engagement ceremony? Your parents made you do it?

206
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:55,080
What about Soo Ryun? From going on that blind date to the engagement, did she make those choices herself?

207
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,350
Listen, Hee Tae.

208
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,350
Just because you don't want this marriage,

209
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,880
it doesn't mean you don't have any responsibilities and duties to fulfill.

210
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,210
I believe I'm fulfilling all my duties.

211
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,050
You can't say that...

212
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,680
when you ran away from your engagement ceremony.

213
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,320
Also, you didn't run away alone that day.

214
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,320
Excuse me. May I ask why you're here?

215
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,010
It's nothing.

216
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,980
Wait.

217
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,920
Why did you want to see me today?

218
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,480
Whatever you're up to, you should stop right now.

219
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,460
Don't do anything you can't take responsibility for.

220
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,780
I don't think I'm doing anything I can't take responsibility for.

221
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,170
Do you even know what it means to take responsibility?

222
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,580
It means to make sure no one gets hurt by your actions.

223
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,860
Even if everyone around you becomes devastated, do you think it's not a problem as long as you're okay?

224
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,750
How can you be so reckless?

225
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,080
Let me ask you something.

226
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,010
Are you sure you're angry because of Soo Ryun?

227
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,920
What?

228
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,670
You be responsible and do your duty.

229
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,700
Living without regrets comes first for me.

230
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,450
Last one?

231
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,860
Ah, what's this? It was you? I thought it was Hee Tae.

232
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,390
Is he not here yet? I thought you had a tutoring session this evening.

233
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,120
I have no idea what's going on. Did he forget about it?

234
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,040
But how do you know I had tutoring in the evening?

235
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,380
Um, well...

236
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,980
I'm here.

237
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,110
You're late. I was getting worried about you.

238
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,560
The thing is...

239
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,830
I did all the homework, but I couldn't finish writing down all the questions I got wrong.

240
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:37,860
Wow, you did all the homework? That was a lot.

241
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,410
Good girl, Jin Ah.

242
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,470
Oppa, did you drink?

243
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,770
- Music is what?
- Math!

244
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,060
That's right! Go turn on some music.

245
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,070
Show me your fine taste in music, PD Jin Ah.

246
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,240
Do you want a Korean song or a pop song?

247
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,940
Hee Tae. Hee Tae?

248
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,050
Hee Tae, wake up. Hee Tae.

249
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,650
Hee Tae. Hee Tae.

250
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,410
Hee Tae, wake up.

251
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,020
Myeong Hee, this is the first time I'm seeing you in my dream.

252
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,230
Gosh, I guess you haven't sobered up yet.

253
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:15,890
Teacher, wake up and have some hangover soup.

254
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,670
Why am I here?

255
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,590
I told you to make soybean sprout soup. Who'd want to eat this spicy soup first thing in the morning?

256
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,790
I didn't make it for you. Just eat your breakfast and go to school!

257
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,120
This is totally making my hangover go away.

258
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,280
As expected, he knows what's tasty!

259
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,860
These Jeolla Province folks don't know what's tasty.

260
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,180
I'm from Jeolla Province. I'm a Gwangju native.

261
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,890
Jeolla Province is famous for good food indeed!

262
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,540
You talk like a Seoul native. I had no idea you were from Gwangju.

263
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,170
You must not speak with a dialect much.

264
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,960
Oh, I'm good at it, but my father forced me to use the standard accent.

265
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,110
Of course! No wonder such a wise man did a great job raising his son.

266
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:42,430
When my son was enlisting in the army, I also emphasized to him that he must be mindful of his dialect.

267
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,320
Fortunately, my son is half Gyeongsang and half Jeolla,

268
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,130
so he can use both dialects freely.

269
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,490
He's like those people in border towns!

270
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm originally from Jinju.

271
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,840
It's too hot!

272
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:06,100
Hey, do you have a girlfriend? I'm asking you if you have a girlfriend.

273
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,460
Hey, I heard the girls who protest sleep around a lot.

274
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,610
Come on. Tell me some stories.

275
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,680
Especially girls who work in factories. I heard...

276
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,640
they'd sleep with any college guys.

277
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,900
Have you hit on any factory girls?

278
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,910
No, I have not.

279
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,370
You look like you want to punch me.

280
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,970
If you don't have any stories to tell, then make some up or something.

281
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,600
How dare you glare at me?

282
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,280
Am I eating seaweed soup with clam or sand?

283
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,950
They should've removed the sand properly!

284
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,640
Darn it.

285
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,410
Halt!

286
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:14,500
1, 2!

287
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,460
Hey, hey! Take breaks.

288
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,680
This is exhausting.

289
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,530
Why did you do that earlier?

290
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:36,140
I was going to take it up with him anyway. He always speaks ill of Jeolla Province in front of this Gwangju native.

291
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,290
Elite colleges and Jeolla province are his trigger points, you know.

292
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,170
- But because of me...
- It's okay.

293
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,910
That jerk will be discharged in a month anyway.

294
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,070
It's so nice to talk comfortably like this.

295
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,150
My best friend is also from Gwangju.

296
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:01,350
Hey, look at this punk. Do you think Gwangju is just a small neighborhood and we all know each other?

297
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,560
- Quick.
- Okay.

298
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,700
What is this? Joint management?

299
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,050
Don't think too much of it. It's so the investors can put their worries to rest.

300
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:26,380
Mr. Hwang, I'm a businessman. I've overcome all sorts of hardships in this industry.

301
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,450
Bribing people in high places. Sure, I was prepared for it and will deal with it.

302
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,010
But this is different. You're asking me to hand over the business to this person.

303
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,120
This is practically robbery without a gun.

304
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,540
With a gun, I'd say.

305
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,910
[Resume, Hong Yong Gil]

306
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,650
I suggest you make a choice that will result in less damage. Like a true businessman.

307
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,080
Myeong Hee!

308
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,420
Is your stomach okay? Who did you drink with yesterday?

309
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,720
Just someone who makes me uncomfortable. Oh, your work schedule.

310
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,810
- You're really going to collect that?
- Yes.

311
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,420
- I'm off today and tomorrow .
- Really?

312
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,830
Then let's go on a date for two days.

313
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,250
Ah, n-not for two days and one night.

314
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,520
Continually for a two-day period.

315
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,410
A two-day and one night is fine, too.

316
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,130
Myeong Hee, answer the phone.

317
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,540
- One moment.
- Okay.

318
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Myeong Hee, is that you?

319
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,450
What time does your shift start today?

320
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:03,340
Oh, that's great. Then, can Myeong Soo sleepover at your place tonight?

321
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,320
Your dad was going to pick him up on his way home from the market,

Until what time can I pick Myeong Soo up?

324
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,090
All right.

325
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,210
Okay.

326
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,870
Let's go out now.

327
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,560
Not going out? Why?

328
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,980
This is so interesting.

329
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,420
How can your brother be Myeong Soo's classmate?

330
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,350
Did we drag you to an uncomfortable place?

331
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,090
Nah, not at all. He has nowhere to go to anyway.

332
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,150
He's supposed to be at a church retreat by this evening. Right?

333
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,820
- When he glares at you like that, he's your spitting image.
- That's not true.

334
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,170
How can you speak casually to her?

335
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,140
That's so interesting.

336
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,560
They even say the same thing at the same time.

338

Eat up. Chew it thoroughly when you do.

Yes.

340
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,890
This boy is obviously growing a lot faster and needs more food.

341

He's all grown up.

342
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,920
When I was 12, I was just like Myung Soo.

Kids who grow later end up taller.

344

It's all nonsense, so don't listen to him. Eat up now.

By the way, what kind of relationship do you two have?

348
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,510
That reminds me... Your brother recently got engaged, right?

Was that you?!

We're just...

Friends. Just friends. Eat up.

353
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,810
Do friends always go around together like that?

354

Hey, you do the same with Myung Soo!

355
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,750
You guys go around together when you aren't even engaged!

356
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,580
Well, anyway,

357
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,940
you said today was your last day of break before the competition. Right?

358
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,350
Do you two want to go anywhere?

359
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,130
There's someplace I want us to all go.

360
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,310
We can go. Where is it?

One of the days in our golden two-days and one-night trip comes to a close like this...

368
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,140
It's not like we were going to spend two days and one night together.

Did you know?

When you eat sweet candy,

373
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,620
there's that feeling of your inner molar poking at you.

374

That's why rather than the taste of the candy,

Why do you hate your brother so much?

Do you know how badly he treated me all these years?

378

You wouldn't understand, Myeong Hee.

He may be young, but the things he does—

385

Gosh. Even if he acts like a grown-up, he's still a kid.

Look at him. How is that a grown-up?

You keep doing things to make me hate you.

I'm the type of person to withstand everything when someone hates me.

You're right.

He looks just like you when he smiles.

Is that so?

463

00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,820
It's okay.

467
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,520
You can always fix a mistake. You're being deceived by Hwang Hee Tae—

468
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,590
It's not...

469
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,960
a mistake.

470
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,890
He's not deceiving me either.

471
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,490
Myeong Hee. Hwang Hee Tae, that guy, isn't a good person.

472
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,490
He's not someone you should involve yourself with.

473
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,720
It's a choice I made.

474
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,680
I've lived my entire life giving up and yielding.

475
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,010
Because I had no courage.

476
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,150
But Hwang Hee Tae,

477
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,600
is the first choice I made by gathering up the courage.

478
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,140
Even if you curse or throw rocks at me,

479
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,110
it's a choice I made.

480
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,470
So I'll pay the consequences.

481
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,280
That's what I'm saying.

482
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,670

00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:02,550
Since the problem is coming from your family, you should take care of it quietly.

645
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,490
Was your daughter completely unaware of this?

646
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,950
If she knew...

647
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:17,130
do you think she would have agreed to the engagement?

648
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:24,580
So, you're saying your daughter didn't know that Hee Tae has another girl,

649
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:31,300
or who that girl is?

650
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,910
I have no words to say.

651
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,980
This is all because I raised my child incorrectly.

652
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,230
However, how could we end the relationship

653
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,950
between our two families because of this incident?

654
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:08,010
If you give me one more chance, I will take responsibility and correct the situation.

655
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,590
Usually, I never get two days off in a row.

656
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:23,690
I guess everyone is like this, but I didn't have enough vacation days, to begin with.

657
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,860
Among my juniors is someone named In Young.

658
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:31,320
She's a newbie and clumsy with her work so everyone keeps making me work with her—

659
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,040
You're not interested, right?

660
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,040
What? No. I was listening. Keep going.

661
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,490
Tell me if you're bored. Since you're staying quiet, I keep on blabbering.

662
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,910
I'm not bored.

663
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,350
I'm really fine with it.

664
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,270
If you're okay, what are those sleepy eyes?

665
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,450
Earlier, we said that we should tell each other everything.

666
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,670
Hey, Sissy. How could you?

667
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,250
I'm nervous.

668
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,460
Because I'm so happy.

669
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:35,010
In my life, I've never had this much luck before.

670
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,300
It's like I'm flying really high in the air...

671
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:49,600
until I suddenly crash. It makes me anxious.

672
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,540
I know it's silly and absurd.

673
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:11,700
♫ Above the dark night sky  ♫

674
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,990
♫ One star shines brightly  ♫

675
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,410
♫ I don't know who is it shining for  ♫

676
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:33,180
♫ but seems like you're lonely all night  ♫

677
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,080
♫ And suddenly I missed you ♫

678
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:47,350
♫ because I couldn't see you ♫

679
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:55,620
♫ I keep writing your name  ♫

680
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:01,380
♫ On the pages of my diary  ♫

681
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,850
♫ On the night in which the star falls  ♫

682
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:15,520
♫ A ray of moonlight resembles you  ♫

683
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,160
♫ I'll hide and keep it in my pocket  ♫

684
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,710
♫ and deliver it to you  ♫

685
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,190
I can't walk you all the way home today either, can I?

686
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,720
See you again. Tomorrow.

687
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,730
♫ Because I can't comfort you  ♫

688
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:58,460
♫ when you on your shady face  ♫

689
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,120
♫ I'll light the way so you can  ♫

690
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:13,260
♫ find me from far away  ♫

691
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,310
♫ On the night in which the star falls  ♫

692
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:26,490
♫ A ray of moonlight resembles you  ♫

693
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,830
♫ I'll hide and keep it in my pocket  ♫

694
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,220
♫ and deliver it to you  ♫

695
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:48,310
♫ I close my eyes, but they're still seeping in...  ♫

696
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,680
[Youth of May]

697
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,420
I came to file a missing persons report.

698
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,710
Did you ever think that she's just trying to avoid you?

699
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,570
I'm sorry you came all the way here but couldn't meet Myeong Hee.

700
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:36,360
Does your family know that you're meeting Myeong Hee?

701
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,760
- Why are you asking that?
 - The Defense Security blocked her passport and visa applications.

702
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,500
I have something to tell you. I lied.

703
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,950
- Lee Soo Ryun, you little...
- Father.

704
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,840
The only thing she did wrong was crossing paths with me.

705
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,880
Don't get scared already. I haven't even started yet.

706
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,700
Just let her live her life.
