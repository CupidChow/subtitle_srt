1
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:52,182
I suffered so much after she died like that. 
    

2
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,372
You both know, right?

3
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:01,302
But she came back to life.

4
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,172
Mom,

5
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,932
how could you tell me to let go of her hand again?

6
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:14,172
She's on the edge of the cliff once again.

7
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:16,682
You're telling me to look the other way again?

8
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,192
Mom,

9
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:23,272
Father,

10
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:25,862
is that really what you want?

11
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:31,562
Do you want me to regret it and hurt again

12
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:34,970
for the rest of my life? Do you?

13
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:43,980


14
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,232
No, Oppa. No.

15
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,992
We don't want you to be sad.

16
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:52,182
We don't want you to hurt.

17
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:54,072
We're sorry.

18
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,932
To be honest, I was a little mad at her, too.

19
00:01:56,932 --> 00:02:02,552
I was so mad at her because I thought you were being ruined and hurting because of her.

20
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:06,872
But not anymore.

21
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:12,522
I didn't know you loved her so sincerely.

22
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:15,882
I'm sorry that I didn't understand how you felt.

23
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:24,742
We're already struggling a lot.

24
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:31,852
But if Mom, Father, and the rest of the family attack us and give us hard time,

25
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:36,092
- what are we supposed to do? 
 - But...

26
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,682
you're walking into the fire.

27
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:42,082
How could we just sit back as your parents?

28
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:47,752
Let me make this clear.

29
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:50,202
No matter what situation we face,

30
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:53,572
I'll stay by Do Ra's side.

31
00:02:55,402 --> 00:03:00,572
Haven't you seen the articles about Do Ra?

32
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:06,492
There are unspeakable rumors and they call her the biggest scammer for changing her face.

33
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:09,782
So, you're about to become the biggest scammer, too!

34
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:12,652
How am I supposed to just sit still?

35
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:17,022
Let me tell you this one more time.

36
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:21,392
What people are saying isn't true.

37
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:26,452
So, please trust Do Ra and me just once and wait a little longer.

38
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:32,102
I'll prove all the rumors and lies wrong.

39
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,462
Mom,

40
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:36,982
Father,

41
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,202
please understand us.

42
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:56,632
I think Pil Sung is the coolest.

43
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,692
Other pathetic men would've already run away to save themselves.

44
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:06,702
But Pil Sung is cooler than a male lead in a romance novel.

45
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:11,472
From now on, I'll cheer and support Pil Sung's love.

46
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:13,822
I feel the same way as Ma Ri.

47
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,292
The whole world is throwing stones at them.

48
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:21,322
Shouldn't we understand them since we're his family?

49
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:25,792
Why does Pil Sung have to get hit with those stones? Why?

50
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:29,342
He didn't do anything wrong!

51
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:46,795
That happened today?

52
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:48,845
Yes.

53
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:54,115
I don't think we could tear them apart anymore.

54
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:01,225
Before Park Do Ra died,

55
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:03,605
she said she was framed for prostitution.

56
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:08,965
He asked Pil Sung to believe her, but he apparently ignored her.

57
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:13,665
Maybe he believes she died because of that,

58
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,915
but I think he loves her even more now.

59
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:21,735
By the way,

60
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:26,415
there's something kind of strange.

61
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:29,265
What is it?

62
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:34,465
How did the reporters know and barge into the wedding venue?

63
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:36,855
It was when the bride just showed up, too.

64
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:40,245
It was as if someone planned it.

65
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:44,755
If Park Do Ra was really framed for prostitution,

66
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:48,615
maybe someone's secretly torturing them.

67
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,935
I started thinking that.

68
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:57,825
Honey, it's okay if we don't adopt Pil Sung.

69
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,465
But...

70
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:05,965
can you please help them get back up?

71
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,155
Pil Sung is Ma Ri's brother.

72
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:12,455
And you used to care for him.

73
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:18,935
You're the only one who could help them.

74
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:36,905
 How did the reporters know and barge into the wedding venue? 

75
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:39,415
 It was when the bride just showed up, too. 

76
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,815
 It was as if someone planned it. 

77
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:56,065
   

78
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,395
   

79
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,995
   

80
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:06,745
   

81
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,895
Oppa, what are you doing?

82
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:30,835
Do Ra, close the door. Go inside.

83
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,305
Go inside, I said!

84
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,285
What is it?

85
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:39,455
   

86
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:43,045
I told you to go inside. You're so stubborn.

87
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,285
I'll remove this quickly.

88
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:47,315
So, go inside.

89
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:50,985
No, Oppa.

90
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,295
Let's do it together.

91
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:08,525
Hey, you dirty bitch!

92
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,895
You scamming bitch!

93
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,495
How dare you show up again after having sex for money?

94
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:25,245
Don't you have any shame? Huh?

95
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:27,465
Is that why you changed your face?

96
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,565
You think that's the end of it?

97
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:34,255
Seriously. You prostitute!

98
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,815
You shameless bitch!

99
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,355
Go inside, Do Ra.

100
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,175
Don't ever come out!

101
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:43,115
How dare you go back inside?

102
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,695
What are you doing?

103
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,865
You did this, too, didn't you?

104
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:51,385
This is property damage and defamation.

105
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:53,815
I'll report you to the police.

106
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:59,885
He hit me! He hit me! Ouch!

107
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,575
C-Call the police.

108
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,885
Did I say anything wrong?

109
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,655
Park Do Ra did have sex for money.

110
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:15,115
She changed her face and lied.

111
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,055
I'll sue you for assault.

112
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:19,875
What an asshole.

113
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,805
Gosh, it's so noisy.

114
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,535
Why are you always doing this in front of my house?

115
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,635
Gosh, what's going on?

116
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:29,445
What did we do to deserve this?

117
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,995
Why don't you just move somewhere else?

118
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:34,625
Reporters, you should stop coming here, too!

119
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,555
I'm so sick and tired of it.

120
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:42,375
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,585
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,425
Let us have peace and quiet, please.

123
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:14,785
His grandma bragged so much about Pil Sung winning an award abroad

124
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:18,675
and becoming a CEO after the drama's success.

125
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:22,095
But he's on the run with the actress who had sex for money.

126
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:25,785
That means she's basically a prostitute.

127
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:28,665
How dreadful. Why is he doing that?

128
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:34,095
Why does he like someone like her? He fooled the whole world.

129
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:37,705
Pil Sung isn't like that. It's probably not true.

130
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,965
What do you mean it's not true?

131
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:43,395
She faked her death and changed her face.

132
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:47,555
She and Pil Sung plotted that from the beginning, apparently.

133
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:51,165
I heard he even got fired as the CEO.

134
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,745
Pil Sung is over now. He's over.

135
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,865
What did you just say?

136
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,785
What are you saying right now?

137
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,895
Don't blabber your mouths when you know nothing.

138
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,065
What did you say? Pil Sung plotted what?

139
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,695
Who said that? Who says? Did they see him? Huh?

140
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:10,125
How could you be like this?

141
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,175
We've been neighbors for over 30 years.

142
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:14,775
You've known Pil Sung since he was a child.

143
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,825
You think he's that type of a person?

144
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,255
It's not like you're just anyone.

145
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:25,175
Neighbors can't do this to each other.

146
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:29,765
And Park Do Ra was framed for prostitution!

147
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:33,795
It's not true! So, stop talking about her like that!

148
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:36,695
That's what they said on the news.

149
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,695
Would the news say so if it weren't true?

150
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:41,275
That's fake news!

151
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,345
Don't you know fake news is everywhere these days?

152
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:45,405
It's all fake! Fake!

153
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,475
We should go.

154
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,645
Gosh, seriously!

155
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:52,065
They say a mouth isn't for spreading lies.

156
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:57,455
How will you pay for your sins when you say such awful things?

157
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:01,175
Seriously. How could they do this?

158
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,325
It's okay.

159
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:06,665
The awful women are saying awful things.

160
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,765
Don't get upset about it.

161
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:12,115
It's okay. Let's go home.

162
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,135
How awful.

163
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,965
Mom.

164
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:28,845
Grandma.

165
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:38,265
Why are you here instead of being at home?

166
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:40,095
Go home now.

167
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,475
Grandma,

168
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,385
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,115
And...

170
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:52,865
thank you.

171
00:12:57,005 --> 00:13:00,055
You don't have to apologize to me.

172
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,925
But I feel sorry for your mom.

173
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:06,485
She raised you with so much care.

174
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,025
Look what happened.

175
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:11,205
You're the neighborhood's gossip subject.

176
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:27,405
I'll teach them a thing or two if those women blabber their mouths again.

177
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:56,345
 How dare you show up again after having sex for money? 

178
00:13:56,345 --> 00:14:00,335
 Don't you have any shame? Is that why you changed your face? 

179
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:04,655
 You don't have to apologize to me. 

180
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,595
 But I feel sorry for your mom. 

181
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:11,205
 She raised you with so much care. 

182
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,605
 Look what happened. 

183
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:15,725
 You're the neighborhood's gossip subject. 

184
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:34,205
Yes, Oppa. It's me.

185
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,475
Do Ra,

186
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:40,075
it can't go on like this anymore.

187
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:43,495
You did nothing wrong.

188
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:47,165
Why should you hear awful things like that?

189
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:49,195
When will this end?

190
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,155
Do Ra,

191
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:56,465
let's fight this face-to-face.

192
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,645
Face-to-face?

193
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:04,115
What do you mean, Oppa?

194
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:07,015
   

195
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:16,255
Subscribers, welcome to "Cha Bong Soo's Cha Cha Cha."

196
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:21,145
A few years ago, an actor died tragically.

197
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:27,575
But she wasn't dead, and she's been living among us.

198
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:33,865
Here we have Park Do Ra and Go Pil Sung, the talk of the town at the moment.

199
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:38,625
Let's hear their answers to many rumors.

200
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,495
 They say you didn't plan to die, 

201
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:49,505
 but you intended to change your face through plastic surgery. 

202
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,275
 What's your response to that? 

203
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:55,715
 Was it possible to pretend to be Kim Ji Yeong? 

204
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:58,825
 Where's the real Kim Ji Yeong, then? 

205
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:04,505
 We really thought she was Soon Jeong's granddaughter, Ji Yeong. 
   

206
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,145
 Soon Jeong believed so, too. 

207
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:12,095
 But we don't know what happened to the real Ji Yeong. 

208
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,385
Her granddaughter probably died,

209
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,703
but she was so sad

210
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:23,313
that she believed Park Do Ra was her late granddaughter, Ji Yeong.

211
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,825
That's what we think.

212
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:32,995
Here's the medical record from the doctor who operated on Park Do Ra's reconstructive surgery.

213
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:37,275
Not only her face but her whole body was wounded.

214
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:42,265
The reconstructive surgery was necessary because her entire body unrecognizable.

215
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:53,175
This is a diagnosis by a neurologist who diagnosed her with memory loss.

216
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:57,485
Park Do Ra didn't intend to deceive the public.

217
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:02,705
Due to the memory loss, she believed she was Kim Ji Yeong.

218
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:07,985
Here's the truth about Kim Ji Yeong's casting for "Seoul Lady."

219
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,795
Here's an interview with Writer Kim Oh Gyeong.

220
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:15,795
Hello, I'm Kim Oh Gyeong, the writer of "Seoul Lady." 
    

221
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:22,075
I suggested casting Kim Ji Yeong to play Bun Hong, the Seoul lady.

222
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:26,895
I was inspired by her when she played a small role in "Don't Lie to Me."

223
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:32,495
 So, I wrote "Seoul Lady" with Ji Yeong in mind. 

224
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:39,295
 The rumor says Go Pil Sung cast Kim Ji Yeong because of his personal feelings. 

225
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:42,475
 But it's a complete lie. 

226
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:48,625
 Director Go was very worried Kim Ji Yeong was inexperienced, but I kept insisting on casting her. 

227
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,525
 That's why she was cast. 

228
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:53,485
This is a fact.

229
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,025
 Everyone must've seen this already. 

230
00:17:56,025 --> 00:18:01,675
 Here's CCTV footage regarding the baseless prostitution allegation. 

231
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:06,105
 Some of you may have seen this man on TV. 

232
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:10,615
 Because this man is a reenactment actor. 

233
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,165
   

234
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:15,965
What's this? Look him up. Look him up.

235
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:22,575
 If you've seen this man, please let us know. 

236
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:27,235
It can be through the comment section, message, or email.

237
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:29,115
Mr. Hwang Jeong Shik,

238
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,225
you confessed to me then.

239
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:39,145
You said you got paid two million won and acted as if you hired her for sex.

240
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:43,895
You ruined someone's life.

241
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:47,375
Where on earth are you hiding right now?

242
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:53,185
If you feel bad for Park Do Ra at all, please contact us.

243
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:58,685
And Mr. Hwang, if what I said isn't true,

244
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:03,545
show up right now and sue me for defamation.

245
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:08,555
 Mr. Hwang, please reveal the truth. 

246
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:11,055
Please contact us.

247
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,100
   

248
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:26,752
Mr. Jeong, tell Hwang to leave Korea immediately.

249
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:28,802
Tell him to leave right now.

250
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,032
I suddenly can't reach him.

251
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,352
His phone number is no longer available.

252
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:37,032
W-What?

253
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,782
Thank you, Hyung.

254
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:44,412
It was difficult to ask you this because you might get criticized, too.

255
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,212
But you were so willing to do it.

256
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:50,352
Aigoo, how could you say that to me between us?

257
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,892
Who would I believe if I didn't believe you?

258
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:57,712
And we had to reveal the truth about this.

259
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:01,982
And Ji Yeong...

260
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:05,872
I can't believe you were Do Ra.

261
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:10,262
Do Ra, I cried so much when you died.

262
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:15,192
I thought I should've been nicer instead of getting into fights on set.

263
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,782
Do Ra, my Do Ra,

264
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:21,382
thank you so much for coming back, Do Ra.

265
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,172
Thank you, Oppa.

266
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:25,442
Thank you so much, Oppa.

267
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,332
Do Ra.

268
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,972
Hyung, people will criticize you a lot because of this.

269
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:33,342
people will criticize you a lot because of this.

270
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,842
I'm so sorry.

271
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:38,972
Seriously, stop saying you're sorry.

272
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:45,262
I want to get a lot of views and have a popular video for once.

273
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,832
Yes, Cheol Su.

274
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,682
What did you say?

275
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:08,921
Do Ra, you should stay here.

276
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:12,831
Why? I should come with you, too. Let me come with you.

277
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,881
It's too crowded here. I'll see him briefly and come back.

278
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:19,101
I'll find out where Hwang Jeong Shik is.

279
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:22,651
So, don't come outside and wait in here.

280
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,301
Okay.

281
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:43,161
   

282
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,761
Hello.

283
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,351
Are you Ms. Kim Hong Sun?

284
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,981
I am.

285
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:25,981
Who are you?

286
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,621
I'm Go Pil Sung.

287
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:34,061
You're Mr. Hwang Jeong Shik's mother, correct?

288
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:38,141
How do you know my son?

289
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:43,221
I'm looking for him regarding a very important matter.

290
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:47,371
Where's your son right now?

291
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:49,040
Why do you ask?

292
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,860
Will you take Jeong Shik away?

293
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:57,121
I haven't talked to him in a while.

294
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,661
I don't even know where he is.

295
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:03,611
Ma'am,

296
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:07,851
do you know an actor named Park Do Ra?

297
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:10,240
She died a few years ago.

298
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,531
I do.

299
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:18,091
Why do you suddenly ask about a dead actor?

300
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:23,031
She died because of Mr. Hwang.

301
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:27,880
You're a terrible person!

302
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:33,920
What does my son have to do with Park Do Ra?

303
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,951
My son would never hurt other people.

304
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:43,311
Please leave if you'll keep talking nonsense.

305
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:47,781
Someone paid your son two million won

306
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:51,731
and told him to meet Park Do Ra at a hotel.

307
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:55,341
I'm not trying to blame Mr. Hwang.

308
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:57,471
I'm looking for the person who hired him.

309
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:02,111
But I need your son's help in order to do that.

310
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:07,191
Please let me meet your son just once.

311
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:10,111
Tell me where in the Philippines he is. Or...

312
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:12,761
let me make one phone call to him.

313
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:16,460
Because of that incident,

314
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:20,510
a woman was marked with a stigma that can't be removed

315
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:23,271
and she jumped into the ocean.

316
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:29,271
Please don't let her life be disgraced further.

317
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,501
I beg you.

318
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,671
I don't know where he is.

319
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:42,310
I don't even know his phone number.

320
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,120
I know nothing.

321
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:50,081
So, don't ever come back here.

322
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:06,981
Ma'am, here's my business card.

323
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:11,891
If you change your mind

324
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:17,311
or Mr. Hwang calls you, please contact me.

325
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:28,001
Mr. Hwang's crime isn't so heavy.

326
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:32,671
He could reach a settlement with Park Do Ra, too.

327
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:37,591
He can't be on the run overseas forever because of this.

328
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:43,781
It must've been difficult for you to be apart from your son, too.

329
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:51,161
And he won't be able to keep running away

330
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,681
because his face is publicized now.

331
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:03,251
Please call him and tell him to call me.

332
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:06,931
I'll help him as much as I can.

333
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:27,141
Jeong Shik, where are you?

334
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:32,231
Someone named Go Pil Sung just came looking for you.

335
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:39,201
You didn't have to care for an old lady like me.

336
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:42,121
Of course, I should care for you.

337
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:45,561
I'll be taking care of you from now on.

338
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,451
Just come here often with me.

339
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:51,421
How do you like it so far, Aunt?

340
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,781
It sure is nice.

341
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:57,971
Right? You need to care for your skin often like this.

342
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:03,151
People would believe you're my friend, Aunt.

343
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:06,271
Gosh, come on.

344
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:10,651
I have no one but you, Aunt.

345
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:16,421
Ji Dan and I have no one but you to trust in this world.

346
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:21,371
Chairman Gong is always trying to get rid of Jin Dan.

347
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:24,421
He's dying to adopt someone outside the family as his son.

348
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:27,071
Don't worry about that.

349
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:31,881
He must've reconsidered because of Park Do Ra.

350
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:36,671
If he adopts Go Pil Sung, Park Do Ra would be our daughter-in-law.

351
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,771
Our family can't have someone like her as a daughter-in-law.

352
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:41,021
Right?

353
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:46,811
Actually, adopting Go Pil Sung made no sense from the beginning.

354
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:51,561
Chairman Gong needs to know the importance of you and Jin Dan.

355
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:56,661
To be honest, I'm grateful to you.

356
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:58,941
Pardon? Me?

357
00:27:58,941 --> 00:28:03,901
You've only been thinking of my brother, Gong Dae Gil,

358
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:08,481
and lived as a widow by only caring for Jin Dan.

359
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:14,181
I'm so grateful that at least we have Jin Dan in our family.

360
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:21,621
I'll protect him out of gratitude for you. Don't worry.

361
00:28:21,621 --> 00:28:23,991
Thank you, Aunt.

362
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:27,011
I'll only count on you, too.

363
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:29,931
Aunt, let's get dinner since we're out.

364
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:33,261
- I made a reservation at a good place. 
 - Okay.

365
00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:02,311
Gosh! My gosh...

366
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:05,511
Be quiet.

367
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:09,641
You're Hwang Jeong Shik's mom, right?

368
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:14,001
W-Who are you?

369
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:17,601
Where's Hwang Jeong Shik? Where's he?

370
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,051
I don't know.

371
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:24,941
I haven't seen Jeong Shik for a long time.

372
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:27,631
What?

373
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:31,151
He took money from me to see you.

374
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:33,321
Call him right now. Right now!

375
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,451
I don't know.

376
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:40,771
I don't even know his phone number.

377
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,231
Stop lying.

378
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:47,251
I really don't know.

379
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,631
Then...

380
00:29:56,021 --> 00:30:00,071
if he comes by, make sure to tell him.

381
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:03,031
Tell him to hurry back to the Philippines.

382
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:06,421
If he gets caught frequenting Korea again,

383
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:10,081
I'll surely kill him then.

384
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:11,821
Got that?

385
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:14,061
Okay.

386
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,531
Gosh, my goodness. My goodness...

387
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,751
- Well done. 
 - Noona, well done.

388
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,661
Do Jun...

389
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,601
You did great.

390
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,761
Thank you, Hyung.

391
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:45,131
By the way, how did you know to do that?

392
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:51,161
Pil Sung came up with the idea.

393
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:53,351
I think it was a good idea.

394
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:58,191
There were mean comments, too, but many said they felt bad for Noona.

395
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,841
Do Jun and I read all the comments.

396
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,681
There are tons of them. It got so many views, too.

397
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:10,171
I wish one of them saw Hwang Jeong Shik and tell us.

398
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:13,291
I'm sure someone will.

399
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:18,591
So, stay at home until someone says they saw him, Do Ra.

400
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,710
I'll be out and about instead.

401
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:23,281
Okay, Oppa.

402
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:28,331
By the way, have you guys been eating at all?

403
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,721
What?

404
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,141
Did we eat?

405
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:40,731
It must've been so hectic. How could you not remember if you ate or not?

406
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:43,921
Eat with us. I make a killer soybean stew.

407
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:46,221
Have a seat. Come.

408
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,811
Hello?

409
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:59,040
 This is Hwang Jeong Shik's mom. 

410
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,301
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:13,301
- Thank you. 
 - My son will be here soon.

412
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:16,091
Try talking to him in person.

413
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,491
Okay.

414
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,591
- Mom! 
 - Jeong Shik!

415
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,911
Try talking to these people for a moment.

416
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:35,841
Hwang Jeong Shik!

417
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,081
Let go! Let go, I said!

418
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:44,201
Hold on! We need to talk!

419
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,991
You saw the article on Park Do Ra, right?

420
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:51,121
She died and came back to life.

421
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:55,461
She barely managed to come back to life,

422
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:58,851
but she can't even go outside because of the prostitution allegation.

423
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,891
The entire world is pointing fingers at her.

424
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:06,921
Mr. Hwang, please tell the truth.

425
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,941
You got paid two million to do that.

426
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:16,031
Please tell the truth and say you didn't hire her for sex! Please!

427
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:19,721
I know nothing.

428
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:21,901
I don't know!

429
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,031
Ahjussi...

430
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:46,471
Ahjussi, I'm Park Do Ra.

431
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,831
I don't know you.

432
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,691
Why are you doing this to me?

433
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:53,591
Ahjussi,

434
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:58,521
I tried to die after that happened.

435
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:03,361
But miraculously, I came back to life.

436
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:09,981
But people criticize me for having sex for money and scamming the whole country.

437
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:14,731
Ahjussi, should I die again?

438
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:21,471
Should I be criticized for what I didn't do my whole life?

439
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:25,141
Ahjussi...

440
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:30,081
Ahjussi, please don't let me die...

441
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:33,651
Please let me live, Ahjussi.

442
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:39,131
Ahjussi, please! Please clear my name for this.

443
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:41,601
Please let me live, Ahjussi.

444
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:45,481
Please clear my name for that, Ahjussi...

445
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:47,891
If you tell us who hired you,

446
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:53,201
we'll make sure you get the lightest sentence possible.

447
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:56,981
- I promise you. 
 - Ahjussi! Ahjussi...

448
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:59,281
Jeong Shik,

449
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:03,141
please do what they tell you to do.

450
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:06,561
You can't live a terrible life like this...

451
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,231
Ahjussi.

452
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:12,601
You can't drive someone to kill themselves.

453
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:18,831
How will you pay for this sin?

454
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:20,661
Ahjussi, please.

455
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,891
- Jeong Shik. 
 - Ahjussi, please...

456
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:25,941
Please spare me, Ahjussi.

457
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:36,221
They say you got paid two million won to frame Park Do Ra for prostitution.

458
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,101
Is that true?

459
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,580
Yes.

460
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:46,001
That's true.

461
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:52,241
I was told I'd get paid two million if I spent two hours at the hotel with Park Do Ra.

462
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:57,841
I couldn't say no because I was struggling financially.

463
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:05,351
Park Do Ra seemed to think it was for a cosmetics ad meeting.

464
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:08,160
Framing Park Do Ra

465
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,360
for something so filthy,

466
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,740
I am deeply sorry.

467
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:19,121
I also suffered while wandering around in the Philippines.

468
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:22,411
But...

469
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:27,471
I heard Park Do Ra survived and came back.

470
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:30,601
That's why I mustered the courage to come forward.

471
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:35,091
Who hired you to do that, then?

472
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:38,031
I already told the detectives about it.

473
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:41,711
You'll hear about it once the investigation is over.

474
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:44,201
Once again, I'd like to...

475
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:48,561
apologize to Ms. Park Do Ra.

476
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,261
I'm so sorry, Ms. Park Do Ra.

477
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:01,575
   

478
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:04,815
   

479
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:07,305
   

480
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:08,825
   

481
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:12,125
What? The online sleuths are on the case?

482
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:15,035
Don't they have anything better to do?

483
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:19,310
Fine, try to find me.

484
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,490
You won't be able to.

485
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:30,047
But what if they do find out?

486
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:32,741
No.

487
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:34,541
No!

488
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:38,701
That'd really be the end of me.

489
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:48,171
Mr. Jeong, it's me.

490
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,311
Take this money and go somewhere far away.

491
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:19,551
Somewhere very far away.

492
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:24,831
And not that it'd happen, but...

493
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:27,721
if you get caught...

494
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:29,231
You know, right?

495
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:30,521
Of course.

496
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:34,231
I'll protect you until the end.

497
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,231
Don't worry.

498
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:39,241
Okay.

499
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:42,241
Make sure not to get caught, okay?

500
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:55,261
   

501
00:38:55,261 --> 00:38:57,381
My gosh. My gosh.

502
00:38:57,381 --> 00:39:00,191
Park Do Ra was really framed.

503
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:03,041
Who framed her for such a thing?

504
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,801
How could this be?

505
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,011
I wonder who caused one woman to hit rock bottom.

506
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:12,461
I'm so curious to see his face.

507
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:18,791
What kind of bastard would do this? He deserves to die.

508
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:23,161
She must've had a hard time being framed like that.

509
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:27,261
She must've suffered so much that she attempted suicide.

510
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:31,241
I know. She must've felt so humiliated and frustrated.

511
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:34,580
She was criticized by everyone.

512
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:38,141
Even I'm starting to feel bad.

513
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:41,101
Anyway, who's the bastard who did this?

514
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:44,571
He deserves to get struck by lightning and croak.

515
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:47,131
The police are investigating.

516
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,521
I'm sure he'd get caught soon.

517
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:55,370
By the way, I feel so bad for Do Ra.

518
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,980
Poor thing.

519
00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:00,551
Yes, I feel sorry for her, too.

520
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:03,651
I can't wait for this person to get caught and punished.

521
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:10,181
But I still don't want her to get involved with Pil Sung.

522
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:14,511
And she's Baek Mi Ja's daughter.

523
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:16,891
Honey, that's enough now.

524
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:19,511
Just accept it after all Pil Sung has done.

525
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:22,861
You'd give him such a hard time by doing this.

526
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:25,481
It's because I find it unacceptable.

527
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:29,371
I find it unacceptable. What am I supposed to do?

528
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,421
Yes, CEO Gu.

529
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:43,411
What?

530
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:48,721
Who exposed Park Do Ra on Go Pil Sung's wedding day?

531
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,521
Okay.

532
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:00,241
How...

533
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:14,111
You wanted to see me?

534
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:16,571
What's this about?

535
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:21,090
On the wedding day of Pil Sung and Park Do Ra,

536
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,521
are you the one who told the reporters?

537
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:27,771
Why would you ask me that?

538
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:30,181
Is it true or not?

539
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,601
Just answer that.

540
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:37,351
Hyung, have you been doing a background check on me?

541
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:40,001
Why do you want to know that?

542
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:44,231
It was you, wasn't it?

543
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:46,121
You bastard.

544
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:49,521
How could you do something so dirty and low?

545
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:51,821
"Dirty and low"?

546
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,491
Hyung, are you blaming me right now?

547
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,021
That's not right.

548
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:59,441
They're the ones to blame.

549
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:02,221
The entire world is criticizing them right now.

550
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:03,951
But you're criticizing me?

551
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:06,411
What? What did you say?

552
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:11,371
Even so, how could you do that on their wedding day?

553
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:15,071
They're going through hell right now because of that.

554
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:18,950
I know you were crazy about her, but how could you do this?

555
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,871
I told you.

556
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,661
I don't want her to marry Go Pil Sung.

557
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:26,461
- That's why I did that. 
 - What?

558
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,291
What the...

559
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:34,301
Hyung, are you still hung up on Go Pil Sung?

560
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:38,960
You can't adopt him now that he ruined himself, so you're taking it out on me?

561
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:44,261
Hyung, when you die and meet Father in heaven,

562
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,981
I'm sure he'd slap you in the face.

563
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:49,151
Because you're acting so ridiculous right now!

564
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:56,821
Hyung, I'm your half-brother but still a brother.

565
00:42:56,821 --> 00:43:00,681
We share blood, and I'm a Gong, just like you!

566
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:03,741
But how could you always defend him?

567
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,481
What a loser.

568
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:17,871
A petty bastard.

569
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:27,991
Where's Grandmother? Here's her favorite red bean buns.

570
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:36,661
Because I can't go out, she went for a walk with Do Shik and to look around the market.

571
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:39,851
We should go out, too, then.

572
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,281
What?

573
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:49,801
Oppa, I don't think I can yet.

574
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:57,771
Do Ra, let's practice being out in the world instead of hiding.

575
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:00,371
You cleared your name now.

576
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,621
And you have a handsome knight by you, too.

577
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:06,071
A knight?

578
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:15,101
Oppa,

579
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:21,991
do you think Mr. Jeong, who hired Mr. Hwang, is the real culprit?

580
00:44:23,191 --> 00:44:27,081
Who is he, and why did he do that to me?

581
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:30,811
The police are after him.

582
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:33,771
We'll find out once they catch him.

583
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:37,231
Get ready now.

584
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:40,711
To be honest, someone invited you today.

585
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,461
Me? Who?

586
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:47,281
You'll find out once you get there. Just follow me.

587
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:49,111
   

588
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:01,841
Do Ra, it's okay.

589
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:08,861
No, I'll take care of this table.

590
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:10,341
Thanks.

591
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:12,811
Father, I'll do it if you're busy.

592
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,551
No, no. I want to grill for you.

593
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:18,241
Wait just a moment. I'll make it tasty.

594
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:30,881
This is the new dish we came up with. Try some.

595
00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:38,361
Thank you.

596
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:52,301
It's so well-marinated and tasty, Father.

597
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:54,761
F-Father?

598
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:59,321
It's nice being called that.

599
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,661
Here. Have some more. Here.

600
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:04,441
Let me cut you more. Help yourself.

601
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:06,421
Have more.

602
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:08,361
Father,

603
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:09,781
how about me?

604
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:13,771
What? You're good at grilling. Grill it yourself.

605
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,101
Have some.

606
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:19,421
Wow, did you already choose her over me?

607
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:21,991
I'm your second fiddle now, huh?

608
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:26,841
Come on. Here you go. Have a small piece.

609
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:29,951
Thank you.

610
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:34,611
- Eat. 
 - You should have some, too.

611
00:46:34,611 --> 00:46:36,451
No, I'm okay.

612
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:41,801
I feel sorry for Park Do Ra.

613
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:45,241
And Pil Sung loves her so much. Why bother opposing them?

614
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:47,011
It'd be a waste of our energy.

615
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:52,761
Anyway, we raised him hard for no good reason.

616
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:05,381
Mom, have you had dinner?

617
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,201
Don't worry if I had...

618
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:14,051
dinner or not, and just chase Do Ra around.

619
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:20,091
You don't care if I eat or starve, anyway.

620
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:23,641
Don't be like that, Mom.

621
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:28,621
Mom, I have a confession to make.

622
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:32,151
What is it?

623
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:37,441
To be honest, I like you more than Do Ra.

624
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,251
Hey, go away! Geez.

625
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:45,261
Aigoo, don't lie so shamelessly.

626
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:48,841
I'm not lying. I mean it. I really do.

627
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,301
Mom, thank you.

628
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:56,711
Thank you so much.

629
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:58,761
What are you thanking me for?

630
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:03,041
I'm just grateful.

631
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:09,621
Just know that I love you, and I'm grateful for you.

632
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,501
Whatever.

633
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:16,061
Mom, should I make you kimchi fried rice?

634
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:18,121
I know you like my kimchi fried rice.

635
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:20,891
I'll use my skills just for you today.

636
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:24,191
Forget it. I don't want it.

637
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:26,881
Mom.

638
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:30,651
Gosh, what are you doing? Go away.

639
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:34,971
Go away, I said. I need to fold these.

640
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,761
Give me.

641
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:01,581
All in.

642
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:04,061
All in.

643
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:05,851
I'm out.

644
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:08,841
- I'm out. 
 - It's always like this. This sucks.

645
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:14,041
The soybean stew is so tasty today, Aunt.

646
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:18,041
It is. People eat simple breakfasts these days,

647
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:22,541
but I like having rice and soybean stew like this since I'm old.

648
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:27,551
I do, too. I crave rice and kimchi if I eat bread for days.

649
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:33,921
By the way, Chairman Gong, when will you hire the new CEO for Go Go Entertainment?

650
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:37,681
Chief Yun is the interim CEO for now. You don't have to worry.

651
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:42,771
I'll hire a management specialist at some point.

652
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,721
Okay, do that.

653
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:46,981
There isn't a good option right now.

654
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:51,811
Go Go Entertainment could've been in trouble because of Go Pil Sung and Park Do Ra.

655
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:56,761
I know she was framed for prostitution, but how could he fall for someone like her?

656
00:49:56,761 --> 00:50:01,371
Anyway, I'm glad Go Pil Sung stepped down as the CEO.

657
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:06,201
Dad, I've never met anyone as cool as Pil Sung.

658
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:08,391
Even the romance novel characters aren't as cool.

659
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:10,551
The whole world was criticizing her.

660
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:14,171
A pathetic man would've run away already to save himself.

661
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:19,561
But instead of doing that, he stayed until the end and proved what true love is.

662
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:21,571
Doesn't it make him a truly trustworthy man?

663
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:24,781
I was so moved by him because of that.

664
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:33,811
But who do you think is the terrible person who framed her?

665
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,231
Someone like that needs to die already.

666
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:41,101
Ma Ri, don't say that over a meal.

667
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:46,271
Why not? Why can't I say a bastard like him needs to die?

668
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:52,841
These are salt buns, croissants, and a cream roll cake.

669
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:56,711
I waited in line to get them at a famous bakery for you, ma'am.

670
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:59,961
Gosh, thank you so much.

671
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:04,761
I've always liked pastry since I was a kid.

672
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:08,691
I apparently sprung out of bed to eat pastry.

673
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,091
Gosh, really?

674
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:13,121
So, what brings you here?

675
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:15,901
Gosh, seriously.

676
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:20,711
I came by to give Sang Gu something and wanted to say hello to your mother.

677
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:22,861
Am I not allowed to come here?

678
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:26,181
By the way, Ms. Hong,

679
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:32,291
are you and our tenant, Jin Sang Gu, really cousins?

680
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:35,311
Gosh, ma'am. What are you thinking?

681
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:39,261
Sang Gu and I really are maternal cousins.

682
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:40,781
I see...

683
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:42,981
Really?

684
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:46,741
It's because you two seemed so close.

685
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:48,491
Mother.

686
00:51:48,491 --> 00:51:53,801
By the way, I heard your daughter-in-law was framed, Seon Yeong.

687
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:57,301
My goodness. I'm so glad that was proven.

688
00:51:57,301 --> 00:52:01,691
Hey, who says she's my daughter-in-law? We didn't even finish the wedding.

689
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:04,541
But still, the bride and groom walked down the aisle.

690
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,261
Doesn't it mean they're married?

691
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:09,411
I thought they were living with you.

692
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,181
She didn't walk down the aisle.

693
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:14,231
It ended even before it started.

694
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:18,161
She's not our daughter-in-law yet. Don't even say that.

695
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:20,681
You should let them re-do their wedding, then.

696
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:23,101
They love each other so much.

697
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:25,101
It's unusually beautiful love.

698
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,821
Gosh, are you kidding me right now?

699
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:31,631
Excuse me, Ms. Hong. Why are you bringing that up right now?

700
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:36,621
You know how stressed we all were because of Park Do Ra.

701
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:40,791
Is it because she ended up with Pil Sung instead of your son

702
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,641
and he's going through hell right now?

703
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:46,531
Is that why you're here to rub it in first thing in the morning?

704
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,631
It's not like that.

705
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:51,361
Cut the nonsense and leave.

706
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:54,061
We don't want any of these. Take it back with you!

707
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:58,501
Seon Yeong, I was so touched by your son and daughter-in-law's beautiful love.

708
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,281
I just thought they were beautiful together.

709
00:53:00,281 --> 00:53:03,361
- Anyway, I'll get going now. 
 - Take that with you.

710
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:04,431
Don't get the wrong idea.

711
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,091
You should still eat this. Take care.

712
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:10,881
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong...

713
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:15,351
We need to kick them out! Kick them out immediately!

714
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:18,281
Both of them are out of their minds.

715
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:20,811
What's with her?

716
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:23,321
Sang Gu!

717
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:28,451
I don't think Pil Sung's grandma believes we're cousins.

718
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:31,041
So, you should move out of this house.

719
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:35,641
I'm so nervous she might tell Jin Dan.

720
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:36,681
Okay.

721
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:40,881
That old woman gets involved in every little thing.

722
00:53:40,881 --> 00:53:44,221
I was going to move out because I was sick of it, too.

723
00:53:45,351 --> 00:53:51,561
Ae Gyo, should we go on a drive and get spicy stir-fried chicken?

724
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,811
Shall we? I love it!

725
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:59,321
Jin Sang Gu, talk to me. Talk to me—

726
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:00,891
Gosh.

727
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:05,731
Gosh, what's going on?

728
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,861
You're cousins. Why are you hugging?

729
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:09,601
So gross. So gross.

730
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:12,181
No, we aren't cousins.

731
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:13,511
What?

732
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:16,331
You said you were cousins.

733
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:19,541
W-We aren't. Let me correct myself.

734
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,951
To be honest, we aren't cousins.

735
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:24,431
We're a couple.

736
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,821
What?

737
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:28,661
Y-You're a couple?

738
00:54:28,661 --> 00:54:30,000
Excuse me.

739
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,320
Was the first love you mentioned CEO Gong's mother?

740
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,691
 Actually, I didn't know, either. 

741
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:52,811
 My first love, whom I used to date, has been raising my son. 

742
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:55,351
 I found that out just recently. 

743
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:04,451
If so, by chance...

744
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:06,611
is CEO Gong Jin Dan...

745
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,621
C-Could he be J-Jin Sang Gu's son?

746
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:18,191
No, no, no. He said he doesn't have a son.

747
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:22,171
Gosh, what am I thinking right now?

748
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,701
Is that Park Do Ra?

749
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:44,291
My gosh. Is she already out in public because she cleared her name?

750
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,811
Does she not have any shame?

751
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:47,001
I know.

752
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:50,861
I can tell she'd be back on TV soon.

753
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,741
We'd still be thinking about the rumor, anyway.

754
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:55,491
I know.

755
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:59,571
Excuse me, Ms. Park Do Ra... I mean, Kim Ji Yeong...

756
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,411
Should I call her Park Do Ra or Kim Ji Yeong?

757
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:05,331
Anyway, you should quit acting.

758
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:09,051
You changed your face and deceived the entire country.

759
00:56:09,051 --> 00:56:11,241
You can't act anymore.

760
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:15,371
Seeing a prostitute on TV would be a bad influence on children.

761
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:23,051
The fact that she was framed has been proven.

762
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:30,291
She was framed.

763
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:32,221
She's still hurting from it.

764
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:36,291
So, please don't say stuff like that.

765
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,221
I beg you.

766
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,671
Do Ra!

767
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:50,781
Do Ra.

768
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,491
Oppa,

769
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:00,941
I thought people would forgive me if I cleared my name.

770
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:03,161
Because I'm really innocent.

771
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:06,521
I believed people would acknowledge the truth.

772
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:09,401
But they don't.

773
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:15,861
I'm still an actor who had sex for money and a scammer.

774
00:57:15,861 --> 00:57:19,111
It's like the scarlet letter that won't go away.

775
00:57:20,631 --> 00:57:22,451
Do Ra.

776
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:26,861
I... I wasn't even at a department store.

777
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:31,051
I wasn't at a theme park. I was just at a corner store.

778
00:57:31,051 --> 00:57:33,821
Am I not even supposed to buy ramen?

779
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:37,151
Am I supposed to only stay at home?

780
00:57:39,691 --> 00:57:42,801
No, no.

781
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:46,871
Even innocent actors have haters.

782
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:50,561
They get hated for no reason.

783
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:54,181
You just need some time.

784
00:57:54,181 --> 00:57:59,381
I believe that time heals.

785
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:03,401
It's okay, Do Ra. It's okay.

786
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:08,021
Do you really think so, Oppa?

787
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:12,771
Don't cry. It's okay.

788
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:21,411
What?

789
00:58:21,411 --> 00:58:24,081
What did you say, Sang Gu?

790
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:25,891
You need money again?

791
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:31,321
Ae Gyo, I wasn't going to ask you again, but it's an emergency.

792
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,971
What's wrong with you, Sang Gu?

793
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,531
Why do you keep asking your woman for money?

794
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:38,831
I'm about to lose my feelings for you.

795
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:40,141
I'm sorry, Ae Gyo.

796
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,381
Could you help me just this once somehow?

797
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:49,071
Gosh, are you with me for money, by chance?

798
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:52,641
Are you really a gold digger, as Jin Dan said?

799
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:55,471
Gold digger? It's not like that.

800
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:58,961
To be honest, this happened while trying to care for him.

801
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:02,001
How could you say something so hurtful?

802
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:03,661
Jin Dan?

803
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:07,321
Why are you bringing him up suddenly?

804
00:59:08,091 --> 00:59:09,721
I...

805
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,051
I caused trouble.

806
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,851
Trouble? Like what?

807
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:20,371
You know the accident Chairman Gong's daughter was in?

808
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:24,011
That was me.

809
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:29,081
W-What did you say? You caused Ma Ri's accident?

810
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:32,251
- Yes. 
 - Honey, are you crazy?

811
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:34,911
Why would you do such a thing?

812
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:36,511
How could you do such a thing?

813
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:41,061
You said she was getting in the way of Jin Dan's future.

814
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,211
That's why I tried to get rid of her.

815
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:47,791
But Go Pil Sung suddenly jumped in.

816
00:59:48,811 --> 00:59:50,881
I don't know if it's a good thing, but I failed.

817
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:52,911
Stop, stop.

818
00:59:53,971 --> 00:59:57,151
But still. How could you hurt Ma Ri...

819
00:59:57,151 --> 00:59:59,141
You're crazy! You're crazy!

820
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:03,581
Hearing that the family gave you and Jin Dan a hard time

821
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,491
made me lose my mind.

822
01:00:05,491 --> 01:00:11,411
Ae Gyo, I just wanted to do that for Jin Dan.

823
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:15,881
I never did anything for him because I'm a pathetic father.

824
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:19,801
I don't think I'd be better off in the future, either.

825
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:21,971
That's why I did that.

826
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:26,461
But why do you need money? What's it for?

827
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:30,941
Since I couldn't cause the accident myself,

828
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:34,391
I made someone else do it for me.

829
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:37,951
I gave him all the money you gave me last time.

830
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:43,161
But he needs to leave the country because he's about to get caught.

831
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:44,921
Gosh.

832
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:46,911
If he gets caught, I'll get caught.

833
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:50,611
I thought that might hurt you and Jin Dan, too.

834
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:54,731
That's why I'm thinking of sending him somewhere far away,

835
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:59,801
but it'd require a lot of money.

836
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:03,381
A lot? How much?

837
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:09,291
Mom, did you say 500 million just now?

838
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:13,141
I kind of need it urgently, Jin Dan.

839
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:14,351
So give me just 500 million.

840
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:16,911
No, no. Lend it to me. Lend it to me.

841
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:18,761
You can give me a loan, right?

842
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:21,390
Of course. I can just give it to you, too.

843
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,711
Gosh, really?

844
01:01:22,711 --> 01:01:26,271
Why do you suddenly need that much money?

845
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:29,201
- What's it for? 
 - Don't ask me about it.

846
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:31,841
It's because I caused some trouble.

847
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:34,371
Trouble? What trouble?

848
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:37,071
Gong Jin Dan, I'll pay you back.

849
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:41,261
I'll pay you the interest on top of the principal.

850
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:53,951
   

851
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:06,751
Here's the 500 million.

852
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:10,701
Send him abroad or wherever immediately, okay?

853
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:12,301
Okay, don't worry.

854
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:16,781
He said he'd leave tomorrow if he gets paid.

855
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,231
Mom, are you serious?

856
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:22,501
I knew it was like this.

857
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:26,051
I knew this asshole was taking this money from you.

858
01:02:26,051 --> 01:02:27,421
Jin Dan.

859
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:30,531
You asshole, how are you not a gold digger?

860
01:02:30,531 --> 01:02:32,651
You're still not a con artist?

861
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:36,691
Jin Dan, don't do that! What's wrong with you?

862
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,321
Come here, you gold-digging bastard.

863
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,751
I won't forgive you this time, you bastard.

864
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:46,701
I'll put you in jail for extortion and blackmailing.

865
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:48,331
I'll kill you, you bastard!

866
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,841
No, Ji Dan! He's...

867
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:53,231
He's your dad. He's your dad.

868
01:02:55,631 --> 01:03:00,041
Mom, what are you saying right now?

869
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,141
Who's my dad right now?

870
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:05,191
How could someone like this be my dad?

871
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:06,691
Are you out of your mind?

872
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:10,131
Jin Dan, he really is your dad.

873
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:12,631
The one who gave you life. Your biological father.

874
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:14,341
So please stop hitting him.

875
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,931
Why do you keep hitting your dad?

876
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,301
Don't do that, Jin Dan.

877
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:25,111
Mom, why would you say something so crazy?

878
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,101
It's not true, right?

879
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:31,541
It can't be true, right?

880
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:35,071
What the hell are you saying right now?

881
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:37,191
Yes, President Gu.

882
01:03:39,621 --> 01:03:44,481
What? You found the man who attempted to hurt Ma Ri?

883
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:47,841
Yes.

884
01:03:49,431 --> 01:03:51,041
Okay.

885
01:03:55,610 --> 01:04:05,610


886
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:15,161
What's the reason?

887
01:04:15,161 --> 01:04:17,791
Why did you try to kill my daughter?

888
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:23,081
You rammed into her on purpose.

889
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:24,351
You tried to kill her!

890
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:27,431
I'm sorry! Forgive me.

891
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:31,181
I did that because someone told me to.

892
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:33,961
He said he'd pay me if I killed your daughter.

893
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,951
What?

894
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:38,611
Someone hired you to do that?

895
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:43,471
I wanted to study, but I had no money.

896
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:46,521
That's why I did that for money.

897
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:49,060
I did what he told me to do.

898
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:51,141
"He"?

899
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,691
Who's he?

900
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:56,151
Who told you to do it?

901
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:58,401
Jin Sang Gu.

902
01:04:58,401 --> 01:05:00,371
It's Jin Sang Gu.

903
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:02,501
Jin Sang Gu?

904
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:05,420
Who's Jin Sang Gu?

905
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,851
   

906
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:15,661
♫  That shines in our memory  ♫

907
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:23,391
♫  Try to remember us then  ♫

908
01:05:23,391 --> 01:05:27,141
♫  We used to be happy  ♫

909
01:05:27,141 --> 01:05:31,171
♫  Why do we keep drifting apart?  ♫

910
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:37,921
♫  I'm still waiting for you  ♫

911
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:41,931
♫  I love you  ♫

912
01:05:41,931 --> 01:05:45,151
 Actors are all about their image. Who'd cast Park Do Ra now? 

913
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:46,771
 I think it's probably over for Park Do Ra. 

914
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:49,891
 We can't just sit back because of that. 

915
01:05:49,891 --> 01:05:53,541
 And I don't want to waste Grandma's recipe, either. 

916
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,181
 Let's give it a try, Oppa. 

917
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:56,811
 Father? What father? 

918
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:59,951
 He always takes money from you. What kind of father is he? 

919
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:02,041
 Do you know what Sang Gu did for you? 

920
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,951
 He definitely tried to kill Ma Ri. 

921
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:06,101
 But why? 

922
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:07,291
 He ran away? 

923
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,831
 I just went to his room, and his room was empty. 

924
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:12,581
 Jin Sang Gu moved out behind my back. 

925
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:14,531
 Why did you want to see me at this hour? 

926
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,891
 The secretaries already went home, too. 

927
01:06:17,421 --> 01:06:18,770
 Hyung.
