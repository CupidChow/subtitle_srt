1
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,137
   

2
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:51,227
Ji Yeong! Kim Ji Yeong!

3
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:54,687
Kim Ji Yeong, are you really Park Do Ra?

4
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,467
Is it true you got plastic surgery to live as Kim Ji Yeong?

5
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,757
Did you lie to Director Go Pil Sung, too?

6
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:01,387
Does he know you're Park Do Ra, too?

7
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:02,397
Please say something!

8
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:03,997
- A comment, please. 
 - A comment, please!

9
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,517
Why are you doing this to Ji Yeong?

10
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,127
I'll explain everything.

11
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:11,617
I'll explain everything on a separate occasion. So, today...

12
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:14,707
Does that mean you knew everything but deceived everyone with her?

13
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,117
That's not true.

14
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,167
Director Go didn't know anything.

15
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,967
I did it on my own! I attempted suicide and did everything myself!

16
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,927
Is that why you faked your death? Because of the prostitution allegation?

17
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:26,977
Did you have to change your face and work as an actor?

18
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:29,107
- Say something! Please explain! 
 - Jae Dong!

19
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:32,267
- Say something! 
 - Please say something!

20
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:44,427
What's going on? What happened?

21
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:51,027
- She went that way! 
 - Kim Ji Yeong!

22
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,947
Kim Ji Yeong!

23
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,737
That way.

24
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:59,287
President Baek Mi Ja?

25
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,217
You're Park Do Ra's mom, President Baek Mi Ja, correct?

26
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:03,517
- President! 
 - Did you also know, President Baek?

27
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:06,827
No, I-I don't know anything! I don't!

28
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,277
- Please say something! 
 - President Baek!

29
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:10,367
President Baek!

30
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:13,250
Please say something, President Baek!

31
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:21,837


32
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,397
   

33
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,117
   

34
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:28,567
   

35
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:42,487
Is Seon Yeong doing okay?

36
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:48,877
Gosh, my hands are still shaking. I can't calm down.

37
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:53,917
How could he fool us all and get married like that?

38
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:57,987
This is why I can't help but bring up that he was an abandoned baby!

39
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,787
Mom!

40
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:04,017
What? Did I say something wrong?

41
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,737
He can't do this if he thinks of you as his parents.

42
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,307
Is this how he returns the favor for raising you?

43
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:11,207
Geez, what a bastard.

44
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:14,807
Is the wedding only for them?

45
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:18,477
How could something like this happen?

46
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:22,947
Also, the Chairman must feel so betrayed.

47
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:26,557
We'd have nothing to say if he wants to cancel the adoption.

48
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:31,637
Mom, that's enough. Seon Yeong is stressed out enough already.

49
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:34,847
Pil Sung had his reasons, too.

50
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,187
What do you mean? What reasons?

51
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:41,207
Did you know something about it?

52
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:47,807
Pil Sung told me everything before the wedding.

53
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:49,947
W-What...

54
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:52,417
What? What?

55
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,477
What did you say?

56
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:59,337
You mean you knew everything?

57
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:02,707
You deceived all of us, knowing everything?

58
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:06,447
Did you know everything, then, Oppa?

59
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,077
You knew Kim Ji Yeong was Park Do Ra?

60
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,347
Well, I...

61
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:14,947
I felt so bad for him hearing his story.

62
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:20,477
So, I... allowed it...

63
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:23,747
- What? 
 - My goodness.

64
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:28,807
How could you allow them to marry knowing that?

65
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,317
Are you out of your mind?

66
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:35,017
The whole world is criticizing Pil Sung.

67
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:38,327
This is... This is all your fault!

68
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,337
What are you going to do?

69
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,287
- What will you do about Pil Sung? 
 - I mean, I...

70
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,437
I'm sorry, Honey. I didn't think this would happen.

71
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,777
Seon Yeong.

72
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:51,757
How... How could you lie to me like this?

73
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,727
I can't live with you!

74
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,867
I want a divorce! I want a divorce! I want a divorce!

75
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,097
- Aigoo, Seon Yeong. 
 - Unni, Unni...

76
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,557
What are you going to do?

77
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,587
I want a divorce!

78
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:04,897
- How... 
 - Seon Yeong, calm down.

79
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:07,817
   

80
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,917
My gosh...

81
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:15,257
What's going to happen to Do Ra now?

82
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,967
How did the reporters find out Ji Yeong was Do Ra?

83
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:20,537
What will Do Ra do?

84
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:25,587
She's just starting to make money. How could this happen?

85
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:30,447
Do Sik.

86
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,727
It was you, wasn't it?

87
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,967
You did it, didn't you? Mom...

88
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,277
You told the reporters that Ji Yeong is Do Ra, right?

89
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,587
No, I didn't!

90
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,837
I'm so upset, too. Why are you doing this to me?

91
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,577
Why would I expose my daughter?

92
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:51,567
You told me last time!

93
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,147
That you'd expose that Ji Yeong is Do Ra.

94
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,317
I said that because I was so angry then!

95
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,307
Because you guys said you'd abandon me!

96
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,727
Please be honest for the last time, Mom.

97
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,327
It was you. You're the only one.

98
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:09,007
I said it wasn't me!

99
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,937
But...

100
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:19,657
to be honest, there might've been a slip of the tongue.

101
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,937
A slip of the tongue?

102
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:29,247
That day, President Gong came by and kept asking me if Ji Yeong was Do Ra.

103
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,497
He said he overheard us talking about it.

104
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:35,747
But I was a little drunk that day.

105
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:38,517
I said my Do Ra isn't Ji Yeong.

106
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:45,247
I think I said, "I wouldn't tell you that," by mistake.

107
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,167
What?

108
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:51,147
He has no evidence, but I think it was President Gong, that bastard.

109
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,707
Do Sik, please believe me.

110
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:56,817
Should I go to President Gong and say something?

111
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,867
Should I slap him in the face or something?

112
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,487
So, it's ultimately your fault.

113
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:06,107
No one would've known if you didn't say anything, right?

114
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:11,327
Do Sik, why are you doing this to me now? You're upsetting me.

115
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:14,987
Don't show up in front of us anymore, Mom.

116
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:18,247
Even if Do Ra and Do Jun don't mind, I do.

117
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,677
Do whatever you want with this place.

118
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:25,987
But if you show up in front of Do Ra and Do Jun and bring up money again, I'll kick you out of this place, too.

119
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,707
No, Do Sik, Do Sik...

120
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:31,967
Mom, from this moment on,

121
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:35,417
let's not ever see each other again.

122
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,807
No, Do Sik! This isn't right! Do Sik!

123
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:41,457
This isn't right! Do Sik! Do Sik!

124
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:43,717
This isn't right. This isn't right, Do Sik.

125
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:48,157
Do Sik! I didn't do it! Do Sik!

126
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,207
Oppa.

127
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,047
What are we going to do?

128
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:37,347
   

129
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,727
   

130
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,747
   

131
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,647
   

132
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,117
   

133
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,097
   

134
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,977
   

135
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,297
Oh, no...

136
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,817
What do I do...

137
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,977
I told you not to look at this.

138
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,297
People are saying that without knowing anything.

139
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,567
They're making it sound sensational without providing context.

140
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:34,307
But they'll eventually find out you didn't do it on purpose.

141
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:38,057
I'm okay.

142
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:44,137
I deserve to be called names and criticized.

143
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:46,797
I have nothing to say.

144
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,867
But how about you, Oppa?

145
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:54,347
Why are you being criticized because of me?

146
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:58,407
This is why I said I wouldn't marry you.

147
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:06,049
Do Ra, I said I'm okay.

148
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:12,119
We knew we'd go through this at least once.

149
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:17,209
Just think it happened sooner than we expected.

150
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,829
People are too riled up right now.

151
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:25,029
Let's take time and explain everything that happened.

152
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,459
People will understand our truth, too, then.

153
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,089
Let us...

154
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:37,859
overcome this obstacle together. Okay?

155
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,549
Do you really think so?

156
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,599
Really?

157
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,149
Of course.

158
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,979
They'll understand your true intentions someday.

159
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,119
Don't cry anymore.

160
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,549
I'm by your side.

161
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,599
   

162
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,009
There's finally justice.

163
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,359
You should be punished for deceiving people.

164
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:35,479
They won't be able to live in Korea anymore.

165
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:44,787
Geez, this is why she should've listened to me.

166
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:49,437
Jin Dan! Jin Dan!

167
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,687
I have big news. Big news.

168
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,457
Do you know who Kim Ji Yeong is?

169
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:57,967
You kept calling her Do Ra.

170
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,987
But she was actually Park Do Ra.

171
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,837
She was alive after faking her death.

172
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:06,407
When the bride walked down the aisle, the reporters rushed in.

173
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:09,337
It was a total disaster, apparently.

174
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,337
What would've happened if you ended up with her?

175
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:15,787
Our family and you would've gone down.

176
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,757
Why aren't you surprised, Jin Dan?

177
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:22,797
Kim Ji Yeong is Park Do Ra, whom you've missed so much.

178
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:26,047
I saw the articles. I know about it, too.

179
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:30,497
Really? Gosh, isn't Do Ra so scary?

180
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:35,047
Right. So, I asked Attorney Kang about it.

181
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,697
Apparently, Pil Sung's adoption was put on hold.

182
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,087
- Really? 
 - Yes.

183
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:43,547
I suppose your brother is a sensible man.

184
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,537
He somehow found out and put it on hold.

185
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,907
He would've been crapped on if he had adopted Pil Sung.

186
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,087
But he cleverly found a way to avoid it.

187
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,737
Anyway, I don't know who it was, but I'm glad someone exposed Park Do Ra.

188
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:57,057
How could she fool everyone like that?

189
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,707
She even changed her face, too.

190
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,977
Gosh, I'm getting the chills.

191
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,477
Father, it's me.

192
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:19,367
 Pil Sung! Where are you right now? Are you okay? 

193
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,677
 Is everything okay? 

194
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:26,087
Are you sure you're okay?

195
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,657
Have you been eating?

196
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:30,537
How is she? She seemed very shocked.

197
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:33,087
Are you out of your mind? Who are you worrying about?

198
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,917
- Give me that. Let me talk to him. 
 - Yes, yes.

199
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,057
Don't worry about us. Yes.

200
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:38,947
Call me if anything happens. Bye.

201
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,790
Why are you hanging up!

202
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,970
Let me talk to him! Let me!

203
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:46,027
Pil Sung, that bastard!

204
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:49,557
He won't call me or answer my calls!

205
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:52,697
Since when have you been talking secretly?

206
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:55,327
What do you mean, "secretly"?

207
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,297
He's somewhere safe right now. He said not to worry.

208
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,597
He said he'd come home once the reporters quiet down. So, don't worry.

209
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:05,077
You should've told him to come home, still!

210
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,097
What if something happens while he's out and about?

211
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,057
The whole world is trying to eat them alive right now!

212
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:14,130
Gosh, Unni. The reporters are camping outside.

213
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,430
He can't come here.

214
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:19,337
How long does he have to hide, then?

215
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:22,397
My Pil Sung didn't do anything wrong.

216
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:25,877
This is all your fault!

217
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,227
Why did you allow it, anyway?

218
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:34,387
If you told me in advance, I would've stopped them and avoided this disaster!

219
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,497
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong. Seriously.

220
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,937
How is that Hyeon Cheol's fault? How?

221
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:43,407
It's because of that bitch Park Do Ra.

222
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:46,357
What are we going to do?

223
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:48,120
What would happen to our Pil Sung?

224
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,460
What would happen?

225
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,927
My goodness...

226
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,147
Where did she go?

227
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,327
Do Ra.

228
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,947
Ji Yeong!

229
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,087
Ji Yeong!

230
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:25,687
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

231
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:30,857
 I'm sorry I decided on my own without telling you. 

232
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,797
 But I thought I should take care of this myself. 

233
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:37,187
 I'll have a press conference. 

234
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,357
 I'll be in touch afterward, Oppa. 

235
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:41,687
 Don't worry too much. 

236
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:43,527
Press conference?

237
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,047
What's she talking about?

238
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:59,207
Cheol Su, it's me. Park Do Ra is having a press conference now.

239
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,017
Could you find out where it's happening?

240
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:18,477
First of all, I'm sorry for all the trouble.

241
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:45,887
I know I waited too long, but I thought I should

242
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:49,567
finally explain everything myself.

243
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,127
That's why I'm here.

244
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:55,407
Ms. Kim, are you really Park Do Ra?

245
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,467
Yes.

246
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,277
It's true I'm...

247
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,027
Park Do Ra.

248
00:18:09,897 --> 00:18:13,087
The rumor says that I got plastic surgery

249
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:16,357
and lived in disguise to avoid the prostitution allegation

250
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:19,760
and contract cancellation fees.

251
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,070
But that is not true.

252
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:22,747
What are you talking about?

253
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:27,127
You got plastic surgery and lived as Kim Ji Yeong, didn't you?

254
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,717
Let me explain everything.

255
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,057
All of this started...

256
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:43,257
with my mom's gambling debt.

257
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:48,837
 We're from the court. 

258
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,707
 We'll seize Ms. Baek's bond bank account and tangible movable property. 

259
00:18:53,707 --> 00:19:00,257
 One day, when I was working as Park Do Ra, I learned my mom had a huge amount of gambling debt. 

260
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:03,627
 Why are we having an ad contract meeting at a place like this? 

261
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:06,977
 I was going to work hard and pay it back. 

262
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:12,407
 I went to a meeting that was supposed to be for the cosmetics ad, 

263
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:16,037
 but it led people to think I attempted prostitution. 

264
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:20,007
 Is this for the cosmetics commercial meeting? 

265
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:24,607
 And I ended up becoming an actor who had sex for money. 

266
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:29,397
Everyone,

267
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:33,247
I did not have sex for money.

268
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,437
Ever since I started working as an actor at age 13,

269
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:42,827
I've worked honestly, diligently, and with pride.

270
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:47,677
But the prostitution allegation erased all of my life's efforts

271
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:51,147
and there wasn't a single person who believed me.

272
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:56,227
I was completely hopeless then.

273
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:01,447
I tried my best to survive somehow,

274
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:05,017
but I seemed to be falling even deeper.

275
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:09,697
I know I shouldn't have...

276
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:18,067
but I ended up by the sea without realizing it.

277
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,767
So, are you saying you didn't fake your death?

278
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,827
No.

279
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:31,417
Death was the only thing I could think of then.

280
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,027
 I... 

281
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:39,647
 no longer have the confidence to live as Park Do Ra, Dad. 

282
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,547
 I know it's hard to believe, 

283
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:48,897
 but when I woke up after jumping into the ocean, 

284
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:53,487
 I was at the hospital as Kim Ji Yeong, Lee Soon Jeong's granddaughter. 

285
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,997
 I had no memory then. 

286
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:58,997
 I was diagnosed with memory loss. 

287
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:05,117
That's why I lived believing I was Ms. Lee's granddaughter, Kim Ji Yeong.

288
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,977
Then, I started getting my memory back only recently...

289
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:12,607
and I realized I was Park Do Ra.

290
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:17,307
But I was already an actor.

291
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:22,937
I constantly contemplated whether I should reveal I'm Park Do Ra.

292
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:28,827
But I didn't think anyone would believe me unless I cleared my name from the prostitution allegation.

293
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:35,077
So, I tried to clear my name and stand up proudly,

294
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,587
but the words got out like this.

295
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,277
Did Director Go Pil Sung lie with you, then?

296
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:43,037
No.

297
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,937
He didn't know, either.

298
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,327
He also only recently found out I was Park Do Ra.

299
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:50,867
Didn't he marry you knowing you're Park Do Ra?

300
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:54,857
He cast you for "Seoul Lady," knowing you're Park Do Ra, correct?

301
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:59,397
I-It's true, but... he didn't decide to cast me alone.

302
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:01,687
He still cast you knowing that, right?

303
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,527
Reporters,

304
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:08,587
please, I beg you.

305
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:12,197
Please stop being unreasonable about Director Go.

306
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,217
Director Go is innocent.

307
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:15,947
Everything is my fault.

308
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:18,707
What do you mean he's innocent?

309
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:21,247
You plotted this together. Are you joking?

310
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,887
How dare you make up a story?

311
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,507
You had sex for money, but you were framed?

312
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:28,217
You changed your face and name. What are you proud of?

313
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,127
You damn scam artist!

314
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:36,217
If you were really framed for prostitution, why did you show up with a different face?

315
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:39,887
Why get plastic surgery and live as someone else?

316
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:45,027
You scammer!

317
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,287
Do Ra!

318
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:58,927
It's Go Pil Sung!

319
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,317
It's Director Go Pil Sung!

320
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:02,027
Director Go Pil Sung!

321
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,397
Director!

322
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:06,017
They really are scammers!

323
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,067
How dare you show your face here?

324
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:12,317
The director and actor plotted this together.

325
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:14,847
Go Pil Sung, you scammer!

326
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:17,127
Don't you feel guilty toward other actors?

327
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:19,337
Director Go did nothing wrong!

328
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:22,457
I don't care what you do to me, but don't do this to him!

329
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:24,277
Please!

330
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,397
Director Go did nothing wrong!

331
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:31,777
Everyone, you're watching Park Do Ra's miserable ending live.

332
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,927
Don't lie, everyone.

333
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:37,937
This is what happens to liars.

334
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,880
Why did you do that without telling me?

335
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,580
Why?

336
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,390
Oppa.

337
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,140
I told you you'd suffer if you stayed with me.

338
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,900
Why did you have to be so stubborn?

339
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,960
Just look at you.

340
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,500
Look what happened to you because of me!

341
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,980
Do Ra... I'm okay.

342
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,450
Oppa,

343
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,420
I'm not okay with this.

344
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,200
I want to clear your name, Oppa.

345
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

346
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,260
You did nothing wrong!

347
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,360
Why should you suffer like this?

348
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,380
I'm so upset that I'm about to go crazy!

349
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,230
Do Ra,

350
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,370
I said I'm okay.

351
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,520
Why would you be upset?

352
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,060
The fact that you went through that alone hurts me more.

353
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,640
You must've been so scared alone.

354
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,350
Oppa...

355
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,820
Oppa,

356
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,650
what do we do if Hwang Jeong Shik never shows up?

357
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,120
We have to keep living like this if we can't find him.

358
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,130
You need to leave me right now, Oppa.

359
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,470
Leave me! Leave me!

360
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,500
Leave me! Leave me, Oppa!

361
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,260
Leave me, Oppa!

362
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,040
Park Do Ra!

363
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,790
Oppa! Leave me, Oppa!

364
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,590
Do Ra... pull yourself together.

365
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,700
Because of me...

366
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,220
Stop saying that now.

367
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,380
We can overcome this together, okay?

368
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,130
More than my suffering,

369
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,400
the fact that you have to suffer bothers me more.

370
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,410
I'd rather die than see you go through that!

371
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,960
Do Ra, calm down.

372
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,740
Calm down.

373
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,780
- I'm fine as long as I have you. 
 - Oppa, what do we do?

374
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,560
Trust me.

375
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,020
Oppa, what do we do?

376
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,110
Oppa, what do we do?

377
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,320
It's okay.

378
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,150
It's okay.

379
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,700
What did you say?

380
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,060
You put the adoption on hold?

381
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,770
Why—

382
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,700
There's nothing I can do right now.

383
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,120
At least, the court hasn't received the paperwork yet.

384
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,430
What if Pil Sung had become my adoptive son?

385
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,040
Things would've been disastrous for APP Group, too.

386
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,500
Honey, how could you do this without discussing it with me?

387
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,470
He didn't ask for it, yet you wanted to adopt Pil Sung first.

388
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,330
You said he was like your son.

389
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,860
If a child is in crisis, the parents should help, no matter what.

390
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:16,500
How could you do this just because of what happened?

391
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,840
You say you put it on hold,

392
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,950
but you already decided to cancel it, right?

393
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,700
Dad,

394
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,030
w-will you not adopt Pil Sung?

395
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,380
He's going through so much. How could you do this to him?

396
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,900
He agreed to become your son.

397
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,930
Shouldn't you be helping him?

398
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,110
Ma Ri, I had no choice, either.

399
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,480
Pil Sung decided to do this.

400
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,030
I told him not to marry her if he wanted to be my son,

401
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,220
but he chose to do it.

402
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,680
I can't let that lady negatively affect the company.

403
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,570
I guess you'd do that to me, too, if the company were in danger.

404
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,500
- I'm so disappointed in you, Dad. 
 - M-Ma Ri.

405
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,920
Honey, what are you doing? You should've stopped her.

406
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,240
What?

407
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,760
- Jin Dan liked Park Do Ra? 
 - Yes.

408
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,090
They even planned to get engaged back then.

409
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,380
Seriously. That girl is just as cunning as ever.

410
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,200
How could she try to fake her identity and become an actor?

411
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,270
Aigoo, Jin Dan must've been so shocked.

412
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,550
By the way, I thought Park Do Ra was with Pil Sung.

413
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,450
That's why I'm saying Jin Dan wasted his time.

414
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,710
My poor baby.

415
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,650
She tricked him as Park Do Ra and as Ji Yeong again.

416
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,110
But I'm sure Jin Dan didn't do that for no reason.

417
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,170
While she was dating Pil Sung, she must've flirted with Jin Dan, too.

418
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,580
I'm sure she did.

419
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,650
Park Do Ra is bad news, isn't she?

420
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,130
But what happened was a blessing in disguise.

421
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,550
Blessing in disguise? What do you mean?

422
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,890
Chairman Gong put the adoption on hold because he was disappointed in Pil Sung.

423
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,630
- It basically means he's canceling it. 
 - Really?

424
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,990
Will Jin Dan become the adoptive son, then?

425
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,920
Maybe not immediately, but I'll find the right time to push for it.

426
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,190
Besides, Jin Dan would get everything eventually if he didn't adopt anyone else.

427
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,680
That's why Pil Sung needs to go down for good.

428
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,830
So that he'd fall out of favor with Chairman Gong.

429
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,590
So, he can never break up with Park Do Ra.

430
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,960
They'd go down if they stayed together.

431
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,570
I see. You're right.

432
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,470
 That's why Pil Sung needs to go down for good. 

433
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,350
 So that he'd fall out of favor with Chairman Gong. 

434
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,910
You're working so hard in this heat.

435
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,590
Have these. Here you go.

436
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,140
Use these fans, too.

437
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,730
Have these drinks, too.

438
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,310
Thank you. By the way, who are you?

439
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,440
Oh, I live in this house.

440
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,010
Are you Director Go's family?

441
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,600
No, I'm friends with his father.

442
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,410
You're his friend.

443
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,200
Let me ask you something since you're an acquaintance.

444
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,520
Park Do Ra said Go Pil Sung didn't know she was Park Do Ra.

445
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,510
- Is that true? 
 - I'm not sure.

446
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,640
I heard they've been together for a long time.

447
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,450
How could he have not known?

448
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,780
I'm assuming he knew from the beginning.

449
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,510
Then, did he cast her knowing she's Park Do Ra?

450
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,170
She's his girlfriend. I'm sure he did.

451
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,470
Working with your girlfriend means you get to have fun while working.

452
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,080
There's no reason not to cast her.

453
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,750
By chance, has Park Do Ra come here, too?

454
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,660
Have you seen her?

455
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,890
Well, I think I saw her a few times.

456
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,310
But I'm not sure if that was her.

457
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,850
A lot of women have been here.

458
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,800
What do you mean by that?

459
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,200
Did Director Go have other women?

460
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,190
I can't comment on someone else's love life.

461
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,870
I'll say "no comment" to that question.

462
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,620
Hey, Jin Sang Gu!

463
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
What are you doing, you bastard?

464
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,000
- You bastard... 
 - What did he do?

465
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,920
Everything he said is a lie, everyone.

466
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,690
- He has nothing to do with our family. 
 - You!

467
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,250
He's just a tenant who rents here.

468
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,080
So, stop hanging out here and leave. Leave.

469
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,100
Hey, Jin Sang Gu! You bastard!

470
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,110
Leave! Leave! Leave!

471
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,020
Go! Leave! Leave!

472
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,960
Leave, I said! Leave!

473
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,940
The Heavens helped us this time.

474
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,830
It's such a relief the adoption paper hasn't been sent yet.

475
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,680
We barely managed to dodge the bullet.

476
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:32,150
You're considering adopting him because of Ma Ri,

477
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,560
but Jin Dan is actually related to Ma Ri.

478
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,110
The only one who'd protect Ma Ri,

479
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,520
our family, and APP Group is Jin Dan.

480
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,340
You need to listen to me.

481
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,850
Aunt said that to Hyung?

482
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,560
So, what did he say?

483
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,950
He listened without saying anything.

484
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,410
But you know why he listened without saying anything.

485
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,850
It's because he found her convincing.

486
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:08,060
Jin Dan, Pil Sung, and Park Do Ra saved you this time.

487
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,370
Anyway, be careful not to upset Auntie and Hyung from now on,

488
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,200
okay?

489
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,090
   

490
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,370
   

491
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,610
   

492
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,990
   

493
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,580
I told you not to read the articles and the comments, didn't I?

494
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,290
Don't read them.

495
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,600
Drink this water.

496
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,710
Yes, Do Joon.

497
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,860
What?

498
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,710
Grandma?

499
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,990
Okay, I'll be right there.

500
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,950
What's going on?

501
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,530
I need to go home right now, Oppa.

502
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,760
Grandma is about to pass out because she's been refusing to eat, looking for me.

503
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,680
She can't pass out, Oppa.

504
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,170
Okay, let's go.

505
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,600
We can't avoid things anymore.

506
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,110
It's about time something happened.

507
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:01,810
How could we get anything if no one shows up?

508
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,140
- We can't sell everything now.
- Isn't it great?

509
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,680
- Of course. 
 - I think it's great.

510
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,380
Hey, isn't that Park Do Ra?

511
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,180
It's her! Look!

512
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,460
It's Park Do Ra!

513
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,850
Park Do Ra! We'll take some photos!

514
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,790
How dare she show her face like this?

515
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,790
Please show your face!

516
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,010
Ji Yeong!

517
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,220
Aigoo, Ji Yeong.

518
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,480
Grandma.

519
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,270
Aigoo, where have you been?

520
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,300
I thought you jumped into the water again.

521
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,650
No, why would I do that?

522
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,360
I'd never do that.

523
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,100
So, don't worry.

524
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,600
Aigoo, Ji Yeong. Aigoo...

525
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,550
I'm sorry, Grandma.

526
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,580
I'm sorry, Grandma.

527
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,800
No, no, no.

528
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,670
You came back without dying. That's enough.

529
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,270
You can live. You can live.

530
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,490
Don't you worry, Ji Yeong.

531
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,890
Grandma.

532
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,240
Yes, yes...

533
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,510
Aigoo, it's okay.

534
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,520
Aigoo, it's okay. It's okay.

535
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,100
- Grandma. 
 - My baby.

536
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,400
I would've stopped you from marrying her if I had known.

537
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,030
I'm sorry we caused you harm.

538
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,520
Why would you say that?

539
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,300
We had to go through this at some point, anyway.

540
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,650
That's why I rushed our wedding.

541
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,240
Because I wanted to be with her when this happened.

542
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,710
Hyung.

543
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,100
No one else knows, but we do.

544
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,900
That Do Ra was framed for prostitution.

545
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,800
People will learn the truth eventually.

546
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,670
So, let's hang in there until then.

547
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,210
Hyung, I'll find the man named Hwang Jeong Shik.

548
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,110
You don't know where he is in the Philippines.

549
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,610
There are more than 7,000 islands there. It's impossible.

550
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,400
A reporter friend and I have actually been looking for him through the Korean expat group there.

551
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,990
Someone saw Hwang Jeong Shik by chance recently.

552
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,430
I guess he even changed his name.

553
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,730
Why couldn't you catch him, then?

554
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,340
There's no evidence, and he has no criminal record.

555
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,770
But he said he wanted to come to Korea because he ran out of money.

556
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,610
Really?

557
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,110
I don't think he could last long, either.

558
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,770
We can reveal the truth if he comes to Korea.

559
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,340
We'll know who hired him to do that, too.

560
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:23,280
If Do Ra could clear her name about that, people would understand her.

561
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,980
Thank you so much, Hyung.

562
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,330
Just one moment.

563
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,130
Yes, Chief Yun.

564
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,870
Is that so?

565
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,880
Okay, I'll be right there.

566
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,050
Do Ra, I need to go because something came up at work.

567
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,190
I'll take care of it real quick and be back. Stay here, okay?

568
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,710
Do Shik and Do Joon, please take care of Do Ra.

569
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,480
Okay, don't worry.

570
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,980
There must be a lot of reporters outside, Oppa.

571
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,240
Don't worry about me and rest with Grandma.

572
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,830
I'll be back.

573
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,040
Director.

574
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,950
Director, Writer Kim's project we were supposed to work on...

575
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,130
They just said it got canceled.

576
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,430
Oh, really?

577
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,510
The companies that were supposed to invest backed out

578
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,710
and the ones who signed the contract are demanding a refund and damage compensation.

579
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,710
And "Seoul Lady" will no longer be sold abroad, either.

580
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,660
The ones that bought the broadcast rights in advance want to sue us for a penalty for breaching the contract.

581
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,590
GOGO Entertainment

582
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,990
Yes, Chairman.

583
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,060
   

584
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,620
Is this your solution?

585
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,050
I'm not trying to...

586
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,250
avoid the current situation with this resignation.

587
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,860
But since I'm the one to blame for all of these issues,

588
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,590
I should leave Go Go Entertainment

589
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,060
to prevent further losses for the company.

590
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,050
That's why I decided to do this first.

591
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:13,390
I'll do my best to take responsibility for the damages I inflicted on the company one by one.

592
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,970
I'm sorry, Chairman.

593
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,830
   

594
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,820
Did Pil Sung really submit a resignation letter?

595
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:40,190
Yes, he said he needs to quit to stop people from attacking the company

596
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,620
and stop further losses and damages, too.

597
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,640
But you shouldn't have accepted it.

598
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,230
He has achieved so many things since he joined Go Go Entertainment.

599
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:55,900
It's true he grew the company,

600
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,100
but he did put it in danger, too.

601
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,450
He should be responsible as the CEO, then.

602
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,140
The employees didn't do anything wrong.

603
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,740
- Honey— 
 - Look at the situation now.

604
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:15,070
Just because he said he quit, the media suddenly stopped attacking us

605
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:20,380
and the people who wanted to sue us are changing their minds, too.

606
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,040
It's such a relief for the company.

607
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,010
That's why President Go decided to do this quickly.

608
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,220
So, you should try to understand, too.

609
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,110
I can't just let this happen.

610
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,160
Pil Sung stepped down as the CEO?

611
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,030
S-Soo Yeon, is that true?

612
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,210
Okay.

613
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,060
Unni, what do you mean by that?

614
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,580
Pil Sung stepped down as the CEO?

615
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,270
I suppose so.

616
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,270
I guess the company was in danger because of the negative public opinion.

617
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,140
What's Pil Sung going to do?

618
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:32,030
Looks like Pil Sung was labeled as a corrupt director

619
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:37,630
who lied about Park Do Ra and cast his girlfriend unjustly

620
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:42,240
because of his personal feelings for her.

621
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,860
My goodness. This is all because he met the wrong woman.

622
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,470
The chairman is about to cancel the adoption, too.

623
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,630
I'm home.

624
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,250
- Hey. 
 - Pil Sung, how could you...

625
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,620
What is all this?

626
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,920
Did you really step down as the CEO voluntarily?

627
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,860
The company suffered a loss because of me.

628
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,830
I had to take responsibility.

629
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,010
Gosh, seriously!

630
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,310
I can't believe you let a woman do this to you.

631
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,710
You quit that great job as the CEO.

632
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,400
The adoption with the Chairman is on hold.

633
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,450
You were a successful director, but they're throwing stones at you!

634
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,940
You lost everything you worked so hard to achieve! Everything!

635
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,310
How could all this happen because of that Park Do Ra?

636
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,420
Pil Sung, you need to break up with her.

637
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,150
Then, the Chairman would take you back.

638
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:49,450
Because all of this is her fault, not yours.

639
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:54,260
Yes, Pil Sung. It's not too late to break up with her now.

640
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,560
You didn't even have a wedding. It's all over now.

641
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,420
So, breaking up with her won't cause any issues.

642
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,840
Please. Please, Pil Sung. You need to break up with her now.

643
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,930
Break up with her now!

644
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,180
Mom.

645
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,250
Should I abandon the woman I chose to get adopted by the Chairman?

646
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,540
I can't do that.

647
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:25,670
And I quit my job at the company, but I'll get back up.

648
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,590
Don't worry.

649
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,600
That bastard.

650
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,380
Gosh, seriously.

651
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,350
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong!

652
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,160
Aigoo, Seon Yeong!

653
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,450
Seon Yeong, you'll get sick at this rate.

654
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,720
Gosh, don't be like that. That little bastard.

655
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,450
- That bastard... 
 - You're draining yourself. Don't do this.

656
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,890
This is so upsetting.

657
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,570
Hyeon Cheol!

658
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,730
- Come over here. 
 - Hold on...

659
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,290
Don't be like this, Seon Yeong. You'd hurt yourself. Seriously.

660
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,850
 You quit that great job as the CEO. 

661
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,570
 The adoption at Chairman's is on hold. 

662
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,610
 You were a successful director, but they're throwing stones at you! 

663
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,140
 You lost everything you worked so hard to achieve! Everything! 

664
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,550
 How could all this happen because of that Park Do Ra? 

665
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,360
Honey, water...

666
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,280
Honey, where are you going?

667
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,150
Mother.

668
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,330
"Mother"?

669
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,640
How dare you call me that?

670
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,230
Pil Sung stepped down as the CEO, and his adoption was canceled, too.

671
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,000
The whole world calls him a scammer.

672
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,010
He lost everything because of you.

673
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,000
He lost everything! Everything!

674
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,870
What will you do about ruining his life?

675
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,330
What's my Pil Sung going to do now?

676
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,500
There was an article about you getting engaged to another man

677
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,020
while you were with Pil Sung.

678
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,760
Do you know how he lived thinking you were dead?

679
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,650
I thought he'd die then, too!

680
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,190
He was pretty much dead!

681
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,880
You broke his heart so much.

682
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,260
He barely managed to get back up,

683
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,480
and you showed up in front of him again.

684
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,950
How dare you drag him down again like this?

685
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,080
Just go and die alone. Go ahead!

686
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,930
Go die alone!

687
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,990
I'm sorry, Mother.

688
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,190
I'm sorry.

689
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,060
I'm sorry, Mother.

690
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:15,480
If you care about Pil Sung,

691
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,320
you should leave him right now.

692
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:26,150
If you care about him even a little bit, leave him now.

693
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,460
Yes, Mother.

694
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,720
I will do that.

695
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,410
I'm sorry.

696
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,140
I'm sorry, Mother.

697
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,980
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,900
I'm sorry.

699
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,110
Mom.

700
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,530
Yes, Do Ra. Just one second.

701
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,430
Yes, where are you right now? I'll come pick you up.

702
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,140
The reporters are still outside. You can't come in alone.

703
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,540
 I won't go home, Oppa. 

704
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,630
I'm thinking of going somewhere for a bit.

705
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,410
What? Go? Where are you going?

706
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,710
Later...

707
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,620
I'll tell you later.

708
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,250
But I'm worried about Grandma.

709
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,880
I want to go with her, but it'd be too difficult for her to be with me.

710
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,280
 So, I can't take her with me. 

711
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,340
Why don't I come with you, then? I'll pack right now.

712
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,700
No, Oppa. You and Grandma would suffer too much, then.

713
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,440
That's why.

714
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,110
Do Ra, by chance...

715
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,010
You aren't trying to do what you did, right?

716
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,640
If you do, I'll never forgive you, okay?

717
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,900
No, I won't.

718
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,060
Just for now,

719
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,930
I'm thinking of being away while things quiet down.

720
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,580
I'm thinking of...

721
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,340
breaking up with Pil Sung.

722
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,030
Do Ra.

723
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,780
Oppa,

724
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,720
I need to let him go.

725
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,020
That way, he can live.

726
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,990
I can't let him ruin his life because of me.

727
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,980
That'd be too difficult for him.

728
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,860
You know what I mean, right?

729
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,730
Okay.

730
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,080
But you promised me.

731
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,040
Don't ever leave us behind.

732
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,930
Promise not to do anything bad, okay?

733
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,920
I promise.

734
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,090
Please take good care of Grandma.

735
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,040
I'm sorry.

736
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,860
Thank you.

737
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,060
Where's Do Ra?

738
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,820
She's gone.

739
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,060
She's gone? What do you mean?

740
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,110
She left. Don't look for her.

741
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,220
You two aren't meant to be.

742
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,210
She doesn't want you to suffer anymore.

743
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,360
Do Sik.

744
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,070
You've done enough already.

745
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,110
I'm so grateful for what you've done for her, but...

746
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:42,060
if you keep doing this, I'd feel too guilty.

747
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:47,940
Even I feel so bad for you. Imagine how Do Ra must feel.

748
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,780
Please forget about her now.

749
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,820
What are you talking about right now?

750
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,520
Where's Do Ra?

751
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,050
Where is she?

752
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,570
I don't know. She just said she'll be in touch later.

753
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,550
Do Sik.

754
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,130
Please tell me. Where's Do Ra?

755
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,450
Hyung, I have no idea.

756
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:23,100
She didn't tell me so I won't tell you.

757
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,120
Hyung,

758
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:33,580
please let her do what she wants to do now.

759
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,840
Her heart must be breaking into pieces seeing you suffering because of her.

760
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,360
So, please let her go! Please!

761
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,280
You can't leave Do Ra alone right now.

762
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,550
Do you really not know?

763
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,580
She can't be left alone right now!

764
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,300
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

765
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,590
Park Do Ra, where are you?

766
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,470
You're doing the wrong thing right now.

767
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,740
You're making a mistake with me.

768
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,000
You promised me not to do this.

769
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,690
You promised me not to let go of my hand, no matter what!

770
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,320
Tell me where you are right now.

771
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,490
You need to call me!

772
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,300
Did Ji Yeong come here by chance, ma'am?

773
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,630
No, she didn't.

774
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,150
This is the only place she has to go. Are you sure she didn't?

775
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,790
Please tell me if you know anything.

776
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,230
I don't know anything.

777
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,970
I haven't seen her in a while, too.

778
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,550
I only saw her on the news.

779
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,660
I see.

780
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,770
Please call me if she comes here. Promise.

781
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,060
O-Okay.

782
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,930
Director, hold on.

783
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,640
I swear she didn't come here.

784
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,770
She didn't come here.

785
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,000
Thank you.

786
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,090
Park Do Ra!

787
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:46,500
♫  You can't forget just because you try  ♫

788
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:53,230
♫  You can't erase things just because you try  ♫

789
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,140
Do Ra.

790
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,860
Park Do Ra,

791
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,850
why are you doing this to me?

792
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,700
Why are you hurting me so much?

793
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,810
You promised me.

794
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,180
You promised not to do this!

795
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,290
You're suffering because of me.

796
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,080
I'm not suffering.

797
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,570
I suffer when I don't have you.

798
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,910
Why don't you believe me? Why?

799
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:37,170
♫  Can you think of it like that?  ♫

800
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:41,450

806
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,740
Wow...

807
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:18,050
The weight has finally been lifted.

808
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:26,000
So, Park Do Ra and Go Pil Sung probably...

809
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
blamed each other for everything

810
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,890
and broke up by now, right?

811
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,470
Go Pil Sung is probably at a loss.

812
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,850
You need to abandon her to live.

813
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,340
The air at the office is clear without Go Pil Sung.

814
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,430
All right...

815
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,450
   

816
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:11,070
Why is Mr. Jeong calling me?

817
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,800
Yes, Mr. Jeong. What's this about?

818
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,380
CEO Gong, I have bad news.

819
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,220
What's this about?

820
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:26,610
Hwang, whom we sent to the Philippines, returned to Korea.

821
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,680
Hwang? Hwang who?

822
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,200
What? By chance, is it that Hwang?

823
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,040
He promised to stay in the Philippines.

824
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,510
He promised to never return to Korea.

825
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:46,500
Yes, apparently... it's because his mother is ill.

826
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,180
He says he has no money.

827
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:52,600
He said he'll return to the Philippines as soon as his mother is treated.

828
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,420
He's demanding money.

829
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,840
 What should we do? 

830
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,640
Geez, seriously...

831
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,090
I gave him enough then. He's asking for more?

832
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:10,150
Okay, instead, warn him properly.

833
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,790
If he comes back to Korea and asks for money again,

834
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,000
I won't forgive him then.

835
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,850
I'll keep that in mind.

836
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,880
Thank you.

837
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:43,790
He took money from me like that.

838
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,150
He'd go to jail if he's caught, too.

839
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:51,650
That's right. I'm sure he wouldn't do anything stupid.

840
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,710
Do Ra...

841
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,460
you can run away anytime.

842
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,810
So, run away with me later if you have to.

843
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:32,580
Instead, let's try everything we can first.

844
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:36,230
Let's fix things one by one.

845
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:42,900
Let's do everything we can, even if it takes time.

846
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,250
Even if no one in the world believes us,

847
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,280
let's at least say it's not true...

848
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,800
before we run away. Please?

849
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,720
Do Ra,

850
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,910
don't ever do this again alone.

851
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,660
Let's go.

852
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,910
Let me take you home.

853
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,570
You're coming, right?

854
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,510
Yes, please come in.

855
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:39,850
What brings you here, anyway?

856
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:43,510
I heard Seon Yeong was sick.

857
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,290
Here...

858
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,650
I got some ssanghwatang* made. 
  (T/N: Herb tonic tea) 

859
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,980
Please share it with Seon Yeong.

860
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,640
Okay, thank you.

861
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,590
By the way, are the reporters still camping outside?

862
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,550
They're gone today. I didn't see a single one.

863
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:06,080
They must've gotten tired and left.

864
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,640
They used to be here until late at night.

865
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,110
Pil Sung.

866
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:19,590
Pil Sung, where have you been? You didn't answer our calls, either.

867
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,030
We've all been so worried.

868
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,530
Pil Sung is here?

869
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,810
- Pil Sung. 
 - Pil Sung.

870
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,790
Are you okay?

871
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,380
Where have you been?

872
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,630
I'm okay.

873
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,810
I need to tell you something.

874
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,740
Mom,

875
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,420
Father,

876
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,960
I've never said anything like this before.

877
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:53,080
To be honest, Do Ra died then...

878
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,340
because of me.

879
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:06,570
Why do you say she died because of you?

880
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,530
Mom, please be quiet.

881
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:16,130
Here's the truth about the prostitution rumor regarding Do Ra.

882
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,630
Someone hired a reenactment actor named Hwang Jeong Shik.

883
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:23,830
He tricked Do Ra, saying they'd hold an ad meeting, and told her to come to the hotel.

884
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,480
That's how he framed her for prostitution.

885
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,780
And he ran away to the Philippines.

886
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,460
Back then,

887
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,270
I didn't believe Do Ra, either.

888
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,090
After being framed,

889
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,450
she came to me for one last time

890
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,880
and asked me to believe her innocence.

891
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,580
She said I was the one who had to

892
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,910
believe her out of all people.

893
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,090
But I didn't.

894
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,530
And...

895
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,290
Do Ra died that day.

896
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,210
Mom,

897
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,860
Father,

898
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:30,930
I suffered so much after she died like that.

899
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:34,250
You both know, right?

900
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:40,020
But she came back to life.

901
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,990
Mom,

902
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,860
how could you tell me to let go of her hand again?

903
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,930
She's on the edge of the cliff once again.

904
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,570
You're telling me to look the other way again?

905
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,860
Mom,

906
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,920
Father,

907
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,630
is that really what you want?

908
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,290
Do you want me to regret it and hurt again

909
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,840
for the rest of my life? Do you?

910
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:27,070


911
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:30,080
   

912
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:35,890
♫  That shines in our memory  ♫

913
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:43,730
♫  Try to remember us then  ♫

914
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:47,450
♫  We used to be happy  ♫

915
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:51,470
♫  Why do we keep drifting apart?  ♫

916
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:58,230
♫  I'm still waiting for you  ♫

917
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:02,230
♫  I love you  ♫

918
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:06,570
 Who exposed Park Do Ra on Go Pil Sung's wedding day? 

919
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:09,010
 Tell Hwang to leave Korea. Tell him to leave immediately. 

920
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,480
 It can't go on like this anymore. 

921
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,540
 You did nothing wrong. Why should you hear awful things like that? 

922
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,640
 Do Ra, let's fight this face-to-face. 

923
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,380
 Face-to-face? What do you mean?
