1
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:55,180


2
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:21,717
What's with you?

3
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:28,987
Why are you staring at my face like that?

4
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,277
Hey, why did you hit me? What's wrong with you?

5
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,847
A mosquito. Mosquito, a mosquito.

6
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,077
A mosquito tried to suck your blood.

7
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:42,617
So... I was trying to catch it for you.

8
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:45,557
A mosquito? What mosquito?

9
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:48,037
There. There, there, there.

10
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:49,957
- Where? 
 - Wow.

11
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:52,007
Wow, the weather's so nice.

12
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,217
Oppa, look at the sky.

13
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:55,557
It's not raining today. It's totally different than yesterday.

14
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:57,727
Wow, the wind is so fresh.

15
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:00,367
I need to go out now.

16
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,597
Where's the mosquito?

17
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:04,497
Are there mosquitos here already?

18
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,157
Geez, it hurts.

19
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,017
Why did she hit me so hard?

20
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:13,537
What?

21
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,977
Do Ra! Do Ra!

22
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,807
What's going on, Do Ra? What is it? 
    

23
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,247
Oppa, look over there.

24
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,987
There's a rainbow. There's a rainbow up there!

25
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,997
Wow, you're right.

26
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:30,717
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

27
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,057
I've never seen such a vibrant rainbow.

28
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:35,757
Isn't this so amazing, Oppa?

29
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:38,137
Oppa, what does this mean?

30
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:41,767
I think our drama is going to be a hit!

31
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:45,707
I thought something serious happened because you were screaming loudly.

32
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,657
Wow, I'm seeing a rainbow today, too.

33
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:52,647
This really feels like a totally different world.

34
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,767
I love this place. I love it so much.

35
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,997
Hey, there are no restaurants, coffee shops,

36
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,587
and not a single person here. But you like it?

37
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:03,677
Yes, that's why I like it.

38
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:05,667
You probably don't know how I feel.

39
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,907
I've been like a monkey in a zoo.

40
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:12,467
Just walking around makes people stare and talk.

41
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:16,007
People take pictures of me eating, yawning, or dozing off while

42
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,547
waiting on set without consent.

43
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:20,897
And they say I don't look good in person,

44
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:25,257
I got plastic surgery or some treatment and whatnot. They talk so much.

45
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:29,967
They call me mean and rude if I avoid them because I'm tired.

46
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:36,097
But here, no one looks at me,

47
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:38,917
or takes pictures of me.

48
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,717
It's perfect freedom.

49
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:47,577
It's been so long.

50
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:52,887
I'm free.

51
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,737
I feel alive.

52
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:08,877
By the way, how much do you think an island like this costs?

53
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,537
Why do you ask?

54
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,557
Maybe I'll buy this island,

55
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:16,717
build a cabin and live here after I retire.

56
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,837
You'll have to make a lot of money, then.

57
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:21,777
Right? I should work even harder,

58
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,347
make even more money, buy this island,

59
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,947
and turn this into the Do Ra World.

60
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,457
I can just wear a bikini and go to the beach there,

61
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:31,927
no one would be looking at me.

62
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:33,387
You're so excited.

63
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:36,127
I love it just thinking about it.

64
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,777
By the way, if you want to come,

65
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:46,497
you can.

66
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:50,187
No, thank you. You beat me, trying to catch a mosquito.

67
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,837
Who knows what would happen if I came here?

68
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:57,387
Huh? It's a boat!

69
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,547
A boat is coming! We made it!

70
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:03,307
Excuse me! Over here!

71
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:04,747
Over here! Over here!

72
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:09,037
What? Why did the boat come so early?

73
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,637
They could've come much later.

74
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,657
 The bride next to Chairman Gong was 

75
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:23,597
 that girlfriend who got pregnant and was supposed to marry the student. 

76
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:25,857
 W-What did you say? 

77
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,127
 That... 

78
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,797
 That was my niece-in-law? 

79
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,187
 Y-You mean Ma Ri's mom? 

80
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,537
She fooled us completely after all that.

81
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:43,387
She should've behaved herself, then.

82
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:47,307
She couldn't even manage a child and ruined our family.

83
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:50,147
Aigoo, that bitch.

84
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:52,477
What a cunning bitch.

85
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:58,837
What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do?

86
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,577
Auntie, I'm here.

87
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:15,417
Auntie, I made abalone porridge, your favorite.

88
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,147
I think it turned out pretty tasty.

89
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,997
Here.

90
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:24,357
Eat this and feel better.

91
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,887
I'm sick because of you right now. How dare you make me this?

92
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,207
A-Auntie.

93
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:35,397
I can't eat your porridge because I find it disgusting.

94
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,997
How shameless!

95
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,827
You have no shame.

96
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:39,987
Disgusting?

97
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:42,647
Auntie, why are you doing this to her now?

98
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:46,767
Let it out on me if you want to. Don't do this to her.

99
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:50,977
Honey. Honey!

100
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,147
Who do you think you are?  You have no shame!

101
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,207


102
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,927
Honey, hold on a moment.

103
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,687
I apologize on her behalf.

104
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,117
I'm sorry, Honey.

105
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:07,477
I can no longer put up with this.

106
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,747
I tried to make her feel better somehow,

107
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,267
- but I don't think I can anymore. 
 - Calm down, Honey.

108
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:17,387
I'll talk to her so she doesn't do this again.

109
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:21,107
She's just shocked because Ma Ri lashed out at her the other day.

110
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,387
I think she's irritable since she's also not in good health.

111
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:29,547
I know it isn't easy, but please try to understand just once.

112
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,057
What do you mean to understand just once?

113
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:35,447
How can you say that after seeing what she did to me?

114
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:37,837
What can we do, then?

115
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:41,447
I can't understand you acting like this anymore.

116
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,727
Fine.

117
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:48,387
I'll leave with Ma Ri, then.

118
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:51,787
You should meet someone new, as Auntie said.

119
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:55,357
Either have a baby or get a surrogate mother. Do whatever you want.

120
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:59,047
Honey, how could you say such a thing?

121
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,597
What am I supposed to do if you act like this, too?

122
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:41,137
What wrong could she have done for you to cause a scene like this?

123
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:49,437
I wanted to live a long time with you, Auntie.

124
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:55,647
You should go back to the US now.

125
00:08:56,887 --> 00:09:02,137
Instead, I'll visit you there often.

126
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,667
- Jin Taek. 
 - Let's do that.

127
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,757
Because you keep doing this,

128
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,197
- I have no choice, either. 
 - Jin Taek.

129
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:14,257
I need to tell you something.

130
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:18,007
Okay, go ahead.

131
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,777
It's about your wife, Ma Ri's mom.

132
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:27,477
 No, he wants me to go back just because I threw porridge. 

133
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:31,517
 He'd refuse to see me again if I bring it up without evidence. 

134
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:34,747
 He'd never see me again once he turned his back against me. 

135
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:36,487
What about Soo Yeon?

136
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:39,647
What are you trying to say now?

137
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,727
Never mind.

138
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:50,627
I think I overreacted since I worry too much because of my old age.

139
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:56,357
I gave you two a hard time by only caring about our family.

140
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,977
Auntie.

141
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:01,257
I'm sorry, Jin Taek.

142
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,167
I'll never do that again.

143
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:07,127
I'll apologize to Soo Yeon that I was out of line.

144
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:16,087
You should've been like this sooner.

145
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,057
You know I think of you...

146
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:23,317
as my mother, right?

147
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:25,947
Of course, I do.

148
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:29,317
I won't give you a hard time from now on.

149
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,687
So, go back to work.

150
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:35,827
Would you be okay on your own?

151
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:40,187
Don't be silly. What am I, a child?

152
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,957
Don't worry, and get to work.

153
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:49,517
Okay, I will.

154
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:06,387
Hey, Ms. Jo. Where are you right now?

155
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,647
I'm in Jeju right now.

156
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,247
I came with my family for a vacation.

157
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,007
 Is that so? 

158
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,187
When are you coming back to Seoul?

159
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:16,857
 We're going back the day after tomorrow. 

160
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:20,017
 What is it, by the way, Ms. Gong? 

161
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:23,117
Ms. Jo, I have a favor to ask.

162
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:29,487
You can tell Chairman Gong what you told me last time, right?

163
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:33,037
Me? That's a bit...

164
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:35,697
 Think from my perspective. 

165
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:38,777
Would you just ignore it if it were about your son?

166
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:40,567
 That's true, but... 

167
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,997
He'll believe you because you saw it yourself.

168
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:49,057
So, meet Chairman Gong with me and tell him.

169
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,567
I'm begging you.

170
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,427
 I'm not sure if that'd be okay. 

171
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:55,047
I'll be responsible, okay?

172
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,427
I won't put you in a difficult position. Don't worry.

173
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,877
 Okay, I'll call you when I return. 

174
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:04,587
Okay, thank you, Ms. Jo.

175
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:08,577
Call me as soon as you get back to Seoul, okay?

176
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:19,587
Yes, it'd be better if he heard it from her and found evidence himself.

177
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:22,267
That way, he'll realize what's going on.

178
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:28,107
Mom, it feels so peaceful and nice without Great Aunt.

179
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:32,167
I hope she just goes back to the US.

180
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,687
- Ma Ri. 
 - What?

181
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,567
We've been a mess since she came here.

182
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,477
You're always frowning, too.

183
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:46,607
Your face got really ugly because of her.

184
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:50,757
So, let's tell her to go back to the US.

185
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:53,647
Ma Ri, you can't say stuff like that.

186
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,107
Why not? Do I have to forgive her because she's an elder?

187
00:12:57,107 --> 00:13:01,807
I... I think that's unreasonable.

188
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,757
 Auntie, when did you get back? 

189
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:07,007
I'm coming back just now.

190
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:12,827
I would've picked you up if I knew you were coming home today.

191
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:14,637
Why would you do that?

192
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:17,957
I was just getting an IV treatment and rested a bit.

193
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:21,727
Soo Yeon,

194
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:26,287
thinking about it, I've been too out of line.

195
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:29,127
I'm sorry for causing trouble at home.

196
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:31,207
I apologize.

197
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:35,737
It happened because I'm old and easily worried.

198
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:38,297
I hope you understand.

199
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:41,010
I told Chairman Gong, too.

200
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:44,307
I'll be careful from now on.

201
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,207
Well...

202
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,777
I'm home.

203
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,087
Why are the lights off?

204
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,087
Where's everyone?

205
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,947
Mom. Dad.

206
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,857
Grandma!

207
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,667
She's not here, either.

208
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,707
Where did everyone go this late?

209
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,407
Gosh, you're back, Pil Sung.

210
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,227
I just got back.

211
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:20,027
Where have you all been, by the way?

212
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,257
Dad, why do you have a band-aid on your forehead?

213
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:24,827
You have no idea.

214
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:30,137
He was working as a day laborer at a construction site and he almost died.

215
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,007
We're all coming back from the hospital right now.

216
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,577
What did you say?

217
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:38,087
Dad, you worked at a construction site?

218
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:44,037
Ever since I got fired, I tried to earn money and

219
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:48,370
start a business wearing a suit, but...

220
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,330
I was wrong.

221
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:55,947
Whether it's a warehouse or a construction site,

222
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:58,837
I want to work with my own hands.

223
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:02,417
So, no one should stop me. Not even you, Mom.

224
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,137
I feel too guilty to not work anymore.

225
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,457
I understand what you mean,

226
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:11,877
but working at a warehouse or a construction site at your age is too much.

227
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,647
Yes, Honey. Do something less demanding, at least.

228
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:18,537
What if you get injured again?

229
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:23,617
I thought I'd die from a heart attack when I heard from the hospital.

230
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:27,417
So, look for a different job while resting, okay?

231
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:30,717
No easy and cushy job would wait for me.

232
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:34,387
I should be glad I even got this work in this economy.

233
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,187
And I got injured because I wasn't good at my job

234
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,967
and had no skills. It was a mistake.

235
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:45,217
This won't happen from now on. So please stop, everyone.

236
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,217
Aigoo, goodness gracious.

237
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:52,157
This happened because you've been complaining about money to him.

238
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:55,807
You nag at him just because you have this house, but—

239
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:58,587
Mom, that's not right.

240
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:01,107
Why do you keep blaming her?

241
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,027
Don't you know why I'm doing this?

242
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:12,187
Anyway, don't say anything to me from now on.

243
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:15,577
I'll manage my business myself.

244
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,827
 Oppa! 

245
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:40,347
 Do Ra. 

246
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,057
 Oppa... 

247
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:46,577
 Gosh, you acted tough, but you were a scaredy-cat. 

248
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,777
Why do I keep thinking about Pil Sung?

249
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,107
Why on earth?

250
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,847
By chance...

251
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:04,517
No, no, no... What are you thinking, Park Do Ra?

252
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:08,187
Yes, he was my first love, no matter what.

253
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:12,717
I got confused since I haven't seen him for 15 years. That's right.

254
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:16,657
Park Do Ra, you can't do this to someone you work with.

255
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,987
Get it together, Park Do Ra.

256
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:24,017
Get it together, seriously.

257
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,057
By the way, I wonder what he's up to?

258
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:47,457
   

259
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,407
What?

260
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:57,737
Gosh, why is he so cute?

261
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:01,017
He was cute as a high-schooler, but he's cuter now.

262
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,487
Some kids change for the worse.

263
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:07,547
But Oppa got even more handsome than before.

264
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:09,897
Gosh!

265
00:18:09,897 --> 00:18:12,697
Gosh... Wow, what...

266
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:15,287
What am I doing right now?

267
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,127
Why am I looking at his photos?

268
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:20,597
Why does it matter if he's cute or handsome?

269
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:25,007
Go to sleep, Do Ra. Yes, go to sleep.

270
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,007
Go to sleep.

271
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,207
Go to sleep, Do Ra.

272
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:50,457
 She said you're so romantic and cute.  
    

273
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:55,747
 Women don't just call any men cute. 

274
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:03,337
Is it finally time to give her this necklace?

275
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:11,207
I'm sure she'll be smitten if I give this to her.

276
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,447
President Gong Jin Dan sent this.

277
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,517
- President Gong? 
 - Yes.

278
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:19,967
- Gosh, thank you. 
 - Of course.

279
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,387
Gosh, this is so pretty.

280
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:27,827
Wow, look at the huge gems.

281
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:29,967
Look how shiny they are.

282
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:34,637
Wow! President Gong really spends big, doesn't he?

283
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,717
Do Ra. Do Ra!

284
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:42,437
Gosh, it's so pretty. It's perfect. It suits you so well.

285
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:44,077
You like it, too, right?

286
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:47,957
Yes, it's really pretty.

287
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:50,777
- Do Ra, turn around. 
 - Huh?

288
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:55,777
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

289
00:19:57,087 --> 00:20:00,067
Look, look, look. Isn't it totally your style?

290
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,097
Yes. Well...

291
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,277
By the way, did you buy this?

292
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:06,577
We have something similar to this.

293
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:08,697
Why would I pay money for it?

294
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:11,957
President Gong just sent it with flowers.

295
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:15,677
What? President Gong did?

296
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:18,177
Why would he send me something so expensive?

297
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,517
And why would you accept it?

298
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,977
Return it immediately.

299
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:23,797
I can't accept something so expensive.

300
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,037
Why would you return it?

301
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:29,007
He sent it because he has feelings for you.

302
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:33,447
Don't be like that and try seeing him, Do Ra.

303
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,527
Not because he gave you a necklace.

304
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,907
He really is a good person.

305
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:41,347
Mom, I said I'm not interested in him.

306
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:44,977
Do Ra, I don't want to lose my potential son-in-law to someone else.

307
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,947
You haven't even tried dating him. Why say no?

308
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:53,707
By chance, are you seeing someone behind my back? Is that why?

309
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:55,997
I'm not. That's not why.

310
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:58,857
How could I date someone I'm not even attracted to?

311
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,297
And why would we accept stuff like this when we have money?

312
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,547
Return this immediately.

313
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:05,387
I'm going to the shoot.

314
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:08,937
Wait, Do Ra...

315
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,707
Why does she not like him?

316
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:15,057
She's not seeing anyone, either.

317
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,257
Not just anyone could send a necklace like this.

318
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:21,787
How many men in this country would send her stuff like this?

319
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,437
Seriously.

320
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:29,447
 Did you receive the gift I sent? 

321
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,267
 Did Do Ra like it? 

322
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:35,140
Seriously, what do I do? What am I going to do?

323
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,380
   

324
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:50,700
 Do Ra was so happy to receive your gift. 

325
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:53,707
Of course, she was.

326
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:11,727
Why is Do Ra so pretty?

327
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:17,947
Her eyes spark more than the diamonds.

328
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:29,644
Huh? It's Do Jun.

329
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:32,604
Do Jun!

330
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:36,224
Do Jun, my baby. Have you been well?

331
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:38,474
You're studying hard, right?

332
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:41,204
You're not sick, and you're eating well, too?

333
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:44,064
 You always ask if I'm eating well or studying hard, Noona. 

334
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,234
 What am I, a child? 

335
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,494
You're always a child to me.

336
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:51,294
Do Jun, you know who I'm working so hard for, right?

337
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:54,144
 Of course, I do. That's why... 

338
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:56,474
I'm studying hard today, too.

339
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:59,534
Gosh, my baby.

340
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:02,644
Do Jun, won't you come home during the spring break?

341
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:04,834
I'm dying to see you.

342
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:08,344
 I said I can't go this time. I have a lot of studying to do, too. 

343
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:10,744
There's nothing we can do, then.

344
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:14,894
I'll go to the US as soon as I'm done shooting this drama.

345
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,244
- Okay? 
   - Okay. 

346
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,374
 Don't overwork and take care of yourself. 

347
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:21,294
Okay, Do Jun.

348
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,284
Do Joon, I need to shoot now.

349
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:28,624
Let's talk again later. Bye.

350
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:36,354
Jae Dong, how do I look today?

351
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:38,274
I've been meaning to tell you, actually.

352
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:40,114
You didn't sleep well last night, huh?

353
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:43,614
Is it because you were stranded? Your dark circles are all the way down your chin.

354
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,044
What?

355
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:51,514
I'll talk to the CEO for a moment.

356
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,714
I can't have dark circles.

357
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:57,164
   

358
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,394
Assistant Director Go—

359
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,944
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

360
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:04,564
Give it to me. I'll carry it.

361
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:06,004
I'm really okay.

362
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:07,814
It's no trouble.

363
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,134
What's with Sook Ja?

364
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:19,124
How dare she grab Oppa?

365
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,044
How dare she flirt at work?

366
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,524
Isn't she doing that on purpose?

367
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:27,114
This is a difficult scene. Someone might get injured.

368
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:30,094
- Check the movement pattern closely. 
 - Okay.

369
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,514
Park Do Ra walks angrily here and...

370
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,504
Cha Bong Soo grabs her shoulder.

371
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:38,804
She loses her footing while removing his hand,

372
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:41,474
he holds her, and they roll down here.

373
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:44,484
Their eyes lock and...

374
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,414
and they kiss. That's it.

375
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:50,184
Director Hong!

376
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:54,964
Let me... Let me try this myself.

377
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:57,824
With Assistant Director Go.

378
00:24:57,824 --> 00:25:00,974
We're just checking the movement. You don't have to.

379
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:03,094
We'll rehearse with Bong Soo later.

380
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,114
Rehearsal is one thing.

381
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:09,514
It'd be good to learn the movement myself since it's a difficult scene.

382
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:13,084
I have to do this without a body double, anyway.

383
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:16,424
Wow, the passion and motivation.

384
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:20,284
This is why she's a pro. Seriously.

385
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:22,974
Wow, this will turn out well!

386
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,614
Hold on, Honey. Listen to me for a second.

387
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,954
- Let go! 
 - She falls while moving his hand, and he holds her.

388
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:32,744
Cut. Okay.

389
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,314
Is the rope ready?

390
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,634
We're rehearsing the rolling scene.

391
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:41,834
- Ms. Park, are you sure you'd be okay? 
 - Yes.

392
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,784
We'll roll just a little bit, okay?

393
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:46,044
Okay. Rehearsal, cue.

394
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
Be careful.

395
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,794
O-Oppa.

396
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:04,224
O-Oppa, wake up, please?

397
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:07,374
Director Hong!

398
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:09,384
Director Hong! Jae Dong!

399
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:12,644
911! Call 911!

400
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:16,834
Oppa, Oppa, wake up!

401
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:20,834
Oppa, you can't die.

402
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:24,194
Open your eyes, Oppa!

403
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:29,724
Oppa!

404
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:33,334
Well, Ms. Park.

405
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,384
Stop yelling.

406
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:38,194
I'm about to go deaf, okay?

407
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:49,564
I... I was too absorbed in the scene.

408
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:52,574
I thought it was real.

409
00:26:52,574 --> 00:27:00,204
S-So, I guess I thought I was with Bong Soo Oppa for a moment.

410
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:03,714
Let's take a little break.

411
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm too emotional because I got too sucked in.

412
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:12,734
This is... This is why she's a great actor. Wow.

413
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:15,574
This is why!

414
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,134
I must've lost my mind.

415
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,754
What did I do in front of all those people?

416
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,824
So embarrassing. So embarrassing...

417
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,244
Noona, you know—

418
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:29,514
What? Did people say something about me?

419
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:33,254
By chance, are you seeing Cha Bong Soo behind my back?

420
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,104
You don't like him, do you?

421
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:38,104
What kind of nonsense is that?

422
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:41,594
Don't add to the nonsense and...

423
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:44,074
just get me some ice cream so I can cool down.

424
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,664
Okay. Ice cream.

425
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:50,294
What did he say about Cha Bong Soo?

426
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,584
Gosh, you can't be serious.

427
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:59,124
No, that's for the better.

428
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:02,384
Because people won't think it's Pil Sung.

429
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:11,214
And it's normal for an actor to get emotional during a scene.

430
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:17,524
No one noticed, right?

431
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:22,324
Gosh, I must be crazy. What's wrong with me?

432
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:28,784
Mom, what kind of nonsense is all this right now?

433
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:30,194
That's what I'm saying.

434
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:34,034
Your brother wants to continue the bloodline by getting a son-in-law,

435
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:37,104
and Aunt wants to get a surrogate mother or a mistress to have a successor.

436
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:39,154
They were fighting about that.

437
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:45,224
But for some reason, Auntie backed down quietly. She must be plotting something.

438
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,484
Aigoo, don't worry about it. Who cares what they do?

439
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:50,064
How could I not worry?

440
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:51,604
It's so annoying.

441
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,334
My pride is hurt, too.

442
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:55,754
Why are they doing this when we have you?

443
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:57,704
You're the son of the Gong family.

444
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:00,574
Mom, don't worry, I said.

445
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:04,084
You think Hyung would have a baby somewhere? Huh?

446
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:07,054
And even if he does,

447
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:11,004
it'd take too long for them to raise that baby.

448
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:13,484
And he wants a son-in-law?

449
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:19,234
- Mom, how could Ma Ri end up with someone normal? 
 - That's what I'm saying.

450
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:23,544
That's why APP Group has to end up with me.

451
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,714
There's no reason for us to get desperate.

452
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:28,844
I have to be Hyung's successor.

453
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:30,914
I'm the only Gong except for him.

454
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:32,944
You're right. You're right.

455
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:36,764
By the way, who's the woman you said you were dating?

456
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:38,814
I'm dying to know.

457
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:43,384
Gosh, I told you to wait a bit. We're almost there.

458
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:48,314
So, tell me before I lose patience and find out.

459
00:29:48,314 --> 00:29:51,004
Which family is she from? Huh?

460
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:55,824
Mom, you know Park Do Ra, right? Park Do Ra.

461
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:57,660
Park Do Ra?

462
00:29:58,244 --> 00:30:00,724
Whose daughter is she? Which group is it?

463
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:03,734
Gosh, I mean Park Do Ra, the actor.

464
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:05,724
You watched "Let the Strong Wind Blow," right?

465
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:07,364
Park Do Ra, the lead of that drama.

466
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:09,364
You watched that with me.

467
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:11,624
What? That Park Do Ra?

468
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:14,614
Hey, are you dating some actress right now?

469
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:16,904
Are you crazy? You can't.

470
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:19,314
What if your brother or aunt found out?

471
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:20,724
They look down on you already.

472
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:23,484
You won't get Angel Investment, not to mention the APP Group.

473
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:25,384
You can't. I won't let you, okay?

474
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:26,954
Break up with her before others find out.

475
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:29,814
Mom, don't say stuff like that.

476
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:34,114
I've never met a woman like her in my life.

477
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:36,794
So, you'd better play ignorant this time.

478
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,244
It has to be that woman.

479
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:46,854
You're shooting in the afternoon tomorrow. I'll come then.

480
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,984
Okay, thank you. See you.

481
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:51,644
Bye.

482
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,234
Who's this?

483
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,504
I don't recognize this number.

484
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,134
Hello?

485
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:17,014
 This is actor Ms. Park Do Ra's phone, right? 

486
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:20,854
Yes, it is. Who's this?

487
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:23,534
 I'm President Gong Jin Dan's mom. 

488
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,964
Pardon?

489
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:29,604
Let me be straightforward with you.

490
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:33,284
Break up with my Jin Dan. You can never be together.

491
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:35,364
Pardon?

492
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:37,414
What do you mean by that?

493
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:42,144
My gosh, why don't you understand Korean when you're Korean?

494
00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:44,924
I'm asking you to let my Jin Dan go.

495
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:48,984
We can never allow him to date some actress.

496
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:53,694
Gosh, looks like you're mistaken.

497
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:57,244
I'm not in that kind of relationship with President Gong.

498
00:31:57,244 --> 00:32:02,514
You're greatly mistaken if this is about us seeing the musical together.

499
00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:05,314
President Gong invited me and...

500
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:09,564
I went because I was thankful he invested in our drama.

501
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:12,274
Nothing else happened except for that.

502
00:32:12,274 --> 00:32:13,784
Is that true?

503
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:15,794
Are you sure nothing else happened?

504
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:21,234
Yes, I'm not interested in President Gong romantically at all.

505
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:24,654
- Not even a tiny bit? 
 - Not even a tiny bit.

506
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:25,954
You're sure, right?

507
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:30,784
Yes. I'm not in a position to break up or not.

508
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:38,154
I'm not sure why I should be told this right now.

509
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,664
I'll get going now.

510
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,914
And...

511
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:57,494
I don't think you should look down on someone because of their profession.

512
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:04,454
Gosh, what a cheeky little thing.

513
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:09,544
What is it now, Mom? I'm busy.

514
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:11,034
What happened?

515
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:13,304
Park Do Ra says she's not interested in you at all.

516
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:15,674
She said all you did was see a musical together because you invited her.

517
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:20,504
You crazy bastard. Why waste time on a woman when she's not interested?

518
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:22,774
Mom, did you see Park Do Ra?

519
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:25,024
Yes, I told her not to see you.

520
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:26,324
I told her to break up with you.

521
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:28,014
And she said she's not interested.

522
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:29,734
Why did you do that?

523
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:33,034
Who said you could see Do Ra?

524
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:35,504
Huh? Where are you going right now?

525
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,174
Are you going to see that girl again?

526
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:39,534
She says she doesn't like you!

527
00:33:42,074 --> 00:33:46,054
Do Ra, I heard you met my mom.

528
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:47,774
I'm so sorry.

529
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:50,614
You must've been stunned because of her.

530
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,214
Yes.

531
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:58,464
She thought you and I were dating.

532
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:00,484
We're not like that.

533
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:05,124
So, I told her that I'm not interested in you romantically at all.

534
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:07,174
What do you mean?

535
00:34:08,024 --> 00:34:10,774
I thought we were getting started.

536
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:12,294
Pardon?

537
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:16,694
What do you mean, President Gong?

538
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:18,624
When did we...

539
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:21,804
I never thought that even once.

540
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:30,114
I'm a bit shocked.

541
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:36,894
If so, why did you see a musical with me

542
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:40,204
and accept the necklace I sent?

543
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:44,794
You told your mother that you think I'm a good man and praised me.

544
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:48,184
That's why I thought you were interested in me.

545
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:55,344
I did think you were a good person,

546
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,504
but not in a romantic way.

547
00:34:57,504 --> 00:35:01,594
I just thought of you as a CEO who invested in our drama.

548
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:04,264
And the musical...

549
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:10,944
My mom suddenly got an upset stomach.

550
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:13,664
So, I had no choice but to see it with you alone.

551
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:16,804
I didn't think of it as a date.

552
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:19,084
And I told my mom to return the necklace.

553
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,984
So, I thought she returned it to you.

554
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:26,334
I'll check again if you haven't received it.

555
00:35:30,104 --> 00:35:35,774
I'm sorry if I mistakenly led you on.

556
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:37,334
So...

557
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:42,194
you mean I've been imagining things on my own?

558
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:44,444
I'll be careful from now on, too.

559
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,354
I hope this doesn't happen again.

560
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:51,404
I'll get going now.

561
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:03,594
Gosh, why return something so pretty?

562
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:08,934
I'll make sure Do Ra and President Gong end up together. No matter what.

563
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,904
That way, I could survive.

564
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:25,024
Yes, it's me.

565
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:29,514
What? All the members are there?

566
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,934
Make a decision.

567
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,554
Three.

568
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:54,024
- Call. 
 - Three. Call.

569
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:58,024
Boss, please show your cards.

570
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:04,154
Straight.

571
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:05,744
Here we go.

572
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:07,824
Flush. Win.

573
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,980
Here.

574
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:26,364
Brother, when did I ever wear fake ones?

575
00:37:26,364 --> 00:37:28,744
Stop touching it and give me money right now.

576
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:31,104
Okay, I'll get it for you now.

577
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:50,144
Baek Mi Ja...

578
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:54,024
Can you really call yourself a human?

579
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,124
Gosh...

580
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:59,324
After losing all that money,

581
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,994
why would you come back here? My goodness...

582
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:06,214
This hand. Do I need to cut it off?

583
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:08,744
What should I do with this?

584
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,884
I lost the rest of Do Ra's pay.

585
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:14,194
How could I pay the interest next month?

586
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:17,674
What do I do?

587
00:38:28,714 --> 00:38:31,204
Hey, D-Do Ra. What is it?

588
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:32,964
Mom, where are you?

589
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:34,344
Me?

590
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:37,904
I'm out to see a friend. Why?

591
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:41,565
Didn't you return the necklace to President Gong?

592
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:44,625
Well, I-I have it. I have it.

593
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,685
Why? I-I've been a bit busy.

594
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:48,805
I told you to return it immediately.

595
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,815
Why didn't you return it yet?

596
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:55,225
Because you didn't, they mistook me, and even his mom came to see me.

597
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:57,145
What?

598
00:38:57,145 --> 00:39:00,955
President Gong's mom came to see you? Why?

599
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:04,365
She told me to break up with him, thinking we were dating.

600
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:07,005
She told me to get lost.

601
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:10,105
Why do I have to hear that from his mom?

602
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:13,485
D-Do Ra, so what did you tell her?

603
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,995
What do you think?

604
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,295
I said I'm not interested in him at all

605
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:20,185
and I made it clear that there was nothing going on.

606
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:23,865
So you'd better return that necklace quickly, okay?

607
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:26,365
H-Hey, D-Do... Do...

608
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:30,775
What do I do?  What do I do?

609
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:32,915
What do I do?

610
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:38,455
It's President Gong. Gosh. 
    

611
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:40,065
This is...

612
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,085
What do I do?

613
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:50,365
President Baek, what happened, exactly?

614
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:53,335
 He's calling me "President Baek" instead of "Mother" now. 

615
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:55,325
 He must be really upset. 

616
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:56,955
 What do I do? 

617
00:39:56,955 --> 00:40:00,185
 No, Baek Mi Ja. Stay alert. 

618
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:03,205
 Even if you get dragged into a tiger cave, you can survive by staying alert. 

619
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:05,675
President Gong, the thing is—

620
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:09,765
You told me that Do Ra was interested in me, too.

621
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:12,005
But she said she wasn't.

622
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:14,675
She says she's not interested in me at all.

623
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:18,385
I heard she asked you to return the necklace, too.

624
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:26,305
That's why you shouldn't have let your mother go meet Do Ra.

625
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:27,425
Pardon?

626
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,525
Do Ra has never been involved in a scandal.

627
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:34,065
As you know, since she's proud and strict to herself,

628
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,465
she doesn't easily fall for anyone.

629
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:42,465
But she went to see a musical with you alone.

630
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:48,015
In my opinion, she did have feelings for you.

631
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:51,105
If only your mother didn't flip out today,

632
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:57,845
I'm sure Do Ra would've opened up herself more to you.

633
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,965
If so, is it because of my mother—

634
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:06,515
My Do Ra is an A-list actor in the country. A-list.

635
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:09,025
Try thinking from her perspective.

636
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:12,415
She has a lot of pride. Imagine how hurt she must've been.

637
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:14,565
How devastated she must've been?

638
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:19,275
Even I feel so disappointed with you now.

639
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:24,435
I'm sorry. T-That didn't cross my mind at all.

640
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:27,095
Could you tell Do Ra...

641
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:30,725
What do I do now?

642
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:38,765
I think it'd only backfire if you apologize now.

643
00:41:39,805 --> 00:41:43,045
Why don't you wait a bit for now?

644
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:47,655
I'll try to persuade Do Ra this time, too.

645
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:49,815
Could you really do that?

646
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:51,485
Thank you, Mother.

647
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:53,965
I'm indebted to you again.

648
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:58,555
Right, by the way, the necklace...

649
00:41:58,555 --> 00:42:05,285
Let's just say you got it back for now.

650
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:11,555
I'll give it to Do Ra once she feels better.

651
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:13,495
Oh, okay, okay.

652
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:17,755
My mother will not be seeing her again.

653
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:22,325
So, please don't be angry and forgive me just once.

654
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:24,115
I beg you, Mother.

655
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:30,505
Gosh, seriously. I'm so upset right now.

656
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:35,905
 Gosh, that was a close one. Seriously. 

657
00:42:41,065 --> 00:42:45,025
Do Ra, Do Ra, drink this before you go.

658
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:46,735
What's this?

659
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:51,935
I made honey tea with pear, jujube, and bellflower root. Drink up. Drink up.

660
00:42:53,765 --> 00:42:58,025
Oh, right. You returned the necklace President Gong gave me, right?

661
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:02,245
Yes, I gave it back. You told me to.

662
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,935
Do Ra, I'm telling you this for your sake.

663
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:12,215
Consider him seriously just once.

664
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,925
It's not just because he's a chaebol's son.

665
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,715
He really is a good person.

666
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:18,175
He really likes you sincerely.

667
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:20,285
He'd care for you for the rest of his life, too.

668
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:23,425
So, just once. Just once.

669
00:43:23,425 --> 00:43:29,125
Mom, I'll date someone I'm naturally drawn to.

670
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:33,395
So don't mention President Gong to me from now on. Okay?

671
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:36,015
I'm going to work.

672
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,085
Gosh, you little...

673
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:46,115
She'll date someone she's naturally drawn to?

674
00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:49,225
Gosh, is she seeing someone?

675
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:53,055
Could it be Cha Bong Soo?

676
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:57,575
Is Do Ra seeing someone by chance?

677
00:43:57,575 --> 00:44:00,825
Is she seeing someone? No, no. I don't think so.

678
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:02,205
Really?

679
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:05,025
How about Cha Bong Soo, then?

680
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:08,995
People flirt when they shoot a romance. Anything like that?

681
00:44:08,995 --> 00:44:13,035
Things are better now, but they were enemies in the beginning.

682
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:15,015
It's probably not Cha Bong Soo.

683
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:17,465
There's no way, in my opinion.

684
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,535
Really?

685
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:22,535
President Baek, I need to go before her shoot ends.

686
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,215
Okay, okay. You should go. You should go.

687
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:30,635
Jae Dong, you need to keep a close tab on her, okay?

688
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,995
I will.

689
00:44:31,995 --> 00:44:34,275
- Good luck today. 
 - Thank you.

690
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:39,585
Mom, you've been quiet for a while. What's going on now?

691
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:42,045
She's not a child anymore. Just leave her alone.

692
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:44,555
So what if she's dating someone?

693
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:48,575
Hey, we're about to become in-laws with APP Group.

694
00:44:48,575 --> 00:44:51,645
We're about to hit the jackpot right now. But you want me to do nothing?

695
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:54,425
You think we'd get another chance like this?

696
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:58,895
So, you're saying the chaebol, President Gong Jin Dan, likes Do Ra?

697
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:01,005
Hello.

698
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:13,265
How did Pil Sung turn out so well?

699
00:45:13,265 --> 00:45:15,695
Why is he so handsome?

700
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:22,155
Oh, my! What are you doing? You decided not to do this.

701
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:24,465
Get it together, Park Do Ra.

702
00:45:26,905 --> 00:45:30,965
Yes, I was so scared on the deserted island

703
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:34,165
that I was relying on him. That's why I'm like this.

704
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:38,425
Because of the pure memories of the 12-year-old Park Do Ra.

705
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:41,975
Park Do Ra, keep your eyes peeled and watch carefully.

706
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:44,775
That curly-haired man isn't handsome at all.

707
00:45:46,595 --> 00:45:48,005
Are you okay?

708
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:50,265
Yes, I'm okay. It's a small cut.

709
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:52,055
Hold on. I have an ointment and a band-aid.

710
00:45:52,055 --> 00:45:55,265
- Really? Let me do it. 
 - No, your hands are dirty.

711
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:11,695
Director!

712
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:17,615
Assistant Director Go...

713
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:18,935
Yes, me?

714
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:21,615
I need to talk to you about something.

715
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:24,085
Could we chat for a second?

716
00:46:25,145 --> 00:46:27,905
Oh, okay. Thank you.

717
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:34,715
What's going on? Is something wrong?

718
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:37,685
The thing is...

719
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,915
You know...

720
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:45,615
I couldn't sleep a wink because I kept thinking about the tteokbokki from last time.

721
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:48,565
So, could you take me there again today?

722
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:51,895
As you know, I can't just go alone.

723
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:56,815
Did you scream at the top of your lungs to tell me that?

724
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,875
Gosh, was I that loud?

725
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:03,815
Yes, you screamed. I thought something happened.

726
00:47:03,815 --> 00:47:05,217
I'm sorry.

727
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:09,345
I must've been loud because I was wearing headphones.

728
00:47:09,345 --> 00:47:12,795
Anyway, you're going with me because the shoot ends early today, okay?

729
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:14,465
Okay.

730
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:22,605
Park Do Ra, why did you suddenly mention tteokbokki?

731
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,135
Why do I care if Sook Ja puts an ointment or a band-aid on him?

732
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:26,975
What does that have to do with me?

733
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,095
Why did I yell his name so loudly?

734
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:39,545
Okay. Just eat tteokbokki...

735
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:42,417
and get over your feelings from the deserted island

736
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:47,935
and the 12-year-old Park Do Ra's feelings... completely.

737
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:50,905
Chairman, you're having lunch with Chairman Kim at 12.

738
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:52,565
Oh, okay.

739
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:58,465
- Let me help you! 
 - You go ahead.

740
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:00,845
Pil Sung.

741
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:04,575
Oh, hello, Chairman.

742
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:07,955
I heard there will be a shoot here today.

743
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,565
I didn't know it was yours.

744
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:12,035
Yes. We're done, so we're putting things away now.

745
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:13,685
Is that so?

746
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:16,375
Why don't we have some tea since you're here?

747
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,285
Are you available?

748
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,485
Yes, that should work.

749
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:25,895
You were in high school when your grandfather passed, right?

750
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:30,965
Yes, I was grateful that you came to the funeral.

751
00:48:32,195 --> 00:48:37,905
You were a kid then and grew up to be a nice young man.

752
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:40,885
That's why I was so surprised the last time I saw you.

753
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,825
I only knew because my wife told me.

754
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:45,295
I didn't recognize you at all at first.

755
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:49,325
- I did grow a lot, didn't I? 
 - Yes, you did.

756
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:52,495
How did you grow so tall?

757
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:55,115
My mom actually cooked meat for me every day.

758
00:48:55,115 --> 00:48:58,585
She said I need to eat well to be healthy, and I need to be healthy to study hard.

759
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,545
So I had meat, fruit, and milk every day.

760
00:49:01,545 --> 00:49:05,005
And at some point, the ground seemed to be getting further away.

761
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:08,055
What? The ground seemed further away?

762
00:49:08,055 --> 00:49:11,715
So I told my mom, "Mom, the ground looks so far away!"

763
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,035
And she laughed a lot.

764
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,965
Gosh, you're so funny.

765
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,485
Drink.

766
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:31,355
I could run into her anytime, anywhere. Will I avoid her every time?

767
00:49:31,355 --> 00:49:34,505
No, I should straighten things out...

768
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,835
and take care of things the right way.

769
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:43,135
Yes, and no woman would say no to a designer purse.

770
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,285
Life gets difficult once a woman gets resentful.

771
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:57,425
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

772
00:50:00,275 --> 00:50:02,185
 It happened last time, too. Why is it happening again? 

773
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:05,605
 Why do I keep finding her pretty? 

774
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,045
 What's the deal? 

775
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,575
 Did my eyesight get bad? 

776
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:15,655
Excuse me.

777
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:18,345
L-Let's talk for a second.

778
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:19,755
Why me?

779
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:21,935
Do you know me?

780
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,765
Don't be like that, and let's talk for a second.

781
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:27,535
Excuse me, can't you tell I'm working right now?

782
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:30,355
Please leave if you won't order.

783
00:50:34,045 --> 00:50:36,525
Could I have a cappuccino?

784
00:50:45,665 --> 00:50:47,115
Bye, see you tomorrow.

785
00:50:47,115 --> 00:50:49,565
Aren't you going to work here today?

786
00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:53,725
Since someone annoying is here today,

787
00:50:53,725 --> 00:50:56,405
I'm afraid my writing would suck, too.

788
00:50:57,215 --> 00:50:59,955
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you.

789
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:05,385
E-Excuse me, Noonim. Hold on. Talk to me for a second, please.

790
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:08,215
Why? What would you say?

791
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:11,035
Why are you doing this to me? Seriously.

792
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,855
Well, here.

793
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,755
What's this?

794
00:51:16,755 --> 00:51:19,695
You know this, right? Louis Vuitton.

795
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:26,155
I thought I hurt you too much.

796
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:30,115
I wanted to end things on a good note.

797
00:51:30,115 --> 00:51:33,705
Just think of it as a band-aid for your wound.

798
00:51:33,705 --> 00:51:35,305
Here.

799
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:41,205
You really are a bastard, aren't you?

800
00:51:41,205 --> 00:51:44,615
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

801
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:47,065
Understand? You piece of trash.

802
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:49,455
Excuse me, hold on.

803
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:52,247
The thing is...

804
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:57,145
I've always been rejected or dumped, but

805
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:59,815
I never made a woman cry in my life.

806
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:03,895
But I thought I hurt you too much. I...

807
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:05,845
I felt too bad about that, so...

808
00:52:05,845 --> 00:52:08,235
Can't you accept my apology? Please?

809
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:11,405
Gosh, what's this piece of trash saying?

810
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:14,897
Wait...

811
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:18,165
Gosh, it hurts.

812
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:35,105
Here's black tea.

813
00:52:35,105 --> 00:52:36,805
Thank you.

814
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:44,455
The color of the tea is so nice.

815
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,635
It smells so good, too.

816
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:52,095
Thank you for everything, Honey.

817
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,265
You forgave Aunt, too.

818
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:59,945
She's like a mother to you. I had no choice.

819
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:02,565
I know you would've cried if I didn't.

820
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:05,725
Cry? What am I, a child?

821
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:13,065
Auntie promised me not to give you...

822
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,585
a hard time from now on.

823
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:20,515
Okay, don't work too hard.

824
00:53:20,515 --> 00:53:22,125
Oh, right.

825
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:27,305
I saw Pil Sung earlier today.

826
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,445
What did you say? Why would you see him?

827
00:53:31,445 --> 00:53:34,585
Why are you so shocked about that?

828
00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:37,575
Am I not supposed to see him?

829
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:41,815
N-No, it's not like that, but...

830
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:46,385
Why... How did you get to see him?

831
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:48,195
Did you reach out to him first?

832
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:52,105
No, I didn't. I don't even have his phone number.

833
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:55,305
I just ran into him.

834
00:53:55,305 --> 00:53:57,815
I guess he filmed in front of our building today.

835
00:53:57,815 --> 00:54:00,455
So, I had tea with him since I was happy to see him.

836
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:02,665
Oh, I see.

837
00:54:04,585 --> 00:54:09,155
By the way, he seems like a nice fellow.

838
00:54:09,155 --> 00:54:11,935
The more I see him, the more I like him.

839
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:15,255
Oh, really?

840
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:19,915
Since we're on the topic, Honey...

841
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:25,635
What do you think of him as Ma Ri's significant other?

842
00:54:28,405 --> 00:54:30,915
W-What did you say?

843
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:02,955
What is this, a runway?

844
00:55:02,955 --> 00:55:06,325
He's walking down the street, but why does he look so handsome?

845
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:11,035
And how did his legs get so long?

846
00:55:11,035 --> 00:55:13,805
Is he really the Dae Chung I knew?

847
00:55:13,805 --> 00:55:17,355
He has a better physique than a model.

848
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:24,525
 Park Do Ra, you came here to eat tteokbokki. 

849
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:28,145
 Don't be confused with 12-year-old Park Do Ra anymore. 

850
00:55:28,145 --> 00:55:30,695
 Just think about the tteokbokki. 

851
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:33,115
 Just think about the fish cake. 

852
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:36,455
Let's go.

853
00:55:38,865 --> 00:55:40,385
Okay.

854
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:49,745
What? They're closed today.

855
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:51,845
Geez, I should've called them earlier.

856
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:53,925
We came here for no reason.

857
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,885
Do Ra, I'll pick some up when we're shooting in the afternoon.

858
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:58,705
It's disappointing, but we should get going.

859
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:02,725
Oppa, we came this far. It'd be a shame to just leave.

860
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:04,815
Let's get some fish cake somewhere, at least.

861
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:07,715
- I'm hungry. 
 - Okay, let's.

862
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:18,635
Wow, the broth is so nice.

863
00:56:18,635 --> 00:56:20,175
I feel so relaxed.

864
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:21,875
It's really nice.

865
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:25,815
Oppa, should we get soju?

866
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:29,595
- Can you drink? 
 - I'm not shooting tomorrow.

867
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,395
A glass or two is fine.

868
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:36,215
And I don't normally get to have fish cake soup and soju at a snack bar.

869
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:40,865
I haven't been somewhere like this in a long time except when I was filming.

870
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:45,475
And there aren't many customers, either.

871
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:48,525
Okay, just one bottle, then.

872
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:53,505
Ma'am, we'll have a soju, eel, and odolbbyeo  (spicy stir-fried pork soft bone) .

873
00:56:53,505 --> 00:56:55,045
Okay.

874
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,295
Eel and odolbbyeo?

875
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:59,415
I love that.

876
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,605
My heart is racing.

877
00:57:01,605 --> 00:57:04,105
- What? Your heart is racing? 
 - Yes.

878
00:57:04,105 --> 00:57:07,995
You're probably the only woman whose heart races about that stuff.

879
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,905
Here you go.

880
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:22,675
Thank you.

881
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:25,485
Boom.

882
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,485
Cheers.

883
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:46,815
Oppa, I'm in an amazing mood right now.

884
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:50,695
This reminds me of the old days.

885
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:53,155
I'm so happy.

886
00:57:53,155 --> 00:57:56,415
I love the ambiance here.

887
00:57:56,415 --> 00:58:00,895
You're happy to have soju and eel at a shabby snack bar like this?

888
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:03,425
You must've been to all sorts of nice places.

889
00:58:03,425 --> 00:58:04,825
Expensive and nice restaurants.

890
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:10,405
No, I don't know how to explain it, but...

891
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:14,505
I feel somehow free.

892
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:19,135
Thank you, Oppa.

893
00:58:19,135 --> 00:58:22,095
For drinking soju at a place like this with me.

894
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:27,695
I think I've been very frustrated all this time.

895
00:58:31,865 --> 00:58:36,905
You have to drink soju at a snack bar like this.

896
00:58:36,905 --> 00:58:39,215
It tastes so sweet.

897
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,055
Oppa, another bottle?

898
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:43,665
No, no. We drank enough already.

899
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:48,605
No, it's okay. I'm not drunk at all.

900
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:50,905
Are you drunk?

901
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:52,925
No.

902
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:55,375
I'm not drunk at all.

903
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:58,455
Ma'am, we'll have another bottle of soju.

904
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:00,005
Another bottle, please.

905
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:02,155
Cheers.

906
00:59:16,545 --> 00:59:19,105
By the way, Oppa,

907
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:22,965
don't you have a girlfriend?

908
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:26,695
I've been observing you, Oppa.

909
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:32,195
You either shoot or go to the broadcasting station on the weekdays

910
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:36,065
and you seem to go there on your days off, too.

911
00:59:37,405 --> 00:59:40,895
Your girlfriend must not like that, no?

912
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:45,245
Hey, how could I have a girlfriend?

913
00:59:45,245 --> 00:59:47,425
I have no time to date.

914
00:59:47,425 --> 00:59:49,895
I'm busy enough to just work.

915
00:59:49,895 --> 00:59:53,445
I have to prepare for the shoot on set and run errands.

916
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:57,245
I have to keep you satisfied, and keep Bong Soo satisfied, too.

917
00:59:57,245 --> 01:00:00,315
And I have to look into all sorts of things.

918
01:00:00,315 --> 01:00:04,465
I go to work when I get up, and it's 10 at night when I get home.

919
01:00:04,465 --> 01:00:10,775
 I suppose. He has no time to date when he works day and night. 

920
01:00:13,335 --> 01:00:14,845
Do you...

921
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,205
know what my dream is?

922
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,905
I'll debut as a director...

923
01:00:21,905 --> 01:00:25,655
and make a drama that gets the whole country excited.

924
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,195
That's why "Straightforward Romance" needs to be a hit.

925
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:29,955
That way, I could debut as a director.

926
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:32,345
So stop asking me silly questions.

927
01:00:32,345 --> 01:00:36,705
Because my only interest is to make "Straightforward Romance" a hit.

928
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:39,785
Wow.

929
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:42,815
Your passion is solely for the project.

930
01:00:42,815 --> 01:00:44,265
Passion!

931
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:50,405
On that note, I'll give you the rest of the soju.

932
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:52,155
- Here. 
 - Okay.

933
01:00:52,155 --> 01:00:57,855
You should continue to only focus on work from now on, okay?

934
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,595
Okay.

935
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:01,805
Just work, okay?

936
01:01:07,735 --> 01:01:09,265
 Noona! 

937
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:12,165
 Don't forget what I said! 

938
01:01:14,075 --> 01:01:15,525
 It's just for a year! 

939
01:01:15,525 --> 01:01:18,165
 We'll be together in a year! 

940
01:01:18,165 --> 01:01:20,315
 Noona! 

941
01:01:23,085 --> 01:01:28,815
Oppa, by the way, on my way here...

942
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:32,575
I noticed Sol Hair Salon was still there.

943
01:01:32,575 --> 01:01:36,005
How did things go with Jeong Mi?

944
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:39,665
Did you see her again after that?

945
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:44,475
Jeong Mi...

946
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,575
Noona?

947
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:58,385
 He's kicking. He's kicking. 

948
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:01,455
 Wow, he's so strong. My gosh. 

949
01:02:01,455 --> 01:02:03,665
 Come out soon. 

950
01:02:15,795 --> 01:02:17,525
 What? 

951
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:25,205
 An acceptance letter and a resident ID? 

952
01:02:25,205 --> 01:02:28,395
 There are so many weirdos. 

953
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:51,737
   

954
01:02:56,497 --> 01:03:04,627


955
01:03:07,795 --> 01:03:10,235
Oppa, are you crying?

956
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:17,745
Are you still so upset about saying goodbye to Jeong Mi?

957
01:03:17,745 --> 01:03:20,705
How could I not tear up about that?

958
01:03:21,955 --> 01:03:25,905
We promised to meet again when I get accepted

959
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:29,205
to a college and become an adult.

960
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:34,035
I ran into her when she was pregnant with

961
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:37,145
twins on the street like that.

962
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:41,125
You'd tear up, too. Wouldn't you?

963
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:44,325
Thinking about that day now...

964
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:50,185
is tearing my heart in pieces.

965
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,275
A heartbreak.

966
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,055
The clock of my youth...

967
01:03:57,995 --> 01:04:01,195
was stopped that day.

968
01:04:03,395 --> 01:04:05,475
Give me a break.

969
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,585

The clock of youth stopped?

Your heart is tearing in pieces?

972
01:04:12,775 --> 01:04:14,655
Are you writing a pop song right now?

973
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:18,905
Hey, do you understand love?

974
01:04:18,905 --> 01:04:24,905
Do you understand a heart-wrenching love like that?

975
01:04:28,905 --> 01:04:30,965
Noona,

976
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:38,665
age isn't important when it comes to a beautiful romance.

977
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:40,975
Yes, that's right.

 If Jin Taek hears about that cunning thing's past from Ms. Jo,

 Did you see who put this on my back?

 I've been hinting at the fact that I like you countless times,
