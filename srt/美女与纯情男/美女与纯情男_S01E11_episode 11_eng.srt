1
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:56,110


2
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,940
What...

3
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,420
W-What are you doing right now?

4
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,810
What did you do to my lips?

5
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,130
Why would you ask?

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,380
You're embarrassing me.

7
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,230
   

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,310
You do whatever you want. You could get sued!

9
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,060
Yes, sue me if you want.

10
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,090
But they probably won't accept the case.

11
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,210
Because I didn't do it alone. We did it together.

12
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,310
W-What do you mean we did it together?

13
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,180
Wow, you're so unbelievable.

14
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,230
I wasn't thinking and didn't do anything, and you did it all by yourself.

15
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,030
Oppa, you weren't thinking and didn't do anything?

16
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,550
You were 0.0001mm close to me as if you'd kiss me.

17
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,360
Gosh, seriously.

18
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,400
What are you, a turtle?

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,080
I just did it because you were approaching me too slowly.

20
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,060
You should be thanking me instead.

21
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,540
W-What did you say?

22
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,160
Wow, she's framing me and writing a novel now.

23
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,610
When did I get as close as 0.0001mm from you?

24
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,590
Oppa, try to be honest.

25
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,030
Your heart was racing earlier because you liked me.

26
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,530
Do you know how loud your heartbeat was?

27
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,610
And your eyes were fired up as if you'd eat me alive.

28
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,780
What was with those eyes?

29
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,100
I can't believe you're framing me like this.

30
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,710
Are you blaming me after stealing a kiss from me?

31
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,370
What? I looked at you as if I'd eat you alive?

32
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,190
What are you, a rabbit? Why would I eat you alive?

33
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,870
Whatever.

34
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,310
I'm letting this slide because we need to finish "Straightforward Romance" without issues.

35
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,190
But if you steal a kiss from me again,

36
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,320
there's no "Straightforward Romance" or anything, then. Got it?

37
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,520
How much longer will you hide your feelings, Oppa?

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,450
You came here because of me.

39
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,290
Because I was meeting with President Gong.

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,230
You got jealous because I was with another man.

41
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,570
Because you like me.

42
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,620
I definitely said it wasn't like that.

43
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,610
I was in the area because of work.

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,380
So, don't interpret it the way you want.

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,040
For work?

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,610
Yeah, right. You expect me to believe that?

47
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,060
I know for sure now.

48
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,850
That he likes me, too.

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,350
What?

50
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,770
What kind of stupid dream was that?

51
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,210
Why would I have a dream like that?

52
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,160
Did I kiss her back like she said?

53
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,230
No, no. There's no way I did.

54
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,500
Get it together, Go Pil Sung.

55
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,780
What are you thinking right now?

56
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,780
You can't do this.

57
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,570
Yes.

58
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,310
I can no longer get tempted by Do Ra.

59
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,330
Not anymore.

60
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,010
Do you...

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,640
even remember what you said drunkenly last night?

62
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,330
Yes, I remember everything, Hyungnim.

63
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,900
I might as well be honest with you about everything.

64
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,890
Okay, go ahead.

65
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,420
I've been very disappointed in you, Hyungnim.

66
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,740
I'm not even asking for what's yours.

67
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,340
I'm asking for... what Father let me inherit, the Angel Investment.

68
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,690
Why won't you give it to me?

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,020
How long do I have to walk on eggshells and wonder when you'd give it to me?

70
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,140
I want what's mine.

71
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,990
Why do I have to tiptoe around you?

72
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,330
Did I say I wouldn't give it to you?

73
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,670
I'd give it to you if you were trustworthy.

74
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,090
When will you finally trust me? When, exactly?

75
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,140
Do you really have to ask?

76
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,250
What happened to the construction company I gave you?

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,130
I kept saying no,

78
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,450
but you insisted on building condos in Vietnam and Myanmar and gave up in the end.

79
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,750
The whole company could've been in danger because of you.

80
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,530
And how could I let you have Angel Investment after that?

81
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,290
Wait a little longer.

82
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,720
No, I don't want to.

83
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,760
I can't wait, either.

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,070
Give it to me now.

85
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,750
What?

86
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,440
What do you think you're doing?

87
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,510
Give it to Jin Dan right now.

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,010
Angel Investment is Jin Dan's.

89
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,800
It's up to him whether he'd ruin or sell it.

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,750
Why are you holding onto it?

91
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,830
- Auntie. 
 - What?

92
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,720
Did your wife tell you to hold onto it?

93
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,160
Auntie, we're talking about Jin Dan. Why would you bring up Soo Yeon?

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,670
Why are you doing this, Auntie?

95
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,220
Just look at how this family is.

96
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,470
I'm frustrated and angry, that's why.

97
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,140
Same with Ma Ri and Jin Dan.

98
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,910
You think it's something you can just insist on?

99
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,400
Give it to Jin Dan and sort things out.

100
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,100
You're giving him Angel Investment?

101
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,890
Would you really be okay?

102
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,450
Thinking about it, I think Auntie is right.

103
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,550
Angel Investment.

104
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,410
I can't continue to be responsible for it.

105
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,270
If something goes wrong with it,

106
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,570
the company and the subsidiary companies will suffer, too.

107
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,630
We own its shares, too.

108
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,550
But there's no choice anymore. It's no longer mine.

109
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,530
We'd just have to trust him and keep an eye on it.

110
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:30,610
And it doesn't look good to fight about stuff like this.

111
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,280
It's better to let go of it at this stage.

112
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,780
Okay, I understand.

113
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,580
I'll get going.

114
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,730
Is it true?

115
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,850
Is he really giving it to you?

116
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,040
Yes, he said he'd process it immediately.

117
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,940
I'm Angel Investment's real CEO now.

118
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,220
Gosh, Jin Dan! What in the world!

119
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,910
Is this a dream or reality?

120
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,970
By the way, do you think he actually will?

121
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,500
What if he changes his mind later?

122
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,200
Come on, Mom.

123
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,380
He's a man of his word, you know.

124
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,650
I suppose.

125
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,700
Gosh, I can't believe this day finally came.

126
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,390
Jin Dan, let's move out of this house, then.

127
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,670
Let's move out and try living freely, okay?

128
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,530
Mom, what are you talking about?

129
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,940
Why would we move out?

130
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,250
Do you think I came this far just to get Angel Investment?

131
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,610
APP Group's successor, the chairman position is still left.

132
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,810
Gosh, Jin Dan. Someone might hear you. Talk quietly.

133
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,880
So, don't try to move out of this house, Mom.

134
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,890
We're just getting started.

135
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,130
Okay, I got it. Let's do that.

136
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,890
I didn't even know you had a plan like that.

137
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,690
Jin Dan, I'll only count on you from now on.

138
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,450
Didn't you before? I'll get going now.

139
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,470
Gosh, my handsome son.

140
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,500
Have a nice day, handsome President Gong.

141
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,110
Right, take good care of Auntie.

142
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,140
Okay, okay. I understand what you mean.

143
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,230
Auntie, thank you so much.

144
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,570
You let us have Angel Investment.

145
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,270
I'll never forget that.

146
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,190
I'll think of you as my mother from now on.

147
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,280
If you say blue is red,

148
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,720
I'll think of blue as red and care for you for the rest of my life.

149
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,840
 Hold on, why didn't I think of this? 

150
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,570
 She and Soo Yeon were high school classmates. 

151
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,430
Do you really mean what you just said?

152
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,290
You'd think of me as your mother?

153
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,560
You'd believe blue is red if I said so?

154
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,810
Yes, Auntie. I mean it.

155
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,450
You changed Jin Dan and my fate. There's nothing I can't do.

156
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,910
I'll live for you for the rest of my life.

157
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,210
If so, have a seat here.

158
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,440
There's something I want to discuss quietly.

159
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,710
Discuss?

160
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,030
Tell me, Auntie.

161
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,740
You know you can't reveal the mother and child's secret, right?

162
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,720
Of course.

163
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,050
You're telling me since you think of me as your child.

164
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,660
I have to take everything you said to the grave.

165
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,500
If so, find out about Ma Ri's mom's past.

166
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,390
Her past before she married Jin Taek.

167
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,280
Pardon?

168
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,430
M-Ma Ri's mom, so Soo Yeon's past?

169
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm home.

170
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,910
Oh, hey.

171
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,690
Hey, what's that?

172
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,400
I got traditional medicine made for Hyeon Cheol.

173
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,860
I told him to rest, but he won't listen.

174
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,650
I'm worried he'd get hurt doing physical work at his age.

175
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:38,570
You did a good thing, but... don't you ever worry about me?

176
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,750
Putting 300 eyes on the stuffed animal... is a tough job.

177
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,140
My eyes hurt, my shoulders hurt,

178
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,700
and my whole body hurts doing this.

179
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,730
I didn't know sewing eyes on stuffed animals was this hard.

180
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,070
Aigoo. Because I felt bad for Hyeon Cheol,

181
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,650
I wanted to do something to help him.

182
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,940
So, I sew 300 eyes every day—

183
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,750
Mother, I'll get your medicine made later.

184
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,040
 Gosh, what a bitch. She always says she'd get it for me "later." 

185
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,330
Who is it?

186
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,510
Gosh, Ae Gyo.

187
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,940
What brings you to our house?

188
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,300
Ae Gyo, what brings you to our house out of the blue?

189
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,390
I thought of you while I was in the neighborhood.

190
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,250
Am I not supposed to visit you or something?

191
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,320
Of course, you can.

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,810
I was just curious because you suddenly showed up without telling me.

193
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,630
You were closer to me when we were in high school.

194
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,440
But at some point, you started caring for Soo Yeon more.

195
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,490
So, I was actually pretty disappointed, to be honest.

196
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,430
Gosh, were you?

197
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,020
We did grow apart since we lost touch at some point,

198
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,750
but I feel bad since you're saying that.

199
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,270
I didn't do it on purpose.

200
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,320
Gosh, I was just saying that.

201
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,350
Right. These are makeup products.

202
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,200
I got you some while I was getting mine.

203
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,310
Try using them. It's really nice.

204
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,610
Ae Gyo, this is really expensive stuff.

205
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,800
You shouldn't have.

206
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,610
It's a gift from a rich friend. Can't you just take it?

207
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,530
We need to care for our skin at our age.

208
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,920
Otherwise, it suddenly gets ruined.

209
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,530
Okay, thank you. I'll enjoy them.

210
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,560
My skin is being well-treated, thanks to you.

211
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,410
Maybe it's my age, but I think of my friends a lot these days.

212
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,970
I think of the old memories, too.

213
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,170
Do you remember when you, me, and Ji Hye went to Wolmi-do?

214
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,130
Gosh, of course, I remember.

215
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,310
We saw the ocean and went to a theme park, too.

216
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,810
We barely managed to get home after getting drunk with dongdongju and pajeon.

217
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,520
Yes, we did.

218
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,140
The three of us were closer then.

219
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,670
Since Soo Yeon was the daughter of an assemblyman and aloof,

220
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,180
we didn't dare to even look at her.

221
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,960
By the way, since when did you get close to her?

222
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,250
I happened to run into her in the neighborhood after I had Pil Sung.

223
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,650
I suppose her family used to live near here.

224
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,250
She said she couldn't get pregnant and found Pil Sung so cute.

225
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,640
So she stopped by often.

226
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,100
That's how we got close.

227
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,220
What do you mean?

228
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,090
Didn't you say she gave you postnatal care since your mom passed?

229
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,990
So, what do you mean you ran into her after giving birth?

230
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,730
N-No, I mean...

231
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,160
How long ago was that, anyway?

232
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,240
I meant I ran into her when I was pregnant with him.

233
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,410
She used to visit me often when I was pregnant.

234
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,020
She cared for me a lot then.

235
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,020
She helped me a lot with postnatal care, too.

236
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,160
Is that so?

237
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,820
By the way, who was Soo Yeon close to when we were in high school?

238
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,600
Well, was she close to Eun Joo then?

239
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,780
She probably was.

240
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,330
I think she used to hang out with Eun Joo all the time.

241
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,120
Oh, Kang Eun Joo?

242
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,760
The one who moved to Busan after marrying someone from there?

243
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,060
You're right.

244
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,750
I think I saw them hanging out, too.

245
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,250
 When Seon Yeong had a baby, 

246
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,410
 I went to the hospital with her because her mother had passed away early on. 

247
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,090
 I helped her with the postnatal care, too. 

248
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:21,970
 I happened to run into her in the neighborhood after I had Pil Sung. 

249
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,530
 N-No, I mean... 

250
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,930
 How long ago was that, anyway? 

251
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:32,440
 I meant I ran into her when I was pregnant with him. 

252
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,640
Why do they say different things?

253
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,920
How strange.

254
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,140
No, I shouldn't be doing this right now.

255
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,260
Eun Joo. Kang Eun Joo.

256
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,490
Yes, there it is.

257
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,520
Gosh, Eun Joo. It's me, Ae Gyo.

258
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,670
Yes, it's been a while.

259
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,300
Have you been well?

260
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,610
 Of course. What's this about, by the way? 

261
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,810
You used to be close to Soo Yeon in high school.

262
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,610
Did you meet her after graduating, too?

263
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,240
 She left to study abroad after graduating high school. 

264
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,420
 I talked to her once in a blue moon since then. 

265
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,280
 - By the way, why do you ask?  
 - Huh? W-Well, the thing is,

266
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,290
I'm helping a reporter write about her youth.

267
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:24,380
Did she have a close friend while she was studying abroad?

268
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,880
Who?

269
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,020
Oh, Kim Jae Gyeong? She studied in the US, too, right?

270
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,810
Yes, thank you.

271
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:38,050
Eun Joo, call me when you come to Seoul. Okay.

272
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,860
By the way, which part of her past am I supposed to look into?

273
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,380
I'm looking for her close friends from the past.

274
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,880
What did you want to know about, by the way?

275
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to look into.

276
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,140
What is it about, exactly?

277
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,170
Then...

278
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,280
find out about how she lived while she was studying abroad.

279
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,750
While she was studying abroad?

280
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,030
I got the phone number of a friend who studied abroad with her.

281
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,660
By the way, Auntie, just tell me what's going on.

282
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,760
I need to know what it's about to ask the right questions.

283
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,140
Do you want to know if she had a man by chance?

284
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,750
How did you know that?

285
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,330
My gosh, I was right.

286
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,820
People usually talk about that when it comes to someone's past.

287
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,800
We need to find the man she dated when she studied abroad.

288
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,970
Our family's fate depends on it.

289
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,500
So, do it quietly without anyone knowing.

290
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,770
- You know what I mean, right? 
 - My gosh!

291
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,250
Did she really see a man then?

292
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,170
Assistant Director, which one should I choose between these?

293
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,680
G-Go with this one.

294
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,790
I'll go with this one, then.

295
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,950
Hello.

296
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,830
Why is Park Do Ra all dolled up today?

297
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,070
Who is she trying to impress?

298
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,700
Yes, I-I wonder.

299
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,530
Something is definitely up between her and Cha Bong Soo.

300
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,960
You know how accurate my radar is, right?

301
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,420
Pardon?

302
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,810
Wow, she definitely is an actor.

303
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,580
She's so pretty.

304
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,330
I see her every day, but I don't get sick of her. Don't you agree?

305
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,480
Well, yes. I guess...

306
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,660
You forgive her no matter how awful and annoying she is since she's so pretty.

307
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,240
- Director! 
 - Yeah?

308
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,860
- Please check this for us. 
 - Okay, okay. Coming.

309
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,040
Oppa.

310
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,570
Ms. Park, I told you not to call me that on set, didn't I?

311
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,410
Okay. Pil Sung, then?

312
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,910
Seriously.

313
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,620
Forget it. Let's not bother.

314
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,930
Oppa, what are you doing after the shoot today?

315
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,410
- Why? 
 - Let's get shabu-shabu afterward.

316
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,510
Why would I get shabu-shabu with you after work?

317
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,770
- What kind of relationship do we have? 
 - What do you mean, what kind?

318
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,870
We've even kissed.

319
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,730
Didn't we start dating yesterday, then?

320
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,240
Hey, Park Do Ra. Don't ever mention that again.

321
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,750
I want to sue you, but I'm barely holding back.

322
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,130
Oppa, I'll wait for you at the tteokbokki shop parking lot.

323
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,840
- I'll wait until you come. 
 - I made it clear that I won't go.

324
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,850
So don't do anything silly.

325
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,550
I made it clear, too. That I'll wait until you come.

326
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,130
I'll wait there all night long.

327
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,130
   

328
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,590
   

329
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,937
It's finished, Chairman.

330
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:07,367
You're the owner of the Angel Investment now.

331
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,557
Take good care of it.

332
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,767
Okay, I will.

333
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,577
Thank you, Hyungnim.

334
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:19,767
Mom, that oppa is coming.

335
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,867
Over here! Over here.

336
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:26,347
I didn't notice because I was out of it then,

337
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:29,497
but he looks kind of cute seeing him now.

338
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:31,277
Ma Ri.

339
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,447
Okay, I'll be careful.

340
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,317
I won't say that in front of him.

341
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,527
Hello.

342
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,667
Welcome. Have a seat here.

343
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,257
Okay.

344
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:52,427
I wanted to see you because I was so grateful for the last time.

345
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:54,737
I hope I'm not taking too much of your precious time.

346
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:57,117
Were you working, by chance?

347
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,347
No, I'm a student.

348
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:03,357
I'm studying in New York, but I came briefly since it's spring break now.

349
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:06,187
Oh, really? You're still a student.

350
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,667
I was in the US, too.

351
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,727
How old are you, then, Do Joon?

352
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:14,507
I'm 24 years old.

353
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:17,397
Oh? You're younger than me, then.

354
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:19,837
Do Joon, just call me "Noona."

355
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:22,017
Noona is 26 years old.

356
00:24:22,017 --> 00:24:25,097
Ma Ri, you can't do that. That's rude.

357
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,727
No, it's okay.

358
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:28,067
You can talk to me casually.

359
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:32,387
Mom, Do Joon told me to talk to him casually.

360
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,887
If so, put in your number here.

361
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,717
I'll contact you if I go to New York. Let's meet there, too.

362
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:43,177
I'll buy you lots of tasty food.

363
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:44,387
Okay.

364
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:48,947
Mom, I'm so happy I have a cute little brother.

365
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,727
Here you go.

366
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:54,067
Mom, I'll go to the restroom.

367
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:57,067
- Excuse me for a moment. 
 - Okay.

368
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:04,297
Do Joon...

369
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:08,180
Ma Ri got into an accident when she was a child.

370
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:14,167
She's physically an adult, but she's about 12 years old mentally.

371
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:16,987
Oh, I see.

372
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:20,997
I hope you understand if she acts impolitely.

373
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:22,897
It's okay.

374
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:26,877
I thought she was just honest and pure.

375
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:28,957
But now I understand everything.

376
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,777
Thank you for being positive about it.

377
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:38,987
And here. I'm so grateful for last time.

378
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,547
No, don't do this. I'm really okay.

379
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:45,177
Don't feel pressured and get a meal with your friends.

380
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:51,017
If it wasn't for you, my Ma Ri would've...

381
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:54,647
I don't even want to think about it.

382
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:59,647
You helped us so greatly.

383
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:01,637
Thank you.

384
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:05,870
Not at all. Anyone would've helped in that moment.

385
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,647
Thank you so much.

386
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:09,567
   

387
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,687
 You should leave while I'm letting you go. 

388
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,827
 I want to just go straight toward you. 

389
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:25,337
 I made it clear, too. That I'll wait until you come. 

390
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:28,967
 I'll wait there all night long. 

391
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:36,697
Why should I go? Why do I care if she waits or not?

392
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:43,187
But it's okay to grab a meal, right?

393
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,417
I need to have dinner, anyway.

394
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,587
I'm kind of hungry, too.

395
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,557
No.

396
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:53,897
I should never grab a meal with Do Ra.

397
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:01,997
Hello?

398
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,887
 Where are you, Oppa? Are you on your way? 

399
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:07,017
I definitely told you earlier. I said I won't go.

400
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:09,007
 I won't get shabu-shabu with you. 

401
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:12,547
So, don't wait for no reason and go home.

402
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:28,647
- I said I won't go. 
  - Oppa, please help me. 

403
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:32,347
Do Ra, what's going on?

404
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:35,137
Park Do Ra! Park Do Ra...

405
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,397
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

406
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:44,837
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

407
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:55,327
Park Do Ra!

408
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,367
Do Ra!

409
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,137
Park Do Ra!

410
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,287
Park Do Ra!

411
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:11,427
Oppa.

412
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:15,347
Do Ra, are you okay? Huh?

413
00:28:15,347 --> 00:28:17,557
What is it? What's going on?

414
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:21,297
You thought something might've happened to me, didn't you?

415
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:25,097
I was just yelling because the snack was tasty.

416
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:30,447
What? You yelled because the snack was tasty?

417
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:34,677
Are you... Are you serious right now?

418
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:38,807
Why? Was my acting too believable?

419
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:41,287
Park Do Ra, are you joking? You think I'm a joke?

420
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:45,437
Oppa, I'm not scared at all if you get angry.

421
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:48,917
You're just cute even when you're angry.

422
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:50,867
W-What did you say?

423
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:54,737
You shouldn't have refused to see me when I wanted to, then.

424
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:57,677
You should've come immediately if I told you to.

425
00:28:57,677 --> 00:29:00,317
Oppa, I'm hungry. Let's go right now.

426
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,277
We need to get shabu-shabu and have lots to do.

427
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:05,377
I said I won't get shabu-shabu with you.

428
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:10,277
Can't you just listen to me today?

429
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:18,317
Just think you're doing a favor for a girl who lived in your house.

430
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,647
Please?

431
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:27,287
Okay, don't say we're going out starting today or anything funny like that.

432
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,477
Okay. Let's go!

433
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,087
Let's go!

434
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:32,747
Hey, hey. Take this off.

435
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:35,117
What if someone recognizes you?

436
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:37,097
Oppa, look at me.

437
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:39,997
I'm wearing a hood, mask, and sweatsuit.

438
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,937
Who'd think I'm Park Do Ra?

439
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,717
No one would recognize me. Don't worry.

440
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,457
Where are we going?

441
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:52,767
Oppa, don't ask any questions and just follow me.

442
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:59,747
♫  Saturday afternoon  ♫

443
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:02,577
♫  Don't hesitate like that  ♫

444
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:05,267
Oppa, I said you don't have to do that.

445
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:08,447
Look. No one recognizes me.

446
00:30:08,447 --> 00:30:11,947
And people these days aren't interested in others.

447
00:30:11,947 --> 00:30:13,567
They're all busy looking at their phones.

448
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:17,367
Be quiet. Don't talk. You'd get caught that way.

449
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:21,117
Be quiet.

450
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:25,197
♫  Monday was busy  ♫

451
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:28,447
♫  Tuesday was hectic  ♫

452
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:35,067
♫  The boring Wednesday is over  ♫

453

♫  The precious Saturday is finally here  ♫

454
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:47,787
♫  Try dancing with me  ♫

455
00:30:58,117 --> 00:30:59,987
You're too old to ride stuff like this.

456
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:02,927
Why? It's nostalgic and nice.

457
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,117
Gosh, it's so stuffy.

458
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:13,607
♫  We can't just let it go  ♫

459
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:16,527
- Feels great! 
 - Hey!

460
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,807
♫  Forget about what you were doing for a moment today  ♫

♫  Dance with me, ya-ho, ya-ho  ♫

462
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:38,877
Oppa, they remind me of our old days.

463
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,447
Like what, exactly?

464
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:45,587
You know. I wanted to impress you, so I put on makeup,

465
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,487
put socks in my chest and went to a theme park.

466
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,307
- Don't you remember? 
 - Hey, how could I forget?

467
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:54,247
You were so ridiculous, then.

468
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,787
How come you haven't changed at all since then?

469
00:31:56,787 --> 00:31:59,457
Look at us now. I was dragged here by you again.

470
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:03,407
But we had fun today.

471
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:10,217
Coming here today with you makes me feel like I'm back to that time. I'm so happy.

472
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:11,967
Isn't that Park Do Ra?

473
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,947
Aren't you Park Do Ra?

474
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:15,957
I'm not Park Do Ra!

475
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:27,877
 - Feels great! 
 - Hey! 

476
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:57,907
 Oppa, I had so much fun today thanks to you. 

477
00:32:57,907 --> 00:33:00,507
 Being with you makes me so happy. 

478
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:03,837
 I want tomorrow to come quickly so I can see you again. 

479
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,907
 I had fun today, too. 

480
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:09,097
 Reminded me of the old days, too. 

481
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:11,017
 See you tomorrow. 

482
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:21,477
Go Pil Sung, what are you doing right now?

483
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,827
what are you doing right now?

484
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:28,017
You're crazy. You're insane.

485
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:31,547
Why would you go to a theme park with Park Do Ra?

486
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:37,147
I was bewitched by her today.

487
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:41,677
I really can't get tempted by her.

488
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,457
Thank you.

489
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,987
What are you doing here, President Gong?

490
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,857
Do Ra, let's talk.

491
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:12,647
I don't have anything more to say to you.

492
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:16,207
I was too hasty last time. I think I made a mistake.

493
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:20,607
So, I wanted to apologize and talk about something important.

494
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:22,807
Get in my car for a moment.

495
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,657
Let's go to a nearby coffee shop.

496
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:26,807
No.

497
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,207
Let's just talk here.

498
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:35,477
Okay. Shall we talk here, then?

499
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:42,707
Do Ra, I finally became the official CEO of Angel Investment.

500
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:46,537
I'm the real owner of Angel Investment now.

501
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:49,347
I was given all the shares I was promised to.

502
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:52,537
I see.

503
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:54,357
Congratulations.

504
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:59,327
Do Ra, I swear there's nothing wrong with me.

505
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:02,827
I'm not lacking in any way for you.

506
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:05,777
Please give me another chance.

507
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:07,717
Oh, right.

508
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:13,977
Don't do this, President Gong.

509
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:21,057
Do Ra, I won't rush you in any way.

510
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:23,707
So, please consider me just once.

511
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:30,637
Your mother said you're interested but avoiding me because of my mother.

512
00:35:30,637 --> 00:35:34,587
If that's the reason, you don't have to worry about that at all.

513
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:36,647
President Gong!

514
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:41,137
I expressed myself very clearly last time. Why are you doing this?

515
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:42,727
It's not because of your mother.

516
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:45,907
I'm not interested in seeing you at all.

517
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,607
So, please don't do this to me.

518
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:56,017
What's the reason?

519
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,517
Why are you refusing me?

520
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:02,337
What am I lacking, exactly?

521
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:06,347
What did I do to you, exactly?

522
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,797
Let go of me!

523
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,847
This is what's wrong.

524
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,457
Why are you doing this when I said no?

525
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,337
Park Do Ra.

526
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:38,777
She has a man.

527
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:41,347
She definitely has someone.

528
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,627
It's me.

529
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:56,457
Park Do Ra...

530
00:36:57,307 --> 00:37:02,477
Find out again if she's seeing someone already.

531
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,597
Hey, you're home.

532
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:08,427
I heard you finished early. You sent Jae Dong home early, too.

533
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,297
What have you been doing and coming home so late?

534
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:15,487
Mom, what exactly did you tell President Gong?

535
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:17,897
What did you say that he did that in front of our house?

536
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:21,107
Gosh, President Gong came again?

537
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:26,707
Yes. He hugged me when I said no at the restaurant, too.

538
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:29,297
He just grabbed my arm again...

539
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:32,887
and he told me not to worry about his mom and forced...

540
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:36,017
I said I don't want him. Why does he keep doing this?

541
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:39,047
What did you say that he's doing this?

542
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:41,487
I didn't say anything.

543
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,987
I really hate that man so much.

544
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:48,857
So, don't even talk to him anymore, okay?

545
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,577
That little brat.

546
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:58,657
Can't she just accept him?

547
00:37:58,657 --> 00:38:00,427
This is such a problem.

548
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:03,677
What if he wants me to pay back 500 million immediately?

549
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:06,837
What do I do? What do I do?

550
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:11,537
   

551
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:13,417
What do I do?

552
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,417
What should I do?

553
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:19,007
What should I do?

554
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:22,657
What if he wants 500 million back... What do I do?

555
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,027
Oppa.

556
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:39,847
We'll see each other on set soon. Why did you want to meet now?

557
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:43,977
What is it? Did you want to see me as soon as possible?

558
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:45,577
Do Ra.

559
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,807
I wanted to see you because I wanted to tell you something.

560
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:53,727
What is it? Why do you sound so serious?

561
00:38:54,917 --> 00:39:00,907
Yes, Do Ra. It's true I was tempted by you.

562
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:05,787
Right? You liked me, too, right?

563
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:10,467
Thank you for being honest with me, Oppa.

564
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,727
Can I like you freely now, then?

565
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:18,157
What? Are we going out starting now, then?

566
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:20,447
Can we see each other anytime and

567
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:23,667
celebrate birthdays and Christmas, too...

568
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:27,597
I-I'm so happy just thinking about it.

569
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:31,617
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

570
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:36,947
But I'm not interested in doing that with you.

571
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:38,817
I can't do that.

572
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,997
What do you mean by that?

573
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:47,017
Didn't you say you like me just now?

574
00:39:48,187 --> 00:39:50,977
You're already a successful A-list actor

575
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:54,007
and I'm a junior assistant director who's just getting started now.

576
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:56,037
We aren't a good fit for each other.

577
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,857
I don't care about stuff like that at all.

578
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,277
I don't mind.

579
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,187
We like each other. Why should that matter?

580
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:07,197
But I do mind.

581
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:10,537
What if the media finds out we're dating?

582
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:13,007
What would happen then?

583
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,437
Reporters will flock around in front of our house

584
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:20,037
and not only me but also my family will be exposed.

585
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:22,447
I don't want to go through that.

586
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:24,887
What?

587
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:29,057
I told you. I want to succeed as a director.

588
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:33,047
That I want to make a drama that moves people.

589
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:37,677
I don't want to claim fame for something else before I even started as a director.

590
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:41,177
Do Ra.

591
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:47,137
Before we get more attached and suffer more,

592
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:49,217
let's stop now.

593
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,207
I don't think I can handle you.

594
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:56,497
So, you should meet someone who suits you.

595
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:59,727
I'll meet someone who suits me.

596
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:01,667
Let's leave it at that.

597
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:09,257
Oppa, can't we just date secretly?

598
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:12,297
We can avoid getting caught.

599
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:16,617
I'll be careful.

600
00:41:16,617 --> 00:41:19,807
I'll make sure no one finds out so we don't get caught.

601
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:21,497
Do Ra...

602
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:24,337
We won't work.

603
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:28,987
I can't explain everything to you,

604
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,367
but for many reasons, we won't.

605
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,557
So please, I beg you.

606
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:38,657
Don't tempt me anymore, okay?

607
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:55,327
We...

608
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:58,797
will be on different paths.

609
00:41:58,797 --> 00:42:02,107
You should meet someone who suits you.

610
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:05,157
I'll meet someone who suits me.

611
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:08,437
Why should we break up when we love each other?

612
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:13,837
I'll just love you even if it's on my own.

613
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:18,737
I'll just head straight toward you.

614
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:28,697
Cut, cut, cut. NG, NG.

615
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,467
Do Ra.

616
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:34,377
But why...

617
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:37,037
You're not supposed to cry in this scene.

618
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:43,497
You're supposed to go for the man cheerfully, even though he wants to break up.

619
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:50,527
Do Ra, Do Ra, calm down. Calm down.

620
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,117
Why...

621
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:59,857
She got too emotionally involved with me.

622
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:02,017
All actors do this.

623
00:43:02,017 --> 00:43:03,747
Let's take a break, Director.

624
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,507
Okay, okay. Let's, let's.

625
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:10,607
Things got too emotional since the actors got into it so passionately.

626
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,667
Let's take a quick break.

627
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,807
Jae Dong.

628
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:17,127
Maybe something really is going on between them.

629
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,667
I know. You can tell something is going on.

630
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:26,807
The information you requested was just delivered.

631
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:30,170
   

632
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:43,747
This bastard and Park Do Ra are flirting?

633
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:48,397
She rejected me because of a loser like him?

634
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:51,987
I can't believe it.

635
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,097
Damn it!

636
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:31,367
Why is Park Do Ra everywhere I go?

637
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:35,417
Park Do Ra, why are you doing this to me?

638
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:38,477
Why do you keep showing up in front of me?

639
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:45,847
   

640
00:44:55,977 --> 00:45:00,117
Aigoo...

641
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:07,497
Hey, you said the screenwriting competition results come out today...

642
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:11,237
Hey, Myeong Dong, did you...

643
00:45:11,237 --> 00:45:13,287
Myeong—

644
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:16,937
Did you get rejected again?

645
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:25,447
What did I... What did I tell you?

646
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:27,877
I told you to quit already!

647
00:45:27,877 --> 00:45:31,907
I kept telling you not to waste energy on what's impossible!

648
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:35,747
You can't even pretend to listen to your mother.

649
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:41,337
What are you thinking that you dumped the man who gave you a diamond ring, too?

650
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,407
Aigoo, I can't live like this.

651
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:49,487
Hey, you'd better quit writing screenplays and...

652
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:52,847
This thing... Throw this out immediately.

653
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:55,297
Why are you doing this to me now?

654
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,567
I'm already upset right now.

655
00:45:57,567 --> 00:46:00,087
I think I'm about to die!

656
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:07,527
So... So Myeong Dong, quit something that won't work out.

657
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:13,030
Go out and date someone, please.

658
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:19,657
Hey, you can't keep living off of your sister-in-law like this...

659
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:25,947
I'm so embarrassed to see your brother and Seon Yeong because of you, okay?

660
00:46:25,947 --> 00:46:29,637
Okay. I'll move out. I'll move out for you.

661
00:46:29,637 --> 00:46:33,297
You... You... What?

662
00:46:35,547 --> 00:46:37,637
Seriously.

663
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:56,917
But why?

664
00:46:56,917 --> 00:47:00,287
Why am I being rejected? Why?

665
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:04,547
What am I lacking?

666
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:07,617
What's my work lacking?

667
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:11,847
Everyone said it was fun.

668
00:47:12,857 --> 00:47:16,957
I had so much fun with it, too.

669
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:20,977
Why does this keep happening? Why?

670
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:31,857
Why is she doing that again?

671
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:37,257
Why is she crying? She's upsetting me.

672
00:47:41,227 --> 00:47:44,297
Why would I be upset? Geez.

673
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:54,467
You people. I'll make you regret rejecting me.

674
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:57,767
Let me make this clear.

675
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:01,087
You'll regret this!

676
00:48:10,827 --> 00:48:12,617
You're crazy. You're crazy.

677
00:48:12,617 --> 00:48:15,117
Why am I here again?

678
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:20,537
Thank goodness.

679
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:23,387
Gosh, thank you.

680
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,077
By the way, what's going on?

681
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:33,950
Did I come here alone voluntarily?

682
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:37,317
Gosh, I don't remember a thing.

683
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:39,267
What happened?

684
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:53,597
 Noonim, it's me, Wednesday. 

685
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,217
 I don't know what happened, 

686
00:48:56,217 --> 00:48:58,867
 but don't drink alone at a place like that. 

687
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:02,277
 You might end up with someone like me again. 

688
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,907
Are you okay?

689
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,947
You jerk!

690
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:27,327
You piece of trash!

691
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:36,487
By chance, did that jerk bring me here again?

692
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:41,787
Gosh, are you kidding me?

693
00:49:41,787 --> 00:49:46,087
Hey, Go Myeong Dong. What's wrong with you?

694
00:49:48,817 --> 00:49:50,707
Thank you.

695
00:49:50,707 --> 00:49:52,387
Here. Have some of these.

696
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:55,047
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

697
00:50:01,217 --> 00:50:05,287
Oppa, have some of this. It's a gourmet burger.

698
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:12,007
I'm not only giving it to you. I gave it to the entire staff.

699
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:16,337
I gave one to Director Hong and Bong Soo, too.

700
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:20,827
Eating this won't get you exposed to the public.

701
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:24,227
So feel free to eat it, okay?

702
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:28,747
Thank you, Ms. Park. I'll enjoy it.

703
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:33,457
Oppa.

704
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,067
Don't be so harsh and cold.

705
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,557
Today is the last day of the shoot.

706
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:42,917
It'd be difficult to see each other after today.

707
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:47,827
Oppa, look at me and talk to me.

708
00:50:49,537 --> 00:50:52,207
Ms. Park, I'm a bit busy.

709
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:55,537
Okay, okay. I'll make it quick, then.

710
00:50:55,537 --> 00:51:00,227
Oppa, I've only been thinking about myself and not you.

711
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:03,727
I'll no longer insist that you...

712
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:08,727
go out with me and like me anymore.

713
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:12,667
Let's just be casual and close friends.

714
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:17,497
Can't we just stay that way, please?

715
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:21,927
I'm sorry. I need to take care of something quickly.

716
00:51:23,717 --> 00:51:25,317
What?

717
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:29,427
He doesn't even want to be friends with me?

718
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:43,647
Cut! Okay, nice!

719
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:46,517
Thank you.

720
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:50,787
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you!

721
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:53,417
- Good work. You worked so hard. 
 - Good work.

722
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:55,487
Good work, everyone.

723
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,797
Thank you.

724
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:03,807
- Gosh. 
 - Thank you.

725
00:52:04,717 --> 00:52:06,497
Okay, okay, okay.

726
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:10,177
Thinking back, there have been ups and downs,

727
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:17,247
but our entire staff worked their best until the end without any accidents.

728
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:19,977
I'm sincerely thankful to you.

729
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:23,357
Therefore, I believe "Straightforward Romance," which is premiering tomorrow

730
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:27,947
will be a huge success, without a doubt!

731
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:34,677
Most importantly, Ms. Park Do Ra and Mr. Cha Bong Soo.

732
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:38,887
You did your best in such a dire situation.

733
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:42,857
Thank you so much. You worked so hard.

734
00:52:42,857 --> 00:52:44,797
Thank you, Director Hong.

735
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:47,317
Thank you, Assistant Director Go Pil Sung.

736
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:50,387
And the staff members, thank you for your hard work.

737
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:54,837
And I fell in love with Ms. Park while working on this project.

738
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:58,227
Thank you so much, Ms. Park.

739
00:52:58,227 --> 00:52:59,967
I love you!

740
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:11,097
In my entire life, I think this was...

741
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:17,007
the first project that was so dear to me.

742
00:53:19,187 --> 00:53:23,387
I met the people I love as if it was meant to be

743
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:27,937
and I had a magical time with you.

744
00:53:28,937 --> 00:53:34,327
I won't be able to forget this for a long time.

745
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:38,257
I really don't want to say goodbye.

746
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:45,557
- Don't cry! 
   - Don't cry! Don't cry! 

747
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:47,737
It's happening again. It's okay. It's okay.

748
00:53:47,737 --> 00:53:50,137
A round of applause!

749
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:12,607
 Oppa, are we really not seeing each other starting tomorrow? 

750
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:15,127
 I can't believe it. 

751
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:19,007
 I don't think we should end things this way. 

752
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:22,087
 Let's grab a tea, Oppa. 

753
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:37,480
 Ms. Park, it was nice to see you again working on this project. 

754
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:40,117
 As I'm very busy with other projects, 

755
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:43,480
 I won't be able to meet up with you. So I'm saying goodbye now. 

756
00:54:44,057 --> 00:54:46,567
 I hope you become a great actor. 

757
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:48,227
 I'll always cheer for you. 

758
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:51,407
What? Why is he acting like a stranger?

759
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:54,187
Does it mean he'd never see me again?

760
00:54:58,277 --> 00:55:00,947
 If so, meet me after work. 

761
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:04,237
 I'll wait at the cafe until you come. 

762
00:55:23,177 --> 00:55:28,797
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We're closing now.

763
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:30,967
I see. I'm sorry.

764
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:32,667
It's okay.

765
00:55:38,657 --> 00:55:45,467
♫  Does love even really exist?  ♫

766
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:53,147
♫  I always give everything, but why does it end?  ♫

767
00:55:53,147 --> 00:56:00,197
♫  I don't think I'd be able to love again  ♫

768
00:56:00,197 --> 00:56:02,927
♫  Love is so difficult  ♫

769
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:05,907
 You know Ms. Park Do Ra, right? 

770
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:09,617
 Hello. 

771
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,487
 Hey, Park Do Ra! Cha Bong Soo! 

772
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:14,787
 Hey, hey! Stop. Let go... 

773
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:16,957
 Oppa! 

774
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,487
 Do Ra. 

775
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:21,917
 I'm in an amazing mood right now. 

776
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:25,957
 This reminds me of the old days. 

777
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:29,027
 I'm so happy. 

778
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:32,857
 Don't you know why I'm doing this? 

779
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:36,087
 - I don't. 
 - You really are an idiot and a fool. 

780
00:56:37,057 --> 00:56:38,827
 I like you. 

781
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:41,897
 I did that because I like you. 

782
00:56:43,507 --> 00:56:49,627
♫  I'd be okay if you just looked at me  ♫

783
00:56:49,627 --> 00:56:54,327
♫  Love is so difficult, so difficult  ♫

784
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,667
♫  It hurts a lot  ♫

785
00:56:56,667 --> 00:57:00,797
 I met the people I love as if it was meant to be 

786
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:05,307
 and I had a magical time with you. 

787
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:11,677
 I won't be able to forget this for a long time. 

788
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,850
   

789
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:42,717
Yes.

790
00:57:44,897 --> 00:57:46,897
This is for the better.

791
00:57:48,907 --> 00:57:51,107
It's better this way.

792
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:03,007
 Where are you, Oppa? 

793
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:11,790
   

794
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:17,387
Why are you lying until the end, Oppa?

795
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:28,040
You came to see me here. But why lie?

796
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:31,417
Why are you hiding your feelings until the end?

797
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:37,157
- Do Ra. 
 - Do you think it's easy for me to like you?

798
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:40,437
It's hard for me, too. It's not easy.

799
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:44,680
But I'm working up courage because I like you.

800
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,217
But how could you do this?

801
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:53,947
You came here because you wanted to see me, but you're lying.

802
00:58:56,437 --> 00:59:00,157
I didn't know you were this cowardly.

803
00:59:04,287 --> 00:59:05,867
Fine.

804
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,907
Let's not ever see each other again.

805
00:59:12,697 --> 00:59:17,397
Our project ended, and we have no reason to meet again.

806
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:20,707
I won't see you anymore.

807
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,517
I never will.

808
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,817
I'll never...

809
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:31,347
like you again.

810
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:41,957
You're right, Do Ra.

811
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:45,757
I came because I wanted to see you.

812
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:48,987
I came because I didn't want to say goodbye to you.

813
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,357
But I lied until the last minute.

814
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:58,657
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

815
00:59:59,397 --> 01:00:01,557
I won't do it again.

816
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:10,027
Oppa.

817
01:00:11,037 --> 01:00:12,837
Yes, Do Ra.

818
01:00:13,997 --> 01:00:16,117
Let's try seeing each other.

819
01:00:17,677 --> 01:00:19,947
Yes, why don't we just...

820
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:23,007
like each other?

821
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:31,457
♫  It's you in the end  ♫

822
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:33,427
Really?

823
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:36,157
You mean it, right?

824
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:39,467
You can't change your mind later, okay?

825
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:45,927
♫  The name that lingers on the tip of my tongue  ♫

826
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:53,267
♫  I'll choose you even if I were born again  ♫

827
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:55,057
   

828
01:00:55,057 --> 01:00:57,177
   

829
01:00:57,177 --> 01:00:59,447
By the way, Park Do Ra is so pretty.

830
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,447
She really is. 
    

831
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,237
Did you watch "Straightforward Romance" yesterday?

832
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:06,257
Yes, I did. It's so fun!

833
01:01:06,257 --> 01:01:08,737
Park Do Ra is an amazing actor. It's so daebak.

834
01:01:08,737 --> 01:01:13,187
Gosh, her chemistry with Cha Bong Soo is amazing, too.

835
01:01:13,877 --> 01:01:16,277
Mom! Do Ra! Do Joon!

836
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,817
Come out! Come out! Come out!

837
01:01:17,817 --> 01:01:19,067
What? What is it?

838
01:01:19,067 --> 01:01:20,987
What? What's going on?

839
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:25,357
Look. Since "Straightforward Romance" is a huge hit right now,

840
01:01:25,357 --> 01:01:26,987
everyone wants Do Ra in their commercials.

841
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:32,277
Calls, texts, emails, and DM are flooding in right now!

842
01:01:32,277 --> 01:01:34,897
Mom... I mean, President. What do we do?

843
01:01:34,897 --> 01:01:37,437
Mom... I mean, President. What do we do?

844
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:42,377
What do you mean? We say yes. We say yes!

845
01:01:42,377 --> 01:01:45,987
Do Ra. Ms. Park.

846
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:49,757
My sweet daughter. What do we do? My gosh!

847
01:01:52,497 --> 01:01:54,157
Seriously!

848
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,017
What?

849
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:58,507
Yes, hello?

850
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:00,027
How are you?

851
01:02:00,027 --> 01:02:04,597
Ms. Park's schedule is a bit full right now...

852
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:08,947
Yes, we'll check and get back to you. Okay.

853
01:02:12,377 --> 01:02:16,567
You're the best, Director Hong. I knew you'd become successful one day.

854
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,237
Good job. I'm proud of you, Hong Jin Goo!

855
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,087
- It's all thanks to you, Sir. 
 - No, no.

856
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:27,787
It was possible because you trusted and supported me.

857
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,717
Pil Sung. Pil Sung. Go Pil Sung.

858
01:02:31,717 --> 01:02:35,167
You little. You practically lived in the office.

859
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:37,697
You've really done it this time.

860
01:02:37,697 --> 01:02:40,907
Go Pil Sung, you're debuting as a director!

861
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:42,377
Thank you! Victory! 
  (T/N: Pilsung means "victory" in Korean) 

862
01:02:42,377 --> 01:02:44,377
Victory!

863
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:48,017
You two saved me and the broadcasting studio.

864
01:02:48,017 --> 01:02:53,107
I'm paying for the "Straightforward Romance" after-party tonight!

865
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:55,747
- Thank you, Sir! 
 - Thank you!

866
01:02:57,197 --> 01:02:59,017
Yes, well done.

867
01:02:59,017 --> 01:03:01,207
 Oppa, where are you? 

868
01:03:02,397 --> 01:03:04,237
I'll get going now. Victory!

869
01:03:04,237 --> 01:03:07,307
Victory. Hey—

870
01:03:22,627 --> 01:03:24,727
Did you sleep well?

871
01:03:24,727 --> 01:03:26,727
I didn't.

872
01:03:26,727 --> 01:03:28,517
Why not?

873
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:31,457
Because I missed you.

874
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:36,957
- I'll get going now. 
 - Thank you, Seon Yeong.

875
01:03:36,957 --> 01:03:39,567
- See you next week. 
 - Okay.

876
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,897
Thank you.

877
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,287
   

878
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,067
My gosh.

879
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:52,487
Why did she give me so much bonus?

880
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:57,617
I should get medicine made for Mother.

881
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:02,277
Thank you.

882
01:04:02,277 --> 01:04:05,217
- Take care. 
 - Thank you. 
    

883
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:09,217
My Do Ra needs to take this medicine and shoot tons of commercials.

884
01:04:09,217 --> 01:04:11,137
So I could pay off my debt.

885
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:13,117
They say you always get a second chance.

886
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:15,687
"Straightforward Romance" saved me.

887
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,090
   

888
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:28,780


889
01:04:29,567 --> 01:04:32,797
No, why should I hide?

890
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:38,607
You tried to hide. You must know you committed a sin.

891
01:04:38,607 --> 01:04:41,127
What did you say? Sin?

892
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,807
Sin? What sin?

893
01:04:42,807 --> 01:04:45,417
Who are you talking to right now?

894
01:04:46,217 --> 01:04:48,347
How shameless.

895
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:52,747
I'd better not engage.

896
01:04:52,747 --> 01:04:55,447
Shameless? You're calling me that right now?

897
01:04:55,447 --> 01:04:59,847
You sent your mother-in-law to blackmail me for money.

898
01:04:59,847 --> 01:05:03,257
Money? What money?

899
01:05:03,257 --> 01:05:05,147
How dare you act innocent now?

900
01:05:05,147 --> 01:05:09,527
You sent your mother-in-law, blackmailed me, and took 50 million, including the interest.

901
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:11,157
I even got a memorandum from her.

902
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,867
How dare you play ignorant right now?

903
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:18,017
50 million? M-My mother-in-law?

904
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,017
   

905
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:27,647
♫  It's you in the end  ♫

906
01:05:27,647 --> 01:05:35,447
♫  You made me smile countless times  ♫

907
01:05:35,447 --> 01:05:40,837
♫  At night, when there's no light  ♫

908
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:46,707
♫  You shine even brighter  ♫

909
01:05:46,707 --> 01:05:53,977
♫  Even if you ask me a thousand times  ♫

910
01:05:53,977 --> 01:05:57,897
 I'm so fed up with you that I can't live with you anymore. 

911
01:05:57,897 --> 01:06:00,907
 What if she goes to a law firm to divorce you? 

912
01:06:00,907 --> 01:06:04,527
 I feel so happy at this moment. 

913
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:08,147
 You're by my side like this. What else can I ask for? 

914
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,287
 What did I just see? 

915
01:06:09,287 --> 01:06:12,297
 Why is Do Ra getting into the curly-haired director's crappy car? 

916
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:13,717
 Should I let President Baek know? 

917
01:06:13,717 --> 01:06:17,117
 Change Park Do Ra's mind in a month and bring her to me. 

918
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:22,807
 Otherwise, I'll make sure your daughter loses her career forever. 

919
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:26,117
 I'm sorry, Oppa. I don't want you to suffer. 

920
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:29,707
 It's okay. It's all right.
