1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,522


2
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:53,622
Noona! 
    

3
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,232
Are you okay?

4
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:58,582
Back there. Is something going on?

5
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:00,482
- It's nothing. 
 - It's nothing.

6
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:02,662
Why did you pick such a cold day?

7
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,262
Do something with the weather.

8
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:06,792
Hey, I'm okay.

9
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:10,132
- You can go. I'll talk to him for a second. 
 - Okay.

10
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:12,262
- Let's go. 
 - It's okay.

11
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:23,742
Gosh, I almost died because of a branch.

12
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:26,282
It's dangerous to run in the mountains.

13
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:30,602
Why do you think they say you need to be humble in the mountains?

14
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:37,512
Anyway, thank you.

15
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:41,122
You saved me again, Assistant Director.

16
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,242
By the way, what did you want to ask that you came running?

17
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:47,942
Oh, oh... Well...

18
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,422
Your last name is Go.

19
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,592
Assistant Director Go Pil Sung.

20
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:56,082
Do you have a relative named Go Dae Chung, by chance?

21
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,442
Pardon?

22
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:07,322
G-Go Dae Chung? W-Why?

23
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:11,312
I knew an oppa named Go Dae Chung when I was a kid.

24
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:14,982
For some reason, I think of him whenever I see you.

25
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:18,802
Your last name is Go, and you have the same curly hair, too.

26
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,392
That's why I thought you might be related.

27
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:29,372
No, I don't have a relative like that.

28
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:34,422
His name is Go Dae Chung? What a funny name.

29
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,512
Did they name him that so he lives willy-nilly?

30
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:46,222
I'm sorry, but I've never met someone like that ever.

31
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:53,032
I suppose not everyone named Go is related.

32
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:57,392
Of course not. There are so many with the surname Go in the world.

33
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:02,302
By the way, he must've made a strong impression on you.

34
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,542
You say you keep thinking of him.

35
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:10,942
Actually, he was obsessed with me and followed me around.

36
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:12,932
Pardon?

37
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:15,032
I was his first love.

38
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:18,302
He followed me, offering bike rides when we were in school

39
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:21,220
and he said he'd buy me tteokbokki all the time.

40
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:25,140
Anyway, he was like that.

41
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:29,742
Oh, yes. I see.

42
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,202
Don't ever think of him when you see me now.

43
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:35,072
I swear I don't know him.

44
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,602
And walk slowly.

45
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,312
I need to put the set together beforehand.

46
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:47,532
Right, Dae Chung Oppa couldn't have had relatives who resembled him.

47
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,962
He wasn't Ahjumma's biological son.

48
00:03:54,772 --> 00:04:00,182
But why do I keep thinking of Dae Chung Oppa whenever I see him?

49
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:02,672
I really don't know.

50
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:07,832
Do I miss that Oppa, by chance?

51
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,332
Geez, come on.

52
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,492
I must be crazy.

53
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,062
Why would I have such a silly thought?

54
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:20,382
Wow, my heart almost sank.

55
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:26,132
By the way, she didn't ask me that, knowing I was Go Dae Chung, right?

56
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,932
No, no, no. It didn't seem that way.

57
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,292
Gosh, it's because of my curly hair.

58
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,172
Should I straighten my hair?

59
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,632
No, no, no. She might find it even more suspicious.

60
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:39,902
I said it wasn't me. She'll just think that.

61
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:46,802
But when did I chase after her?

62
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:50,052
She's the one who chased after me.

63
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,302
I really can't believe it.

64
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:55,592
Mr. Cha, enter this way when he comes out of here.

65
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:58,042
Do Ra, check the staff's last action.

66
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,262
We have to time it and connect the scenes together.

67
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,942
- Okay, I will. 
 - Okay.

68
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:04,102
Director, we're in trouble.

69
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:06,582
The stuntwoman got into a car accident on her way.

70
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:07,972
What did you say?

71
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:09,842
Thankfully, it wasn't a major accident,

72
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,422
but she can't move because she might have fractured her ribs.

73
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:14,322
She can't come because she's on the way to the hospital.

74
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,322
Geez.

75
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:18,962
Geez, we're behind schedule already.

76
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,662
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

77
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:24,002
Director, I'll do it myself, then.

78
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,842
You can't.

79
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:35,212
I mean, it's too dangerous for Ms. Park to do it herself.

80
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,112
Yes, yes. You're right. You're right.

81
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:40,162
An actress can't roll around in the dirt.

82
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:42,292
We'd be in trouble if you get injured.

83
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,462
We'll come up with another solution.

84
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:47,172
Don't worry about anything and rest.

85
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,392
Another solution?

86
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:51,892
One of us can do it if the stuntwoman can't come.

87
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,032
Me?

88
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:57,942
You want me to do it?

89
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,982
You should do it since you had military training.

90
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:01,842
Who else would do it?

91
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:05,222
Of course.

92
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,052
Of course, I should do it.

93
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,722
I'll do it.

94
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:10,582
A-Assistant Director.

95
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:13,812
Wardrobe team! We have an extra outfit, right?

96
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,302
It doesn't look too bad.

97
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,202
Done. Let's go.

98
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:34,082
Assistant Director, should I just do it?

99
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,602
No, it's okay.

100
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,712
Let me just do it.

101
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,102
Thank you so much, Pil Sung.

102
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:42,862
Action!

103
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:47,682
Cut, cut, cut. NG, NG, NG!  (No good) 

104
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:52,002
Pil Sung, I know it's precarious, but run in a feminine way. Feminine way.

105
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:53,682
One more time.

106
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,352
Cut, cut, cut. NG, NG, NG!

107
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:10,402
Do something with his wig.

108
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:14,272
What do we do?

109
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,452
One, two, action!

110
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,412
Cut, cut, cut. NG, NG, NG.

111
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:20,332
Hey, roll on my cue. Roll on my cue.

112
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:23,302
Cut! NG. Roll four times. Four times.

113
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:25,262
Do it again!

114
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,072
Last one!

115
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,382
Tae Soo! Tae Soo.

116
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:33,412
Cut, cut. NG, NG.

117
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,432
We saw too much of your face. Too much.

118
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:42,582
Tae Soo! Tae Soo.

119
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,282
NG!

120
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:47,702
Pil Sung, roll five times. Five times!

121
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,732
- I thought it was okay. 
 - Action!

122
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,272
Tae Soo! Tae Soo!

123
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:59,532
Okay! Nice!

124
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,282
Bring me my coat!

125
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:08,232
Gosh, I'm dying here.

126
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:09,982
You did great.

127
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,802
Next scene!

128
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,062
Y-Your legs...

129
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:31,000
- My gosh! 
 - You aren't running away this time.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,702
Let go of me. Seriously.

131
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:37,722
Will you run away like you did at the department store again?

132
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,552
You must know you committed a grave sin.

133
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,432
Sin? I ran away?

134
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:43,952
Why are you doing this to me?

135
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:47,132
No need to talk further. Give me the money. The money.

136
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:50,592
The money you took from my in-law after seducing him.

137
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:53,432
Give me all of it, including the 15 years worth of interest. All of it.

138
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,372
Are you out of your mind? I seduced him?

139
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:58,552
How dare you say stuff like that?

140
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:01,352
Aigoo, I heard your daughter is very successful now.

141
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,462
She's in TV dramas and commercials.

142
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:06,402
I heard she's raking it in these days.

143
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:10,502
But you're acting like it never happened. How could you?

144
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:13,992
30 million then is equivalent to over 50 million now.

145
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:18,242
Yes, it's over 100 million, including the interest. One hundred million.

146
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:21,632
What did you say? One hundred million?

147
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:25,442
Ahjumma, do you think 100 million is someone's dog's name?

148
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:31,512
And as for that money, Grandpa just gave it to me. He gave it to me.

149
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:34,762
By the way, what are you, his wife or something?

150
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:38,242
How dare you demand that money from me?

151
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:41,202
Don't ever come to see me again.

152
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:44,682
If I see you again, I won't tolerate it, okay?

153
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,162
Okay.

154
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,412
I'll go to the broadcasting station now, then.

155
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:53,152
I'll tell everyone that Park Do Ra's mom never paid us back. I'll expose you.

156
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:58,622
- What did you say? 
 - That Park Do Ra's mom seduced my in-law and took his money.

157
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:01,272
That my in-law passed away because of Park Do Ra's mom.

158
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,922
I'll tell everyone about it!

159
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:06,222
Seriously! You Ahjumma. Seriously.

160
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:10,272
Are you seriously out of your mind?

161
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:24,872
- Mom, I'll step out for a second. 
 - Hey... Where are you going?

162
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:31,222
Y-You aren't delivering packages on a motorcycle, right?

163
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:33,542
Don't do stuff like that.

164
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:39,332
I'd hate it if you do dangerous things like riding a motorcycle.

165
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:41,602
I don't want you to, even if I starve to death.

166
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:45,452
Okay. I'm just meeting someone nearby. I'll be right back.

167
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,642
- Hyeon Cheol. 
 - Yes?

168
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,452
Just wait a bit.

169
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:53,402
I'll fund your business.

170
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:58,442
It might not be 200 million, but would 100 million do?

171
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,902
One hundred million? How would you...

172
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,252
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

173
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:06,052
Gosh, seriously.

174
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:09,182
Just wait a bit. I'll get you the funds.

175
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:13,972
So don't ever feel insecure, okay?

176
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:17,922
Okay, okay. Got it. One hundred million.

177
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,792
I'll be right back.

178
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,152
Please make scallion kimchi once you're done with the cabbage gutjeori.

179
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:32,502
The scallion kimchi is already sold out.

180
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:35,382
Already? Okay.

181
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:38,832
Everyone's raving about how good the kimchi is.

182
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,342
That's good to hear.

183
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,402
Ms. Jang, Driver Kim arrived.

184
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,452
I could've driven there myself.

185
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,482
- Okay. I'll be right back. 
 - Okay.

186
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:53,932
Oh, right. Did the soy sauce crab turn out well?

187
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:59,062
Yes, it's marinated well. I'm sure she'll like it. Don't worry.

188
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:01,742
You're heading to the airport, right?

189
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,462
I'll come with you.

190
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:08,172
I don't mind going alone. You don't have to pick her up.

191
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:10,272
Auntie already hates me.

192
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,182
Who knows what would happen if I didn't pick her up?

193
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:17,812
You must be happy since she loves you so much.

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,740
   

195
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,622
Honey!

196
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,702
Did Auntie come out yet?

197
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:41,352
What are you doing here? I thought you had a meeting.

198
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:46,792
I canceled it. I can't focus on work since she's finally coming back.

199
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,502
Don't be silly.

200
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,602
Gosh, are you that happy?

201
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,832
You're like a child waiting for his mom.

202
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,442
Really?

203
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,022
Oh, there she comes.

204
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,352
Auntie.

205
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,322
My gosh, Jin Taek!

206
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,842
You must be tired from the long flight.

207
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,322
It's just how it is.

208
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:12,362
- But seeing you makes me feel rejuvenated. 
 - Really?

209
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:16,192
Aigoo, you haven't changed at all, Jin Taek.

210
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,252
You haven't changed, either.

211
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:20,292
You somehow look younger now.

212
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,562
Don't even try to lie.

213
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,322
I'm serious, Auntie.

214
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:27,482
To me, you haven't changed at all.

215
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:30,162
Thank you for always thinking that.

216
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:33,152
Aunt, thank you for traveling all the way here.

217
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:36,802
Aigoo, you came, too, Soo Yeon.

218
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:39,682
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, Auntie.

219
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:42,352
I'm so happy that you look healthy.

220
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:43,942
Hello.

221
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:47,122
Yes, Ae Gyo is here, too.

222
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:50,292
Why did you all come when you're busy?

223
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,832
Of course, we should come, no matter how busy we are.

224
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,142
- I— 
 - Let's get going, Auntie.

225
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,252
Yes, let's go, Jin Taek.

226
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:59,862
Come here, Soo Yeon.

227
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,372
Gosh, yes, yes.

228
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:09,322
They look happy without me.

229
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,812
Yes, I can understand Auntie and Chairman Gong.

230
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,132
But how could Soo Yeon do this, too?

231
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:19,782
Would it kill her to turn around and ask me to join?

232
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,622
What a meanie.

233
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:25,352
They couldn't be this rude to a sack of barley.

234
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,892
- The broth is nice, right? 
 - Yes, it is.

235
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:34,832
Stay for a long time since it's your rare visit.

236
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,032
You should see a lot of your friends, too.

237
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,652
Yes, I came determined this time.

238
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:43,782
I'll take care of some things and stay by your side for a long time.

239
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,672
You mean it, right?

240
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,902
You aren't leaving soon like last time, right?

241
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,502
You promised me, okay?

242
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:52,652
Okay, I got it.

243
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:56,902
I feel nice and comfortable since I'm finally back home.

244
00:14:56,902 --> 00:15:01,042
But I feel bad that Soo Yeon must feel uncomfortable because of me.

245
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,282
Not at all, Auntie.

246
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:07,292
I'll take good care of you while you're here. Make yourself at home.

247
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:09,852
Okay, thank you.

248
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:16,632
Oh, yes. I heard Jin Dan is in charge of Angel Investment. Is it manageable?

249
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,592
Yes, I should work hard.

250
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:22,562
Investment companies require doing well. Not just working hard.

251
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,552
You can't get distracted, either.

252
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:27,182
I'm sure you know that already. I don't need to nag.

253
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:30,772
Of course. He's working hard and doing well.

254
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,942
All he ever thinks about is the company.

255
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,552
Of course, he should.

256
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:37,682
My brother worked so hard to build up APP Group.

257
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,742
You need to do a good job.

258
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:44,002
I live in the US, but my heart is always here.

259
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:47,432
Thinking about the company my brother built up by working hard

260
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:51,762
and the Gong family's future keeps me up at night.

261
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:56,432
Great Auntie, the company and the Gong family have me.

262
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:59,172
So don't worry and sleep soundly.

263
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:03,842
There's nothing worse than insomnia for your health.

264
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:08,792
Yes, yes. My Ma Ri. My pretty Ma Ri. I wonder who'll end up with you.

265
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:12,902
I hope a handsome prince shows up and ends up with you.

266
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:15,352
I'm an independent woman.

267
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:17,722
I'm not waiting for a prince to come and get me.

268
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:22,292
I'll bring a prince to our house with my own hands.

269
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:27,342
Gosh, hey, this barley-aged croaker is so tasty.

270
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,192
It's your favorite, isn't it, Jin Taek?

271
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,942
No, no. You should eat it.

272
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,532
Help yourself.

273
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:34,952
Seriously. Have some more.

274
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,592
Okay.

275
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,932
Here. Let's eat.

276
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:58,002
- What's that? 
 -  Shikhye.

277
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:01,012
Drink it up. It'll help you digest.

278
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:06,332
I couldn't digest the food at all.

279
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:11,912
I ate digestive medicine, but I can't digest it. It's all stuck in here.

280
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:15,762
Looks like your old aunt will stay for a long time.

281
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:18,412
Seriously. I'm going crazy.

282
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:24,202
Eat separately while she's here and try not to run into her.

283
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:31,282
Jin Dan, just focus on work while she's here and be careful not to look bad.

284
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:34,002
Your brother listens to everything she says.

285
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:37,502
So behave yourself until she leaves.

286
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:43,072
Okay. You don't have to tell me. I already knew.

287
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,810
How much longer do we have to live like this?

288
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:53,962
I'd move out of this house immediately if it wasn't for Angel Investment.

289
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:00,902
I'm sorry, Jin Dan. For having you be born as my son.

290
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:08,912
Mom, should we just move out of this house?

291
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:13,062
I could abandon everything if it makes you happy.

292
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,452
I don't want that.

293
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:17,312
Why would you abandon everything? Are you crazy?

294
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,332
Right?

295
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:24,482
Mom, don't worry about a thing.

296
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:27,592
I won't let them take what's mine.

297
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:33,652
I'm okay, so don't even joke about abandoning everything. Okay?

298
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:35,462
Okay.

299
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:41,282
Being born as your son was the best thing that ever happened to me.

300
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:43,312
Gosh, seriously. My baby.

301
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,782
This is why women are crazy about you.

302
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:49,612
Seriously.

303
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:05,252
 That Park Do Ra's mom seduced my in-law and took his money. 

304
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:08,002
 That my in-law passed away because of Park Do Ra's mom. 

305
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:12,702
 I'll tell everyone about it! 

306
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:18,842
Mom, are you feeling sick? Why can't you eat?

307
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:21,362
Huh? I'm not sick at all.

308
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:25,112
I have no appetite because I snacked on stuff earlier.

309
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:28,232
Wow, what's wrong with Jeon Baek Jo now?

310
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:31,382
- Someone's going after him for debt. 
 - Debt? Really?

311
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:36,742
Yes. He should've paid back the 50 million won he borrowed before debuting.

312
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,622
He was so successful, but they're suddenly demanding money.

313
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,742
His life is over now. It's over.

314
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:46,062
Gosh, 50 million isn't much. Can't believe the chump change ruined him.

315
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:51,562
Mom, that wouldn't happen to us, right? We don't owe anyone, right?

316
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,702
Of course not. Of course not.

317
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:56,792
They would've come after us already if that were the case.

318
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,442
I suppose.

319
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:11,732
 Why aren't you responding? Should I go to the broadcasting station tomorrow? 

320
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:16,192
Gosh, I have no appetite because I ate earlier.

321
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:18,542
Eat without me, okay?

322
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,052
Why? It's tasty.

323
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:24,442
I think it's tasty.

324
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:27,092
She didn't even eat that much.

325
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:30,472
This old hag is driving me insane.

326
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,762
What am I supposed to do now?

327
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:34,952
Whoa!

328
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,752
 Give me some time. 

329
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:44,962
 I'll be in touch soon. 

330
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:49,212
Wow, seriously. Wow.

331
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:53,372
By the way, why haven't we been paid for the drama yet?

332
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:57,302
What if that crazy hag ends up at the broadcasting station?

333
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,322
Wow, seriously.

334
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:07,492
Did my muscles get injured when I was rolling earlier?

335
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:10,112
Why am I so stiff and in pain?

336
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:13,582
Gosh, when will "Straightforward Romance" end?

337
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:15,892
I'm going to get sick working on that.

338
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:18,872
No.

339
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:21,372
That's not the issue right now.

340
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,952
This needs to be a success, so I debut as a director.

341
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,252
Yes.

342
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,312
Just focus on the debut. The debut.

343
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,782
Gosh, it hurts.

344
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:43,142
 Actually, he was obsessed with me and followed me around. 

345
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:44,662
 Pardon? 

346
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:46,352
 I was his first love. 

347
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:49,752
 He followed me, offering bike rides when we were in school 

348
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:53,312
 and he said he'd buy me tteokbokki all the time. 

349
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,702
 Anyway, he was like that. 

350
00:21:56,702 --> 00:22:00,772
What? I followed her around because I was obsessed with her?

351
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:03,700
The more I think, the more absurd it is.

352
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:07,252
Park Do Ra, I can't believe her.

353
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,192
 I'll do it. 

354
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:20,292
 Cut, cut, cut. NG! 

355
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,142
Why is the curly-haired director so cute?

356
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:31,282
The more I think, the funnier it gets.

357
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,302
Seriously...

358
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:58,502
What? Why did that happen earlier?

359
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,092
It felt so electric.

360
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:03,972
Can you get static shocks in the mountains, too?

361
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,252
Gosh, why is he so funny, anyway?

362
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:14,022
He's so cute.

363
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,822
Gosh, he's so cute!

364
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,163
My gosh. Aigoo, what's gotten into you, my daughter?

365
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,403
You must be feeling good today.

366
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:33,313
You've been shooting a lot lately. Aren't you tired?

367
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,693
I feel a little tired, but I'm okay.

368
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,593
Should I ask them to adjust the schedule?

369
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:40,353
I'm worried you'd get sick.

370
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,853
It'd be terrible if you ended up passing out.

371
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,643
No, Mom. I'm really okay.

372
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:48,523
It's so fun and motivating going to the set. It's nice.

373
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,193
Gosh, really?

374
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:54,813
I was so worried because you said you were sick of working.

375
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:58,313
I love going to the set lately...

376
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,573
and this project is making acting fun again.

377
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,783
So don't worry.

378
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:05,963
Aigoo, that's such a relief.

379
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:07,613
But let me know if you feel tired at all.

380
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,573
I'll ask the director to adjust the schedule.

381
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:16,663
You need to be healthy to work on the next project.

382
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,993
What's with you? Are you worried I'd get sick and can't work?

383
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,013
You're worried I won't make money?

384
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:24,403
Come on, don't say it like that!

385
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:27,123
I'm worried you'd hurt yourself overworking.

386
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:29,303
Seriously, you little. Gosh.

387
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:32,613
Hey, hey. Drink this while shooting.

388
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:34,433
It's jujube ginger tea.

389
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,123
You might catch a cold since it's cold these days.

390
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:40,943
I've been brewing it carefully since last night.

391
00:24:40,943 --> 00:24:42,573
Okay, thank you.

392
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:45,233
You're the best, Mom.

393
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:50,023
Right, Mom, do you have another one?

394
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:51,463
Yes, I do. Why?

395
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:53,093
Give me another bottle, then.

396
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,193
Okay. Hold on.

397
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,673
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.

398
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:00,173
Hey. Here's one. I prepared one already.

399
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:02,003
Will you give it to the director?

400
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,443
Huh?

401
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:05,773
Yes, yes.

402
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,503
- I'll be right back. 
 - Okay, okay.

403
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:10,873
- Thank you! 
 - Yes, see you later.

404
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:15,373
Wow, she used to be sick of working.

405
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:16,753
Hold on.

406
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:20,053
Is she dating Cha Bong Soo?

407
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:23,653
No, there's no way. Gosh...

408
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,500
 Why aren't you responding? 

409
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,210
 How long do I have to wait? 

410
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,730
Gosh, what am I going to do with this crazy old hag?

411
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,020
I need to pay the interest on the gambling loan and I need to shut her off, too.

412
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,970
Why isn't the CEO of the production company sending the payment as he promised?

413
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,350
Shouldn't he keep his promise?

414
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,550
Wow, seriously. What do I do? What do I do?

415
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,580
Should I ask President Gong myself?

416
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,300
No, no, no. That's not right. That's not right.

417
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,820
They actually paid us in full. 
    

418
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,380
This payment goes through only when the main investor approves it.

419
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,200
I heard President Gong is the second eldest son of APP Group. He's quite powerful.

420
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,800
Wow, seriously. Wow.

421
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,690
   

422
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,050
The chairman of APP Group only has a sick daughter.

423
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,820
Although President Gong is... the mistress's son,

424
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,270
but realistically, the only person who'd succeed APP Group

425
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,280
is President Gong Jin Dan, right?

426
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,500
And he's not married and is single?

427
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,630
President Gong, this isn't much.

428
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,470
I'm sure you have everything.

429
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,850
But ties are something you switch every day.

430
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,470
So, Do Ra and I decided this would be a good gift.

431
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,430
Oh, really? Do Ra did?

432
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,560
Yes. She wanted to come with me today,

433
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,880
but she's busy with shooting. So I came on her behalf.

434
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,070
President Gong, thank you so much... for paying Do Ra in full for the drama.

435
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,070
I'm well aware that you made it possible.

436
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,490
No, it's nothing.

437
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,050
I've said this from the beginning.

438
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,800
I won't let Ms. Park worry about anything else while working on this project.

439
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,750
I'll let her fully focus on the project.

440
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,830
Gosh, President Gong, you're so cool. Thank you so much.

441
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,580
- Excuse me. 
 - Sure.

442
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,310
 I can't wait any longer. 

443
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,480
 I'm about to head to the broadcasting station. What will you do? 

444
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,150
What's wrong? Is something going on?

445
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,050
No, no. It's nothing.

446
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:13,500
Sometimes, annoying people bother us since Do Ra is a celebrity.

447
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,540
Let me know anytime if you need my help.

448
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,930
I won't let anyone bother Ms. Park.

449
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,900
Thank you so much for saying that, President Gong.

450
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,900
That crazy old hag. Should I kill her or what?

451
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,770
I won't forgive her for this. Seriously.

452
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,240
What did you say? Forty million?

453
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,140
Did you say 40 million just now?

454
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,220
I've explained this before, but I didn't borrow 30 million.

455
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,130
Mr. Kim gifted me that money.

456
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,630
So I don't have to pay you back for that, but I don't want to ruin Do Ra's image.

457
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,170
That's why I'm adding 10 million as a courtesy.

458
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,030
Look here! My in-law ended up that way because of you.

459
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,500
And my daughter-in-law is living in heartache to this day.

460
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,080
Gosh! You should be compensating us more. But what did you say just now?

461
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,880
Fine. Exactly double the principal. 60 million, then.

462
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I didn't think you were like this, but you're like a thief.

463
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,270
If you keep this up, I'll report you for blackmailing.

464
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,070
Go ahead and tell people I owe you money.

465
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,920
Well, fine.

466
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,180
Why don't we both compromise, then?

467
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,410
50 million.

468
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,310
That's enough, right?

469
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,900
Fine, then.

470
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,540
If so, here.

471
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,610
Write a memorandum instead.

472
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,960
M-Memorandum?

473
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,000
You can't keep showing up like this.

474
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,850
I need to end this here.

475
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,730
I'll send you the money right now if you write a memorandum.

476
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,550
All right.

477
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,300
I'll write it, then.

478
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,180
Dictate what I say.

479
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,870
Write down your name first.

480
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,380
   

481
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,450
I, So Geum Ja, promise to do the following for receiving 30 million won

482
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:38,820
and 20 million won in interest for the money Kim Joon Seob gave Baek Mi Ja 15 years ago.

483
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:45,440
One. I will never show up in front of Park Do Ra and Baek Mi Ja.

484
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,080
I will not reveal Baek Mi Ja's past.

485
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,980
If I fail to do so, I will pay back three times the amount of 50 million.

486
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:04,890
And I will compensate for all the damages inflicted on Park Do Ra.

487
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,160
Are you okay?

488
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,510
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

489
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

490
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,140
W-What's wrong, Mom?

491
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,620
What's going on that you're locking the door?

492
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,920
- Goodness. 
 - Come over here.

493
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,910
Hyeon Cheol, promise me not to faint.

494
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,350
What's this about?

495
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,910
Look at this. Look. This is 50 million in total. 50 million.

496
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,750
Gosh. Mom, what's this money?

497
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,720
- Where did you get this? 
 - Hey, quiet!

498
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,620
That woman. Do Ra's mom.

499
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:12,690
That gold digger paid me back the 30 million she took from In-law plus 20 million in interest.

500
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,050
I got... 50 million.

501
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,380
Fifty million from her.

502
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,620
I mean, was that woman willing to give you this money?

503
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,760
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo! She insisted on not paying.

504
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,330
But I said I'd expose Park Do Ra's debt at the broadcasting station and ruin her career.

505
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,050
She paid me when I threatened to do that.

506
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,940
Mom!

507
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,240
So what? The method doesn't matter as long as we achieve the goal.

508
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,960
Gosh, Mom. Seriously.

509
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,890
But why did you bring it in cash? It's dangerous.

510
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,690
I didn't want Seon Yeong to see that I sent you money.

511
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,040
And you need to use money like this in cash.

512
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,130
You'd get tracked if you deposited it for no reason.

513
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,880
I suppose.

514
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:05,100
Hyeon Cheol, why don't you use this to set yourself up?

515
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,950
And make a lot of money.

516
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,480
That way, you'd feel proud in front of your wife.

517
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,670
Mom...

518
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,180
You can't make a mistake this time.

519
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,850
Knock even the stone bridge twice before you cross it.

520
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,210
Okay, Mom.

521
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,230
But we'd be in trouble if Seon Yeong found out about this.

522
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,820
No one would know unless we tell someone.

523
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,920
And until we take this to our grave, we must keep this...

524
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,220
- A secret. 
  - I'm home. 

525
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,590
What?

526
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,460
- Yes. 
  - Is no one home? 

527
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,120
- Hey. 
  - Honey? 

528
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,890
I saw the shoes at the door. What's going on?

529
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,620
 Honey. 

530
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,490
 Mother? 

531
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,930
- Mom. 
  - Why is the door locked? 

532
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,740
 Honey, Mother, are you in there? 

533
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,820
- Yes, w-what is it? 
 - What is it?

534
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,950
 How did the door get locked? 

535
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,170
What? T-The door is locked?

536
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,700
 Yes, Mother. 

537
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,500
Open. Open it.

538
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,990
- Yes, hold on. 
 - Hey.

539
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,490
Mom.

540
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,380
 What's wrong? 

541
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,910
Hey, y-you came, Honey.

542
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,540
Wait...

543
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,690
Why did you lock the door?

544
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,360
What were you two doing?

545
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,130
D-Did the door get locked?

546
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,020
I think it's because the house is old.

547
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,300
We'll have to get it fixed sometime.

548
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,350
The door gets locked on its own once in a while.

549
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,630
Yes, I noticed that, too.

550
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,980
- I see. 
 - We need to fix it.

551
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,860
Yes.

552
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,060
What were they plotting with the door locked?

553
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,270
Even so, I won't let him borrow using the house as collateral.

554
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,030
Never.

555
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,350
Hide it well.

556
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,140
Wrap this up.

557
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,510
- Make it look pretty. 
 - Okay.

558
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,600
Yes, no woman dislikes diamonds.

559
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,600
This is enough to win Park Do Ra over, right?

560
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,200
Is she filming?

561
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,920
No.

562
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:55,220
Yes, she might think I'm a weirdo if I rush too much.

563
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,490
She's a precious woman. Take time and treat her preciously.

564
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,370
Like gentle rain that drenches you without noticing.

565
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,550
She'll totally get smitten by my charm.

566
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,210
With diamonds.

567
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,520
How could you do this to me?

568
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,300
You son of a bitch. Yesterday, you said...

569
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,540
My gosh. I'm sorry. I forgot the line.

570
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,690
I'm sorry, Oppa. Are you okay?

571
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,010
- Cut. NG. 
 - I-It's okay.

572
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

573
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,160
- Oppa, I'm so sorry. 
 - No, it happens.

574
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,890
Yoo Jeong.

575
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,870
Let's do it in one go this time. Get ready.

576
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,310
Okay.

577
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,370
Okay, ready.

578
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,770
One, two, action.

579
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,330
How could you do this to me?

580
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,290
You son of a bitch. Yesterday, you...

581
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,380
Cut. NG.

582
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:08,090
Hey, Park Do Ra. How do you splash water so painfully? It's harder than a fly swatter!

583
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,120
I was trying to do it in one go.

584
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,810
I'm sorry, Oppa. Does it hurt a lot?

585
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,030
It's fine.

586
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,760
Try to understand. It happened because she was absorbed.

587
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,620
- Okay. 
 - I'm sorry.

588
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,120
- Are you okay? 
 - Is everything okay, Pil Sung?

589
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,640
Yes, just one second.

590
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,450
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

591
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,900
One, two, three, action.

592
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,570
How could you do this to me?

593
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,330
You son of a bitch.

594
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,760
Cut, cut, cut. NG, NG, NG.

595
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,400
Hey, Park Do Ra. You're doing this on purpose to screw me over, aren't you?

596
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
- Come here. 
 - Come on...

597
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,000
That's not true, Oppa.

598
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,670
No, it's not true. She said it's not. Please hold yourself back.

599
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,290
What do you mean it's not? That brat is doing this on purpose, I said!

600
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,020
- Ms. Park. 
 - Did you call me a brat?

601
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,680
You're a brat. What are you, then? Come here.

602
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,720
Okay, okay. Let's take a break.

603
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,780
Gosh, seriously. Why did the writer create a scene like this?

604
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,510
It's the writer's fault. It's the writer.

605
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,420
I'll suggest we don't do scenes like this again.

606
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,260
So calm down.

607
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,730
They shoot a gun instead of splashing water in foreign countries.

608
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,780
With one shot.

609
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,190
Bong Soo is too difficult.

610
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,230
I didn't do it on purpose. I was trying to do it in one go.

611
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,780
He's not just foul-mouthed. He's foul-tempered, too.

612
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,650
Do his fans know he's a terrible person?

613
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,080
And it wasn't iced water. It was room temp.

614
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,290
How could it possibly be more painful than a fly swatter?

615
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,520
I suppose he was upset because he got splashed on five times.

616
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,140
And something bad happened last time, too.

617
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,830
I suppose that's why he lost his temper.

618
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,710
Curly-haired director.

619
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,590
Are you defending him with me right now?

620
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,860
No, no way.

621
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,200
You saw it earlier, too.

622
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,250
When he approached you threateningly, I threw his whole body to block him.

623
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,480
You're right. Thank you so much for that.

624
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,410
You're the only one who's on my side.

625
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,070
There are too many annoying people in this project,

626
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,650
but I'm only doing this because of you. You know, right?

627
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,980
Of course, I do.

628
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,950
Thank you so much.

629
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,190
So, you have to be on my side until the shooting ends.

630
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,860
Yes, of course.

631
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,500
- Promise me, then. 
 - Promise.

632
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,980
Ms. Park, eat this spicy tteokbokki and feel better.

633
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,680
I went all the way to the market to get it.

634
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,700
They're really famous for their tteokbokki.

635
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,230
Eat it before it gets cold.

636
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,070
Thank you.

637
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,140
By the way, this is really good.

638
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,500
Right? Isn't it?

639
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,450
I'm so happy that you like it.

640
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,300
Oh, right.

641
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,170
Ta-da.

642
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,670
Here.

643
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,850
Try it. It's jujube ginger tea.

644
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,460
It smells amazing.

645
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,050
- Wow, daebak. 
 -  It's good, right?

646
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:43,790
The flavors of... jujube and ginger are melded together without overpowering.

647
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:50,890
I woke up early in the morning and made it myself... to give it to you.

648
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,640
So you'd better drink every last drop of it.

649
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,460
It's really good for you.

650
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,350
Wow, it's an honor. Thank you.

651
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,200
Wow, it's warming my whole body.

652
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,580
The tteokbokki is amazing.

653
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,690
What happened, Pil Sung?

654
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,690
Did you take care of the situation?

655
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,370
I calmed Park Do Ra down with tteokbokki and Cha Bong Soo with fried chicken.

656
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,050
Shooting with those ill-tempered people is killing me.

657
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,310
Pil Sung, what would I have done without you?

658
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,540
You'll become a hugely successful director.

659
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,460
Your compliments don't comfort me now.

660
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,380
Pil Sung, I need to make this a hit.

661
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,050
I really want to make this work.

662
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,350
But if those jerks fight again,

663
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,920
I'll faint out of shock.

664
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,030
So Pil Sung, don't run away,

665
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,510
stay by my side, and keep helping me.

666
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,500
If this succeeds, it'd be good for you, too, not just me.

667
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,540
Hyung, don't worry.

668
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,960
I'll be sure to hang in there until the end.

669
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,460
Okay.

670
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,070
I'm counting on you.

671
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,830
Here, take this.

672
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,190
Curly-haired director, what's this for?

673
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,820
I wanted to thank you for the tea earlier.

674
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,610
But that was nothing.

675
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,990
What do you mean, nothing?

676
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:44,900
No one gets to drink the jujube ginger tea you made yourself.

677
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,590
I suppose.

678
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,650
And despite the difficult situations and issues,

679
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,920
you're working hard on our project with affection. I'm so grateful.

680
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,810
You put up with Mr. Cha flipping out earlier and have faith in me.

681
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,080
Those flowers won't be enough to express my gratitude.

682
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,190
Don't mention it.

683
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm so touched, curly-haired director.

684
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,130
Thank you so much.

685
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,010
I'll put up with Bong Soo, no matter how much he flips out...

686
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,420
thinking about these flowers.

687
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,360
Thank you.

688
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,590
I'm learning a lot working on this project.

689
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,620
Gosh.

690
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,080
Come on. Don't mention it.

691
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:34,370
If you want me for your directorial debut, I'll be there regardless of the conditions.

692
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,230
- Really? 
 - Yes.

693
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,440
Wow, it'd be such an honor. Thank you.

694
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,600
There's only one scene left for today. Get ready for it.

695
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,080
Okay.

696
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,950
So pretty.

697
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,920
My gosh, son.

698
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,700
You haven't worn a suit in a while. You look great.

699
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,820
Honey, what's the suit for?

700
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,830
Who are you meeting with?

701
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,180
Well, I'll tell you later.

702
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,780
Who are you meeting that you'll tell me later?

703
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,300
You aren't meeting weird people who insist on starting a business, right?

704
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,050
Hey, hey, hey.

705
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,250
How could you talk like that?

706
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,940
Do you think Hyeon Cheol is a fool?

707
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,410
He won't just meet random, weird people.

708
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,220
If your husband put on a suit to go out,

709
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,540
you should say, "You look great. Have fun."

710
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,750
Go Myeong Dong, did you stay out all night?

711
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,180
Why are you suddenly doing this?

712
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,700
Come here. Did you drink last night?

713
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,830
- Hey, hey. Well... 
 - Hey.

714
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,530
Well, you know her friend Jang Mi?

715
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,810
She's been struggling after the divorce. So, Myeong Dong wanted to keep her company.

716
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,260
So I told you to stay with her for a few days.

717
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,810
So...

718
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,210
is she feeling better now?

719
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,690
Huh?

720
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,660
Yes. Y-Yes.

721
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,850
Geez.

722
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,050
But you should still sleep at home.

723
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,610
I'll be right back. See you.

724
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,610
 Let's meet up. I need to tell you something. 

725
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,280
 Ending things like this doesn't feel right. 

726
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,580
Seriously, this woman...

727
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,560
What is she, a leech?

728
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,670
What does she want to talk about? She's driving me crazy.

729
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,860
What did you want to talk about?

730
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,240
I've been waiting for a long time,

731
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,910
but I can't anymore because I feel anxious.

732
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,620
What do you mean...

733
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,450
You still get periods, right?

734
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,810
Pardon?

735
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,380
You're getting older now.

736
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,990
I thought maybe you should get help at the hospital.

737
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,420
Before it's too late.

738
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,400
Auntie, I'm not sure what you're referring to—

739
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,880
A baby. I'm talking about a baby.

740
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,990
A son would be better, but a daughter would be okay, too.

741
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,510
Ma Ri is in that state.

742
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:37,490
You need to have a child to take over the family and company before it's too late.

743
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,490
You're still young and healthy.

744
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,610
Auntie, I'm turning 60 soon.

745
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,950
I had menopause a long time ago. It's been a while.

746
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,830
How could you tell me that just now?

747
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,080
Pardon?

748
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,310
I thought you still could get pregnant.

749
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,950
Pardon?

750
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,010
What's wrong with Auntie?

751
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,950
Has she been expecting me to get pregnant?

752
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,910
My goodness.

753
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,500
Doesn't she know how old I am? It makes no sense...

754
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,820
Seriously.

755
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,250
 Ahjumma. Ahjumma! 

756
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,010
Yes.

757
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,970
- Ahjumma, 
 - Yes?

758
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,690
I asked you to change my bed sheet. Why hasn't it been changed?

759
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,040
You didn't clean the bathroom, either.

760
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,740
I'm sorry. I'll do it tomorrow.

761
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,380
Ahjumma, what's wrong with you?

762
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,260
Who said you can do it tomorrow?

763
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,390
Are you looking down on me, too?

764
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,860
No, how could I...

765
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,510
It's not that.

766
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,280
Madam told me to clean Auntie's bathroom and Ma Ri's room first

767
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,000
and clean the Second Madam's room tomorrow if I don't have time...

768
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,820
What? Second Madam?

769
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,200
Who says I'm the Second Madam?

770
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,990
Who said you could call me that?

771
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,430
Hong Ae Gyo, what are you doing right now?

772
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,950
Why are you yelling at Yeoju-daek?

773
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,640
Hey, Jang Soo Yeon, how dare you call me by name?

774
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,120
She's looking down on me because you're like this.

775
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,790
What are you doing right now?

776
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,720
W-What's going on?

777
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,570
What are you arguing about this time?

778
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,230
Yes, I am a mistress.

779
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:30,440
But I gave birth to the late chairman's son.

780
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,690
He acknowledged me as his son's mother before he passed, too.

781
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,050
But you always look down on me.

782
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,040
Even the maid is looking down on me.

783
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,020
This would be unspeakable in any place in the world.

784
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,730
I know she's a friend from high school,

785
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:51,170
but the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are fighting each other.

786
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,460
What kind of situation is this?

787
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,240
Chairman Gong, is our family this uneducated? Is it?

788
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:14,420
I couldn't understand my brother, who had a child with a woman who was old enough to be his daughter.

789
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,040
I was so ashamed and hated it.

790
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,020
I felt so guilty and terrible in front of Jin Taek's late mother,

791
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,260
my sister-in-law, that I couldn't even look at her.

792
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:35,420
However, no matter how backward this family is, this is unspeakable.

793
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,520
She was still your father's wife.

794
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,460
She even gave birth to his son.

795
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,120
You should respect her accordingly. What are you doing now?

796
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,210
Jin Taek and Soo Yeon, starting now,

797
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,490
call her "Mother."

798
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:59,390
- Auntie— 
 - I know it's awkward because you were classmates.

799
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,220
But what's wrong is wrong.

800
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,420
If Jin Dan and Ma Ri get married, we'll have new family members, too.

801
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:14,420
Would you still call each other by your names and fight, then?

802
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,300
Our family isn't that backward.

803
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,760
Even if she were younger than you,

804
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,550
you still need to call her "Mother."

805
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,970
Don't you agree?

806
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,250
I understand.

807
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,640
I'll do that.

808
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,430
I'm sorry...

809
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,150
about everything,

810
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,890
Mother.

811
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,480
Ma Ri.

812
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,620
Yes, Great Auntie.

813
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,940
Call her "Grandmother" from now on, okay?

814
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,390
She doesn't like it when I call her that.

815
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:07,210
No, it's okay. Call me "Grandma."

816
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,630
Ma'am.

817
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:10,970
Y-Yes, Ms. Gong.

818
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,110
Call her Senior Madam from now on, and...

819
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:17,660
call Ma Ri's mom Junior Madam.

820
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,560
Do that.

821
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,240
Yes, I will.

822
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,920
Why is Auntie telling us what to do?

823
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,780
She's our eldest family member.

824
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:45,940
She's my aunt, but she's like a mother to me.

825
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:51,490
She raised me instead of my sick mother and...

826
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,710
if she didn't donate her liver when I was a kid,

827
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:59,370
I wouldn't be here now. You know that, too.

828
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,800
I know, but still.

829
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,730
How come you have no say when it comes to Auntie?

830
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,740
It's not that I have no say. She had a good point.

831
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,010
I haven't been thinking clearly, either.

832
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,950
As Auntie said, even though she was younger than you,

833
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,900
you still need to address her "Mother."

834
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,960
I can't do that.

835
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,960
What then?

836
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,280
What are you suggesting?

837
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,090
Do you think it was easy for me?

838
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,320
Honey.

839
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,140
Yes, Sister-in-law.

840
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:06,050
What's wrong, Sister-in-law?

841
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,800
I'll call you Sister-in-law from now on, too.

842
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:19,270
Gosh, what's going on, Sister-in-law? Get up.

843
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,930
Hyungnim,

844
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:25,850
thank you so much for enforcing hierarchy.

845
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,140
Ever since I met the Chairman when I was 21,

846
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,080
he's the only man I have ever known.

847
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,840
I've been living my whole life

848
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,840
hoping our son, Gong Jin Dan, will become successful someday.

849
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,770
If I've ever sinned,

850
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,940
it is that I kept seeing the Chairman, knowing he was married

851
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,090
and gave birth to his son.

852
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,590
Yes, I am a sinner.

853
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:11,540
But you acknowledged me and defended me.

854
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,540
I sincerely thank you.

855
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:22,820
From now on, I'll do anything you tell me to do.

856
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,670
You saved me from my misery.

857
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:34,150
I'll return the favor, no matter what it takes for the rest of my life.

858
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,010
Auntie,

859
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,720
I wish you a long, healthy life.

860
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,960
Okay, okay. I got it. Get up now. Get up.

861
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:52,770
- Hyungnim. 
 - Yes.

862
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,920
Hyungnim.

863
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,890
 It's okay. Stop crying. That's enough. 

864
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,530
 Stop crying. That's enough. 

865
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,660
 Okay. 

866
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,610
 Thank you. 

867
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,380
The Curly-haired director always carries a backpack.

868
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,050
This will suit him well.

869
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,280
Are you buying a backpack?

870
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,480
Yes.

871
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,840
Hey, Curly-haired director would be happy if I gifted this to him, right?

872
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,590
You want to gift this designer bag to the Assistant Director?

873
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:40,670
Yes, he's been doing me favors and getting me food.

874
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,050
Noona, he got you ttoekbokki and ice cream that cost 2,000 won.

875
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,960
Getting him a designer bag would be too much.

876
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,410
- Is that so? 
 - Of course.

877
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,410
And if you give this nice bag to him, you should get one for Director Hong, too.

878
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,090
I guarantee Director Hong will get upset if he learns you only gave this to the Assistant Director.

879
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,370
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

880
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:02,360
If you really want to, how is this cap?

881
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,240
This is nice.

882
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,210
Just get him a cap, Noona.

883
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,680
This navy cap would suit the Curly-haired director, right?

884
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,550
Should I give it to him in this bag or put it on him myself?

885
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,830
No, he might get the wrong idea if I put it on him.

886
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,980
I'd better give it to him with the bag.

887
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,890
What?

888
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:10,070
Noona, don't give the Curly-haired director the cap, okay?

889
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,680
- Why not? 
 - I didn't know, but he's no good.

890
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,850
He keeps switching sides. He's like a bat.

891
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,760
A bat? What do you mean?

892
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,750
The Curly-haired director sided with the garlic pervert, Cha Bong Soo

893
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,210
and talking behind your back.

894
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,640
Hey, that doesn't make any sense.

895
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,350
There's no way Assistant Director Go would do that.

896
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,760
Who told you that?

897
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,730
They're talking behind your back right now, too.

898
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,000
And he got you tteokbokki that cost 5,000 won,

899
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,930
but he got Cha Bong Soo fried chicken, pizza, and beer.

900
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,560
He sucked up to him by treating him to sashimi from Noryangjin Seafood Market.

901
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,610
Lee Jae Dong, I said the Curly-haired director isn't like that.

902
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:58,560
Looks like someone came up with a weird rumor, but don't worry.

903
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,630
And I've told you this before.

904
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:05,950
Always keep your eyes, ears, and mouth closed on a film set.

905
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,750
So don't say silly stuff like that, okay?

906
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,730
Seriously, I—

907
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,840
Okay, Noona.

908
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,410
Is spring coming?

909
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,150
The weather is crazy.

910
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,560
It's ridiculous.

911
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,310
Do they not have hands or feet?

912
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,370
Why the hell would you fix her hair?

913
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,650
No.

914
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,130
All of this is...

915
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,600
This is what romance is.

916
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,000
Although they have their own hands, you fix their hair.

917
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,430
I'm jealous.

918
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:32,570
Yes. For the last time, just this once, I should call him.

919
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,220
This is not a matter of pride.

920
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,880
   

921
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,570
 The number you dialed does not exist. Please check... 

922
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,380
What?

923
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,210
Did he change his number because he doesn't like me?

924
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,190
I mean, how could he do that?

925
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,470
Hey, how could you—

926
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,310
Excuse me, let's talk for a second.

927
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,340
Excuse me!

928
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,870
You son of a bitch! Stop for a second!

929
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,080
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

930
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,980
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy right now.

931
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,090
Yes, let's talk for a second.

932
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,520
You keep calling it a mistake,

933
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,630
but it wasn't a mistake for me.

934
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,460
It was very brief and only for a night,

935
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,160
but I was sincere to you

936
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,930
and I liked you.

937
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,210
Noonim, why are you doing this?

938
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,070
Please don't do this. Please. I beg you.

939
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:18,900
- That night, we just... drank and made a mistake. 
  - What? "Noonim"? 

940
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,310
Noonim,

941
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,270
please forget about me.

942
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:28,160
Please pretend you don't know me even if we run into each other. I beg you.

943
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:35,020
Not even Noona, but Noonim?

944
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,680
Me?

945
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,820
One, two, three.

946
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,390
Cut! Okay! Nice!

947
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,010
- Wrap up! 
 - Thank you.

948
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,760
Thank you.

949
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,540
Thank you. Thank you.

950
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,420
- Yes. Well— 
 - Pil Sung!

951
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,820
- Go Pil Sung. 
 - Yes.

952
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,350
- Seriously. 
 - What's on the schedule tomorrow?

953
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,550
Give me a hot pack.

954
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,360
Thank you.

955
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:10,160
 Assistant Director, would you like to have dinner together? 

956
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,530
 I need to give you something, too. 

957
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,670
 I'm so sorry. 

958
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,690
 I have an important plan tonight. 

959
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,160
Well, I can't help it.

960
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,290
Today isn't the only chance.

961
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,940
I'll give it to him tomorrow.

962
01:02:40,312 --> 01:02:44,140
Jae Dong, let's get sushi.

963
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,090
- Sounds good. 
 - Let's get sushi.

964
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,340
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

965
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:58,250
I would've quit this project already if it wasn't for you.

966
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,260
You've been on my side,

967
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,460
drinking with me after work, and listening to me.

968
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,330
That's how I've been enduring it.

969
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:14,720
This is the most difficult project I've worked on in my 15-year career.

970
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,760
You saw how Bbakdora splashed water on me yesterday.

971
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,830
That's not splashing. It's hitting with water.

972
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,410
How could water be so painful?

973
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:26,820
It hurt more than a fly swatter because she must've really meant it.

974
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,880
I know. She was splashing hard.

975
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,750
- Your face got red, too. 
 - That's what I'm telling you.

976
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:39,160
I hate water because it reminds me of getting water-slapped by Bbakdora. I still hate it.

977
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,500
I gave my dear Bi Bi a permanent wound because of her.

978
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:53,340
Pretending to look at her romantically with these emotions is really, really,

979
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,490
It's... It's so hard, Pil Sung.

980
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:01,520
I know, I know. I understand you completely.

981
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,040
Since we're on the topic,

982
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,570
you know the scene where I kneel and get slapped tomorrow?

983
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,450
I don't think I can do it.

984
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,330
I think she'll slap me until I break my neck.

985
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:21,440
Could you ask the writer to change the script, by chance?

986
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,000
That's a bit...

987
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:29,660
Hyung, Hyung...

988
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,140
I'm so tired because of Bbakdora, too.

989
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,900
Yes, you must be tired, too.

990
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:45,500
By the way, I heard you gave her ice cream, tteokbokki, and even flowers.

991
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:50,320
Are you... a bat, by chance?

992
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:56,650
Hyung, Hyung, do you think I wanted to do that?

993
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,340
I didn't want you to suffer.

994
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:02,900
You'll suffer less if I humor her. That's why I did that.

995
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,590
But it's so hard for me to humor her, too.

996
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,880
I could see why people call her "Bbakdora."

997
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,250
She drives me nuts 12 times a day!

998
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:26,740


999
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,180
   

1000
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:39,740
♫  You keep showing up and make my heart flutter and get me excited over and over  ♫

1001
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:46,620
♫  You keep finding me without fail, so I can't think about anything else  ♫

1002
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:51,300
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

1003
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:03,170
♫  The sky is clearer than usual, and my feet feel light  ♫

1004
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:07,000
 I sent a catering truck just for you. I thought I'd come and cheer you up. 

1005
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,100
 Wow, you're so cool, President Gong. 

1006
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,050
 I feel bad for always taking from you. 

1007
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,590
 Then, treat me to a meal next time. 

1008
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,060
 Don't ever show up in front of me. 

1009
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:18,780
 If I see you again, I swear I'll kill you! 

1010
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,080
 What did I see just now? 

1011
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,000
 What if your mom finds out she treats you like that? 

1012
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,990
 She'll foam up and faint. 

1013
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,650
 Work isn't hard. People are hard. 

1014
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,210
 Is someone giving you a hard time? Who is it? 

1015
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,540
 I'll teach him a lesson. 

1016
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,940
 Let's not ever see each other again after today.
