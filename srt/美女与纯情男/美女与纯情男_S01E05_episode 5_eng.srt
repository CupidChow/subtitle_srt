1
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,107
Curly-haired assistant director.

2
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:52,807
Yes. 
    

3
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:59,137
By chance, have we met somewhere before?

4
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,807
We have, right?

5
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:02,997
Pardon?

6
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,337
- Yes. 
 - Where?

7
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:08,417
Well, I saw you on TV a lot.

8
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,840
I saw you in commercials and TV dramas, too.

9
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:14,417
And people often tell me that since I have a generic face.

10
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,507
That's probably why.

11
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:18,297
Is that so?

12
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,507
Whoa, that was a close one.

13
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:31,767
I almost said, "It's me. Go Dae Chung Oppa."

14
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:35,727
But it feels so wrong to pretend like I don't know her.

15
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:37,977
Should I tell her now?

16
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:40,977
No, no. It's better if she doesn't know.

17
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:45,087
By the way, Park Do Ra...

18
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:48,347
does she still remember me from back then?

19
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:55,947
Okay, okay. Let's drink.

20
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:05,257
 You must've learned from your mother, I suppose. 

21
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:08,897
 She got you roles by pouring drinks for people here and there. 

22
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:12,177
 Everyone in the industry knows! 

23
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:17,747
 Jo Bi Bi, since you stabbed a dagger in my heart, I'll do the same to you. 

24
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,827
 Just wait, Jo Bi Bi. 

25
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,917
- Oppa. 
 - Hey.

26
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,967
Have a glass.

27
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,417
Okay.

28
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:48,777
Park Do Ra,

29
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:52,967
looking at you up close like this today

30
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:56,137
made me realize you have very pretty eyes.

31
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:58,857
Your pupils are very dark.

32
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,077
What happens if I fall into your dark pupils?

33
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,397
Is there an exit?

34
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:09,037
Thank you for calling me pretty, Oppa.

35
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:14,587
Seeing you up close makes me feel nervous, too.

36
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:16,957
You feel nervous?

37
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,917
Any woman would feel nervous in front of you.

38
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:25,337
To be honest, I'm doing "Straightforward Romance" because of you.

39
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,197
- Because of me? 
 - Yes.

40
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:32,947
I was initially going to take a break, but they said you're the male lead.

41
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,057
That's why I'm doing it.

42
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:39,037
Because you were my ideal type.

43
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:44,467
 What's Park Do Ra trying to do? 

44
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,487
I'm your ideal type?

45
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:49,167
That's what I'm telling you.

46
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:56,647
But being in the same project as a couple...

47
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,967
feels like a dream to me.

48
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,477
Really?

49
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:04,917
Gosh, to be honest,

50
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,997
I've been keeping an eye on you, too.

51
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:11,717
Then...

52
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,687
should we try dating?

53
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,227
What?

54
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:22,657
Oppa, you can't do this, can you?

55
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:25,637
I heard you're seeing someone.

56
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:35,487
Oppa, do you know what I hate the most in the world?

57
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,397
Two-timing.

58
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:43,127
You're not the two-timing type, are you?

59
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:48,267
Hey, I'm not! I hate two-timing, too.

60
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:55,957
Okay. Do Ra, I know exactly what you're talking about.

61
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,467
Let's toast our glasses for that.

62
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,987
Cheers.

63
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:05,497
Wow, Park Do Ra is such a fox.

64
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,917
Didn't she tell us she hated Cha Bong Soo?

65
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:14,787
They need to play a couple going forward. It's good they're getting close.

66
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:18,007
You forced them to get close to each other.

67
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,977
She really is a pro.

68
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:23,697
There was a reason why everyone wanted her.

69
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,057
We don't have to worry about our drama anymore.

70
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,917
They're already on fire from day one.

71
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,567
Geez. Seriously, what a mess.

72
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:41,317
What's wrong with Park Do Ra, anyway?

73
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:44,377
She's crazy. She's out of her mind.

74
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,207
She's not the person I knew as a kid.

75
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:51,347
She's not even my younger sister.

76
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:54,607
I don't care if she does a Love Shot with Cha Bong Soo or feeds him a cherry.

77
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:57,197
It has nothing to do with me. Whatever.

78
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,787
Dang it!

79
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:05,137
- Isn't it tasty? 
 - It's so tasty.

80
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:07,307
- Eat a lot. 
 - It's nice and sweet.

81
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,007
I'm home.

82
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,687
- Gosh. 
 - Welcome home.

83
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,157
My Pil Sung came home just in time.

84
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:16,037
Have a seat and have some red bean porridge.

85
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:18,997
Red bean porridge? Is today a special day?

86
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:22,177
Here. Have some.

87
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:25,047
It's hot. Eat slowly.

88
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,357
Red bean porridge. It's been so long.

89
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:31,167
It's tastier since we haven't had it in a while. It's not too sweet.

90
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,637
- Right, Pil Sung? 
 - Yes, Auntie.

91
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:36,657
Eating this is making me feel rejuvenated.

92
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,467
Who's calling at this hour?

93
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:45,797
It's a friend of mine.

94
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:47,987
Yes, Hae Sook.

95
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:52,577
Yes, I hate to tell you this, but...

96
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:57,157
Pil Sung doesn't seem to be interested in dating yet.

97
00:06:58,027 --> 00:07:02,937
Since his job at the broadcasting station is so demanding, he wants to focus on that for now.

98
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:07,027
Yes. It's a shame, but what can we do?

99
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:09,747
Thank you for thinking of him.

100
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,347
Okay, bye.

101
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:14,667
Did Pil Sung get a blind date?

102
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,677
Who is it that you rejected without even asking Pil Sung?

103
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:22,357
My friend's cousin's daughter is a bank teller.

104
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:26,077
She wanted to introduce her because I said Pil Sung works at a broadcasting station.

105
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,707
But I said it's okay.

106
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:32,737
Hey, isn't a bank teller the best job for a future wife?

107
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:35,617
Grandma, I'm not interested in dating yet.

108
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:37,077
I have no time, either.

109
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:41,057
Yes, Pil Sung. Just focus on work for now.

110
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:47,757
Soo Yeon said she'll set you up with a woman from an impressive family once you become a director.

111
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,687
What are you talking about now, Mom?

112
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:53,567
Hey, did the friend from a chaebol family say that?

113
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:58,137
Yes, she'll find a woman from a good family and marry off our Pil Sung.

114
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,087
She even pinky-sweared me.

115
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:06,117
My gosh. My gosh. The chaebol wife even pinky-sweared you...

116
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:10,807
Pil Sung might end up a son-in-law of a wealthy family.

117
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,997
Why are you all getting so excited already?

118
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:15,667
And why would Soo Yeon marry me off?

119
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,987
I'll find my match myself.

120
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:21,347
Please stop worrying, everyone.

121
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:22,837
How could we not worry?

122
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,617
Countless men ruined their lives by choosing the wrong women.

123
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:30,267
Be careful of women at all times. Remember what I said, okay?

124
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,477
Mom, don't you worry about stuff like that.

125
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:36,287
Women are not my priority in my life right now.

126
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:40,827
No matter how careful, you're screwed if you end up with the wrong woman.

127
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:44,467
My goodness. A rich family in my friend's friend's neighborhood

128
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:48,167
had a woman come by who was supposedly pregnant by their son.

129
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:52,647
So, they had no choice but to get them married. But they found it still so strange.

130
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,717
Gosh, why?

131
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,667
- It wasn't his child? 
 - It's not that.

132
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:03,037
The son was very careful since the mother taught him all about contraception.

133
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,647
So, she was curious about how she got pregnant.

134
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:10,497
It turns out that she wanted to join a rich family that

135
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:13,567
she put a hole in the condom to get pregnant.

136
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,627
My gosh. My gosh. My gosh!

137
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:18,277
- Gosh, Mom. 
 - Unni.

138
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:19,767
What?

139
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,497
It's true.

140
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:24,437
- Geez. 
 - How could that happen?

141
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:44,347
 Race. 

142
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:49,077
 Gosh, Noonim. You don't even have a bullet. What do you mean by "race"? 

143
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,037
 Why don't you just go all in with that? 

144
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:55,167
 Hey. Of course, I have a bullet. 

145
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,887
 Do you know how much this costs? 

146
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,087
 - All in. 
 - Okay. 

147
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:00,737
 Deal. 

148
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,257
 Let me see. 

149
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:08,757
 Hey. 

150
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,907
 Wow... 

151
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:16,307
 Hey, hey, hold on, Noonim. 

152
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:27,727
 Aigoo, it's been fun, Noonim. 

153
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:29,957
 Hey! 

154
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,567
 Bring me the money. I'll take a loan. 

155
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,437
 I'll take a loan, I said. 

156
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:58,987
What was that?

157
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:00,597
That dream again?

158
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:05,117
I'm about to go crazy already. He always spooks me out of nowhere.

159
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:08,017
That annoying old man. Seriously!

160
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:10,577
When... When will you leave me alone?

161
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:15,737
When? When? That stupid old man!

162
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:20,867
Gosh, I need to pay at least the interest on the loan by next month.

163
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:26,407
If something happens to the building in Cheongdam or this house,

164
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:28,297
Do Ra will never forgive me.

165
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,767
What do I do?

166
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,087
What am I going to do? What do I do?

167
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,597
What do I do? What do I do?

168
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,687
What should I do? What to do...

169
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:45,937
Gong Jin Dan, should you be working out leisurely right now?

170
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,587
We need to talk.

171
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:50,677
Why do we need to talk again? Let's talk later.

172
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,007
I need to take a shower and go to work.

173
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:56,097
Did you really tell the daughter of Jeil Steel that you met the love of your life?

174
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:59,107
You could've just turned her down. Why did you have to say such nonsense?

175
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:01,107
Who says that on a blind date?

176
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:02,527
What will you do now?

177
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:07,827
You need trusty in-laws to demand Angel Investment from your brother.

178
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,837
Mom, just wait. I met a good woman.

179
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:15,047
She's way more exciting than the daughter of Jeil Steel.

180
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:18,807
What? Is that true? Were you serious?

181
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,977
Gosh, which family is she from?

182
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,657
What's her wealth ranking? Is she higher up?

183
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:27,757
I can't tell you now. I'll tell you everything later.

184
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:29,267
Later when?

185
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:32,277
Can't you tell me now? I'm dying to know.

186
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,737
Geez, I told you to wait a bit.

187
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:37,207
I'll go take a shower, Mom.

188
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:43,127
Of course. He isn't totally senseless.

189
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,987
Anyway, we need to take over Angel Investment quickly

190
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:51,547
so he won't feel inferior to the woman's family.

191
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,527
Gosh, you scared me!

192
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,147
Gosh, Ma Ri.

193
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:59,877
Why were you standing behind me silently?

194
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,537
Were you eavesdropping like a ghost?

195
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:08,897
Mom! The mistress wants to take Angel Investment!

196
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:15,477
Jin Dan, is it true that you invested in a TV drama?

197
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,167
Yes.

198
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:23,217
Gosh, Jin Dan. Why would you invest in something so useless?

199
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:28,117
It's not useless. People invest a lot in media content these days.

200
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:32,957
You need to see the big picture and invest in something secure.

201
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:36,347
Don't be tempted by stuff like that.

202
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:41,837
Hyung, it's true that I've been nothing but a disappointment to you,

203
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:44,917
but please trust me for now.

204
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,377
I'll make it work somehow.

205
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,217
I'll go to work now.

206
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:05,357
Jin Taek Oppa... I mean, Chairman Gong,

207
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,637
Korean Wave is huge these days.

208
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:11,767
Korean TV dramas, movies, music, and K-contents are huge internationally.

209
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,357
I'm sure Jin Dan had a plan, too.

210
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:21,037
Dad, Mom, is Angel Investment Uncle's, by the way?

211
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,747
Ma Ri.

212
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,417
Why are you asking that? You don't have to know.

213
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,577
Mom, I know these things, too.

214
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:34,597
Don't treat me like an idiot.

215
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:37,597
Dad, you said everything we own is mine.

216
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:40,897
You said I'm your successor.

217
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:44,337
So, I need to know everything, too. Right, Dad?

218
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,277
Yes, of course.

219
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:52,147
Of course. I'll explain everything little by little.

220
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:56,647
Do you want to come to the office with me like you used to?

221
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,297
Yes. Sounds good, Dad.

222
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,297
You must've been thirsty, Ma Ri.

223
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,027
Did you find his office boring?

224
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,057
Yes.

225
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:13,487
By the way, your work is so boring,

226
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:17,167
but how do you work every day without taking a break?

227
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,617
I find it fun.

228
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:24,757
And I need to work hard. The company has countless employees.

229
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,127
A sense of duty? Responsibility?

230
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,637
Gosh, Ma Ri. You saw that, right?

231
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,347
Our Ma Ri is a genius.

232
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,937
You're all grown up, Ma Ri.

233
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,087
I told you.

234
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,587
I know things I need to know.

235
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:44,567
What am I doing right now?

236
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:48,140
What do I do? I ruined my diet.

237
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,967
It's okay to eat this much.

238
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,347
You're so thin and pretty right now.

239
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,967
- You don't have to be on a diet. 
 - Yes, Ma Ri.

240
00:15:55,967 --> 00:16:00,317
You're perfectly pretty. Why go on a diet?

241
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,647
I don't know. I'm screwed.

242
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,917
- Where are you going? 
 - The restroom.

243
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,217
You don't have to come out.

244
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:08,117
Let's make this work. See you at the location.

245
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:11,297
Huh?

246
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,687
Hello.

247
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,407
Pil Sung.

248
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:21,047
H-Honey, it's Seon Yeong's son.

249
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:25,227
Oh, the fellow I met at the funeral?

250
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:28,367
Yes, hello.

251
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:32,877
He was a high school student then. You're a dashing young man now.

252
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,517
He got a job at a broadcasting station. He's a drama producer now.

253
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:37,447
Oh, really?

254
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,747
I enjoy dramas when I'm free, too.

255
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:41,737
I hope you make a lot of fun ones.

256
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,127
Yes, I will.

257
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:45,957
What brings you here?

258
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:50,097
I met some people for work. I'm about to leave now.

259
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,647
I'll leave you two alone. I'll get going now.

260
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,477
Okay, then.

261
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,767
Your friend, Seon Yeong...

262
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:05,037
must feel proud to have a son like that.

263
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,817
Yes. I think she does.

264
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,767
- I'll go to the restroom, too. 
 - Okay.

265
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:19,657
Did he leave already?

266
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:23,087
Yes, I'll talk to them. Okay.

267
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:26,417
Huh? Why did you come out?

268
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:30,047
Hey, I wanted to make a call.

269
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,347
Oh, I see.

270
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:35,757
You look a bit tired compared to the last time I saw you.

271
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:37,737
You're not sick or anything, right?

272
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:41,247
Not at all. I'm a bit too healthy.

273
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:44,137
I haven't cared for my skin since I've been busy.

274
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:47,107
I should apply facial masks and stuff like that.

275
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,177
I see.

276
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:52,677
I know you're busy, but take care of yourself. Eat well, too.

277
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:55,537
Yes, you should take care of your health, too.

278
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:57,777
Yes, thank you.

279
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,947
Get going. You seem busy.

280
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,447
Okay.

281
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:17,087
These flowers and wine were sent by Angel Investment's CEO Gong Jin Dan?

282
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:19,967
Yes, here's the business card. Have a look at it.

283
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,687
Are you sure you don't know this CEO?

284
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:25,457
I said I don't know him at all.

285
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,897
Anyway, I'm going to the film set.

286
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:30,247
Do Ra, Do Ra. Hey, hey, hey.

287
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,697
He invested in your drama, and

288
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:36,797
he sent these gifts, too. You should at least thank him.

289
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:40,577
Can't you take care of stuff like this for me? Please.

290
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,107
- I'll be back. 
 - Okay, see you.

291
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:45,847
- Okay, bye. 
 - Bye.

292
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:54,317
President Gong Jin Dan? What kind of person is he that he's so caring of Do Ra?

293
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,877
How strange.

294
00:18:56,877 --> 00:19:03,587
Maybe... Could he be... interested in Do Ra romantically?

295
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:13,277
   

296
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:21,717
Yes, this is Gong Jin Dan.

297
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,407
Hello, President Gong.

298
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:27,647
I'm Baek Mi Ja, the CEO of Dora Entertainment.

299
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:31,067
I'm Park Do Ra's mom, too.

300
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,247
Oh, yes. Hello, Ma'am.

301
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,257
You sent wine and flowers to our house, didn't you?

302
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:42,657
Yes, I did. I wanted to wish Ms. Park good luck with her first filming of our drama today.

303
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:44,927
Gosh, thank you so much, President Gong.

304
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:47,677
I was thinking of giving you a call, anyway.

305
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:52,847
I heard you worked hard to get Do Ra a good deal for the contract.

306
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:56,467
Thank you so much for everything, President Gong.

307
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:59,317
Don't mention it. I'm Ms. Park's fan, and...

308
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:02,107
I invested in the drama since I knew her true value.

309
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:03,647
Gosh, really?

310
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:07,987
She needs to hear these compliments herself.

311
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:10,627
Why don't we have dinner together sometime?

312
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,357
Yes, yes. We'll be available any time.

313
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,127
Yes, thank you, President Gong.

314
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,207
Yes, yes. Take care. Bye.

315
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:24,217
I thought he'd be older, but he sounds young.

316
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:27,267
Is he a young man?

317
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,817
What kind of person is CEO Gong of Angel Investment?

318
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:39,157
Oh, my.

319
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,727
Wow!

320
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,167
- He'll be here later. 
 - Okay.

321
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,767
Sunbae, something bad happened. There was a car accident at the opening of the alley.

322
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:56,307
A truck collapsed. The sprinkler truck can't come in.

323
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:59,557
What? What am I supposed to do?

324
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,477
What do you want me to do?

325
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,127
Action!

326
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:20,167
Cold! Cold!

327
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,367
Cut. Cut. NG!

328
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:24,237
Pil Sung! Can't you do it right?

329
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:27,087
Got it! I'm sorry!

330
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:38,417
Cut! Cut! Cut! NG! NG! Why did it stop raining?

331
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:41,777
Let's fill up the can for a moment. Put more water in here.

332
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:44,037
You need to fill it up if you run out.

333
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,617
How can you stop right there?

334
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:48,437
Okay, okay. Let's try again.

335
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,857
Cut. Okay!

336
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:12,197
Thank you.

337
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,747
Well, Do Ra, by the way—

338
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:18,177
I knew the sprinkler truck couldn't come, but still...

339
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:21,577
Bong Soo, people travel to Mars these days.

340
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:25,757
How can we film while someone's sprinkling water by hand?

341
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:29,097
The assistant director and staff must be tired, right?

342
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,227
Huh? Yes, yes...

343
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,617
- The next scene! 
 - Yes, Director!

344
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:36,237
Oppa, I'll go get changed.

345
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:39,417
Yes, okay. Okay.

346
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,621
We're almost done.

347
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:45,611
Do you need anything else, Noona?

348
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,171
- Something hot. 
 - Something hot?

349
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:50,061
Hot iced Americano?

350
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:52,611
Okay, okay. I'll be right back.

351
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,591
Assistant Director.

352
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,201
Assistant Director?

353
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:12,131
You must be tired from sprinkling water with a watering can.

354
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,801
Not at all.

355
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,001
What?

356
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,161
I was trying to be nice, but he wouldn't even look at me.

357
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:23,741
What's wrong with the curly-haired assistant director?

358
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,371
Is he mad at me?

359
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:34,711
Why is he coming over?

360
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,581
Do Ra.

361
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:47,071
What is it?

362
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:49,811
Did you see the text I sent you earlier?

363
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:52,161
I sent you the address of a Japanese restaurant.

364
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,481
Address of a Japanese restaurant?

365
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:58,281
No, I didn't see it. I put my phone on silence.

366
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:01,841
We'll be done for the day after just two scenes.

367
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:04,441
Let's meet there later.

368
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,681
I reserved a room for us.

369
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,381
A room?

370
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:16,381
Well, something urgent came up. I can't have dinner.

371
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:24,441
Bong Soo, the thing is—

372
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:26,451
Hey, Park Do Ra! Cha Bong Soo!

373
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:29,421
Hey, what are you two doing right now?

374
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:32,251
Park Do Ra, you bitch!

375
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,841
Park Do Ra, you're dead today!

376
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,531
- Please let go! 
 - Let go of him!

377
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:40,981
Hey, hey! Stop.

378
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,281
Bi Bi, let go of him first.

379
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,671
Let go. Let go first, Bi Bi.

380
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:52,751
Park Do Ra, you seduced Bong Soo first, didn't you?

381
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:55,571
You took my work, and you're stealing my man now?

382
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:57,381
You little bitch!

383
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:59,381
Please don't do this on set.

384
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,081
Let's just talk. Just talk.

385
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:03,821
Hey, what are you talking about, Bi Bi?

386
00:25:03,821 --> 00:25:06,361
T-There's nothing going on between us.

387
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:09,491
I'm not interested in Bong Soo. Not even a tiny bit.

388
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:13,611
There's nothing going on? You're not interested?

389
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,081
Is that true? Aren't you?

390
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,131
No, what are you talking about?

391
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:20,311
M-Maybe there's another woman?

392
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,761
Hey, Cha Bong Soo. What happened?

393
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,651
Who is it? Who did you dump me for?

394
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,891
You said it was for Park Do Ra!

395
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:38,311
Hey, Park Do Ra. Say something.

396
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:42,171
What am I supposed to say, Oppa?

397
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,991
Bi Bi, it's not me. I swear. Not even the tiniest bit.

398
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:48,461
Hey, Cha Bong Soo.

399
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,331
How could you do this to me?

400
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:54,051
You should've just said you don't like me!

401
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,411
Son of a bitch.

402
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:59,481
Hey, hey, Bi Bi. Bi Bi. Bi Bi!

403
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,001
Bi Bi, Bi Bi! Bi Bi, listen to me.

404
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,321
It wasn't because I didn't like you—

405
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,791
You son of a bitch!

406
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:10,871
You and I are over as of now!

407
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:43,941
Hey, Park Do Ra.

408
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:48,561
You made it sound like you'd date me if I broke up with her.

409
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,501
Why are you denying it now?

410
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:53,541
Why are you making me look stupid?

411
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,471
When did I?

412
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,601
When did I ask you to go out with me?

413
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,111
What are you talking about?

414
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:07,461
You said you don't like two-timers.

415
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,491
That's why I broke up with Bi Bi!

416
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:11,051
When did I tell you to break up with her?

417
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:13,931
I just said I don't like two-timers.

418
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:16,271
Does saying that mean I want to date you?

419
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:19,621
Am I not even supposed to say that?

420
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:22,861
You said it felt like a dream working with me.

421
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:25,581
I was just saying I was happy to be working with you.

422
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:28,141
That doesn't mean I want to date you.

423
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:33,321
Seriously, you're so funny, Oppa.

424
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:35,991
You're totally overreacting, Oppa.

425
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:39,201
You, &amp;%$@!

426
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,611
Oppa.

427
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,731
Did you swear at me just now?

428
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,881
Yes, you...

429
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:51,551
You asked for it.

430
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:53,091
Hey, are you done talking?

431
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,721
Hey, say that again.

432
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,911
- Come back here. 
 - Please calm down.

433
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,641
- Hey, are you done talking? Huh? 
 - Calm down. Calm down.

434
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,021
You little bitch! Come here.

435
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:05,121
Director! I can't work with an asshole like him. I won't!

436
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:07,301
How dare you call someone that?

437
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,711
What? Asshole? You're the asshole.

438
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:12,101
Come here, asshole. Come here. Come here.

439
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,731
- Come here. 
 - Did you call me an asshole right now?

440
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:15,631
You're the asshole, you cheater.

441
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,501
Come here. Let go. Let go.

442
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,761
Don't you know I'm your senior? Get over here!

443
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:21,241
You asshole. Come here.

444
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,931
Hey! Get over here!

445
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:34,061
What the hell is going on right now?

446
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,091
I can't do this anymore.

447
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,831
Hey, cancel the shoot today. Cancel it!

448
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:42,451
Shit!

449
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,431
And...

450
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,721
Geez, seriously.

451
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:01,041
You're always on your laptop trying to write.

452
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:04,571
Will money or a man come out of this?

453
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:08,091
Gosh, Mom. Don't talk to me.

454
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:13,821
Mom! What's wrong with you?

455
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,041
You think anyone can be a drama writer?

456
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,231
Get your head out of the clouds.

457
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:23,171
If you couldn't make it for over 10 years, you never will.

458
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:26,871
It's not too late to take the civil servant exam.

459
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:28,901
You need to have something to show for.

460
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:32,371
So you can be on blind dates and get married, too.

461
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,501
Mom, please leave me alone.

462
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,731
Do you think the civil servant exam is easy?

463
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,141
Aigoo, aigoo. What a fool. An utter fool.

464
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:44,161
Didn't you hear what Seon Yeong said?

465
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:47,181
I don't know whose daughter she is, but she's so clever.

466
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:51,191
She put a hole in a condom to join a rich family.

467
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,831
But you're always sitting in front of your laptop.

468
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:56,581
When will you stop wasting your life away?

469
00:29:56,581 --> 00:29:58,061
Well...

470
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:05,861
Putting a hole in a condom is... a crime, Mom.

471
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,481
Doesn't she have any self-respect?

472
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:09,611
I'll never hold onto a man like that.

473
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,451
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

474
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:14,321
Don't say that when you've never even seen a man.

475
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:17,721
Just go out and date any man.

476
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:20,871
Instead of messing with stuff like this.

477
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:25,151
You'll turn 40, 50, and have menopause soon.

478
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:27,571
What will you do then?

479
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:30,921
Seeing you getting old like this...

480
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:35,131
It's so hard for me to just watch it.

481
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,071
Gosh, seriously.

482
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:43,991
Don't you dare come back home before you see a man, okay?

483
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,411
Joo Hee, let's get married.

484
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:18,911
Oppa, did you suggest getting married just now?

485
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,371
- With me? 
 - Yes.

486
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,121
Why? You don't want to?

487
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:24,811
Of course, I don't.

488
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:28,491
Oppa, I'm only 23 years old.

489
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:30,541
You're way older than me.

490
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,121
Don't you have any conscience?

491
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:34,241
What?

492
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:38,201
I dated you because you're sweet and nice to me,

493
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:40,691
but this is too much pressure on me.

494
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,971
And I have a boyfriend.

495
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,651
That's why I wanted to see you today.

496
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:11,551
Yes. Go, then!

497
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:19,131
I, Park Do Sik, don't stop anyone from coming or leaving.

498
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:23,521
Go ahead and leave...

499
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:27,981
if you want to.

500
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,471
Huh?

501
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:43,501
What's this?

502
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:55,021
Wow, you're so shiny and pretty.

503
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:59,151
By the way, where did you come from?

504
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,411
Excuse me.

505
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,131
Did you throw away this sparkly thing?

506
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:22,861
Do you mind if I keep it?

507
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:27,111
No, I threw it away. Keep it if you want to.

508
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:30,791
By the way, you'll let me drink some of that, right?

509
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:38,951
So you got dumped by a way younger woman today?

510
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:41,011
Gosh, my goodness.

511
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:43,711
This sounds just like a romantic comedy.

512
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:46,621
Gosh, what do we do? What do we do?

513
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,001
What's so funny? I'm dead serious right now.

514
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,941
Just think about it.

515
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:54,071
A handsome man.

516
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:56,871
And a woman who rejected him coldly.

517
00:33:56,871 --> 00:34:00,801
That's definitely a romantic comedy.

518
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:03,351
It's not a tragedy where you cry endlessly.

519
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:05,241
Don't you agree?

520
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,701
Yes, a rom-com.

521
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:12,111
By the way, am I really handsome?

522
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,461
Yes, totally.

523
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:18,601
I'd never dump a man like you.

524
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:21,941
Even if it turns into an old-fashioned tragedy.

525
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:27,141
You and I seem to have something in common.

526
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,381
Right? Right?

527
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:32,661
You and I actually seem to have a lot in common.

528
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,111
Do you want to be friends?

529
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:36,131
Let's be friends and...

530
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:39,821
Yes. Let's meet every Wednesday.

531
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:42,031
Friends...

532
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,401
Okay, sounds good.

533
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,431
Give me your phone number.

534
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,001
Okay.

535
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:53,761
My phone number. Done.

536
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:57,901
Okay.

537
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:02,601
To celebrate our new friendship...

538
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:07,600
A red rose on Wednesdays!

539
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:11,601
A red rose on Wednesdays!

540
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,971
   

541
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,771
 Who's this woman? 

542
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:47,911
 Gosh, you've got to be kidding me. 

543
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,561
Did you sleep well?

544
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:11,601
Yes. Yes.

545
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,011
W-Where are you going?

546
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,871
I'm late for work. I can't be late.

547
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,621
I'm sorry. I'll be in touch.

548
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:29,221
Well, excuse me...

549
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:37,911
I suppose it's kind of embarrassing to face each other.

550
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:51,251
Gosh, what are you doing, Mom?

551
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:55,011
I-I swear I slept at Seon Mi's.

552
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:58,781
What? Y-You slept at Seon Mi's?

553
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,821
Gosh, gosh, seriously.

554
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:05,011
Do you know how many times I talked to Seon Mi over the phone?

555
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,061
But you say you slept at Seon Mi's?

556
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:12,411
Gosh, you little. You're lying to your mom now?

557
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:17,521
O-Okay, I'll tell you the truth.

558
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,231
Mom.

559
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,581
- Here. 
 - What?

560
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:26,551
Look at it.

561
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:27,901
What's this?

562
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:32,731
My gosh. My... Hey... T-This ring...

563
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:36,271
Hey, who gave this to you?

564
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:41,621
- A-A man. 
 - A-A man?

565
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:46,691
You... Were you... with a man last night?

566
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:48,941
Yes.

567
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,981
I finally made your dream come true.

568
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:57,281
My gosh. My gosh, Myeong Dong!

569
00:37:57,281 --> 00:38:01,271
Myeong Dong! Aigoo, my baby. Aigoo.

570
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:03,441
Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate.

571
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,581
Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate.

572
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:09,011
Aigoo, my baby.

573
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,101
Geez.

574
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:19,241
I was shocked because of Joo Hee, but she's a stranger.

575
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:23,641
Gosh, seriously. I'm crazy. I'm crazy. Geez!

576
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,581
You crazy bastard.

577
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:36,471
 Leave... 

578
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:44,681
 Excuse me, did you throw away this sparkly thing? 

579
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:47,111
No way. How could I...

580
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:56,651
It's gone.

581
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:58,681
The diamond ring is gone.

582
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,921
That cost me a fortune.

583
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:22,448
- Mom. 
 - Huh?

584
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:25,848
This can't be real, right?

585
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:27,828
Why is it so shiny, then?

586
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:29,918
Hey, give it to me.

587
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,528
Give me.

588
00:39:35,638 --> 00:39:39,908
Hey, it's real. It's real.

589
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:42,338
Are you sure it's real?

590
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:48,188
A diamond this size must cost about 50 million.

591
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:53,148
How rich is he that he got such a big diamond?

592
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,378
Fifty million...

593
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:58,528
Not 5,000 won, but 50 million won?

594
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:00,068
Really?

595
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:02,778
Yes.

596
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,678
Mom. 
    

597
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:07,568
I-It's him. It's him.

598
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:09,328
What do I do?

599
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:11,548
What do you mean? Answer right now.

600
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:13,338
Answer. Answer.

601
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,018
Yes, it's me.

602
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:21,618
Yes, where are you right now?

603
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,548
We need to meet now. Right now.

604
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,378
Now?

605
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:33,668
Yes, I'll be on the way now.

606
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:36,328
W-What did he say? Does he want to see you?

607
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:37,968
Yes.

608
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,998
He wanted to meet right now.

609
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:44,528
He must miss me already.

610
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:51,138
We could've met after you got off work.

611
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,268
Did you miss me already?

612
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:59,348
The thing is... well...

613
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,118
Well...

614
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:13,208
could you give me your hand?

615
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:16,088
My hand?

616
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:17,638
Yes.

617
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,388
Here.

618
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:33,808
What are you doing? Why are you removing the ring?

619
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:35,478
Give me the ring.

620
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:37,958
Why? Y-You gave it to me.

621
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:42,018
No, it's not a ring for you.

622
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:44,928
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:47,928
It's too valuable, so...

624
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:52,228
Didn't you give me that since we decided to date?

625
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:54,348
No way!

626
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:04,008
We made a mistake last night because we were drunk.

627
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:07,468
You can't take a mistake like that seriously. We're adults.

628
00:42:09,368 --> 00:42:12,038
And I didn't do it alone.

629
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:15,440
We... did it with your consent.

630
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,270
Well... it looks like you're old enough, too.

631
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,148
I'm sure you could understand.

632
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,598
Anyway, I'm sorry.

633
00:42:26,598 --> 00:42:29,038
I'll get going now.

634
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,328
A mistake?

635
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:40,548
It was just a mistake?

636
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:47,298
My head.

637
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:53,418
 What did you say? 

638
00:42:53,418 --> 00:42:54,828
 Several months? 

639
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:56,808
 O-Okay, okay. 

640
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:59,048
 I'll pay you back, okay? I... 

641
00:42:59,048 --> 00:43:02,708
 I'll pay you back in full within this month. 

642
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:09,948
Where will I get more money?

643
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:12,198
I can't take out more loans, either.

644
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:15,710
Gosh, what do I do? My head...

645
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:19,488
You want the payment for Ms. Park in advance?

646
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:23,048
Yes, I know I'm asking too much,

647
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:27,168
but the company needs funds urgently.

648
00:43:27,168 --> 00:43:30,308
Would it be possible, President Kim?

649
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,718
All right. I can do that.

650
00:43:33,718 --> 00:43:35,528
Really?

651
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:38,248
Thank you. Thank you, President Kim.

652
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:42,358
"Straightforward Romance" was funded thanks to Ms. Park.

653
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:47,868
If it wasn't for her, our main investor, Angel Investment, wouldn't have invested.

654
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:50,008
We should be thanking you.

655
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,198
Please don't tell Do Ra that you paid us in advance.

656
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:58,678
I don't want her to worry while filming.

657
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:02,018
Okay, I won't. Don't worry.

658
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:07,088
My gosh. My gosh...

659
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:08,888
Gosh, I did it. I did it.

660
00:44:08,888 --> 00:44:14,158
I'll use her pay for the drama for now and... figure out a solution somehow.

661
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:24,588
Who is it?

662
00:44:24,588 --> 00:44:27,558
 President Gong Jin Dan sent packages. 

663
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:30,268
President Gong Jin Dan did?

664
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:33,248
My goodness. What are these flowers for?

665
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:36,018
Wow, what's all this?

666
00:44:39,188 --> 00:44:42,328
This is a Charmes purse.

667
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:44,648
Wow.

668
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:50,918
This is a limited-edition Charmes purse.

669
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:56,888
Wow. He sent a purse that cost over 20 million won.

670
00:44:58,498 --> 00:45:02,818
What's with this President Gong?

671
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:07,958
I'm busy memorizing the script because I'm shooting a lot today.

672
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,758
Who are we meeting, exactly?

673
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:12,128
The CEO of Angel Investment.

674
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:16,218
We should meet him at least once and thank him. He's so nice to you.

675
00:45:16,218 --> 00:45:17,498
What?

676
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:21,338
Did you tell me to get makeup done to meet him?

677
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:24,348
And why did you plan to meet him without asking me?

678
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:26,918
If I asked you, you would've gotten out of it somehow.

679
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:28,528
You have to eat, too, anyway.

680
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:31,528
Mom! I'm busy shooting today, I said.

681
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:35,778
Okay. Just say hello to him and leave, then.

682
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:42,148
And he sent the limited-edition Charmes purse, too.

683
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:44,518
He even gave you a blank check to boost your morale.

684
00:45:44,518 --> 00:45:46,828
You should at least say hello!

685
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:52,008
People will call you rude if you take things without acknowledging them.

686
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:54,988
We'll keep it brief, then.

687
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:57,918
I'm shooting a lot of important emotional scenes today.

688
00:45:57,918 --> 00:46:00,778
Okay. Okay, I said.

689
00:46:00,778 --> 00:46:07,408
Hey, for your information, President Gong is the second eldest son of APP Group.

690
00:46:07,408 --> 00:46:11,158
So don't be grumpy and smile. Okay?

691
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:17,108
It won't hurt to be nice to him, okay?

692
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,708
Okay.

693
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,368
That little brat. Seriously!

694
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,098
Hello.

695
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:32,268
I'm Gong Jin Dan.

696
00:46:32,268 --> 00:46:35,028
My gosh, hello.

697
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:37,648
Hello.

698
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:42,898
We met in front of the shop—

699
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:44,468
Yes, that's correct.

700
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,818
You remembered me.

701
00:46:46,818 --> 00:46:49,738
Gosh, did you know each other?

702
00:46:49,738 --> 00:46:53,828
Gosh, what a crazy coincidence.

703
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:04,518
President Gong, thank you so much.

704
00:47:04,518 --> 00:47:09,538
You care so much for Do Ra, paid her generously,

705
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:13,388
and sent her flowers and valuable gifts, too.

706
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:17,638
Saying thank you doesn't feel enough.

707
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:20,408
Not at all. It's my honor.

708
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:23,468
I've been Ms. Park's fan for a long time.

709
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,078
Oh, really?

710
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:32,178
Yes. I think I've watched most of the dramas she was in as a child actor.

711
00:47:32,178 --> 00:47:35,918
Including "My Nickname is Gangbuk Beauty" and "Let the Strong Wind Blow."

712
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:37,698
You watched "Let the Strong Wind Blow," too?

713
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:40,578
Yes, she was so good at North Korean accent.

714
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:44,088
I watched it every week, copying her accent.

715
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:48,848
"How did you travel so far?"

716
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:51,928
"I came because I missed you."

717
00:47:51,928 --> 00:47:54,248
"If you keep making me angry,

718
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:58,158
I'll mix up your ribs in a revolutionary way."

719
00:47:58,158 --> 00:47:59,848
My gosh.

720
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,378
Oh, okay.

721
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:08,698
- My gosh. It fell on your clothes. 
 - How did I drop this?

722
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:11,678
- President Gong, here. 
 - Thank you.

723
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:19,858
 Gosh, why is he checking Do Ra's reaction? 

724
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,468
 How cute. 

725
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:25,048
 Looks like he's interested in her. 

726
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:29,828
   

727
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:33,828
You're screwed, Gong Jin Dan.

728
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,608
Why did you do the North Korean accent, then?

729
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:40,958
Looking cool wouldn't have been enough, but I said, "You did this. You came."

730
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:43,788
And I said, "I'll mix up your ribs."

731
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:46,198
I did all sorts of embarrassing things.

732
00:48:46,198 --> 00:48:49,868
And I couldn't slice the steak properly, either.

733
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:54,928
She must've noticed that I was nervous.

734
00:48:54,928 --> 00:48:57,538
Gosh. How embarrassing.

735
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:08,188
But Park Do Ra was really pretty.

736
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:12,338
They had such an ugly fight.

737
00:49:12,338 --> 00:49:14,608
Will Park Do Ra and Cha Bong Soo come to the set today?

738
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:16,238
I bet 10,000 won that they won't.

739
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:17,968
How about you, Assistant Director?

740
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,048
They'll come.

741
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:22,378
They're pros hired for money. They have to come.

742
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:25,208
Here she comes. Here she comes.

743
00:49:39,538 --> 00:49:43,418
Ms. Park, thank you so much for coming.

744
00:49:43,418 --> 00:49:47,638
You and Director Hong came to my house and begged.

745
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:49,158
Of course, I had to.

746
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,428
And I'm the lead, too.

747
00:49:51,428 --> 00:49:54,828
You're definitely a pro, Ms. Park.

748
00:49:57,618 --> 00:49:59,738
Curly-haired director.

749
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:02,808
I want to apologize and thank you for yesterday.

750
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:04,748
- Pardon? 
 - Well...

751
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:08,228
Bi Bi grabbed your hair while you were protecting me.

752
00:50:09,138 --> 00:50:12,528
I don't know why she always grabs people's hair.

753
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:15,928
You must've lost a lot of hair. I'm sorry.

754
00:50:15,928 --> 00:50:18,988
It's okay. I have a lot of hair.

755
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:32,448
What...

756
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:34,018
What is it?

757
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,488
I mean... you said you had a lot of hair.

758
00:50:40,488 --> 00:50:43,388
I think I've heard that before.

759
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,498
Gosh, I'm so tired.

760
00:51:30,118 --> 00:51:33,178
Cha Bong Soo has a brain, at least.

761
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:36,368
He's chewing gum for the kiss scene.

762
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,188
He has manners, at least.

763
00:51:39,568 --> 00:51:43,698
We'll start shooting! Stand by! Stand by!

764
00:51:50,008 --> 00:51:51,698
Action!

765
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:42,528
What are you doing? So gross!

766
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:44,918
You crazy bitch.

767
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:46,798
How dare you slap my face?

768
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:48,528
Come here. Come here.

769
00:52:48,528 --> 00:52:50,468
Calm down. Calm down.

770
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:52,978
Director, he was eating garlic.

771
00:52:52,978 --> 00:52:56,248
You gross bastard. How dare you try to kiss after eating garlic?

772
00:52:56,248 --> 00:52:58,788
Let go. Let go. I'll finish you today, Park Do Ra.

773
00:52:58,788 --> 00:53:01,608
What? How? How?

774
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,868
Ms. Park,

775
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:22,358
look what happened because of you two.

776
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,628
We had to quit shooting yesterday

777
00:53:26,428 --> 00:53:28,298
and we're about to quit today, too.

778
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:30,098
That's because...

779
00:53:30,098 --> 00:53:34,848
Dozens of staff members prepared for the shoot since dawn,

780
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:37,008
but because of the two of you...

781
00:53:37,988 --> 00:53:41,088
This isn't right.

782
00:53:45,748 --> 00:53:50,648
And I'm not trying to defend Mr. Cha at all.

783
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:54,068
I was at the team outing then, too.

784
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:59,988
Your behavior definitely was misleading.

785
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:04,468
If that's what caused the misunderstanding,

786
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:08,178
I think it's important to straighten things out.

787
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:13,768
Ms. Park,

788
00:54:15,078 --> 00:54:20,108
countless people's fates depend on "Straightforward Romance."

789
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:23,668
For the countless staff members

790
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:27,218
and the viewers who are looking forward to it,

791
00:54:27,218 --> 00:54:33,348
could you make up with Mr. Cha today and get back to shooting?

792
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:36,828
I beg you.

793
00:54:48,088 --> 00:54:49,948
Okay.

794
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:56,738
Thinking about it, I think I was wrong, too.

795
00:54:56,738 --> 00:55:01,028
I'll apologize to Bong Soo.

796
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:03,598
R-Really?

797
00:55:03,598 --> 00:55:07,278
But he keeps swearing at me...

798
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:10,838
and tries to hit me and start a fight.

799
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:16,768
I'd like you to come with me when I apologize to him.

800
00:55:16,768 --> 00:55:19,468
Of course, I will.

801
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:21,228
Thank you.

802
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:25,838
So spicy.

803
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:34,908
What?

804
00:55:34,908 --> 00:55:36,608
Are you here to slap me again?

805
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:37,948
No.

806
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:44,758
Ms. Park is here to apologize to you, Mr. Cha.

807
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:47,798
What did you say?

808
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:53,078
Oppa, I'm so sorry for slapping you.

809
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:57,408
I did it in the heat of the moment, but...

810
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:01,428
I sincerely apologize.

811
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:07,418
And I did mislead you, too.

812
00:56:07,418 --> 00:56:10,528
I drank too much that night.

813
00:56:10,528 --> 00:56:14,408
I must've found you handsome because I was so drunk.

814
00:56:14,408 --> 00:56:18,348
I did confuse you by saying silly things.

815
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:24,438
But that was it. Nothing happened between us, right?

816
00:56:24,438 --> 00:56:27,248
I know I don't get along with Bi Bi,

817
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:29,688
but we've been colleagues for a long time.

818
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:33,658
It shouldn't have happened even if I liked you.

819
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:35,578
Anyway,

820
00:56:37,148 --> 00:56:40,968
I'm sorry for misleading you.

821
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:42,988
It's my fault.

822
00:56:44,378 --> 00:56:46,278
I apologize.

823
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,710
I'm sorry for swearing...

824
00:56:54,298 --> 00:56:56,038
at you, too.

825
00:56:57,048 --> 00:57:01,208
Of course. This is why you're big-name actors.

826
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:05,578
You generously apologized... and you accepted the apology generously, too.

827
00:57:05,578 --> 00:57:08,608
Is this why you're big-name actors?

828
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:13,488
We'll take a break for an hour and resume shooting.

829
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:15,158
Let's go!

830
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:17,838
Let's go!

831
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,398
Thank you.

832
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:36,978
You said you wanted to tell me something.

833
00:57:36,978 --> 00:57:39,608
What is it that makes you so hesitant?

834
00:57:39,608 --> 00:57:43,598
I get scared whenever you say you need to talk to me.

835
00:57:43,598 --> 00:57:49,258
Well, you know Myeong Soo, right? My high school classmate.

836
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:52,268
What about him?

837
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:56,538
By chance, you aren't saying you'll start a business, right?

838
00:57:56,538 --> 00:58:03,198
Apparently, used Korean phones are in huge demand in Vietnam.

839
00:58:03,198 --> 00:58:05,128
They sell like hotcakes.

840
00:58:05,128 --> 00:58:08,348
So, Myeong Soo figured out how to start the business.

841
00:58:08,348 --> 00:58:11,668
He said this would be a piece of cake.

842
00:58:11,668 --> 00:58:13,558
So...

843
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:20,258
why don't we borrow 200 million with this house as collateral?

844
00:58:20,258 --> 00:58:23,298
What are you talking about right now?

845
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:28,198
You borrowed 300 million with this house as collateral to start a business, but it totally failed.

846
00:58:28,198 --> 00:58:33,458
Pil Sung is paying back the loan amount and interest right now.

847
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:36,378
Don't you feel bad for Pil Sung at all?

848
00:58:36,378 --> 00:58:39,158
How could you bring up getting a loan again?

849
00:58:39,158 --> 00:58:42,948
That's why I'm trying to succeed and pay him back.

850
00:58:42,948 --> 00:58:44,538
Please help me just once more.

851
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:46,678
This one's guaranteed. I'm telling you.

852
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:49,408
Honey, please don't do this.

853
00:58:49,408 --> 00:58:52,458
I don't want anything from you.

854
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:57,348
Just don't do anything and sit still. Please.

855
00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:58,958
Hey.

856
00:58:59,858 --> 00:59:03,748
Seon Yeong, how could you be like this?

857
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:08,188
You should help wholeheartedly if the head of the household wants to do something.

858
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:10,628
But what? What did you say just now?

859
00:59:10,628 --> 00:59:14,688
Don't do anything and just stay in the room?

860
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:18,428
Is Hyeon Cheol a dead man? Why would he stay in the room?

861
00:59:19,648 --> 00:59:23,368
Mother, this house is all we have.

862
00:59:23,368 --> 00:59:27,188
We'd be out in the streets if we lost this, too.

863
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,678
Hey! You're acting superior because of this house,

864
00:59:30,678 --> 00:59:34,698
but before Hyeon Cheol got fired from his job five years ago,

865
00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:39,488
he's been feeding everyone in the family as the head of the household.

866
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:43,628
Your father bought this house under your name,

867
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:46,778
but Hyeon Cheol owns half of it, too.

868
00:59:46,778 --> 00:59:51,148
How could you act so superior for owning a house?

869
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:55,618
Mother, when did I act superior because of the house?

870
00:59:55,618 --> 00:59:58,858
It's because we need to protect this house, at least.

871
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:01,898
I'm saying this because we're on the topic.

872
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:07,738
I'm sorry to say this since he has passed, but I'm so disappointed in your father.

873
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:11,668
He let his son-in-law feed him while he was alive,

874
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:17,158
but how could he only put your name on the deed?

875
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:22,208
He had no problem giving that gold digger 30 million won!

876
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:26,528
Mom, why would you say that?

877
01:00:26,528 --> 01:00:30,398
- Geez. 
 - Hey, Hyeon Cheol... Hyeon Cheol.

878
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:33,778
Hyeon Cheol. Hyeon Cheol. Hyeon Cheol!

879
01:00:33,778 --> 01:00:35,818
 Hyeon Cheol! 

880
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:40,858
 Hyeon Cheol! 

881
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:54,328
My poor Hyeon Cheol.

882
01:00:55,658 --> 01:01:01,638
He's so intimidated by his wife because of his pathetic parents.

883
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:24,158
Yes. I need to get that money back, at least.

884
01:01:37,158 --> 01:01:39,698
Is this the right place?

885
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:48,348
Yes, this is it.

886
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:55,408
Hey, Ms. Baek.

887
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:04,258
Why are you so surprised?

888
01:02:04,878 --> 01:02:07,568
Did you see a ghost or something?

889
01:02:11,288 --> 01:02:14,408
I really don't want to do the kiss scene.

890
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:17,428
Gosh, what do we do?

891
01:02:17,428 --> 01:02:19,148
Should I do it in your place?

892
01:02:19,148 --> 01:02:21,058
Would you?

893
01:02:24,528 --> 01:02:26,758
Have some.

894
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:29,528
Assistant Director.

895
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:32,528
What's this?

896
01:02:32,528 --> 01:02:35,658
How did you know I was craving ice cream?

897
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:41,018
You apologized to Mr. Cha for our drama and you finished the difficult scene in one go.

898
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:44,968
So I wanted to thank you for that.

899
01:02:44,968 --> 01:02:49,418
I read that you eat ice cream whenever you feel down.

900
01:02:49,418 --> 01:02:51,688
I wanted to cheer you up.

901
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:53,868
My gosh.

902
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:58,888
I... I'm so moved right now.

903
01:02:59,778 --> 01:03:01,778
That's nothing.

904
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,328
I'll get going now, then.

905
01:03:07,008 --> 01:03:12,028
Excuse me. Assistant Director Go Pil Sung,

906
01:03:12,028 --> 01:03:15,618
thank you for everything.

907
01:03:15,618 --> 01:03:18,558
Gosh, it's nothing.

908
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:21,918
You've been helping and saving me.

909
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:25,268
At the club, when Bi Bi flipped out,

910
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,888
and when I almost got hit by Bong Soo.

911
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:34,888
Because my duty is to protect the female lead in our drama.

912
01:03:34,888 --> 01:03:39,178
I'll work hard on this project to return the favor to you.

913
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:41,328
So don't worry.

914
01:03:41,328 --> 01:03:44,498
I won't give you a hard time.

915
01:03:45,498 --> 01:03:49,708
Thank you so much. I'll work hard, too.

916
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:58,848
 It's okay. 

917
01:03:58,848 --> 01:04:01,268
 I have a lot of hair. 

918
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:04,098
Oh, right.

919
01:04:04,098 --> 01:04:08,228
Dae Chung Oppa said that a long time ago.

920
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,388
I wonder if Dae Chung Oppa is doing well.

921
01:04:16,388 --> 01:04:18,448
I wonder what he's up to.

922
01:04:19,978 --> 01:04:23,318
Ms. Park, get ready for the next scene.

923
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,498
Gosh, how strange.

924
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:32,748
Why does the curly-haired director remind me of Dae Chung Oppa?

925
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:42,838
Is it because his hair looks just like Dae Chung Oppa's?

926
01:04:44,158 --> 01:04:45,858
Hold on.

927
01:04:45,858 --> 01:04:48,268
Go Dae Chung.

928
01:04:48,268 --> 01:04:50,188
Go Pil Sung.

929
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:54,108
What? Even his last name is Go, too.

930
01:04:54,108 --> 01:04:56,880
We'll start shooting! Stand by!

931
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:05,890


932
01:05:05,898 --> 01:05:08,358
Let's go this way.

933
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:13,608
The air is nice outside, too.

934
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:18,008
Today is... perfect for the angry scene...

935
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:25,548
Assistant Director.

936
01:05:26,288 --> 01:05:27,568
Just one second.

937
01:05:27,568 --> 01:05:30,458
- I need to ask you something— 
 - Careful.

938
01:05:31,688 --> 01:05:39,788
♫  Ever since I got to know you, I learned about love  ♫

939
01:05:42,508 --> 01:05:51,238
♫  Paper crane, I learned about the sad dream  ♫

940
01:05:53,348 --> 01:05:56,268
   

941
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:04,508
♫  Ever since I got to know you, I learned about love  ♫

942
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:12,838
♫  Paper crane, I learned about the sad dream  ♫

943
01:06:14,618 --> 01:06:21,518
♫  One day, you handed it to me  ♫

944
01:06:22,888 --> 01:06:28,598
♫  A small paper crane  ♫

945
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:31,978
 Wait just a bit. I'll fund your business. 

946
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:33,418
 How would you possibly... 

947
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:36,938
 It's awful shooting with those ill-tempered people. 

948
01:06:36,938 --> 01:06:38,698
 What would I have done without you? 

949
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:40,328
 You'll become a hugely successful director. 

950
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:42,588
 He even gave me these flowers. 

951
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:46,088
 He went drag and played my body double so I don't get hurt. 

952
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:49,108
 Does the curly-haired director like me?
