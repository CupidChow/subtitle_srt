1
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:51,224
Gosh, hello, hello! The door was open. 
    

2
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:54,204
Gosh, I came by to apologize.

3
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:59,904
I was so rude last time because I was so upset.

4
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,834
I'm so sorry.

5
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:05,184
Is Director Go home, by chance?

6
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,584
- Mom! 
 - Huh?

7
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:13,734
Do Sik, why are you sitting there?

8
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:16,534
What? "Mom"?

9
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,524
Who's your mom?

10
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,324
I-Is she your mom?

11
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:26,150
Y-You're that woman's son?

12
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,920


13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,664
- Well, yes. S-She's my mom. 
 - My gosh!

14
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:37,574
So, the brother of the late Do Ra...

15
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:40,884
The middle schooler back then is you?

16
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:44,394
- Mom, Mom, Mom! 
 - Mother!

17
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:47,274
Do Sik, is that true?

18
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,084
By chance, did you know who I was from the beginning?

19
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:54,534
No, I just found out here, too. I swear I had no idea.

20
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,864
You little! Are you seeing this old woman?

21
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:00,434
Is that why you were sitting here just now?

22
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:03,724
Who are you calling "old woman" right now?

23
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,474
Mom, she's not an old woman.

24
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:08,894
But still! Why would you date a woman from this awful family?

25
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:13,184
My gosh. Come out. Come out!

26
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,304
I'm home.

27
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:18,704
Myeong Dong, I'll call you later. I really didn't know. You're mistaken!

28
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,434
Hey! Myeong Dong!

29
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:21,834
Hyeon Cheol! Go get Myeong Dong!

30
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:25,184
- Hey, hey! Myeong Dong! 
 - Where are you going?

31
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:29,834
Gosh! My gosh! How? How?

32
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:32,684
Why would you date an old woman like her?

33
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,744
Do Sik! Do Sik!

34
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:36,654
How dare you call my son's name?

35
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:38,164
You'd better stop seeing him.

36
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,594
Hey, Myeong Dong. She took the words right out of my mouth.

37
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:44,504
You bastard. You'd better not show up in front of Myeong Dong. Got it?

38
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,574
Why are you talking to Do Sik like that, Oppa?

39
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,154
You'd better go inside now!

40
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:51,104
Please don't scold Myeong Dong. She didn't do anything wrong.

41
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,454
"Myeong Dong"? You think she's your younger sister? You bastard.

42
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:57,294
My gosh. Don't be so proud that she's old. Seriously. Let's go.

43
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,204
- I'll call you. 
 - You have to, okay?

44
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,714
- Go inside! 
 - Oh, my!

45
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:07,624
W-What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a person before?

46
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:10,114
Don't pick a fight. A country bumpkin better stay out of it.

47
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:12,634
- Let's hurry up and go! 
 - Hey, hey!

48
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:15,234
Hey! Hey! Go away!

49
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:16,884
Go away, you bastards!

50
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:20,864
You bastards! How dare you try to steal my daughter?

51
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,354
Wow...

52
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,244
What's going on?

53
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:32,444
She was bringing him in so happily earlier.

54
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:33,784
Let's see.

55
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:38,894
So, the man Myeong Dong was dating was the crazy woman's son?

56
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:41,894
Wow, daebak.

57
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:46,174
How did she end up with the scumbag's son?

58
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:49,534
Gosh, I'm against this, too. Nope.

59
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:56,704
By the way, have I seen that man somewhere?

60
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,884
He looks a bit familiar.

61
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:01,864
Hey, hey! You bastard! Park Do Sik!

62
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:04,494
You're out of your mind.

63
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:09,284
I know we went bankrupt, but how could you date that pathetic old woman?

64
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:12,224
She was a college student when you were in middle school!

65
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,814
It's not like we walk around with our age on our foreheads.

66
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,724
And I never felt like she was older.

67
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,174
So, stop calling her a pathetic old woman and stuff like that!

68
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,744
What did you say now? My gosh!

69
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,834
Gosh, listen to you.

70
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:29,194
I called her "Noonim" at first since she looked older, too.

71
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,164
But she felt like my little sister as I started seeing her.

72
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:34,494
She doesn't seem older, and I want to protect her. What am I supposed to do?

73
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,164
And you saw her. She's pretty, too.

74
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:39,024
She looks much younger than her age.

75
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:41,614
What? She's like your little sister?

76
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,674
Wow, you're out of your mind.

77
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:47,114
Okay, fine. You didn't know before.

78
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:50,044
But now you know who she is. Break up with her immediately.

79
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:51,344
Call it quits.

80
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:54,884
Our families are enemies. She's our enemy's daughter.

81
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:57,504
How can I break up when I love her? How do I call it quits?

82
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:01,004
It was really hard for us to get together, okay?

83
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,474
Are you really my son?

84
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:06,274
Do you know what those women did to me?

85
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,004
Go out and die if you won't listen.

86
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,864
- Go out and die! Go out and die! 
 - Gosh, please...

87
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,894
Hey, get up.

88
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:17,404
Get up, please.

89
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:23,814
Is he the man you slept with back then? Is he?

90
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:25,404
Is it really him?

91
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:30,184
I don't know. Why would you ask that in this situation?

92
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,024
It was him. It was.

93
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:34,394
My gosh, what do we do?

94
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:37,064
What are we supposed to do?

95
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:41,284
Hey, how could you date someone like him?

96
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,254
Are you blind?

97
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:48,054
How could you have such terrible taste in men?

98
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:50,524
You were happy for me then.

99
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,084
You said it was a good thing.

100
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,354
Things are not the same anymore!

101
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,834
Do you really not know?

102
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:02,234
That bastard... His family went bankrupt after Park Do Ra died

103
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:05,764
and they have nothing! Absolutely nothing!

104
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:13,054
You were happy thinking he was rich back then since he gave me the diamond ring.

105
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:16,674
But you want me to break up now that his family went bankrupt?

106
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:20,194
He's the same person. How could you do that?

107
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:21,914
I can't do that.

108
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,044
I can't break up with Do Sik.

109
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:26,014
Hey...

110
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:32,534
Myeong Dong, he is the son of the enemy who caused my in-law to die.

111
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:35,544
You think your sister-in-law and brother would allow it?

112
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:38,334
This would never work!

113
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:41,744
But that's not Do Sik's fault.

114
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:44,204
W-What did you say?

115
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:50,124
Hey, M-Myeong Dong, forget about everything else.

116
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:54,504
If you marry someone who doesn't have a single penny at your age,

117
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:56,614
you'll start suffering from Day 1.

118
00:06:56,614 --> 00:07:00,714
You'd be hopping on a train to hell to enter the gate of hell.

119
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,584
Mom, I'm okay.

120
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:06,344
I told Do Sik I'd support him.

121
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:10,364
I suggested we date because I'd be supporting him.

122
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,894
What did you say? Are you an idiot?

123
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,314
Why would you support him? Huh?

124
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,494
Is he your son? Why would you do that?

125
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:22,114
Why don't you support your mother instead? You stupid girl!

126
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,884
That's enough! Seriously!

127
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:26,444
Be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet.

128
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,804
You little. You little! Die!

129
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:31,174
You might as well die!

130
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:36,784
Get old and die alone, you idiot!

131
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,624
Gosh, seriously.

132
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,044
What do we do? What do we do?

133
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,704
I even brought a fruit basket that cost 200,000 won at a department store.

134
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,994
But you ruined everything.

135
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:52,494
I had to make a good impression on Go Pil Sung to get Do Do started.

136
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:55,874
I bought a used car with the investment money, and I'm running out of money in the bank.

137
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:59,514
- What am I supposed to do? 
 - Geez, seriously!

138
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,384
Right.

139
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:07,884
The woman you called a "country bumpkin" when we left the house.

140
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:12,964
I almost called that woman "Do Ra."

141
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:18,444
- What are you talking about? 
 - I don't know. I just thought she was Do Ra when I saw her.

142
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:22,844
Aigoo, how dare you compare that country bumpkin to Do Ra?

143
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:26,784
No wonder you've been dating an old woman with your bad taste in women.

144
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:29,274
She's not an old woman, okay?

145
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,954
She has a baby face.

146
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:33,034
Aigoo! Gosh, come on...

147
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:37,484
You'd better break up with her, for my sake. Okay?

148
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:42,244
I have to get Go Pil Sung to like me somehow! You punk...

149
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,884
 Gosh! Myeong Dong is gone! 

150
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:50,424
 My Myeong Dong is gone! Myeong Dong. 

151
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:53,484
Mom, I told you to keep an eye on her.

152
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,694
Did she go out to see him again?

153
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:58,494
N-No, probably not.

154
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:02,394
She knows who he is now. How could she? It can't be.

155
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,534
She probably went out to get fresh air.

156
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:07,634
What do you mean she didn't? Where else would she go so early?

157
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,164
Where else would she go so early?

158
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:13,334
She won't answer her phone. There's no point in calling her.

159
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,114
 Anyone home? Anyone home? 

160
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:22,524
Isn't this that woman's voice?

161
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:24,464
My goodness...

162
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:29,994
Why are you back here so early? What business do you have here?

163
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:35,874
Gosh, seriously. I've done so many wrong things to your family.

164
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:39,050
So, I came to apologize.

165
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:42,714
How dare you kneel down in front of us?

166
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,874
I'm living in a studio apartment.

167
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:48,954
I've done all sorts of things ever since Do Ra died.

168
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:52,504
I washed the dishes at a restaurant, and I sold kimbap on the subway.

169
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,394
And it's not like I could just die.

170
00:09:56,144 --> 00:10:00,974
This was my only choice since I don't know how to do anything else.

171
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:03,214
So, I managed to start again.

172
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:07,464
And since a station director I used to work with helped me,

173
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:12,934
I could've put my actor in the show as long as Director Go allowed it.

174
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:17,894
But I mistakenly thought he rejected us because he hated me.

175
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:21,014
And since I was so upset,

176
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:26,694
I did unspeakable things to you. I'm so sorry.

177
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:29,754
I feel so terrible.

178
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:35,684
By the way, where's Director Go...

179
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:39,714
He went to work early.

180
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:43,114
Please tell him I'm sorry...

181
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:45,724
and he should take pity on me.

182
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:51,384
And ask him to say nice things about me at the broadcasting station.

183
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,174
W-Well, okay.

184
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,814
What do you mean, "Okay"?

185
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:58,634
Did you forget about what that woman did to us?

186
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:02,644
Tell her to stop talking nonsense and leave.

187
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,714
Tell your son to stop seeing my daughter!

188
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,994
I will never allow it, okay?

189
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:10,214
Don't worry about that. Of course.

190
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:14,214
And the head of this household. I apologize to you, too.

191
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:17,654
I'm so sorry.

192
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,584
Is she serious?

193
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:27,114
 Aigoo, she's the one who should be acting. 

194
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:30,704
 She really is putting on a show. Seriously. 

195
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,804
What are we supposed to do now?

196
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:43,364
I've been thinking all night.

197
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:47,354
I don't think I can be without you. How about you?

198
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:50,144
Me, neither.

199
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:54,984
I don't even want to think about my life without you.

200
00:11:56,584 --> 00:12:01,734
Let's hold our hands like this and overcome all hardships.

201
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,724
They say love blossoms through hardship.

202
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:18,204
The elders must've been shocked because of me yesterday.

203
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:23,694
How could they accept me immediately after what my mom did?

204
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:30,184
I'll kneel on behalf of my mom, beg for forgiveness,

205
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,474
and introduce myself formally.

206
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:37,394
Do Sik, do you mean it?

207
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,584
You'll stay by my side, right?

208
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:45,054
Of course, I will.

209
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:50,334
Hey! How dare you come back to this place?

210
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,704
Mother, let go of this and talk instead! Please.

211
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:54,484
How could I talk right now?

212
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:57,744
Aren't you going to leave? You'd better leave right now!

213
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,204
- Hey! 
 - Why did you bring him here, Myeong Dong?

214
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,674
Didn't you know she'd be like this?

215
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:04,844
Mom, can't you forgive Do Sik just once?

216
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,704
He didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,104
Let go, let go. Get out of the way.

218
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:12,044
Mother-in-law, I apologize on behalf of my mother.

219
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:14,654
And my feelings for Myeong Dong are sincere, Mother-in-law.

220
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:17,884
Mother-in-law? Mother-in-law?

221
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,244
You bastard. How am I your mother-in-law?

222
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:24,804
- I can't have a son-in-law like you! 
 - Mom!

223
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,064
Do Sik, this is no good. Let's leave for now.

224
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,984
Come on and get up.

225
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:32,494
I'm so sorry, Mother-in-law. I'll be back. I'm so sorry.

226
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:35,104
Hey, Myeong Dong! Bring her back.

227
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:37,684
Hey! You brat!

228
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:41,454
Mother, you can't beat someone like that.

229
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,674
My goodness.

230
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:54,464
 Ma'am, to be honest, I love your son. 

231
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:58,174
 What did you say? How dare you love my son? 

232
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:00,304
 You shameless thing! 

233
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,694
 My gosh! My gosh! 

234
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:03,544
 Die! 

235
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:08,934
Aigoo!

236
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:15,334
Yes, why should I love Director Go, who's against me pursuing my dream

237
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:18,804
and get beaten with a broom?

238
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:20,484
It can't be him.

239
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,344
It's a good thing I decided not to like him.

240
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:40,724
Ji Yeong, why did you come so late today?

241
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,344
What's going on, Jae Dong?

242
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:46,254
What? Is something going on?

243
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:49,304
This is a script. Start practicing now.

244
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:51,754
You need to audition tomorrow.

245
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:56,994
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,454
How could I possibly audition?

247
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:02,344
I'm not good enough for an audition.

248
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,854
And I can't do it because it's so nerve-racking.

249
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:09,394
I swear I'm not pressuring you to pass.

250
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:11,674
I just want you to experience it.

251
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:13,594
You need to have experience in auditioning, too.

252
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:15,194
That's true, but—

253
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:19,574
And if you pass the audition, your fate will change.

254
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:21,824
This is...

255
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:25,474
an audition for a supporting role.

256
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:27,804
A supporting role?

257
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:32,194
It'd be bad even if I got such an important role.

258
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:35,494
I really don't know anything.

259
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:37,644
I can't. I'm scared.

260
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:40,724
That's how stars get born.

261
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,894
Who is good from the beginning?

262
00:15:42,894 --> 00:15:45,764
You're supposed to build on experiences like this.

263
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,954
- Really? 
 - Of course.

264
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:50,734
Ji Yeong, just trust me.

265
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:53,234
Promise no turning back for us.

266
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:56,334
Let's go! Let's move forward.

267
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,514
Come on. Take it.

268
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:03,734
You can do it. You can do it.

269
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:14,084
Director Go!

270
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:16,944
You wanted to see me?

271
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,094
- Jae Dong. 
 - Yes.

272
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:21,754
Your entertainment company. Popcorn. I love the name.

273
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:24,974
I hope you blow up like popcorn and be successful.

274
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:27,754
I'll work very hard. Thank you!

275
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,484
By the way, Jae Dong,

276
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:35,804
why is your first actor Ji Yeong?

277
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:39,524
I think you made the wrong move.

278
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:41,944
Ji Yeong is so simple and clumsy.

279
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,584
She doesn't understand how the world works. She's frustrating, you know.

280
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,504
How could someone like that be an actor?

281
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:49,394
Not everyone can be an actor.

282
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:51,344
You have to have a sensibility.

283
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,014
I'm telling you because I'm worried about you.

284
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,774
I'll introduce you to a good new actor.

285
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:01,774
So, cancel your contract with Ji Yeong immediately, okay?

286
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,534
Director...

287
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,954
I mean, Hyung.

288
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,604
How could you be like this?

289
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,344
Be honest. Ji Yeong is a good actor. Why are you criticizing her?

290
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,334
I don't understand why you're doing this.

291
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,564
I believe she'd become a good actor.

292
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:21,764
Jae Dong,

293
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:27,054
when I was eating tteokbokki sitting on the ground,

294
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:30,464
you brought me a piece of steak. I'm thankful for that.

295
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:33,854
That's why I'm telling you since I want you to succeed.

296
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,874
You have to become successful.

297
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:38,244
I'm telling you, Ji Yeong isn't the one.

298
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:41,474
Okay. I'll keep that in mind. Well, then.

299
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:45,764
Jae Dong, try to go with what I'm telling you.

300
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:51,894
I need to stop Ji Yeong from becoming an actor somehow.

301
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:54,184
Why won't he listen to me?

302
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:00,974
What did you say? Director dissed me?

303
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:02,514
I'm telling you.

304
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,624
He said you're simple, slow, don't know how the world works,

305
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:09,884
and you frustrate him because you're clueless.

306
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,344
And he said you don't have the face for it, either.

307
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:13,784
What?

308
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,724
Did he really say that about me?

309
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,274
Ji Yeong!

310
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,074
Talk to me for a second.

311
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:30,714
Why would you talk to me?

312
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:33,124
My face isn't that great,

313
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:36,244
I'm slow, don't know how the world works,

314
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:40,534
and I'm just a simpleton. I'm not on the same level as you.

315
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,964
Would we be able to communicate?

316
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:46,764
What do you mean by that?

317
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:51,534
Those are all your words. Why are you acting surprised?

318
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,324
I heard everything.

319
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:58,304
You dissed me, saying I don't have what it takes to be an actor for CEO Lee.

320
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:02,894
I didn't speak that harshly—

321
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:05,204
Whatever.

322
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:09,444
But for some reason, hearing that you said that

323
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:13,484
makes me want to become successful as an actor.

324
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:18,334
Thank you for making me get all fired up.

325
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:22,654
I'll make sure to pass the audition tomorrow.

326
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,630
Seriously, are you kidding me?

327
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,470
   

328
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,494
Whatever.

329
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:47,214
Hey, Ji Yeong. It's me.

330
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:49,614
We have one meal left.

331
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,094
How's today?

332
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,584
CEO Gong, I have to say no today.

333
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:56,554
I have to prepare for an audition properly.

334
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:58,724
Anyway, I can't because I'm busy today.

335
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,334
Let's eat some other time.

336
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:03,634
Oh, okay, then.

337
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:05,224
Okay.

338
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:09,694
Hold on.

339
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:12,994
Did she reject Gong Jin Dan just now?

340
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:18,564
Did she do it knowingly or not?

341
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,424
I saw her a few times because she resembles Park Do Ra.

342
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:25,124
Does she think she's somebody now?

343
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:30,654
   

344
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:36,694
Hello, Tae Hee.

345
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,294
Yes.

346
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:41,090
This evening?

347
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:44,024
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

348
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:48,534
I was at Michael's birthday party in New York, too.

349
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,204
Really?

350
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:54,424
I told Tae Hee that she'd fall in love with you.

351
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:59,594
When I heard that she reunited with you and considering marrying you,

352
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:02,284
I got chills all over my body.

353
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:06,124
Gyeong Ah, is that really true?

354
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:07,664
You two must be meant to be.

355
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:10,044
Congratulations on the wedding in advance.

356
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,734
You have to come.

357
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:19,914
Let's order another one. Have more.

358
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:22,934
 Yes, I should focus on Tae Hee. 

359
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:26,084
 I shouldn't be worrying about that country bumpkin. 

360
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,831
   

361
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,481
   

362
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,451
   

363
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:51,151
   

364
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:12,891
You made me come out at this hour

365
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:20,081
and you're telling me not to become an actor again?

366
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:28,911
Director, I'm really curious.

367
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:34,331
Would you suffer a serious loss if I became an actor?

368
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:40,901
I'm worried because something bad might happen to you.

369
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,541
I don't want you to suffer.

370
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,881
Why do you keep thinking something bad would happen to me?

371
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,981
I made it very clear.

372
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:52,431
I'm not going to be an A-list actor,

373
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,801
but that's not why I want to act.

374
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:58,171
I just like studying acting, and it makes me happy.

375
00:22:58,171 --> 00:23:02,301
You already know how Park Do Ra died!

376
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:04,591
You saw all the articles.

377
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,281
Director.

378
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,651
Park Do Ra...

379
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,211
Do you know why she died?

380
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:23,701
Do you know how much pain she was in...

381
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,951
before she died?

382
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:31,591
The whole world pointed fingers at her and criticized her.

383
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:38,661
Do Ra was pushed to the edge and died.

384
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:46,681
I can't let you end up like Do Ra.

385
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:50,171
If something bad happens to you,

386
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:53,901
I won't be able to endure it.

387
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:59,511
I'm so afraid that you'd...

388
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:02,011
end up like Do Ra, too.

389
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:06,841
Ji Yeong, I beg you.

390
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:11,101
Don't become an actor.

391
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,301
I don't want to lose you, either.

392
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,651
Director, why do you keep...

393
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:32,641
bringing up Park Do Ra with me?

394
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:37,161
I'm not Park Do Ra.

395
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:44,071
And even if something bad happens to me as it did to her, I won't die.

396
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:47,041
I'm a strong woman.

397
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:51,151
My whole body got torn up in the ocean

398
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:54,041
and got destroyed, but I survived.

399
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:58,391
And I survived on the verge of death even through many surgeries.

400
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:02,381
Nothing in the world can destroy me.

401
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:09,211
So, don't tell me stuff like that anymore.

402
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:13,371
I'm not Park Do Ra.

403
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:15,761
I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

404
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:22,631
Yes.

405
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,781
You aren't Park Do Ra.

406
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,091
You're Kim Ji Yeong.

407
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:32,821
Kim Ji Yeong.

408
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:36,931
I keep forgetting that.

409
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:53,631
But he must really like me.

410
00:25:53,631 --> 00:26:00,431
He was doing that because he didn't want me to get hurt like Park Do Ra.

411
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:04,291
Because he didn't want to lose someone he loved again.

412
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:08,081
What am I supposed to do now?

413
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:15,971
Why does this make me feel so sad?

414
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,261
No.

415
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,351
I'll still walk the path I chose.

416
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,371
I'll do what I want to do.

417
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,771
Is that true? They broke up?

418
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:08,991
Yes. She got a call last night.

419
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:12,721
Why isn't she coming home, then?

420
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:16,151
Maybe they're together, and she's lying.

421
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,731
She doesn't have to lie at her age.

422
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:22,801
They would've started living together instead.

423
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:24,601
I suppose.

424
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,411
She has a friend named Jang Mi.

425
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:31,941
She said she'd sort her thoughts at her place.

426
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,930
She knows they can't be together, too.

427
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,701
And the more you oppose, the more they'd get fired up.

428
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,531
Just play ignorant.

429
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:47,811
Right? So, when Myeong Dong comes back, don't say anything.

430
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,781
Don't yell at her, either.

431
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:58,591
M-Myeong Dong, you're back.

432
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:02,621
Go Myeong Dong, you really broke up with him, right?

433
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:05,051
You really broke up, right?

434
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:10,361
Yes. Everyone is so against it. What else can I do?

435
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:11,571
Do you mean it?

436
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:15,731
Was he willing to break up with you?

437
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:18,161
He wanted to break up, too.

438
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:23,481
Why would he want to see me after you beat him with a broom like that?

439
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:26,701
Gosh, that's great. That's so great.

440
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:30,411
I feel so relieved as if I have lost an achy tooth.

441
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:35,341
That crazy woman must've flipped out, too.

442
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:40,511
He had to give up if he were in the right mind.

443
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:45,311
Since I won the competition, I'll do nothing but write.

444
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:49,181
I'll work hard and become a successful screenwriter.

445
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:51,741
So, don't worry about me.

446
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:02,961
Looks like they really broke up.

447
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:06,871
She finally started a relationship,

448
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,961
but she had to end up with someone like him.

449
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:15,251
Gosh, I'm so upset.

450
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:34,611
Do Sik, it's me.

451
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:38,041
I just told them that we broke up.

452
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:41,461
Really? I told Mom, too.

453
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:43,531
Did she buy it?

454
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,961
Of course, she did.

455
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:49,691
Okay, see you tomorrow, then.

456
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,101
Okay.

457
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:56,841
Babe, I love you.

458
00:29:57,741 --> 00:30:01,021
Yes, I love you, too.

459
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,270
   

460
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,511
Am I crazy?

461
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,091
I'm crazy.

462
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,511
What happened?

463
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,921
What am I going to do?

464
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:38,911
Hold on.

465
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:48,601
Aigoo. Why can't I get a taxi, either?

466
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,131
Ji Yeong, get in.

467
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,591
Why would I get in your car?

468
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:04,001
You're late for the audition. Get in.

469
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:08,121
Will you take me to the wrong place so I can't audition?

470
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:10,301
- Forget it. 
 - Okay, then.

471
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,551
Be late to the audition.

472
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:16,121
You won't make it if you don't get in now.

473
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:22,521
I'll be your taxi driver today.

474
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:25,291
Just think of this as a taxi.

475
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:29,921
Help me just this once, then.

476
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,271
Let's hurry up, Driver.

477
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:42,541
You'd be in trouble if you dropped me off at the wrong place.

478
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:47,101
Okay. I'll make sure to take you to the right place.

479
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,731
Thank you.

480
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,161
This is the taxi fare.

481
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:08,631
You said this was a taxi.

482
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:12,321
I paid you. I don't owe you anything.

483
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:17,521
Ji Yeong.

484
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:21,761
What? Was that not enough money?

485
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:27,691
Make sure to get the part since you're doing this.

486
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:29,471
Okay?

487
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:31,031
Pardon?

488
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,951
Well, okay.

489
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,301
Ji Yeong!

490
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:41,061
Good luck.

491
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:45,541
"Ji Yeong"?

492
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:50,131
He feels free to call my name now?

493
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:52,141
What's wrong with him?

494
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:53,931
Ji Yeong!

495
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,881
Fighting! Let's go!

496
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:58,631
Gosh, how embarrassing.

497
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:01,251
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

498
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:07,141
Yes.

499
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:09,331
You're Kim Ji Yeong.

500
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:12,331
Kim Ji Yeong.

501
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:24,121
Gosh.

502
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,741
You're here for the audition, too?

503
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,611
I see this country bumpkin everywhere. How annoying.

504
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,561
I feel the same way, okay?

505
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:36,061
I'm your elder. How rude.

506
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:39,471
How will you pass the audition with that accent?

507
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:44,101
Why do you care if I have an accent or not?

508
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:49,921
Seriously, that rude little brat. Gosh!

509
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:54,731
   

510
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:58,311
I'm sorry I left without a word, Gang Ho.

511
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,611
You wouldn't have let me go otherwise.

512
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:08,301
Gang Ho,

513
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:14,921
Even when I was healthy and pretty, I felt guilty for being by your side.

514
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:21,140
But I don't want to be by your side while I'm ill like this.

515
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:24,951
If you love me,

516
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:28,491
I hope you understand me...

517
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,841
and not look for me.

518
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:39,271
Thank you for everything, Gang Ho.

519
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:48,431
That country bumpkin.

520
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:53,471
She acts like how Do Ra used to.

521
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,331
What's going on with me?

522
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,671
What's going on?

523
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:08,101
   

524
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:14,951
Miss, let me talk to you for a second.

525
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,251
What's this now?

526
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,591
You'd better not grab my hair again.

527
00:35:20,591 --> 00:35:22,691
I won't hold back this time, okay?

528
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:27,141
Seriously. I just want to have a tea with you.

529
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:31,101
What? Why would I have tea with you?

530
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:35,971
Let's be honest. We don't exactly have that kind of a relationship.

531
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:38,331
Okay, then. Let's talk here.

532
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:40,171
Seriously.

533
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,791
This is...

534
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,451
who I am.

535
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:47,301
So?

536
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:50,961
Seriously. Miss, you know Park Do Ra, right?

537
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:55,501
I'm CEO Baek Mi Ja of Bbaek Entertainment, and I managed Park Do Ra.

538
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,911
So?

539
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,101
 Gosh, this brat. 

540
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,691
Miss, do you want to work with me?

541
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:03,681
I'll make you a star.

542
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:06,501
Aigoo, forget it.

543
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:10,381
I'd rather quit acting than work with you.

544
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,771
I have self-respect, you know.

545
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,721
Well, you little...

546
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:23,021
Gosh, I have a really good feeling about her.

547
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:28,491
What? Do Sik said it, too.

548
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:31,651
Why does she resemble Do Ra?

549
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:34,571
I don't know what's going on.

550
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:39,532
Ji Yeong.

551
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:48,162
Why are you still here, Director?

552
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,782
Did the audition go well?

553
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:54,962
I don't even remember how I did it because I was so nervous.

554
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:59,302
My legs are still shaking, and I feel dizzy, too.

555
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:03,732
I don't know if I really had the audition or not.

556
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:05,262
When will you hear the result?

557
00:37:05,262 --> 00:37:07,502
Sometime this week, apparently.

558
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:10,752
But I'm not expecting much.

559
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:15,282
My heart was about to explode just by auditioning.

560
00:37:15,282 --> 00:37:18,202
It was ecstatic as if I had become the character.

561
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,552
I just found it fun.

562
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,822
So, I won't mind it even if I get rejected.

563
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:28,482
You felt so excited that your heart was about to explode?

564
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,282
Yes.

565
00:37:32,362 --> 00:37:36,402
By the way, why do you keep asking me?

566
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:40,482
Why? You wish I did poorly and get rejected, don't you?

567
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:43,262
That's why you keep asking me, right?

568
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:49,352
Yes, I'll probably get rejected since you prayed for that.

569
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:53,822
No, I prayed for you to get the part.

570
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,102
- Really? 
 - Yes.

571
00:37:57,872 --> 00:38:02,632
I thought about this a lot after I talked to you last night.

572
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,792
You want to do this so badly.

573
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,132
You find it so exciting, like your heart would burst.

574
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:09,692
I don't have the right to stop you.

575
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:13,292
A lot of people don't even know what they want to do.

576
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,742
But you found what you want to do so badly.

577
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:19,722
I don't think it's right to stop you.

578
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:29,455
I can't get used to it since you changed so much overnight.

579
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:34,195
I said that last night because I was worried about you.

580
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,665
I was really worried.

581
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:38,705
Goodness...

582
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:42,185
Don't you have better things to worry about?

583
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:44,025
Just look at me.

584
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:48,045
I'm not capable of thinking stuff like that.

585
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:51,075
And even if something like that happens to me,

586
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:57,095
I can go back to my hometown and catch octopus and harvest clams.

587
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:59,765
So, don't you worry about a thing.

588
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,935
Come with me somewhere.

589
00:39:02,935 --> 00:39:04,705
Where?

590
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:09,985
l might as well take you to a place that could help you.

591
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,775
Well, I-I can't.

592
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:29,535
   

593
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,895
No, Ma Ri. Don't do that.

594
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:51,575
 Please don't come by again. 

595
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:56,295
 If you keep doing this, I won't be able to think of you as a friend. 

596
00:39:57,205 --> 00:40:00,945
I felt a bit sad then, but I don't hate him anymore.

597
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:02,515
He's so cool when he's cold like that.

598
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:05,715
He really is like a protagonist of a romantic novel.

599
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:11,805
I really want to marry Pil Sung.

600
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:14,515
Could there be a way to do it?

601
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:24,705
Yes, that's it. That's how I can marry Pil Sung.

602
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,675
What's this?

603
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:15,955
"Mom, Dad, don't worry about me.

604
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:18,955
I'll come back after the important mission."

605
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,705
My gosh.

606
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:24,075
Madam! Madam!

607
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:28,385
Do Jun, Ma Ri left her phone, too.

608
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,735
She just left this note.

609
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,485
Did she not say anything to you?

610
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:35,455
Can you think of a place she might be?

611
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:39,455
She's only recently been to the art academy and your friend's house in Heukseok-dong.

612
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,335
She didn't show interest in anything else.

613
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,735
- Really? 
 - Yes.

614
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:47,865
Wait...

615
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:53,405
by the way, she did say something strange.

616
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:54,985
What did she say?

617
00:41:54,985 --> 00:42:00,285
She said she was planning to meet that director as the prince's husband.

618
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,485
Prince husband? What plan?

619
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:07,975
I asked her, too, but she said she'd tell me later.

620
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,325
Okay, then. Go relax.

621
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:13,825
Okay.

622
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:22,975
Did she leave to make Pil Sung a prince husband, then?

623
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,205
If it isn't one thing, it's the other.

624
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:28,155
She'll never stop being a problem.

625
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:29,835
Seriously.

626
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:39,455
 Did she go to meet Pil Sung again? 

627
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:42,335
   

628
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:49,985
 No, he would've called me if he met Ma Ri. 

629
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:02,905
Hey, Soo Yeon.

630
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:05,175
Hey, Seon Yeong.

631
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:08,805
Is Ma Ri there, by chance?

632
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:11,645
No, she didn't come here. Why?

633
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:16,155
What? Ma Ri went missing?

634
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:21,025
Okay, I'll call you immediately if she comes here.

635
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:23,485
Okay, bye.

636
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:29,475
Where did Ma Ri go this time?

637
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:33,905
I hope everything is okay.

638
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:12,395
I love Pil Sung's room. It's so cozy.

639
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:21,225
By the way, why isn't he here yet?

640
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:34,995
Honey, shouldn't we report her missing?

641
00:44:34,995 --> 00:44:37,775
She told us not to worry in her note.

642
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,825
Let's wait a little longer.

643
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:14,805
What's this noise?

644
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:17,035
There's no one in here.

645
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:29,005
Did I hear it wrong?

646
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:43,165
That was close.

647
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:50,175
What's taking Pil Sung so long?

648
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:54,885
I'm so sleepy, and it's uncomfortable in here.

649
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,420
.

650
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:11,655
That's how the time passed while I had her in my arms.

651
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:15,415
And when I think about our two-year-old...

652
00:46:17,045 --> 00:46:19,405
I don't know how I got here.

653
00:46:20,475 --> 00:46:23,175
I can't tell if this is a dream or reality.

654
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:29,665
What did you think of the performance?

655
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:33,725
Director, I think the actors are so smart.

656
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:35,815
How do they memorize all those lines,

657
00:46:35,815 --> 00:46:39,775
make people laugh, cry, and control them like that?

658
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:44,755
Even imagining I was on that stage made me blank out and feel nervous.

659
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:47,605
I don't think I could ever do it.

660
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,735
That's why I told you not to.

661
00:46:49,735 --> 00:46:51,945
Yet you said you'd become an actor without such a resolve?

662
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:55,345
You nag every chance you get.

663
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,475
Tell me how to do it, at least.

664
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:05,675
Ji Yeong, listen closely to what I say now.

665
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:08,675
Okay.

666
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:11,595
You should fix your accent first.

667
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:16,175
I'm trying to do that, too.

668
00:47:16,175 --> 00:47:19,025
And this was your first time seeing a play, right?

669
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:21,185
Yes.

670
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:24,335
You want to be an actor. How could this be your first time seeing a play?

671
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:28,065
Watch a lot of plays, movies, and dramas from now on.

672
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:32,145
And don't walk on streets or go to cafes and stores without thinking.

673
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:35,995
Study the way people talk and behave.

674
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:38,915
And watch the news whenever you can.

675
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:40,765
You should know what's going on in the world.

676
00:47:40,765 --> 00:47:43,285
And read as much as you can.

677
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:46,565
You can tell if an actor reads a lot or not.

678
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:49,175
To put it simply, you can't be ignorant.

679
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:50,795
Ignorant?

680
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:54,485
Are you talking about me right now?

681
00:47:55,935 --> 00:48:00,125
I don't know why I have to hear that from you sitting here.

682
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,675
Here's your accent again.

683
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:06,255
I've lived like this my whole life. How do I suddenly drop it?

684
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:07,835
You still have to.

685
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:10,245
You want to be an actor. Be serious, then.

686
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:14,175
You can't become a good actor with that mindset.

687
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:18,885
I won't eat.

688
00:48:18,885 --> 00:48:23,905
They say you don't even bother a dog when it's eating.

689
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:27,115
How am I supposed to swallow food

690
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:30,555
if you nag at me about everything I say?

691
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:34,315
He just won't stop nagging, will he?

692
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,615
Sit, sit.

693
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:41,845
I won't say anything while you eat. Eat your udon.

694
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:46,365
I heard your stomach growling earlier.

695
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:49,415
Don't regret it later and eat.

696
00:48:57,175 --> 00:49:00,355
The broth is amazing. Wow.

697
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:14,635
It's tasty.

698
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:27,815
Well...

699
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:33,315
Director, you did so much for me today.

700
00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:35,595
Thank you.

701
00:49:35,595 --> 00:49:38,305
- Well, then... 
 - Hold on, Ji Yeong.

702
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:50,925
Ji Yeong, you worked so hard on the audition today.

703
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:54,665
This is the reward for your hard work.

704
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:58,715
Thank you.

705
00:49:58,715 --> 00:50:01,965
You didn't have to get me flowers for auditioning.

706
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,535
A date should end with flowers.

707
00:50:05,425 --> 00:50:06,975
Date?

708
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,325
We watched a play, and you nagged at me all day.

709
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:12,325
What kind of date was that?

710
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:15,585
And don't say such an embarrassing word as "date."

711
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:19,975
Ji Yeong, who took you to the audition today?

712
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,955
I had no choice but to take your car,

713
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,385
but I paid you the taxi fare.

714
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:30,565
- But you went to the audition without an issue, thanks to me, right? 
 - I suppose so.

715
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:33,655
And the play you saw today... was helpful to you, right?

716
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,325
Yes, I suppose that's true, too.

717
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:40,165
Ji Yeong, this is what a date is.

718
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:46,875
I... really like you a lot, Ji Yeong.

719
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:53,585
I want to help you when you're having trouble

720
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:56,295
and I want to protect you by your side.

721
00:50:57,585 --> 00:50:59,425
What did you say?

722
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:03,205
I know you like me, too.

723
00:51:03,205 --> 00:51:06,915
So, I don't know what the reason is,

724
00:51:06,915 --> 00:51:11,835
but I want you to be courageous, too. Please?

725
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:16,945
 Yes, I like you, too, Director. 

726
00:51:21,285 --> 00:51:22,945
Director,

727
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:28,645
I don't deserve to be with someone like you.

728
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:31,605
So, stop tempting me.

729
00:51:31,605 --> 00:51:35,525
Qualifications aren't relevant when you like someone.

730
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,075
Feelings don't require stuff like that.

731
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:44,095
Ji Yeong, you laughed a lot because of me today.

732
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:46,935
You enjoyed the udon we had together, too.

733
00:51:46,935 --> 00:51:49,895
You're happy whenever you're with me.

734
00:51:49,895 --> 00:51:53,345
Let's keep seeing each other like we did today.

735
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:56,565
This is our first day together, okay? Bam, bam, bam.

736
00:51:56,565 --> 00:51:59,415
You can't argue anymore. Good night.

737
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:04,575
Okay. Good night, Director—

738
00:52:05,815 --> 00:52:08,195
No, I take that back! I take that back!

739
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:12,175
I didn't say, "Okay" just now. Okay?

740
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:31,545
Kim Ji Yeong, are you out of your mind?

741
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:36,265
Why would you say, "Okay. Good night, Director," then?

742
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,015
Do you think it's our first day together, too?

743
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:43,745
No, no. Who says we're a couple?

744
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:47,605
He played me like a fiddle today,

745
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:51,395
but I'll never let him play me again.

746
00:52:51,495 --> 00:52:54,075
He's... a sly fox.

747
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:56,035
a sly fox.

748
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:58,695
A fox who stole my heart.

749
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:05,095
Kim Ji Yeong, you'd better stay alert.

750
00:53:19,385 --> 00:53:21,955
Get it together.

751
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:36,945
 This is our first day together, okay? Bam, bam, bam. 

752
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:39,815
 You can't argue anymore. Good night. 

753
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,945
 Okay. Good night, Director— 

754
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,255
 No, I take that back! I take that back! 

755
00:53:47,255 --> 00:53:50,365
 I didn't say, "Okay" just now. Okay? 

756
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:53,855
She pretends she doesn't like me, but I can tell she does.

757
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,995
So cute.

758
00:53:55,995 --> 00:54:00,225
But she liked me all this time. Why did she act like that?

759
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,945
What's that noise?

760
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:24,415
Did I forget to turn off the music?

761
00:54:26,955 --> 00:54:28,685
That's not it.

762
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:36,205
Did I hear it wrong?

763
00:54:44,955 --> 00:54:47,105
What's this noise?

764
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:51,065
It sounds like snoring.

765
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:03,085
Could it be a ghost?

766
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,175
Or a thief?

767
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:31,075
Mom! Dad!

768
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,465
 Mom! 

769
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:43,765
 Dad! 

770
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:45,585
Pil Sung, what's wrong?

771
00:55:45,585 --> 00:55:47,715
Hey, where's the thief?

772
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,535
Where is he, Pil Sung? Where?

773
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:53,815
My gosh. Ma Ri!

774
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:55,355
That's Ma Ri!

775
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:58,235
My gosh, you scared me.

776
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:02,375
- Well... 
 - My gosh.

777
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:06,895
Goodness, Ma Ri. Why...

778
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:10,825
Why were you in there? Since when?

779
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:15,435
The thing is, I...

780
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:17,235
Pil Sung, what's going on?

781
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:21,285
I don't know, either. I heard a strange noise when I got in bed.

782
00:56:21,285 --> 00:56:23,865
It turns out she was snoring in the closet.

783
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:25,785
She scared the crap out of me.

784
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:27,145
My gosh.

785
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:31,245
I also heard that noise when I came in to drop off your clothes earlier.

786
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:35,820
Ma Ri, have you been in here since earlier today?

787
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:39,025
- Yes. 
 - But why?

788
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:42,055
Why did you do that, Ma Ri?

789
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:46,475
To marry Pil Sung.

790
00:56:46,475 --> 00:56:48,045
What?

791
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:57,225
If I sleep with Pil Sung, we have no choice but to marry.

792
00:56:57,225 --> 00:56:59,415
That's why I was hiding.

793
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:02,695
But I fell asleep without realizing it.

794
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:05,105
What a fool. Idiot.

795
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:06,725
Wow.

796
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:10,745
- My goodness. 
 - Gosh.

797
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:25,655
Hey, Seon Yeong.

798
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,755
What?

799
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:37,415
She's been hiding in Pil Sung's closet all this time?

800
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:38,685
- Wait! 
 - Ma Ri.

801
00:57:38,685 --> 00:57:40,115
- I don't want to! 
 - Come on.

802
00:57:40,115 --> 00:57:43,595
- I won't leave. Pil Sung! 
 - Why would you call him?

803
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:46,365
Pil Sung, go inside. I'm sorry.

804
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:47,765
- Let's go, Honey. 
 - Hold on.

805
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,465
What do you mean, "Hold on"? Let's go.

806
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:53,465
- Okay, okay. 
 - Ma Ri!

807
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,435
Dad, let go. I don't want to go.

808
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:57,805
Can't I sleep here?

809
00:57:57,805 --> 00:58:00,235
- Ma Ri. 
 - Ma Ri, you really want to get in trouble?

810
00:58:00,235 --> 00:58:03,055
How dare you say you'd sleep here?

811
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:04,555
Let's just do that.

812
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:08,625
She can sleep with me in my room. Just let her.

813
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,845
It's okay. I'm so sorry.

814
00:58:10,845 --> 00:58:14,005
She said it was okay. I'm friends with her.

815
00:58:14,005 --> 00:58:16,585
I don't want to go. I want to sleep here.

816
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:17,985
You little...

817
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:21,295
What's wrong with you? Why are you being so immature?

818
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:23,245
Why are you doing this late at night?

819
00:58:23,245 --> 00:58:26,415
Don't scold her so much.

820
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,765
We're all okay.

821
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:31,655
I can't apologize enough.

822
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:36,645
I'm so sorry my daughter woke you up and caused trouble.

823
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:41,645
It's okay. It's really okay. Don't worry about us.

824
00:58:41,645 --> 00:58:43,925
Seon Yeong, I'm sorry.

825
00:58:43,925 --> 00:58:46,055
Hyeon Cheol, I'm so sorry.

826
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,825
Not at all. Not at all.

827
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,605
We'll get going now.

828
00:58:50,605 --> 00:58:52,665
Good night.

829
00:58:52,665 --> 00:58:53,985
Take care.

830
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:56,445
Ma Ri, let's go.

831
00:59:03,575 --> 00:59:07,905
Gong Ma Ri, why did you go there?

832
00:59:07,905 --> 00:59:12,685
Why were you hiding in Pil Sung's closet all day?

833
00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:15,175
Mom, I'm so upset.

834
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:20,045
I wanted to sleep with Pil Sung, but I fell asleep and snored.

835
00:59:20,045 --> 00:59:22,655
I failed because he caught me.

836
00:59:22,655 --> 00:59:26,735
Ma Ri! What did you say just now?

837
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:29,365
You tried to sleep with Pil Sung?

838
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,525
Yes. I wanted to make a baby with him.

839
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:35,955
We can get married if I sleep with him and make a baby.

840
00:59:35,955 --> 00:59:37,305
Hey!

841
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:39,135
Honey, what are you doing?

842
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,265
She said she tried to sleep with Pil Sung! To make a baby with him.

843
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:43,705
- Come here! 
 - Honey.

844
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,955
Honey, you still can't hit her like that.

845
00:59:46,955 --> 00:59:50,395
I hate you, Mom! Why did you hit me? Why?

846
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:54,645
What's wrong with trying to sleep with someone I like?

847
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:59,385
The male and female lead in the romance novel did that, too.

848
00:59:59,385 --> 01:00:04,605
I'll marry Pil Sung, no matter what it takes.

849
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,455
I like Pil Sung.

850
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:09,905
- I want to marry him! 
 - You can't!

851
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:13,315
Honey. Come on...

852
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:16,845
Honey.

853
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:34,785
What do I do? What do I do?

854
01:00:34,785 --> 01:00:36,700
What do I do?

855
01:00:37,775 --> 01:00:39,655
What do I do...

856
01:01:05,505 --> 01:01:07,905
Mom, where are we going?

857
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:10,605
Are you trying to beat me when Dad isn't around?

858
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:12,745
Will you pinch me?

859
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,575
I won't change my mind even if you do that.

860
01:01:16,575 --> 01:01:20,055
And I'll tell Dad if you did that.

861
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:40,765
Mom, what are we doing here?

862
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,905
There's no one here. It's scary.

863
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:49,425
Let's go home now. I want to go home.

864
01:01:51,765 --> 01:01:54,660
Will you do that to Pil Sung again?

865
01:01:55,395 --> 01:01:58,255
Will you do that again? Like what you did yesterday?

866
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:02,825
Yes, I will do that until he marries me.

867
01:02:06,995 --> 01:02:11,625
Ma Ri... you can't be with Pil Sung.

868
01:02:12,255 --> 01:02:13,565
Why not?

869
01:02:13,565 --> 01:02:17,565
Is it so bad that I like Pil Sung?

870
01:02:17,565 --> 01:02:21,025
It'd be bad if he had a girlfriend, but he doesn't.

871
01:02:21,025 --> 01:02:23,085
So, it's okay to like him.

872
01:02:23,085 --> 01:02:25,905
You married Dad because you liked him.

873
01:02:25,905 --> 01:02:28,070
Why can't I do the same?

874
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:33,325
Ma Ri, you can't like Pil Sung.

875
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:37,545
Even if he liked you. No matter what happens.

876
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:42,355
You and Pil Sung cannot marry. You can never do that.

877
01:02:42,355 --> 01:02:43,965
Why not? Why?

878
01:02:43,965 --> 01:02:48,085
I want to marry him, no matter what it takes.

879
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,685
Ma Ri,

880
01:02:52,295 --> 01:02:54,275
Pil Sung...

881
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:00,365
is your brother.

882
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:02,595
Your biological brother.

883
01:03:06,055 --> 01:03:07,875
Biological brother?

884
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,645
What does that mean?

885
01:03:17,495 --> 01:03:20,255
Ji Yeong! There's an emergency! Emergency!

886
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,325
What? Did something happen?

887
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:26,635
Get in for now! I'll explain on the way! Hurry!

888
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:34,265
- Put the seatbelt on. 
 - Huh?

889
01:03:44,585 --> 01:03:47,755
What's going on? Is it something bad?

890
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:50,955
I bought movie tickets. We'd be late if we bought popcorn, too.

891
01:03:50,955 --> 01:03:52,700
We need to hurry.

892
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:58,045
Is that the emergency you just mentioned?

893
01:03:58,045 --> 01:04:01,315
Did you scam me just now?

894
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:04,175
Scam? How could you say that?

895
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:07,735
It'd be so upsetting if we were late and missed the movie.

896
01:04:07,735 --> 01:04:09,775
That's why.

897
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:14,565
 I'm such a fool. 

898
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:17,355
 I was tricked by him again. 

899
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:19,825
 He's a liar. 

900
01:04:19,825 --> 01:04:23,635
 But he's a cute liar. 

901
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:26,625
 Should I just fall for him like this? 

902
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:30,055
 No, no. I can't fall for him. 

903
01:04:30,055 --> 01:04:33,215
 How will I ever see the landlady again? 

904
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:37,435
 What if I become a successful actor? 

905
01:04:37,435 --> 01:04:40,935
 Will she accept me then? 

906
01:04:40,935 --> 01:04:45,685
 Should I ask him to wait until then? 

907
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:57,075


908
01:04:57,075 --> 01:04:58,435
You enjoyed the movie tonight, right?

909
01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:03,675
Yes. The movie was fun, but the actors were so cool.

910
01:05:03,675 --> 01:05:07,625
I'd like to know how I can become such a cool actor.

911
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,465
You need to watch a lot of movies to become a good actor.

912
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:15,255
Let's watch a lot of movies together from now on.

913
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:17,905
 Since the Director is so nice to me, 

914
01:05:17,905 --> 01:05:21,185
 my heart is wavering like branches. 

915
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,045
 Should I just let it happen? 

916
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:27,185
Pil Sung.

917
01:05:27,185 --> 01:05:30,715
Did you get out of the car with her just now?

918
01:05:31,415 --> 01:05:35,325
Ji Yeong, I begged you not to last time.

919
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:38,605
Why were you in Pil Sung's car again?

920
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:41,455
Mom, what's wrong?

921
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:48,375
   

922
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:58,635
♫  Saturday afternoon  ♫

923
01:05:58,635 --> 01:06:08,285
♫  Don't hesitate like that and try dancing with me  ♫

924
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:14,715
♫  I don't want to do tiring tasks today  ♫

925
01:06:14,715 --> 01:06:19,805
♫  Try dancing with me  ♫

926
01:06:20,515 --> 01:06:23,625
 I don't understand anything you told me. 

927
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,935
 You're a bad person. How could you abandon your baby? 

928
01:06:26,935 --> 01:06:28,575
 Don't blame Ji Yeong from now on. 

929
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:31,885
 I want to be with her because I like her. 

930
01:06:31,885 --> 01:06:35,395
 Please don't fall for Pil Sung. I beg you. 

931
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:37,855
 Everything the elders said is true. 

932
01:06:37,855 --> 01:06:40,555
 Someone like me doesn't belong with you. 

933
01:06:40,555 --> 01:06:43,315
 I'll be seeing Ji Yeong officially starting today. 

934
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:47,795
 So, please treat me as my girlfriend from now on.
