1
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,994
   

2
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,564
I sent the money.

3
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:59,424
Those people are gone now, right?

4
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:02,404
Yes, my family of four is safe now.

5
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:05,194
You saved us, Sir.

6
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,654
That's great. I'm relieved.

7
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:12,424
By the way, don't lose the receipt for the payment, and keep it safe.

8
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:18,204
The transaction must've been recorded in the bank book, but just to be safe.

9
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:24,144
This is so much money.

10
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:27,034
I don't know how to return this favor.

11
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:31,774
I... I'll work hard and be sure to pay you back, Sir.

12
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:35,014
Okay, later. Later, when you can afford to.

13
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,554
Thank you so much. Thank you.

14
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:42,594
I'll be helping you temporarily for now, so don't worry.

15
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:46,804
Why don't you quit working at night and find a job you can work during the day?

16
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:49,484
That'd be good for the kids, too.

17
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,424
Sir, Sir...

18
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:56,774
I can't keep my head up because I feel so guilty and grateful.

19
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:58,634
Sir!

20
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,464
Sir...

21
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:04,824
It's okay. It's okay.

22
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,694
That's my in-law...

23
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:16,834
My gosh, w-who's that woman?

24
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:21,474
Ahjussi, please let me get off here.

25
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,274
You can't get off here. Get off at the next stop.

26
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:28,264
Aigoo, seriously. I passed them.

27
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,474
Hold on. Gosh...

28
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:35,244
What did I see just now?

29
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,924
Is my in-law...

30
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:43,144
h-had a woman?

31
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,954
Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong.

32
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,684
Seon Yeong.

33
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:52,644
Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong.

34
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:54,804
What's wrong, Mom? Is something going on?

35
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:57,424
Hey, is Seon Yeong home?

36
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:59,194
She left to meet someone earlier. Why?

37
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,034
Hold on.

38
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,414
Why is she...

39
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:08,534
 - The phone is powered off. You'll be...  
 - Why is her phone off at this important moment?

40
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,814
What's going on, Mom?

41
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:15,744
Hey, In-law is hugging a young woman

42
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:18,974
in the middle of the street right now.

43
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:21,424
In-law was hugging a young woman?

44
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,514
No way.

45
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:25,744
Gosh, seriously.

46
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:30,744
I didn't get to see her face, but her body and outfit

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,004
weren't of a woman his age.

48
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,204
It was a very young woman.

49
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:39,504
Gosh, how embarrassing. In our neighborhood, too.

50
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,444
Hey, Myeong Dong.

51
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:47,084
Maybe the In-law is being used by a gold digger.

52
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,694
Gold digger?

53
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,904
Why would you say something so gross, Mom?

54
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:57,084
Come on, why would a young woman hug an old man if she weren't a gold digger?

55
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,984
It wasn't just a normal hug. She was all the way in there.

56
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:03,674
She was using her whole body.

57
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,284
Really?

58
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,554
Gosh, I'm telling you.

59
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:12,334
By the way, what is Seon Yeong up to that I can't reach her?

60
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:16,264
Gosh, what are we supposed to do?

61
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,154
- No way. 
  - The phone is powered off. 

62
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:19,924
How frustrating.

63
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,944
This is a disaster.

64
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:24,324
What do we do?

65
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:29,994
So, did Ae Gyo end up taking Soo Yeon's master bedroom?

66
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:34,314
Yes, she called me to brag about it, too.

67
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:38,564
Gosh, Soo Yeon must've been upset. She can't tell anyone, either.

68
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:40,974
Is Ae Gyo out of her mind?

69
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:46,844
It makes no sense to live with your high school classmate as your mother-in-law.

70
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,744
Hey, Ae Gyo is coming.

71
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:55,124
Guys, guys.

72
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:58,054
Did you get into an accident on the way? What's wrong?

73
00:04:58,054 --> 00:05:00,364
It's not that.

74
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,984
You guys know Ji Hye, right? She used to be close to Seon Yeong.

75
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:06,944
Yes, I heard she moved to the US after marrying an American guy. Why?

76
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:08,964
I just ran into her at a department store.

77
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,434
She stopped by briefly before going to the airport with her husband.

78
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:14,854
We talked about this and that because we were excited.

79
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,864
And she asked me how Seon Yeong was doing.

80
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,534
So, I said she has a son, and she's living happily.

81
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,814
But she was so shocked and said,

82
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:25,964
"How strange. She's infertile." That's what she said!

83
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:28,174
Gosh, she was infertile?

84
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:32,514
Yes, she got her womb removed because the fibroid got too large.

85
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,814
She said, "How did she have a baby when she didn't have a womb?"

86
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:39,684
Thinking about it, I never heard she was pregnant,

87
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,594
but she suddenly said she had a son. I thought it was strange.

88
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:47,214
I knew it. Their son doesn't resemble them at all.

89
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,124
I wondered why that was. My gosh.

90
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:53,314
Yes, you're right. Only he has curly hair.

91
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:55,394
Seon Yeong and her husband don't.

92
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:59,774
My gosh, he must've been adopted.

93
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,734
Where did they find him?

94
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:04,634
What are you guys talking about right now?

95
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,944
How could you be like this?

96
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:15,414
Are you really my friends?

97
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:17,694
Seon Yeong, hold on.

98
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,514
When Seon Yeong had a baby,

99
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,584
I went to the hospital with her because her mother had passed away early on.

100
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,384
I helped her with the postnatal care, too.

101
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,134
What kind of nonsense are you saying now?

102
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:37,144
Try to put yourselves in her shoes.

103
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:40,584
How would you feel if someone said your kid was adopted?

104
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:45,814
What kind of friends gossip behind each other's backs?

105
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:48,504
I'm so disappointed in you guys.

106
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:01,494
Don't be upset, Seon Yeong.

107
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:04,914
They won't say stuff like that anymore.

108
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,884
Dae Chung found out now, too.

109
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:14,704
It doesn't matter either way.

110
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:22,334
But I'm so upset.

111
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:25,814
Of all people, how could my friends do that to me?

112
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,594
Dae Chung...

113
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,384
is your son you gave birth to.

114
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:39,894
You've been raising him with love all this time.

115
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,304
Thank you, Soo Yeon.

116
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:53,844
I would've had a hard time without you today.

117
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:57,464
Not at all. Don't mention it.

118
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:05,384
I must've built good karma in my previous life.

119
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:10,684
I don't know how I ended up with a friend like you.

120
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,894
I'm so grateful.

121
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,734
Thank you so much.

122
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:19,814
Hey, stop embarrassing me so much.

123
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,784
By the way,

124
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:28,654
is Dae Chung okay now?

125
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,334
Yes.

126
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,494
He's okay now.

127
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:36,664
I don't know how he really feels,

128
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:42,234
but he has studied harder ever since that happened.

129
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,774
Our family is acting naturally, too.

130
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,744
Really?

131
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,324
That's such a relief. It really is.

132
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,934
Soo Yeon was at the hospital when Seon Yeong had him.

133
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:07,014
Why did Ji Hye say such nonsense?

134
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:10,414
What the heck? I look like an idiot now.

135
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:12,924
I should've asked Ji Hye for her phone number.

136
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:16,174
- Gosh, I'm so angry. 
 - Oh, my.

137
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,544
You act like you're classy, but you don't even knock?

138
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,644
Are you really a mother?

139
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,604
How could you gossip about her child when you don't know anything?

140
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:28,474
Would you be happy if someone said Jin Dan isn't yours?

141
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:29,914
Why would I be?

142
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:32,254
Why are you bringing up my son now?

143
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:36,054
I was so shocked when I heard that from Ji Hye.

144
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,764
So I just told them since we were hanging out.

145
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,744
What's so bad about that?

146
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:43,254
You already yelled at me once. Why do it again?

147
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:46,574
You aren't the only one who cherishes your child.

148
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:49,074
Try to use your head a bit.

149
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,174
What?

150
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,094
Hey, I'm your mother-in-law.

151
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,834
How dare you talk to your mother-in-law like that?

152
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,844
- Try to act like an elder, then. 
 - Are you serious right now?

153
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,614
How could you do this to me?

154
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:03,154
Do you look down on me because I was your father-in-law's mistress?

155
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:06,454
I won't hold back anymore if you act like this.

156
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,014
Seriously. What did you say?

157
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:11,854
Did you laugh just now?

158
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:15,064
Do you think I'm funny? Do you?

159
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,094
What's all this commotion?

160
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,604
What's going on?

161
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:23,624
Honey...

162
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,254
I can no longer live in the same house with her.

163
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:31,624
Because of you and Father's will,

164
00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:36,504
I tried to put up with it, but I can't anymore.

165
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:40,214
- What? Look at her. 
 - Honey.

166
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,334
What's she so proud of?

167
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:47,064
She never called me "Mother" or treated me like a mother-in-law.

168
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,574
Jin Taek Oppa... I mean, Chairman Gong.

169
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:53,424
I'm so sad and upset.

170
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:58,174
You should scold Soo Yeon if you care about your late father in heaven.

171
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:01,254
How long do I have to live like this?

172
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:04,434
I'll find you a place.

173
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:07,154
I think you should move out.

174
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,144
W-What did you say?

175
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:12,044
Chairman Gong, what did you just say?

176
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,584
Are you telling me to move out?

177
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,844
Because of Father's will and...

178
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:18,674
the fact that you gave birth to my father's son,

179
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:22,514
I managed to persuade my wife and let you move in.

180
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:27,254
But she says she can't live with you. What else can I do?

181
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,414
Jin Taek Oppa... I mean, Chairman Gong.

182
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:34,554
What do I do? Gosh, what do I do?

183
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,474
Gosh, what do I do?

184
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:40,474
Aigoo, you little... You stupid little thing.

185
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:41,914
Look at yourself.

186
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,764
What's in your brain?

187
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:45,704
Do you have any thoughts at all?

188
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,024
It hurts.

189
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,174
Why are you annoying me now?

190
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,624
You can't just spew words without thinking.

191
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:12,144
This is blueberry juice.

192
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:15,134
I made it myself.

193
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:19,764
This is very good for your eyes because it's rich in anthocyanin.

194
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:23,064
Eyesight is very important at our age.

195
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:25,504
You drink it.

196
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,634
Please leave. I want to rest.

197
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:36,554
Soo Yeon, I'm sorry.

198
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,704
Thinking about it, I was wrong.

199
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:41,674
I was too careless.

200
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:45,014
I'll apologize to Seon Yeong, too.

201
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,004
I'll live quietly as you told me to from now on.

202
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,694
Just don't tell me to move out.

203
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:53,984
I'd be too lonely if I moved out of here.

204
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:57,194
You know how lonely I get easily.

205
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,114
I beg you, Soo Yeon.

206
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,274
I'll behave from now on.

207
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:05,604
You don't have to treat me as a mother-in-law.

208
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:11,974
So please just let me live in this house. Please?

209
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,674
   

210
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:43,264
- Hello? 
  - Oppa, Oppa! 

211
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,334
Who's this...  Park Do Ra?

212
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:47,334
 Oppa, please come quickly. 

213
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:50,624
 - The bullies are threatening me for money again.  
 - What?

214
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,474
Where are you right now?

215
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,440
   

216
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,594
This has to be the right place.

217
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,624
Where is she?

218
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,034
Maybe they took her somewhere else.

219
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:18,004
Oppa!

220
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,994
Park Do Ra?

221
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,094
Why do you look like this?

222
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,404
Well, this?

223
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:33,164
I had an audition today but didn't get to remove makeup.

224
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,564
What do you think, Oppa?

225
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:41,684
What kind of audition was it that they made a child look like this?

226
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:45,334
Right, where are the bullies? Where are they?

227
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:49,384
Well, they ran away when I said you were coming.

228
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,714
Really?

229
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:53,834
Did you get hurt at all?

230
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,304
Did they beat you at all?

231
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:57,734
No, I'm fine.

232
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,534
That's a relief. Let's go home, then.

233
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,794
You just want to go home?

234
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:07,194
Of course, I do. What would I do here?

235
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:12,334
Go home and remove the silly makeup. Get changed, too.

236
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,384
People are staring.

237
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:19,704
But you came this far. Let's ride theng and merry-go-round, at least.

238
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:22,414
What? Merry-go-round?

239
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:23,974
What am I, a child?

240
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:27,434
I've never been on a merry-go-round.

241
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,594
This is my first time at a theme park.

242
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,514
You've never been to a theme park?

243
00:15:54,134 --> 00:16:03,314
♫  You keep showing up and make my heart flutter and get me excited over and over  ♫

244
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:07,314
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

245
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:10,574
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

246
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:15,234
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

247
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:21,234
♫  The sky is clearer than usual, and my feet feel light  ♫

248
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:26,364
♫  A sudden heavy rain is getting me wet  ♫

249
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:32,644
♫  You always show up in moments like this  ♫

250
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,504
Hey, Do Ra...

251
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:42,314
Whoa.

252
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,244
Huh?

253
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:53,234
Why did this come out of there?

254
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:57,334
Hey.

255
00:16:57,334 --> 00:17:00,024
Why did you put a sock in there?

256
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:04,044
Whatever!

257
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:06,984
Seriously.

258
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,684
Why would she do that?

259
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:12,714
Hey, Park Do Ra! Where are you going?

260
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:16,344
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

261
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:19,674
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

262
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:23,934
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

263
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:31,894
♫  You keep showing up and make my heart flutter and get me excited over and over  ♫

264
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:35,554
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

265
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,384
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

266
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,494
Hey! Park Do Ra.

267
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:58,344
You lied that you got attacked by the bullies

268
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,584
and went to an audition, didn't you?

269
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:06,954
Why are you doing this to me? Huh?

270
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:11,044
I told you. I like you, Oppa.

271
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:15,404
I wanted to be with you and hang out with you, okay?

272
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,464
What?

273
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,464
So you lied to make me come here,

274
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:24,454
put on makeup, a short skirt, and heels, and pretended to be an adult

275
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:27,044
b-by putting socks in there, too?

276
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:31,044
Yes, I wanted to look like a grownup woman for you because I like you.

277
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,984
Because you only think of me as a little kid next door.

278
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:38,704
You're just an elementary schooler.

279
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:42,304
Don't act like you know me from now on, Park Do Ra.

280
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:46,244
I won't act like I know you, either. Got it?

281
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:49,014
Who do you think you are?

282
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:51,354
You think you're that special?

283
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:53,864
Can't an elementary schooler like you?

284
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:58,434
You said that age doesn't matter in love.

285
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:05,814
It's not my fault that I like you.

286
00:19:05,814 --> 00:19:10,534
You said that being in love isn't a crime.

287
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,364
Do Ra...

288
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:21,504
Get up.

289
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:23,174
Stop crying.

290
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,874
Hurry.

291
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:28,804
People are staring at us.

292
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:31,094
Get up right now, I said.

293
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,994
Otherwise, I'll just leave, okay?

294
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:40,254
Park Do Ra, listen carefully.

295
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:43,584
I need to be good to my parents.

296
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,724
You understand why, right?

297
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:50,764
You also told me to study hard.

298
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:57,684
That's why I'm trying to study hard now. Should you be... distracting me or not?

299
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:05,174
If you really like me, you shouldn't, right?

300
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:11,914
Yes, but I still like you. What can I do?

301
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:18,004
Do Ra, I don't have time to like someone and hang out right now.

302
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:22,934
So let's talk again once you turn 20.

303
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:25,304
- You mean it, right? 
 - Yes. So let's go.

304
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:28,834
Yes. So let's go.

305
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,984
But there's no point if you get a girlfriend before I turn 20.

306
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,804
So, could you promise not to get a girlfriend before I turn 20?

307
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,404
Are you listening to me, Oppa?

308
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,644
Wait for me!

309
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,094
Hey...

310
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,594
Hey, hey...

311
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,674
Where were you all this time?

312
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:57,554
Why was your phone turned off?

313
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:00,444
My phone battery died.

314
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:03,444
What is it? Did something happen at home?

315
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:06,354
Did something happen to Dae Chung?

316
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:09,444
It's not him. It's your father.

317
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:11,944
I'm talking about In-law.

318
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,954
What about my father?

319
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:18,304
Don't be shocked when I tell you this.

320
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:21,776
Your father is dating. He's dating a young woman.

321
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:27,106
My father is? A young woman?

322
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,716
Gosh, Mother.

323
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:31,206
Gosh, seriously. Hey.

324
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,876
I saw it on the way home on the bus.

325
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,156
I saw it clearly myself.

326
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:39,376
He was hugging a young woman on the street, okay?

327
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:43,916
Mother, you know my father wouldn't do that in public.

328
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,906
Gosh, what kind of nonsense is that—

329
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,536
Hey, don't you know he's a man, too?

330
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:53,136
An old man is still a man. There's an old saying, too.

331
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:56,476
That if a man has the strength to walk past a door sill, his private area works—

332
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:58,816
- Mother! 
 - You scared me.

333
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,586
What's wrong with you, Mother?

334
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:05,726
I get so stressed out whenever you act like this.

335
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:08,896
Not to mention what happened to Dae Chung.

336
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,796
I was feeling so tired today already.

337
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:19,496
Mom, are you sure you weren't mistaken?

338
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:22,016
You said you saw it on the bus.

339
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:26,816
Why is she getting so angry, by the way?

340
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Was I mistaken?

341
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,396
It definitely looked like In-law.

342
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:35,476
I suppose he's not someone who'd do that.

343
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,036
Right...

344
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:42,186
Unni, Mom thinks she was mistaken because of her poor eyesight.

345
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:48,566
I'm sorry for saying something silly, Seon Yeong.

346
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:52,096
But I don't think so, though...

347
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:54,626
It was definitely In-law.

348
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:57,646
Mom, go inside. Go inside.

349
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:07,536
Aigoo, I'll get you more food. Eat slowly.

350
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:09,986
Mom, can I order more after we finish this?

351
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:12,326
Of course. Help yourselves. Help yourselves.

352
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,646
I'll order as much as you want.

353
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:18,216
Mom, I haven't had ribs this good in a long time.

354
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:20,406
I've wanted to have beef like this for a long time.

355
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:23,946
Is that so, Do Jun? Eat a lot. Eat a lot.

356
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,366
Eat, eat.

357
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:28,856
By the way, this is really expensive because it's beef.

358
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:31,426
Can we really eat so much?

359
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,776
Mom, do you have money?

360
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:38,956
We bought a lot of clothes and shoes, too.

361
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:42,416
Where did you suddenly get money, Mom?

362
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:48,146
I was paid back all the money I lent.

363
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,466
- Really? 
 - Yes.

364
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:51,996
Don't worry and eat.

365
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:55,726
Eat, eat. Eat quickly. Come on.

366
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:02,526
Eat slowly, Do Jun. You'll get indigestion.

367
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:05,116
It's because Hyung and Noona are eating fast.

368
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:08,146
I'll order more if you want more. Go ahead and eat.

369
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,246
Take your time and eat a lot.

370
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:13,976
We'll have two servings of ribs.

371
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:16,486
No, four servings. Four servings, please.

372
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,276
I got more. Eat, eat.

373
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:20,986
Aigoo, silly me. Silly me.

374
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:24,396
I forgot to put the laundry away.

375
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:37,646
It definitely looked like In-law.

376
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,506
I need magnifying glasses for things up close,

377
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:44,026
but I have no problem seeing things far away.

378
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,446
Am I wrong?

379
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:53,606
Gosh, where did the whole family go together?

380
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:56,706
I can tell you had a barbecue.

381
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,926
Yes, we had beef ribs.

382
00:24:58,926 --> 00:25:00,786
We ate so much of it.

383
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:06,166
I see. You must've been happy to eat something so tasty.

384
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,936
Looks like you did a lot of shopping, too.

385
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:11,706
What's all this stuff you got?

386
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:15,966
Mom got us a lot of new clothes and shoes.

387
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:18,496
Oh, really?

388
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:21,746
You should go inside now. Go in. Go in.

389
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:25,586
- Good night. 
 - Go in, go in. Yes, yes.

390
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:28,236
I'll go inside, too.

391
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:33,746
By the way, Ms. Baek, don't you have to work today?

392
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,766
Well, I quit my job.

393
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:39,426
I'll take a break and look for a daytime job.

394
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:43,736
I decided not to leave the kids alone at night. Well, then...

395
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:45,596
That's a good plan.

396
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:51,536
By the way, this looks like real mink.

397
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:56,346
Gosh, it's so soft and pretty.

398
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,286
Looks like it's new. How much do things like this cost?

399
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:02,296
They're really expensive, right?

400
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:05,816
Well, a little...

401
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:08,306
I'll go inside now, then.

402
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:18,796
Where did she get the money to spend so much all of a sudden?

403
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:26,776
Oh, gosh! Oh, my gosh! My gosh...

404
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:33,636
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong.

405
00:26:33,636 --> 00:26:35,986
Seon Yeong, hey, hey.

406
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:39,026
Ms. Baek, our tenant. Aigoo...

407
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:43,486
I think she found a rich old man somewhere.

408
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,156
What do you mean by that?

409
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:48,106
Dressed in a new mink coat,

410
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,636
she came back with shopping bags in both hands

411
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:54,666
after going out for beef ribs with her kids.

412
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,276
Hey, she didn't even have rice that

413
00:26:57,276 --> 00:27:00,446
she stole rice from our place a few days ago.

414
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:04,196
Where did she suddenly get the money?

415
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:06,166
I know, huh?

416
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,746
She's taking a break from work for a while, too.

417
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:13,156
She has three kids. She needs to make money, no matter what.

418
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:15,306
Isn't it strange?

419
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:17,916
It does sound strange.

420
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:23,754
She must've found a foolish old man somewhere.

421
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:27,594
Mother, you'd better not say that to anyone.

422
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:30,454
I'm saying this just between you and me.

423
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:35,094
Gosh, how disturbing. I don't like it.

424
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:40,284
I wish I could kick her out immediately.

425
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:42,934
Seon Yeong...

426
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:45,084
since we're on the topic...

427
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:48,474
Try not to get so angry.

428
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:57,084
Try asking your father if he's seeing someone by chance.

429
00:27:57,084 --> 00:28:00,464
Mother, you said you were mistaken.

430
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:02,624
You never know what would happen.

431
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:05,294
And it wouldn't hurt to be careful in advance.

432
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:10,254
I've been bothered and worried about what I saw today.

433
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:12,514
Mother!

434
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,314
Okay, okay. I hear you.

435
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:20,814
In-law wouldn't do that even if everyone else does.

436
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:27,414
Hey, did you get herbal medicine just for your father again?

437
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,104
I'll get yours next time.

438
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:32,294
My gosh. "I'll get yours next time."

439
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,214
Gosh, that little brat.

440
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,464
She always says "later" to me.

441
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:41,514
I... I'll just...

442
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:50,144
Dad, drink this up.

443
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:52,384
Why did you get herbal medicine?

444
00:28:52,384 --> 00:28:54,454
You should've gotten some for Hyeon Cheol, who works.

445
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:58,544
He doesn't need stuff like this yet. He's young.

446
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:01,544
I don't need it, either. I'm still full of energy.

447
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,834
I can't be without you.

448
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:07,624
You need to live a healthy and long life with me.

449
00:29:07,624 --> 00:29:10,454
It's getting cold. Drink it now.

450
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:18,744
 You never know what would happen. 

451
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:21,414
 And it wouldn't hurt to be careful in advance. 

452
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:27,384
 I've been bothered and worried about what I saw today. 

453
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,354
Dad.

454
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:36,224
What? Do you need to tell me something?

455
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,864
N-No, it's nothing.

456
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:42,534
Here's candy for you.

457
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,974
Thank you, my daughter.

458
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:07,834
- I love that you don't have to go to work at night. 
 - What?

459
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,014
Me, too. Me, too.

460
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:11,324
- Are you that happy? 
 - Yes, I am.

461
00:30:11,324 --> 00:30:13,454
Gosh, you know...

462
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:16,674
I won't work at night from now on.

463
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:18,614
How exciting. Really?

464
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:20,284
- Yes. 
 - Do you mean it, Mom?

465
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:21,794
- Really? 
 - Yes.

466
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:24,734
I'm excited, too. I'm so happy.

467
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:28,024
I'm so happy, too. I love not having to work at night.

468
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:30,424
Gosh, I'm happy. My babies.

469
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,664
Are you happy? Gosh, really?

470
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,334
My goodness. I'm happy, too.

471
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,074
Let's sleep now. Let's sleep. Let's sleep.

472
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,754
Let's go to sleep.

473
00:30:41,294 --> 00:30:44,174
Gosh, it's so nice to stay at home.

474
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,674
 I'll get Dae Chung to promise me tomorrow that 

475
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:57,114
 he won't get a girlfriend before I turn 20. 

476
00:31:18,684 --> 00:31:21,624
What's going on with Dae Chung Oppa?

477
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,914
What's wrong with him?

478
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:31,444
   

479
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:34,324
- Okay. 
 - Bye, Auntie.

480
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:42,544
- Noona. 
 - Hey, Dae Chung.

481
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,584
- Dae Chung. 
 - Noona.

482
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,064
Have you been well?

483
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:49,934
Why did you ignore my calls?

484
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:52,264
Do you know how much I waited for you to call?

485
00:31:52,264 --> 00:31:54,464
I'm sorry, Dae Chung.

486
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:56,284
I missed you, too.

487
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,774
I missed you so much, too.

488
00:31:58,774 --> 00:32:01,494
How could you not even call me?

489
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:03,534
I'm sorry, Dae Chung.

490
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:05,554
I'm so sorry.

491
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:07,874
But we can't see each other.

492
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:09,784
That's why.

493
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:16,454
Noona, I can't explain everything that has happened,

494
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:20,274
but give me just a year. Until the college entrance exam ends.

495
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:23,374
Please wait for me without changing your mind.

496
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,474
I'll run to you as soon as I finish the exam.

497
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:29,594
Okay, I'll wait for you.

498
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:31,654
Noona.

499
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:33,074
Dae Chung.

500
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:35,474
How long has it been?

501
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:37,184
- You got skinny. 
 - Hey!

502
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:39,594
Get away from each other. Get away now!

503
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:43,364
- You little! Do you want my business to fail— 
 - Don't treat him like that!

504
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,614
Hey! Get away. Get away!

505
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:47,954
Come here. Here's the taxi. Come here.

506
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:49,414
- Come here. 
 - Dae Chung!

507
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:51,014
Dae Chung or whatever. Get in.

508
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:52,324
- Noona. 
 - Go, go, go.

509
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:54,344
- Get going, Ahjussi. Go! 
 - Noona.

510
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:56,834
Hey! Hey!

511
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,354
Noona!

512
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:01,334
Don't forget what I said!

513
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:04,654
It's just for a year!

514
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:07,314
We'll be together in a year!

515
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:09,644
Noona!

516
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,234
Dae Chung Oppa...

517
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:19,194
How could you do this to me?

518
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:23,124
He hasn't gotten over Jeong Mi yet.

519
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:27,554
Why would he tell me to wait until I turn 20?

520
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:31,594
Dae Chung, you're a bad Oppa.

521
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,974
I hate you, too!

522
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:40,654
Hey, Myeong Dong, what's this noise?

523
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:42,624
It sounds like whistling.

524
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:44,304
My gosh.

525
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:48,564
Gosh, In-law.

526
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:51,074
I've never heard you whistling.

527
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:53,064
You're very good.

528
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,064
It's "Paper Crane," right?

529
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,294
Well, yes.

530
00:33:57,894 --> 00:33:59,624
- I'll see you later. 
 - Yes.

531
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:01,904
See you later.

532
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:06,404
My gosh, what do we do?

533
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:08,944
He's even whistling now.

534
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:10,864
Hey, where did Seon Yeong go?

535
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:13,654
She should've heard that whistling.

536
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:16,014
Did she go to the dry cleaner?

537
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,354
Mom, where are you going?

538
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:28,054
Mom! Mom!

539
00:34:31,184 --> 00:34:33,194
Ms. Baek.

540
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,524
You made it.

541
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:39,554
Why did you want to meet here today?

542
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:42,844
There's a famous loach soup place back here.

543
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:44,884
I wanted to treat you.

544
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:48,064
- Do you like loach soup?
- Yes, of course.

545
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:50,534
Let's go. We're having a loach soup date today, then.

546
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:52,694
Oh, okay.

547
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:55,554
Gosh, careful. Careful.

548
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,654
You should be careful, too.

549
00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,184
The ground is not even.

550
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:00,844
Okay.

551
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:05,044
Walking with arms locked makes it really feel like a date.

552
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:06,624
Yes.

553
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:17,624
Do you like that?

554
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:20,924
No, I was just looking.

555
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:22,574
Let's go in. Let's get one.

556
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:25,384
No, I don't need any jewelry in my situation.

557
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,114
It's okay. It's okay.

558
00:35:27,114 --> 00:35:30,924
It's because I want to get you one. Follow me.

559
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:36,024
Gosh, I'm okay.

560
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:47,074
Gosh, it suits you so well... since you're so beautiful.

561
00:35:47,074 --> 00:35:49,504
- Really? 
 - Yes.

562
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,554
Do you like it?

563
00:35:52,554 --> 00:35:55,384
Yes, I like it.

564
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:02,344
Gosh, this is pretty, too.

565
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:05,464
T-That's Ms. Baek.

566
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:10,204
They're locking arms in broad daylight?

567
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:17,144
The woman in front of the bank must've been her, too.

568
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:19,634
Gosh. My gosh.

569
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:23,954
T-That cunning woman...

570
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:27,994
Gosh, is In-law out of his mind?

571
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:30,424
Evidence. Evidence. Evidence.

572
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,284
My phone...

573
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:36,074
How could I leave my phone at home at an important moment like this?

574
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:47,174
Gosh, the tangerines look great today.

575
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,414
I'm glad you came.

576
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:54,064
I was just about to call you.

577
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:57,704
Me? What for?

578
00:36:57,704 --> 00:37:01,244
I'm not sure if I should tell you or not.

579
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:06,604
I still think you need to know.

580
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,624
What is it? Tell me.

581
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:14,534
You know my daughter works at the bank at the intersection, right?

582
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:16,594
Yes, of course.

583
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:21,574
She told me that... Dae Chung's grandpa...

584
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:26,834
the Principal took out 30 million won and gave it to that woman.

585
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,654
What...

586
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:31,064
My father... That woman? Who?

587
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:34,494
Ms. Baek, who's renting from you.

588
00:37:34,494 --> 00:37:38,120
Why would he give her that much money?

589
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,240
What did you say?

590
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:48,724
My father gave Ms. Baek 30 million won?

591
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:56,171
No, there's no way.

592
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,561
My father and Ms. Baek...

593
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:02,731
He's so much older than her.

594
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:06,071
Why would he date someone so young...

595
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:08,421
- With a woman with crazy makeup like that— 
 - Hey, hey!

596
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:10,831
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong!

597
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,861
- Seon Yeong! 
 - Mother.

598
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:16,041
- Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong! 
 - What is it now, Mother?

599
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,211
Seon Yeong, I was right.

600
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:19,811
I did see it correctly.

601
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:23,151
D-Do you know who that woman was?

602
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,521
It was Ms. Baek. Ms. Baek.

603
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:26,121
Ms. Baek, our tenant!

604
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:29,331
I saw them right in front of me just now.

605
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:32,531
She was wearing a necklace at a jewelry shop holding him like this.

606
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:34,851
She was laughing and smiling like this...

607
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:36,821
Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong!

608
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:38,651
Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong!  Seon Yeong.

609
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,941
H-Honey. Honey, what's wrong?

610
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:42,571
- Seon Yeong. 
 - Wake up.

611
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,621
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

612
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:47,701
Okay. Careful. Careful.

613
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,981
- My goodness. 
 - Unni.

614
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:51,641
Oh, yes.

615
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:54,481
You should drink some water.

616
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:56,411
Drink it.

617
00:38:58,591 --> 00:39:00,941
Are you okay?

618
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,971
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

619
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:08,591
I mean, I'm so shocked right now.

620
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:10,851
Imagine how she must feel.

621
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:14,041
He was buying her a gold necklace at the jewelry shop.

622
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,981
The In-law has completely lost his mind.

623
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:20,521
He looked totally smitten, looking at Ms. Baek.

624
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:24,361
He's completely lost it. Totally lost it, as they say.

625
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:29,531
Aigoo, Ms. Baek, that cunning woman, seduced In-law.

626
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:34,431
She totally seduced him, all right. I'm telling you.

627
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:38,631
That's why I said I had a bad feeling about her from the beginning.

628
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:41,981
We let a gold digger in. A gold digger.

629
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:45,371
- Hey. Seon Yeong. 
 - Honey. Honey. 
 - Unni.

630
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:47,131
- Unni. 
 - Seon Yeong.

631
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,131
What are you talking about right now?

632
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:54,281
Are you saying I seduced the Elder for money?

633
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:58,891
He wouldn't have lent you that much money for no reason.

634
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:01,831
He must've gotten something in return.

635
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:05,701
You shouldn't argue about that with me. Go ask him directly.

636
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:08,771
Ask him if I ever asked for money.

637
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:13,381
I'm just borrowing it because he offered it to me first.

638
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:14,971
Are you sure about that?

639
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:18,641
Go ahead and ask him if it's true or not.

640
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:24,201
You can't do this because I'm poor and rent a room from you.

641
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,021
I can just pay him back. Can't I?

642
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:32,301
How dare you treat me like a woman who takes advantage of an old man?

643
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:37,581
Okay, then.

644
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:46,751
Seriously.

645
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:50,821
Gosh, how did she find out? How? How?

646
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:57,241
Dad, where are you right now?

647
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,511
We're home.

648
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:14,341
Dad.

649
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:17,451
What are you doing out in the cold?

650
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:22,441
Where have you been holding Do Jun's hand?

651
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:26,301
I had jjajangmyeon with Do Jun.

652
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:29,831
He got me jjajangmyeon, tangsuyuk,

653
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,931
and got me a game console, too.

654
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,701
And it's not even Christmas today.

655
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:39,641
Why would you buy him jjajangmyeon and a game console?

656
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,681
Seon Yeong.

657
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:46,601
We need to talk, Dad.

658
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:54,601
I think she's angry, Grandpa.

659
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:59,381
No, no. She's not angry. It's okay. It's okay.

660
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:06,811
Are you saying you indeed lent her 30 million won?

661
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,651
Yes.

662
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:15,151
Wait... but why?

663
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:19,391
How can you trust her with that much money?

664
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:23,961
This is no good. I'll go and get that money back from her now.

665
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,841
- Right now— 
 - That's not necessary.

666
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:30,801
I just gave her that money.

667
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,991
What did you say?

668
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:35,871
You just gave it to her?

669
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,461
Oh, my goodness.

670
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:41,201
Hey, Hyeon Cheol, what's...

671
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:44,601
What's he saying right now?

672
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:48,631
He didn't lend it, and he just gave it to her, I think.

673
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:50,651
Oh, my God.

674
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:56,701
My gosh. It wasn't just 30,000 won or 300,000 won. But 30 million won?

675
00:42:56,701 --> 00:43:01,181
Gosh, he must be out of his mind.

676
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:02,971
Maybe he has dementia.

677
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:05,241
Mom, please...

678
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:08,461
- What's going on? 
 - Hey.

679
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:14,401
What are you talking about, Dad?

680
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:17,561
You didn't lend it, but you just gave it to her?

681
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:21,191
Yes, like I already said,

682
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:25,501
Ms. Baek never asked me for money.

683
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:28,611
So you don't have to yell at her.

684
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:31,191
That's why I'm asking you why.

685
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,591
She never asked for it. Why did you give her that money, then?

686
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:38,661
Why did you? What's so great about that woman?

687
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,221
I wanted to.

688
00:43:42,181 --> 00:43:44,501
I wanted to give it to her.

689
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:47,391
I didn't want to see her suffer.

690
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:51,761
Dad...

691
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:57,231
Dad, by chance... do you...

692
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:59,001
Yes.

693
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:02,511
I like that woman.

694
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:06,291
That's why I gave it to her.

695
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:09,991
Dad.

696
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,161
What's wrong?

697
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:28,871
You haven't talked to him yet?

698
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,361
I did talk to my father.

699
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:41,581
He did say he lent you that money.

700
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:47,061
See? That's what I said.

701
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:52,271
Since we're on the topic...

702
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:56,701
my father likes you a lot.

703
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:01,171
He's been living a lonely life for a long time.

704
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:04,881
As long as you're okay,

705
00:45:04,881 --> 00:45:08,461
I'm thinking of letting you see him.

706
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:14,391
He's much older, but as long as you like each other—

707
00:45:14,391 --> 00:45:15,871
What?

708
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,861
What did you say?

709
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:21,081
What are you talking about right now?

710
00:45:22,161 --> 00:45:26,211
I heard you knitted him a scarf and...

711
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:29,511
you went out on dates a few times, too.

712
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,341
Excuse me, are you crazy?

713
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:33,971
What do you mean, dates? We just had a few drinks

714
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:38,511
and I invited him to a movie because I got two tickets. That's all.

715
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:42,291
And as for that scarf, since he lent me money...

716
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:46,121
I knitted one for him as a thank you. That's all.

717
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:52,561
Do you mean you had no feelings for my father at all?

718
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:55,141
Why did you take his money, then?

719
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:57,741
You must've accepted the money because something was going on.

720
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:59,921
Excuse me, how can you say that?

721
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:05,341
Would you want to date a grandpa like that if you were me? Huh?

722
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:07,031
Goodness...

723
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:10,301
Oh, my. Dad.

724
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:15,201
Grandpa, I'm glad you're here.

725
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:19,961
Grandpa, when did I say I liked you?

726
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:23,371
Grandpa, did I ever ask for money from you?

727
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:27,731
I locked arms with you to help you walk, Grandpa.

728
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,591
Did you think I did it because I liked you?

729
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:33,231
Wow, seriously. Are you senile?

730
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:35,391
Don't you know how much older you are than me?

731
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,891
And that money...

732
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:40,531
Did you lend me that trying to do something with me?

733
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,981
Wow, seriously.

734
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:45,791
I'll make sure to pay you back before I die, Grandpa.

735
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:49,231
I'll pay you back even if I have to sell my body.

736
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:54,621
Seriously. How dare you try to take a smelly old man like him?

737
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:58,271
Is this woman serious right now?

738
00:46:58,271 --> 00:47:01,891
Gosh, Dad! Dad! Dad!

739
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:05,001
Dad! Wake up, Dad! Dad!

740
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:07,831
Wake up, Dad!

741
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:11,781
Call 911 right now! Hurry!

742
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:17,130
   

743
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,581
When will we get to the hospital?

744
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:24,871
We'll arrive in five minutes.

745
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,601
Seon Yeong.

746
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,661
Dad.

747
00:47:35,661 --> 00:47:39,691
It will be okay. Nothing will happen.

748
00:47:40,341 --> 00:47:43,871
My daughter, Seon Yeong.

749
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,111
Thank you.

750
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,561
Don't say such a thing.

751
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:53,691
Dad, wake up. Wake up.

752
00:47:54,921 --> 00:48:00,031
Seon Yeong, listen to me carefully.

753
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,931
Seon Yeong,

754
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:09,281
I have no regrets...

755
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:12,701
and I don't blame anyone.

756
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:17,931
So don't blame that woman.

757
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:23,791
And don't accept her money.

758
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,621
Why do you keep saying stuff like that, Dad?

759
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,301
Okay.

760
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:33,991
Okay, so don't say stuff like that anymore.

761
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:37,071
Dad. Hang in there, Dad.

762
00:48:37,071 --> 00:48:38,971
We're almost at the hospital.

763
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:41,691
We'll get there in a bit.

764
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:44,631
I'm sure you'll be okay.

765
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,751
My daughter.

766
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:49,851
My daughter.

767
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:53,181
Seon Yeong,

768
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:57,381
thank you for everything.

769
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,781
Dad.

770
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:05,201
Dad! No, Dad! Dad!

771
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:07,611
Dad! Don't do this!

772
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,911
Gosh, please help him!

773
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:12,661
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

774
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:17,291
I must've been crazy. I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

775
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:21,051
Gosh! Why did I say all that?

776
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:23,881
I should've thought it through.

777
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:27,951
Nothing would happen to him, right?

778
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:30,681
What do I do? What do I do?

779
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,411
- What do I do? 
 - What's wrong, Mom?

780
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:34,081
Huh?

781
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:37,661
Mom, did a debt collector come again?

782
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:40,921
No, no, it's not like that. It's nothing.

783
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:44,331
I... I'll step out for a second.

784
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:47,161
Okay? I'll be right back.

785
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:50,891
No, no. What do I do? What do I do?

786
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:01,911
What? What did you say just now?

787
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:07,111
Mr. Kim Joon Seob died from a heart attack caused by shock.

788
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:09,201
Go to the funeral service area.

789
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,581
Nurse.

790
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:13,431
Gosh, no way. No way.

791
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:16,371
Gosh, what do I do? What do I do?

792
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:18,481
What do I do? What do I do?

793
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:21,331
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

794
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:26,301
What am I going to do now? What do I do? What do I do?

795
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:37,731
Oppa, someone from the funeral service wants to talk to you.

796
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:39,901
Oh, okay.

797
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:59,641
Did Grandpa really pass away?

798
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,711
He was just alive.

799
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:07,231
This makes no sense.

800
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,461
Where did Grandpa go?

801
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:14,141
Yes, Dae Chung.

802
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:18,331
He didn't pass away.

803
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:21,671
I need to go check again.

804
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:24,051
- Unni, Unni— 
 - Honey!

805
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:26,671
Honey, Dad didn't die!

806
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:28,631
I don't think he's dead!

807
00:51:28,631 --> 00:51:31,071
Seon Yeong, what's wrong? Seon Yeong.

808
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:33,381
Honey, calm down. Don't be like that.

809
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,431
No, my dad didn't die!

810
00:51:36,431 --> 00:51:39,171
He didn't die!

811
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:42,981
He'd never die leaving me behind!

812
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:45,771
There's no way he would do that!

813
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,691
Unni!

814
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,341
Unni, Unni, Unni!

815
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,631
Unni!

816
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:54,831
Dad!

817
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:57,081
Unni.

818
00:51:58,871 --> 00:52:02,501
Aigoo! Oh, my goodness!

819
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:09,471
How could we go through this just because of that one gold digger?

820
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:15,831
Gosh, I feel so sorry for my in-law.

821
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:20,871
Gosh, he was such a good man.

822
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:27,451
T-T-That...

823
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:29,861
T-That bitch.

824
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:34,751
H-How dare you show your face here! That bitch!

825
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,221
Hey!

826
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:41,461
Aigoo, aigoo! That bitch! Hey!

827
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:42,651
Mom!

828
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:44,861
You bitch!

829
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,621
How dare you? Get over here!

830
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:50,851
Heaven will punish you!

831
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,061
You bitch!

832
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:56,901
How dare you? How dare you?

833
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:00,761
You bitch!

834
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,441
How could you!

835
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:06,031
How dare you?

836
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:19,531
You bitch! You bitch!

837
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:23,311
You bitch! How dare you?

838
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,301
You bitch!

839
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:32,131
Are you here to check if he's dead or not? You bitch!

840
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:38,031
God will punish you! God will punish you, you bitch! Bitch!

841
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:49,191
Park Do Ra, Do Shik! Get up now. Get up.

842
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:50,871
- What? 
 - What, Mom?

843
00:53:50,871 --> 00:53:52,091
What's wrong?

844
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:53,721
Pack your stuff. Pack your stuff right now.

845
00:53:53,721 --> 00:53:56,571
We need to get out of this house.

846
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:59,121
Mom, are we moving again?

847
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:03,091
- Why all of a sudden? 
 - Don't ask and pack your stuff now!

848
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:05,301
I don't want to move.

849
00:54:05,301 --> 00:54:09,231
Grandpa promised me that he'd teach me a game of Go tomorrow.

850
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:11,351
You're driving me crazy!

851
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:14,251
What are you doing, Do Ra? Pack your stuff!

852
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:18,001
Do Jun, get dressed. Hurry.

853
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:20,281
I don't want to. I won't leave.

854
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:22,571
I want to live in this house.

855
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:24,481
I like this place.

856
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:27,561
Seriously! Why don't you listen to me?

857
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:29,141
Why are you giving me a hard time? Why?

858
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,541
Why are you giving me a hard time?

859
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,051
- Fine, you live here on your own. I'll leave you. 
 - Don't hit him.

860
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,771
You live here on your own.

861
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,401
You're not my son starting today, little brat!

862
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:39,941
Okay, Mom. We'll pack our stuff.

863
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:42,081
- Don't hit Do Jun. 
 - Seriously.

864
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:43,881
Get dressed and pack your stuff.

865
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,931
Pack your stuff. Get dressed!

866
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:00,131
Mom, I want to say goodbye to Grandpa.

867
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:04,171
I promised to play Go with him tomorrow.

868
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:08,011
He's not here. You can say goodbye later. Let's go.

869
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:11,001
Mom, shouldn't we still say goodbye?

870
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:13,451
I already said goodbye.

871
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:15,511
No one's at home right now.

872
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:17,991
Let's go. Go!

873
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:44,891
It's snowing.

874
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:48,171
Let's go. We need to go.

875
00:55:48,171 --> 00:55:51,471
We need to go. Let's go.

876
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:11,431
Thanks.

877
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,021
Mr. Kim, hold on.

878
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:30,051
Ma Ri. Gong Ma Ri.

879
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:31,661
You caught me.

880
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:35,471
Hey, I told you not to rollerskate. It's dangerous.

881
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:37,951
You're not even wearing the helmet, either.

882
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:41,281
I'll wear the helmet. Let me rollerskate.

883
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:44,441
No, go inside now.

884
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:47,311
All the other kids rollerskate.

885
00:56:47,311 --> 00:56:49,101
Why am I not allowed to?

886
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:52,231
Ma Ri, listen to Dad, okay?

887
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:53,671
Okay.

888
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:57,691
He always overreacts because he loves me too much.

889
00:56:57,691 --> 00:56:59,551
I should try to understand.

890
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:01,871
Okay, go inside now, my daughter.

891
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:04,791
I'm going to a funeral with Mom, okay?

892
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,361
- Let's go. 
 - I heard you.

893
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:09,591
Here we go, here we go!

894
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:11,761
- Go inside. 
 - See you.

895
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,841
We'll be right back.

896
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:14,170
   

897
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:27,261
Seon Yeong's son is handsome.

898
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:32,591
Yes, he turned out well.

899
00:58:35,551 --> 00:58:39,081
I'll take Ma Ri over ten sons any day.

900
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:43,211
Our Ma Ri is worth a hundred sons.

901
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:53,381
Hello?

902
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:55,061
Yes, Ma'am.

903
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:59,701
W-What did you say?

904
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,821
M-My Ma Ri did?

905
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:05,421
What happened to Ma Ri?

906
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:11,271
   

907
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,300
   

908
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,721
How could you yawn right now?

909
00:59:30,721 --> 00:59:33,621
What? I can't even yawn?

910
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:37,841
Mom, she must've gotten seriously injured.

911
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,911
Why is the surgery taking so long?

912
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,611
What if something bad happens to her?

913
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:46,511
That little mouth. Keep it shut, please.

914
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:52,061
How's Ma Ri?

915
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:54,761
Thank you so much, Dr. Lim.

916
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:56,341
How's Ma Ri?

917
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,671
The surgery went well.

918
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:02,631
Thankfully, the worst is over, but...

919
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:06,521
well, since the injury was so serious...

920
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:11,871
- Chairman Gong. 
 - Yes.

921
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:13,981
Let's talk for a moment.

922
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:18,541
Okay.

923
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:22,551
Honey.

924
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:34,331
What? What's going on?

925
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:37,201
She made it, but something's wrong?

926
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,561
Why can't he talk in front of us?

927
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:42,311
Our Ma Ri will be okay.

928
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:44,521
Our Ma Ri will be okay.

929
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,071
Our Ma Ri will be okay.

930
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:50,221
   

931
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,461
Do Ra.

932
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,751
Do Ra.

933
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:31,811
Do Ra, Do Ra, wake up.

934
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:33,931
Wake up right now.

935
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:37,211
Do Ra.

936
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:40,491
Let's get dressed.

937
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:42,601
Why?

938
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:45,541
I said let's get dressed.

939
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:47,901
Get dressed. Okay

940
01:01:50,591 --> 01:01:52,661
Mom, I don't want to.

941
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:55,791
You don't want to? Did you say you don't want to?

942
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:59,381
Mom, you promised you won't make me do this again.

943
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:01,051
Why are you so selfish?

944
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,731
We're about to starve and die right now.

945
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:07,371
Everyone does what they don't want to do. Why?

946
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:09,671
Because they need to feed their family.

947
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:15,281
Fine. If you don't want to, let's all jump into the Han River and die.

948
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:16,641
- Let's go. 
 - Mom...

949
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:18,991
- Let's die. 
 - Mom, Mom, no.

950
01:02:18,991 --> 01:02:20,941
Mom!

Dad, it's you, right?

What are you doing here, Dad?

962
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:46,041
What's with this motorcycle?

963
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,351
What's all this now, Dad?

964

966
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:01,531
Pardon?

967
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:05,561
You've cast my Do Ra?

968
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:09,411
Gosh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

969
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:11,761
Yes, yes.

970
01:04:12,521 --> 01:04:14,801
Mom, did I really pass?

971
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:16,481
Yes, you did.

972
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:19,380
You did it, Do Ra!

973
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,430
   

974
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:24,521
The lead character's daughter in a 50-episode weekend drama.

975
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:27,531
We can get a small house with your pay.

976
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,411
You did great. You did great.

977
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,401
Mom, I'll make a lot of money, buy you a house,

978
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,151
and buy tasty food for Oppa and Do Jun.

979
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:37,471
So don't cry from now on.

980
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,481
Thank you, Do Ra. Thank you.

981
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:41,211
We made it now.

982
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,421
We made it! We made it.

983
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:58,071
 Dae Chung will be happy if he finds out I passed the audition. 

984
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:07,271
Hello, Ahjumma.

985
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,491
How dare you come here?

986
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,811
Why did you come here?

987
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,971
I-I wanted to tell Dae Chung something.

988
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:21,091
I passed an audition.

989
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,601
So I wanted to tell him that—

990
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:24,121
Hey, you!

991
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:26,871
Why does my Dae Chung need to know that?

992
01:05:26,871 --> 01:05:31,211
I don't want to see you and your family. I hate to even hear your voice.

993
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:35,071
So don't ever come back here.

994
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:38,201
I'm so sick of you and your family.

995
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:42,151
Go now. Never come back again.

996
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:45,221
- I'm sorry, Ahjumma. 
 - Leave right now!

997
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:47,551
Leave! Leave, I said!

998
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:47,541
   

999
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:57,861
Dae Chung! Dae Chung!

1000
01:06:57,861 --> 01:07:01,041
I mean, Go Pil Sung, you forgot your phone.

1001
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,281
Toss it. Toss it, Mom.

1002
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:04,031
Okay, catch it.

1003
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:07,071
Nice catch. I'll be right back.

1004
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:10,601
Beware of cars and women.

1005
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:12,641
Gosh!

1006
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:16,241
He came home at 4 a.m., slept three hours, and is going back to work.

1007
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,811
I thought his vacation started today. Why do they want him again?

1008
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:22,581
What kind of job is that?

1009
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,801
Do all producers at studios live like that?

1010
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:31,741
But my son still looks cute without sleeping at all. How cute.

1011
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:36,791
Seriously, you love your son too much.

1012
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:39,451
You get hurt more if you love too much.

1013
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,871
Gosh, my Dae Chung... I mean,

1014
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:45,981
my Pil Sung will never betray me.

1015
01:07:57,501 --> 01:08:00,251
   

1016
01:08:03,391 --> 01:08:05,011
Did you see it?

1017
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:09,131
Wow, look at that. Park Do Ra killed it.

1018
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:12,561
Gosh, she's so pretty. I want to try it, too.

1019
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:15,251
How is her skin so nice?

1020
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:17,161
She's a celebrity.

1021
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:26,330


1022
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:30,261
   

1023
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:33,241
   

1024
01:08:33,241 --> 01:08:36,011
   

1025
01:08:40,811 --> 01:08:47,621
♫  Paper crane, I learned about the sad dream  ♫

1026
01:08:49,201 --> 01:08:57,331
♫  One day, you handed it to me  ♫

1027
01:08:57,331 --> 01:09:05,501
♫  A small paper crane  ♫

1028
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:08,681
♫  You have to make a thousand of them  ♫

1029
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:10,911
 You want me to join the melodrama team led by Hong Joon Goo Sunbae? 

1030
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:13,541
 I don't think I could join you for this project. 

1031
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:15,541
 How could I run into Park Do Ra here? 

1032
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:16,711
 But she doesn't recognize me. 

1033
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:18,071
 I heard Park Do Ra is money crazy. 

1034
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,371
 Everyone says she only cares about money. 

1035
01:09:20,371 --> 01:09:23,761
 I'm really obsessed with money. 

1036
01:09:24,611 --> 01:09:28,631
 The new main investor said he'll back out if it's not Park Do Ra. 

1037
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:32,111
 This is about to fail without Park Do Ra. 

1038
01:09:32,111 --> 01:09:35,111
 I'll get her no matter what it takes! 

1039
01:09:35,111 --> 01:09:37,811
 Sir, please hurry up a bit. 

1040
01:09:37,811 --> 01:09:41,491
 Do Ra. Where are you, Park Do Ra? 

1041
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:43,931
 Park Do Ra!
