1
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,450
I wanted to study, but I had no money. 
    

2
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,500
That's why I did that for money.

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,400
I did what he told me to do.

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,080
"He"?

5
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,700
Who's he?

6
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,950
Who told you to do it?

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,120
Jin Sang Gu. It's Jin Sang Gu.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,830
Jin Sang Gu?

9
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,800
W-Who's Jin Sang Gu?

10
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,310
Mom.

11
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,670
Mom, what are you saying right now?

12
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,860
Who's my dad right now?

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,830
How could someone like this be my dad?

14
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,300
Are you out of your mind?

15
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Jin Dan, he really is your dad.

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,240
The one who gave you life. Your biological father.

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,000
So, please stop hitting him.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,610
Why do you keep hitting your dad?

19
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,060
Don't do that, Jin Dan.

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,650
Mom...

21
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,940
why would you say something so crazy?

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,820
It's not true, right?

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,130
It can't be true, right?

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,210
What bullshit are you saying right now?

25
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,950
Why do you keep hitting him?

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,640
He's your dad.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,800
Yes, Jin Dan.

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,570
To be honest, I'm your father.

29
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:13,100
Arggghhh!

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,590
Jin Dan! Jin Dan!

31
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,620
Jin Dan, Jin Dan, are you okay?

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,350
Don't even call my name.

33
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,000
Jin Dan.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,260
I don't want to look at your face and I don't even want to call you mom.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,890
Who's my dad?

36
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,490
Someone like him is my birth father?

37
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,840
How could I suddenly have a different father?

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,470
Are you joking?

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,510
How dare you taint my name like this?

40
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,250
I'm sorry, Jin Dan. I'm sorry.

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,400
It's my fault.

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,690
Mom, were you always such a scary person?

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,920
How could you deceive everyone completely

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
and pretend Chairman Gong Dae Gil was my dad?

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,760
Has everything been an act, then?

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,570
No, no, Jin Dan.

47
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,150
I didn't know, either.

48
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,380
I didn't deceive people on purpose.

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,170
I just found out recently, too.

50
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,680
I never imagined that you'd be Sang Gu's son.

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,400
But he said you might be his son.

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,430
So, I did a DNA test. And...

53
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,570
Stop talking such bullshit!

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,480
How could a loser like him be my father?

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,510
I'm Chairman Gong Dae Gil's son.

56
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,780
I'm Gong Jin Dan.

57
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,960
Gong Jin Dan!

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,770
The sauces are tasty, too. Pick the one you like.

59
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,790
Let me know if you need anything else.

60
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,250
Pil Sung, you should go home now.

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,820
- Hurry. 
 - Why, Dad?

62
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,160
Do you not want to pay me that much?

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,700
Come on. It's not that.

64
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,490
I feel bad because you're tiring yourself out.

65
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,650
What do you mean? I'm not tired at all.

66
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,010
And Father, I think this might be my calling.

67
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,960
- What? 
 - You saw it just now, right?

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,230
The customers gave me two thumbs up because I grilled tasty meat.

69
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,830
Two more servings, please!

70
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,030
Okay, just one moment!

71
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,500
Do Ra, I'm so sorry.

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,220
I've been a fan of Park Do Ra for a long time and you cleared your name, too.

73
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,770
That's why I contacted you to work together.

74
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,120
But the public opinion is still so negative.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,250
And the production company was so opposed to it.

76
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,290
I told the assistant director to explain the situation this morning.

77
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,640
I don't know why he hasn't called you yet.

78
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,540
I'm so sorry about all this.

79
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,650
It's okay.

80
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,700
I'm just thankful you thought positively of me and reached out.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,090
I'll contact you again if I get a chance.

82
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,750
Okay, thank you.

83
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,580
I do feel bad for Park Do Ra.

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,870
She was a good actor.

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,710
How did the queen of romance, Park Do Ra, become such a reject?

86
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,120
What do you mean, you feel bad?

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,550
She has a poor sense of reality.

88
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,000
 She needs to stay out of the limelight. How dare she try to act already? 

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,060
 Even though she was framed for prostitution and whatnot, she has the scarlet letter on her. 

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,900
 She's out of her mind wanting to work again. 

91
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,820
 It's hard to change your image once it's established. 

92
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,350
Hey, Assistant Director.

93
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,070
It's okay. Talk to me.

94
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,320
Director Yun?

95
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,080
Really?

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Okay, I'll call him later.

97
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,720
Thank you.

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,080
 She must know the industry if she worked since she was a kid. 

99
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,490
 The fact that she came here means she's clueless. 

100
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,450
 Actors are all about their image. 

101
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,590
 Who'd cast Park Do Ra now? 

102
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,880
 I think it's probably over for her now. 

103
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,750
Do Ra.

104
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,040
What's with you?

105
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,420
Seriously.

106
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,940
You scared me.

107
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,230
So childish. What are you, a child?

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,900
I knew you'd laugh.

109
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,290
I just needed one laugh.

110
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,070
Mission accomplished.

111
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,960
Seriously.

112
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,350
Thank you, Oppa.

113
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,420
I was in a terrible mood today.

114
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,740
But I laughed, thanks to you.

115
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,020
It turns out I can actually laugh.

116
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,160
I heard that...

117
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,730
you met with Director Yun today.

118
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,120
I was very upset earlier and...

119
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,740
wondered why people still think of me that way.

120
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,270
But thinking about it,

121
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,730
the situation now makes sense.

122
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,940
I didn't intend to deceive people,

123
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:38,160
but it's true I fooled them and lied to them.

124
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,570
It's natural that people won't forgive me and think poorly of me.

125
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,790
Do Ra,

126
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,960
let's take a break for a while.

127
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,010
You worked too hard when you were Do Ra or Kim Ji Yeong.

128
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,530
Let's do what we want to do and eat tasty food, too.

129
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,340
Let's take trips to nice places, too.

130
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,890
We'll go on many dates, too.

131
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,140
They say you're supposed to take a break after a fall.

132
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,320
Why don't we think of this as a vacation?

133
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,620
Vacation?

134
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,900
Okay.

135
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,500
I like the sound of that.

136
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,370
I've been working so hard all this time.

137
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,060
I need a vacation, too, right?

138
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,610
Of course.

139
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,390
When a door closes, another one opens, they say.

140
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,020
Not being able to act doesn't mean my life is over.

141
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,610
As you said, I'll think of it as a vacation and rest.

142
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,820
I'll think about what I'd like to do.

143
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,160
Jin Dan must be shocked that someone like me is his dad.

144
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,010
How is he?

145
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,380
Is he taking it pretty hard?

146
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,550
Yes, I think so.

147
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,220
He won't even answer my calls.

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,170
Why did you have to tell him?

149
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,190
I deserve to be beaten to death by him.

150
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,940
We've been doing a good job not telling him.

151
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,450
Why did you have to?

152
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,220
Seeing my son cry...

153
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,150
broke my heart in pieces.

154
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,680
What do we do with our Jin Dan, Ae Gyo?

155
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,150
Aigoo. My goodness.

156
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,640
What's he... What's he talking about?

157
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,610
"Our Jin Dan."

158
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,210
"M-My son."

159
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,690
What...

160
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,350
I-If so, President G-Gong...

161
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,320
was Jin Sang Gu's son?

162
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,570
My gosh. My gosh.

163
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,620
My goodness.

164
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,450
What's going on, exactly?

165
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,540
Did some weirdo follow you on the way?

166
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,390
The thing is...

167
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,000
Gosh, how frustrating.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,120
Go on and talk to us right now, mom!

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,800
President Gong...

170
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,970
is Jin Sang Gu's son.

171
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,000
Gosh, Mother. What's this now?

172
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,500
Mom, did you eat something funny again?

173
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,260
Why would you say something like that?

174
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,520
Gosh, I really...

175
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,950
I don't know why I saw that.

176
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,470
On my way back from the bathhouse, I saw Jin Sang Gu crying on the phone.

177
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,090
So, I followed him, wondering what was going on.

178
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,040
And he said,

179
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,580
"Ae Gyo, why did you tell Jin Dan I'm his dad?"

180
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,130
And he kept crying.

181
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,410
That's what he said.

182
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,630
No way.

183
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,330
Y-You must've heard it wrong, Mother.

184
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,190
Hey! I'm not deaf yet.

185
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,190
And how could I make up a story like this?

186
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,650
If I did, God would punish me for it.

187
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,450
I suppose. You can't make up stuff like that.

188
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,420
Unless you lost your mind.

189
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,720
You little.

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,810
Hey, Sang Gu definitely said this back then.

191
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,060
That he met his first love, and they have a son together.

192
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,100
And then he denied it.

193
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,980
Everything makes sense now.

194
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,820
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong,

195
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,000
shouldn't we tell Chairman Gong about this?

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Gosh, Mother. How could we tell him that without evidence?

197
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,430
It'd flip their house upside down.

198
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,810
How...

199
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,440
How could a bastard like him be my father?

200
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,880
How?

201
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,380
How?

202
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,330
   

203
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,330
Hey, it's me.

204
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,640
 Ae Gyo, something bad happened. 

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,040
What is it? What's going on?

206
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,840
Jin Dan wants to see me. But he wants to meet by the river.

207
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,350
There are no people around there.

208
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm scared, Ae Gyo. I'm afraid... that he'd do something to me out of anger.

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,190
Sang Gu, where's the place he wanted to meet?

210
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,060
You came.

211
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,520
You must be very shocked because of me.

212
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,270
I'm not here to share gross words with you.

213
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,630
Pack your things and leave Korea immediately.

214
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,420
And don't ever show up in front of my mom and me.

215
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,960
You were never supposed to show up in front of us.

216
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,910
I didn't show up on purpose. Didn't your mom tell you?

217
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,240
I found out only recently, too.

218
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,870
I was so drawn to you, so I asked her about you.

219
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,880
And we found out through the DNA test.

220
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,690
I...

221
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,330
was so happy that you were my son.

222
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,810
I'll never be an obstacle in your life.

223
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,950
Let's see each other from time to time, Jin Dan.

224
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm still your father, you know.

225
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,780
Who says you're my father?

226
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,930
You aren't my father.

227
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,060
What are you trying to pull right now?

228
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
J-Jin Dan.

229
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,570
Are you saying you won't leave?

230
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,320
Are you saying you'd still attach yourself to us?

231
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,980
Jin Dan, don't do that! Don't hit him!

232
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,900
Please don't hit him.

233
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,650
All you do is take money from my mom.

234
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,230
How dare you call yourself a father?

235
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,120
Jin Dan, please let go.

236
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
Let's talk instead. Let's talk.

237
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,040
O-Okay, I'll leave. I'll leave.

238
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,050
Leave this very moment.

239
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,270
Right now!

240
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,240
Okay, I'll leave.

241
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,180
Don't be angry, Jin Dan.

242
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,020
I'm sorry that I'm your father.

243
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll leave.

244
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,030
Hey, aren't you being too cruel?

245
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,110
You grab him by his collar and hit him.

246
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,940
He's still your father who gave you life.

247
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,220
Wake up, Mom!

248
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,960
What do you mean, "father"?

249
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,180
He always takes money from you.

250
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,050
- How is he a father? 
 - No.

251
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,660
He spent that money for you.

252
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,980
Do you know what kind of things he did for you?

253
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,520
If he didn't know you were his son, he wouldn't have caused Ma Ri's accident!

254
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,480
What do you mean by that?

255
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,940
Ma Ri's accident?

256
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Tell me one more time.

257
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,640
Ma Ri's accident...

258
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,410
That bastard did it?

259
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,170
Is that right?

260
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,810
I told him you've been treated poorly by the Gong family.

261
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,840
He said he won't let you live like that anymore.

262
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,480
If Ma Ri were gone, you'd be the head of the Gong family and no one would treat you poorly.

263
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,140
That's why he did it.

264
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,780
 He said he wanted to do something for you. 

265
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,830
Grandma, Oppa, what are you doing?

266
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,490
We're making kalguksu.

267
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,920
I keep craving her kalguksu, no matter how much I eat it.

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,590
So, I asked her to make it.

269
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,920
It really is a shame that we're the only ones to eat it.

270
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,520
Oppa, should we open a kalguksu shop, then?

271
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,040
Kalguksu shop? I'll do it.

272
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,660
I want to run a restaurant.

273
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,500
Gosh, why would you suddenly say that?

274
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,260
And you need to act.

275
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,800
Oppa,

276
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,290
I don't think I can act like I used to for a while.

277
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,210
You know, too.

278
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,920
The public opinion is still negative and people aren't ready to accept me yet.

279
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,070
Well, yes.

280
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,690
But we can't just keep sitting around.

281
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,870
We need to make a living, too.

282
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,410
And it'd be a shame to waste Grandma's recipe, too.

283
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,940
Let's try it, Oppa.

284
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,930
Yes, I'd love to.

285
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,180
Geum Dong, let's do it.

286
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,450
Okay, let's do it. Let's give it a try, Mother. Yes.

287
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,660
- Yes, yes, yes! 
 - Yes!

288
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,740
Yes! I love it!

289
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,550
Would you really be okay?

290
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,580
You've been acting since you were 13. Can you live without acting?

291
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,740
That's why I want to try doing something else, too.

292
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,340
I actually sold kalguksu with Grandma for two years.

293
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,020
I lived so happily back then, too.

294
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,040
Oppa, let's sell kalguksu and become successful.

295
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,040
- Okay, let's just go for it. 
 - Yes.

296
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,280
By the way, how can we afford to do that?

297
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,740
Let's try starting small.

298
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,320
People will come if the food is tasty even if the shop isn't fancy.

299
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,980
I suppose so. People travel across the country to visit good restaurants.

300
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,440
Right.

301
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,540
Hyung, Noona, I have 20 million won.

302
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,430
- What? 
 - I'll contribute, too.

303
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,200
How could you have any money?

304
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,050
It's the money I've saved working all this time.

305
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,910
Do Jun, you bastard.

306
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,540
Come here, you little.

307
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,780
I'll pay you back the first thing I make money.

308
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,710
- It's fine. 
 - You turned out so well.

309
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,740
Stop being so gross.

310
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,880
Come here, you bastard.

311
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,260
Yes, let's finish things well and leave immediately.

312
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,690
I finished packing, too.

313
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,060
The money is ready.

314
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,250
Okay. I'll head over there now.

315
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,080
Mr. Jin Sang Gu.

316
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,850
Let go! Let go!

317
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,710
Mr. Jin Sang Gu, you're arrested for instigating murder.

318
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,440
You have the right to an attorney, and you'll have a chance to defend yourself.

319
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,400
You have the right to remain silent, and you can file a wrongful arrest complaint to the court.

320
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,300
- Take him away. 
 - I'm sorry.

321
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,250
I'm sorry.

322
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,720
This man is Jin Sang Gu.

323
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,650
Why did you do that to my daughter?

324
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,380
Tell me why you did that.

325
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,010
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,670
My business failed in the Philippines, and I heard your daughter was gullible.

327
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,020
I was going to kidnap her and take money. That's all.

328
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,580
Stop lying.

329
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,430
You tried to run over her with a car.

330
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,150
You intended to kill my daughter.

331
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,920
I didn't tell him to kill her.

332
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,420
It's true. Please believe me.

333
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,320
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

334
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,090
 I did that because someone told me to. 

335
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,640
 He said he'd pay me if I killed your daughter. 

336
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,980
 I didn't tell him to kill her. 

337
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,900
 It's true. Please believe me. 

338
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,800
 I'm sorry. Please forgive me. 

339
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,790
Who's telling the truth?

340
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:08,230
But It's certain he tried to kill Ma Ri.

341
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,810
But why?

342
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,830
 Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong! 

343
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,520
How could this happen? Look at this.

344
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,110
Our tenant Jin Sang Gu ran away. He ran away.

345
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,950
H-He ran away?

346
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,500
I just went to his room, and his room was empty.

347
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,870
Jin Sang Gu moved out behind my back.

348
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,930
H-How could he do that without telling us?

349
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,090
We gave him the security deposit because he said he needed money urgently.

350
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,980
We thought he'd pay us back since he's Hyeon Cheol's acquaintance.

351
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,020
But he fled without paying us the rent and security deposit.

352
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,400
He didn't even leave a note.

353
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,940
So, I called him just now, but he won't answer.

354
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,700
So, I called Hyeon Cheol, too.

355
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,180
He left without even sending him a text.

356
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,880
My gosh, how could he do that?

357
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,056
My goodness. He really lives up to his name, doesn't he? 
  (Jinsang means "nuisance.") 

358
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:21,660
Your friend, Hong Ae Gyo, President Gong's mom.

359
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,380
How could she date someone so low?

360
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,880
Seriously. How do we get the rent money from him?

361
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,750
Because I hate him so much,

362
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,470
I'll follow him to the ends of the earth and get that money.

363
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,810
That's what I can do.

364
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,540
I'm here to see Ms. Hong Ae Gyo.

365
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,150
I'm Go Pil Sung's grandma.

366
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,310
 Ms. Hong is out at the moment. 

367
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,910
S-She's out?

368
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,490
Well...

369
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,120
Never mind.

370
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,850
Maybe I should've called her first.

371
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,970
I suppose I can come back.

372
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,330
I'll get that money, no matter what.

373
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,220
Pil Sung's Grandmother. Hello.

374
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,660
Hello, Chairman.

375
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,610
What brings you to our house?

376
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,300
Why are you standing here?

377
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,596
President Gong's mom...

378
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:38,416
I'm here to see Hong Ae Gyo.

379
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,190
But she's not home.

380
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,820
Why don't you wait inside, then?

381
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,300
No, that won't be necessary.

382
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,230
I'll get going now.

383
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,870
Take my car, then.

384
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,480
- Secretary Kim. 
 - No, it's okay, Chairman.

385
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,800
I can just take a walk.

386
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,040
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

387
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,620
By the way, Chairman.

388
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,390
Yes.

389
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,086
W-Well, I...

390
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:12,350
I can't bring myself to just leave.

391
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,676
I'm not sure if I should tell you this or not.

392
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,970
What is it about?

393
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,850
I'm not sure what it's about, but feel free to talk to me.

394
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,766
Well, the thing is...

395
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:37,410
my son's...

396
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,656
middle school junior lives in our rental unit.

397
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,450
But he ran away without paying us the rent.

398
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,650
I wanted to receive the rent payment from Hong Ae Gyo.

399
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,260
That's why I came all the way here.

400
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,300
Why would you receive the payment from Hong Ae Gyo?

401
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,890
The thing is...

402
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,490
President Gong's mom, Hong Ae Gyo, and our tenant

403
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,210
are an item, you know.

404
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,390
Pardon me?

405
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm saying they have a thing going on.

406
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,900
They denied it and said they were cousins at first,

407
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,990
but I found out they were dating.

408
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,500
They're apparently each other's first love.

409
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,600
But why are you telling me about this?

410
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,830
Well, the thing is...

411
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,020
The reason for the long preamble is because...

412
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,060
I'm not sure if I should say this.

413
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,850
If it's true, I'd be dropping a bomb on your family.

414
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,880
If not, I'd become a crazy person.

415
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,320
It's not so easy to bring it up.

416
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,700
Don't feel pressured, and feel free to tell me.

417
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,860
I'll just disregard it if it's nothing serious.

418
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,860
Hong Ae Gyo's son, President Gong Jin Dan...

419
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,820
is a son of Hong Ae Gyo and Jin Sang Gu.

420
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,710
He's not a member of the Gong family.

421
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,680
What did you say?

422
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,590
Well, there's no evidence.

423
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:48,880
But Jin Sang Gu said President Gong was his son over the phone.

424
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,580
I definitely heard that with my ears.

425
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:57,480
And he said he reunited with his first love, but they had a son together.

426
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,166
I heard him say that, too.

427
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,510
Is that...

428
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,450
I-Is that really true?

429
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,830
Get a DNA test done, just in case.

430
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,510
If the test result says it's not the case,

431
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,046
just think a crazy old lady talked nonsense.

432
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,120
By the way,

433
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,490
what did you say the man's name was?

434
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,480
Jin Sang Gu. Jin Sang Gu.

435
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,920
Why do you ask?

436
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,240
By chance, do you know him?

437
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,460
Jin Sang Gu.

438
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:08,920
♫  The reason I love you is because you're you  ♫

439
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,760
It's time to open.

440
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,910
Should we chant before we start?

441
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:19,836
♫  I love you  ♫

442
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,170
Okay.

443
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,020
- Say it three times. 
 - Three times.

444
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,140
Ready, go.

445
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,740
 Sunjeong. Sunjeong. Sunjeong. Yay! 

446
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,010
Fighting. Fighting.

447
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,360
Can I get kalguksu now?

448
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,420
Yes, absolutely. Come on in.

449
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,220
Welcome. Welcome. Come this way.

450
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,980
Welcome. Two?

451
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,780
She has no conscience. Seriously.

452
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,480
Ma'am.

453
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,340
You came. Get all of this out of here right now.

454
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,460
What's going on?

455
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,860
What do you mean?

456
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,720
Your mom demanded the security deposit two weeks ago, saying she was moving out.

457
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,850
So, I rushed to pay her in full.

458
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:07,280
But she hasn't removed her stuff, moved out, or she won't answer my call.

459
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,850
What kind of thing is this to do?

460
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,110
Anyway, the new tenant is moving in tomorrow.

461
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,960
Take this with you immediately.

462
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,810
Where's my mom right now, ma'am?

463
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,280
How am I supposed to know?

464
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,070
Why are you asking me about your mom?

465
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,050
 What? 

466
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,510
- Where are you right now? 
 -  I'm at home. 

467
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm at your place right now—

468
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,970
I heard you said you're moving out and took the security deposit.

469
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,990
 The landlady wants you to move out your stuff. Where are you now? 

470
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,750
It's none of your business.

471
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,940
Keep that stuff at your place for now.

472
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,180
I'll pick it up soon, okay?

473
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,570
Here you go. Here's your coffee.

474
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,430
Okay. Here you go.

475
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,530
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

476
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,730
Ahjumma, a ramen here, please.

477
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,290
Okay.

478
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,420
   

479
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,780
Yes.

480
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,140
Chairman, the document was just delivered.

481
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,770
Okay. Leave that there.

482
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,600
Yes, Mr. Gu.

483
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,420
I just received the document.

484
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,790
 It's the information you requested. 

485
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,140
 It's the file from Hong Ae Gyo's dashcam 

486
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,730
 and the DNA test result for you and President Gong Jin Dan. 

487
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,490
Thank you.

488
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,240
   

489
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,270
No way.

490
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,840
Jin Dan wasn't my father's son.

491
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,340
What did you say? You met Chairman Gong?

492
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,510
Chairman Gong Jin Taek?

493
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,480
Yes. He came to the police station the day I got arrested.

494
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,200
My gosh, what do we do?

495
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,550
What do we do? What are we going to do now?

496
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,470
Ae Gyo, Chairman Gong didn't notice anything.

497
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,410
I'll take care of everything. Don't worry about a thing.

498
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,170
Tell Jin Dan that, too.

499
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,320
Why did you have to come to Korea and do all this?

500
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,470
This wouldn't have happened if you didn't come to Korea.

501
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,006
What will you do about our Jin Dan?

502
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:29,406
What will you do?

503
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,750
Jin Sang Gu, listen to me carefully.

504
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,100
You'd better not mention Jin Dan even once.

505
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,990
I won't forgive you even after I die.

506
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,760
So, keep your mouth shut until you die.

507
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,930
And I won't see you again.

508
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,530
Forget about me and Jin Dan starting today.

509
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,320
I'll forget about you, too.

510
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,176
That way, our Jin Dan could live.

511
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,070
I won't visit you anymore, either. Just so you know.

512
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,700
Ae Gyo.

513
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,550
Ae Gyo!

514
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,200
Yes, I need to end this now.

515
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,160
That way, I can protect Jin Dan.

516
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,670
Jin Sang Gu. He's a stranger to me now.

517
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,780
   

518
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,360
Hey, Chairman Gong.

519
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,320
To your office?

520
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,850
Okay, I will.

521
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,600
Why does he want me at his office at this hour?

522
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,560
   

523
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,380
   

524
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,840
Why did you want to see me at this hour?

525
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,390
The secretaries already went home, too.

526
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,960
I heard you asked Mom to come, too.

527
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,156
Why did you ask her to come in, too?

528
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:36,316
What's it about?

529
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,120
Hyung.

530
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,120
What are you doing right now?

531
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,210
Why are you doing this to me now?

532
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,050
What is it now?

533
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,040
Your mom Hong Ae Gyo. Your birth father, Jin Sang Gu.

534
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,830
The three of you plotted together and tried to kill Ma Ri, didn't you?

535
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,920
Did you think you'd be fine after that?

536
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,180
W-What are you talking about?

537
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,630
W-Why would I kill Ma Ri? Why would I hurt her?

538
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,560
Also, Jin Sang Gu isn't my father!

539
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,540
He approached my mom to sell insurance plans.

540
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,030
He's just some bastard who tried to scam her!

541
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,090
 W-What's this? 

542
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,430
 How could this be? 

543
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,900
 Was Jin Dan really Sang Gu's son? 

544
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,530
 What do I do now? 

545
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,800
 What am I supposed to do about this? 

546
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,600
 Of course, I know what to do. No one knows. 

547
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,180
 I just need to keep my mouth shut. 

548
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,020
This isn't true.

549
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,430
Hyung.

550
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,450
I'm your brother, Hyung.

551
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,110
Our father is Chairman Gong Dae Gil!

552
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,100
You aren't my brother.

553
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,480
You aren't my father's son.

554
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,120
This is the DNA test result for you and me.

555
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,590
How dare you try to deny it?

556
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,490
Hyung, I don't even know who Jin Sang Gu is.

557
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,400
I never even touched the tip of Ma Ri's hair. I swear.

558
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,170
Please, believe me, Hyung.

559
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,030
Please, believe me, Hyung. It's true.

560
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,350
Believe you?

561
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,590
You're begging me to believe you?

562
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,640
You've been embezzling the company's money for years.

563
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,030
You created a slush fund.

564
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,400
Not only that, you lied to everyone about your bloodline.

565
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,200
And you tried to kill Ma Ri, whom you lived with your whole life.

566
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,050
I can't forgive you two.

567
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:05,620
I'll lock you both up for attempted murder.

568
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,730
I'll put you away for embezzlement first!

569
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,470
Hyung, Hyung, Hyung...

570
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,620
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Hyung, I really didn't do that to Ma Ri.

571
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,370
So, please forgive me for this once. Please, Hyung!

572
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,150
You bastard.

573
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,240
Hyung, I'll really go to jail if that gets revealed.

574
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,170
That'd really be the end of me!

575
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,530
So, please let it go just once.

576
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,030
Please spare me!

577
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,480
You bastard...

578
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,330
H-Hyung.

579
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,290
Hyung?

580
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,420
Hyung.

581
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:03,211
   

582
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:07,801
W-What's wrong with this?

583
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,281
Why can't I transfer the money?

584
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:13,251
What?

585
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,520
   

586
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,831
Did he do all this in advance?

587
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,481
Did he block everything?

588
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,621
How? What do I do!

589
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:34,441
 Correct passcode. 

590
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:36,821
 The door was unlocked. 

591
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:56,061
Chairman Gong, I'm here.

592
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:59,061
Did he step out for a second?

593
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:03,071
What's the deal? He made me come all the way here.

594
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:12,551
C-Chairman Gong!

595
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:13,981
Chairman Gong!

596
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:17,751
My gosh. What happened?

597
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:21,261
Secretary Kim? Is anyone there?

598
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,491
My gosh.

599
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:33,581
What do I do?

600
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:49,451
H-Hello? 911?

601
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:51,401
S-Someone has passed out.

602
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:53,531
Please hurry!

603
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,871
My gosh.

604
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:11,021
Hey, what did Dr. Kim say?

605
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:15,771
Thankfully, the test results don't indicate danger,

606
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:20,501
but he's in a coma due to a concussion right now.

607
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:22,260
What did you say?

608
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,100
Coma?

609
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:28,740
He's not sleeping from medication,

610
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,050
but he's unconscious right now?

611
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,730
Yes.

612
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,990
He suspects he hit his head hard when he fell.

613
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,511
When will gain consciousness, then?

614
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:43,811
When will he wake up?

615
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:45,991
He doesn't know.

616
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:49,061
He said we need to keep an eye on him.

617
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:52,651
What if he never wakes up? Chairman Gong...

618
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,391
Aunt.

619
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:58,931
Hold on. Chairman Gong. Jin Taek...

620
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:02,551
Ae Gyo, what happened, exactly?

621
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:07,391
He asked me to come to his office to talk about something.

622
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:12,101
I thought he wanted to discuss adopting Jin Dan again, but he was passed out.

623
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:14,131
I called 911 because I was so shocked.

624
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:17,571
I don't know what's going on, either.

625
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,731
- Oppa. 
 - Yes, Ma Ri.

626
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:26,521
Soo Yeon, what happened all of a sudden?

627
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:28,591
Seon Yeong.

628
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:34,001
Second Grandma found him passed out in his office.

629
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:36,601
But they don't know when he'll wake up.

630
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:40,291
What if he never wakes up?

631
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:44,261
No, Ma Ri. He'll be okay.

632
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:46,731
I'm sure he'll wake up, okay?

633
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:51,181
My goodness. I don't know what's going on.

634
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,280
He was so healthy and energetic.

635
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,980
Why all of a sudden? Gosh.

636
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,021
Well, then...

637
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:04,421
- Get home safely. 
 - Well...

638
00:45:04,421 --> 00:45:07,781
Hold on. I...

639
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:12,211
I need to tell you something, Soo Yeon.

640
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:14,521
Me?

641
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:20,041
I think I know why Chairman Gong passed out.

642
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:24,251
I think it's because of me.

643
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:27,861
He passed out because of you? What do you mean?

644
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:32,621
I told him about it. That thing.

645
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:34,570
Mother.

646
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,911
- Did you really tell him about it? 
 - What is it?

647
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:40,761
Seon Yeong, what's going on?

648
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:43,501
Well, the thing is...

649
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,491
Ma Ri's uncle, President Gong Jin Dan...

650
00:45:46,491 --> 00:45:49,831
He isn't a member of the Gong family.

651
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:54,581
He's the son of Jin Sang Gu, our tenant.

652
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:56,300
Pardon?

653
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,400
What did you say?

654
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:02,201
I told Chairman Gong that.

655
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:05,631
I think he passed out because of the shock.

656
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:08,701
My gosh. What am I supposed to do now?

657
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:10,341
Ma'am!

658
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:13,020
How could you say such a thing?

659
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,201
What did you say just now?

660
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:18,881
My son is whose son?

661
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,831
How could you utter such nonsense?

662
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:24,131
Are you senile, ma'am?

663
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:26,261
I'm not senile.

664
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,811
I definitely heard it.

665
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:32,961
Our tenant, Jin Sang Gu, your boyfriend, was on the phone with you

666
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:35,611
and said "Our son, Jin Dan" and whatnot.

667
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,391
You talked about that with Jin Sang Gu, right?

668
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:39,931
Gosh, what kind of nonsense is that?

669
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,111
Are you looking down on me because I was a mistress?

670
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,151
You can't be like this.

671
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:46,931
I can't be here because I'm offended.

672
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:50,081
- Hey, Ae Gyo. 
 - Sue me if I'm wrong.

673
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,701
- Why don't you just sue me? 
 - Mother...

674
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:55,511
See? See? It's true.

675
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:59,451
She would've flipped out and said she'd sue me if I—

676
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:04,421
Mom, you can't just say that without evidence.

677
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,941
Seriously. It's true. I'm telling you.

678
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:10,531
By the way,

679
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:17,071
Chairman Gong seemed to know who Jin Sang Gu was.

680
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:21,051
Chairman Gong knew Jin Sang Gu?

681
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:23,791
Yes, I'm telling you.

682
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:30,811
But what should I do if he really did pass out because of me?

683
00:47:30,811 --> 00:47:32,631
What do I do...

684
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:38,641
 The phone is powered off. 

685
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:41,981
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

686
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:43,471
 After you're connected... 

687
00:47:43,471 --> 00:47:48,201
Why is Jin Dan's phone off?

688
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:50,301
What do I do?

689
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:54,471
Did Chairman Gong really pass out because of that?

690
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:58,661
What would happen if he wakes up?

691
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:02,510
I don't know this number.

692
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,400
Who's this?

693
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:08,651
Hello?

694
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,181
Mom, it's me.

695
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:12,641
 Jin Dan. 

696
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:14,771
 What's this number? 

697
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:17,631
I threw away my phone so I don't get tracked.

698
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:20,521
T-Tracked? What do you mean by that?

699
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:22,091
Mom, what happened to Hyung?

700
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:24,121
He's not dead, right?

701
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:27,281
Jin Dan, how did you know he was injured?

702
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:31,301
Did he pass out because of him? Did you do it?

703
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:34,361
Mom, he found out everything. Everything.

704
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:37,351
 The DNA test result you destroyed. And the video of it. 

705
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:39,901
 He went through your dashcam records and found out everything. 

706
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:43,671
And he found out Jin Sang Gu is my birth father, too.

707
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:47,011
He found out he tried to kill Ma Ri, too.

708
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:49,881
My gosh. My gosh...

709
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:53,001
That's not all.

710
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:57,851
He found out I embezzled the company's money and created a slush fund, too.

711
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,031
So, I was arguing with him and...

712
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,360
Mom, what do I do?

713
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,270
Mom

714
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:08,361
Jin Dan, pull yourself together.

715
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:10,241
He isn't dead.

716
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,921
He's still unconscious, but he won't die.

717
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:17,101
So, don't try to do anything funny, okay?

718
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:22,231
 Mom, he blocked all of my accounts and money sources. 

719
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:25,721
He even put a travel ban on me, so I can't run away.

720
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,511
W-What? What did you say?

721
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:33,621
 So, you'd better move out of that house before he wakes up. 

722
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:35,501
I'm trying to stow away somehow.

723
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:39,601
I'll contact you if I end up in Hong Kong or wherever.

724
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,111
So, make sure to hang in there until then.

725
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:44,501
 Okay? 

726
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:47,101
No, Jin Dan. No.

727
00:49:47,101 --> 00:49:50,321
How could I live without you?

728
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,441
I can't live without you.

729
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:55,371
We need to live and die together.

730
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:59,621
Jin Dan, take me with you. Take me with you!

731
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:03,701
My gosh, Jin Dan.

732
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:28,401
J-Jin Dan, what's with this junk car?

733
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,481
Why are you driving this junk car instead of yours?

734
00:50:32,371 --> 00:50:34,921
I'll get caught if I use my car.

735
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:37,941
- Get in first, Mom. 
 - Okay.

736
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:54,051
Jin Dan, will we really be okay if we get to China?

737
00:50:55,151 --> 00:51:00,211
Yes, I kept some slush funds in Hong Kong.

738
00:51:00,211 --> 00:51:02,011
I created a paper company there.

739
00:51:02,011 --> 00:51:05,221
So, we just need to get to Hong Kong through China.

740
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:06,831
We'll get our money there...

741
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:11,041
and live in the US, Switzerland, or anywhere.

742
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:13,021
That's what we'll do, Mom.

743
00:51:13,021 --> 00:51:15,121
By the way, Jin Dan,

744
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:21,321
if we stow away and disappear, who will send your dad money in jail?

745
00:51:22,901 --> 00:51:24,651
Seriously!

746
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:28,811
Why don't you stay here and keep sending him money, then?

747
00:51:28,811 --> 00:51:31,001
N-No, I'm sorry.

748
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:33,371
I got it. Let's go. Let's just go.

749
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,591
Seriously.

750
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,441
Hey.

751
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:48,011
I'll give you the other half when we get to China.

752
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:49,871
Okay, okay.

753
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:11,781
Mom, this is all the money we have.

754
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:14,091
You can't put it down even for a moment, okay?

755
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:16,241
Okay, I won't.

756
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:19,411
I'll bring all of our stuff.

757
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:22,581
Hold that tightly and wait for me on the ship.

758
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:25,861
- Okay? 
 - Okay, I will.

759
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:29,911
Go.

760
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:47,141
Come quickly.

761
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:57,831
Hey, take my hand.

762
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,741
- Take my hand. 
 - Shit.

763
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:02,591
Won't you hold it?

764
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:09,131
Don't be afraid and come.

765
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:13,901
Yes, come on.

766
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:15,941
Here.

767
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:23,031
My gosh! My money!

768
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:24,581
Turn the engine on!

769
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:28,391
J-Jin Dan! Jin Dan!

770
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:30,531
Get these bastards!

771
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:32,791
Thieves!

772
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:33,961
Jin Dan!

773
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,031
Hey! Stop right there!

774
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:37,581
My gosh.

775
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,401
Jin Dan! My gosh.

776
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:42,531
You bastards! Stop right there!

777
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:48,881
You bastards! Stop right there!

778
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,090
Stop right there! Come back!

779
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,290
Don't run.

780
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,801
You sons of bitches!

781
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:08,531
Dad, you just made a noise, didn't you?

782
00:54:10,991 --> 00:54:13,721
Ma Ri, what is it?

783
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:16,091
I think the Chairman regained consciousness.

784
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:17,991
Mom, he moved.

785
00:54:17,991 --> 00:54:19,611
He made a noise, too.

786
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:21,571
What?

787
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:24,761
Honey. My gosh.

788
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,741
Is that true? Honey.

789
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:30,471
Mom, Dad is awake, right? He's back, right?

790
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:33,781
Honey? Honey, open your eyes.

791
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:36,020
Honey, wake up.

792
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,800
Honey!

793
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,031
Mom, we're here.

794
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:57,751
Get off.

795
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,191
This is our house.

796
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:19,221
You can't come here.

797
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:22,841
Mom, we have no money anymore.

798
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:25,661
You'd go through hell if you stayed with me.

799
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:27,791
So, try to stay here a little longer.

800
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,271
I don't want to, Jin Dan.

801
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:31,961
I'll come with you.

802
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,941
Mom, it's hard enough to be on the run alone.

803
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:37,861
We'd both get caught if we did this.

804
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:42,711
So, I'll call you after I get the slush fund in Hong Kong.

805
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:45,241
Wait just until then, okay?

806
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,511
Jin Dan, I don't want to go home.

807
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,751
I'm sure they'd kick me out.

808
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:54,441
I'd be so scared without you.

809
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:57,361
Mom, don't worry.

810
00:55:57,361 --> 00:56:00,871
You're Chairman Gong Dae Gil's wife.

811
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:03,741
They can't treat you poorly.

812
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:07,311
So, don't worry and go inside.

813
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:09,111
Jin Dan.

814
00:56:09,111 --> 00:56:11,321
Go inside, please!

815
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:13,611
I said I'll call you.

816
00:56:13,611 --> 00:56:15,951
Okay, okay.

817
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:19,771
Instead, you have to call me when you get to Hong Kong.

818
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:22,661
Call me often, okay?

819
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:25,931
I will. I said I will.

820
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:27,941
- Go inside. 
 - Okay.

821
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:29,411
Go inside.

822
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,811
Jin Dan.

823
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:35,231
- Jin Dan... 
 - Go.

824
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:43,541
Jin Dan...

825
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,531
Jin Dan.

826
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,601
Jin Dan.

827
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:02,621
I'm sorry, Mom.

828
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:04,851
I'll be right back.

829
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:14,001
Who... Who's here, you said?

830
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:17,721
Aunt.

831
00:57:19,371 --> 00:57:21,321
You bitch!

832
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:24,271
How dare you come in here?

833
00:57:24,271 --> 00:57:26,541
How dare you set your foot in here?

834
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,681
You're less than an animal.

835
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:30,871
You deserve to die!

836
00:57:30,871 --> 00:57:33,831
Get out right now. Get out!

837
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:37,051
Get out immediately! Get out!

838
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,161
Gosh.

839
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:42,431
I'm sorry, Aunt.

840
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:44,541
Forgive me.

841
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,671
But I swear I didn't know.

842
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:52,761
I really thought Jin Dan was the Chairman's son.

843
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,771
I swear, Aunt.

844
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,981
Jin Taek,

845
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:00,141
I swear to God, I'm telling the truth.

846
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:03,551
Just once. Believe me just once.

847
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:05,531
- Mr. Kim, Yeojudaek, 
 - Yes.

848
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:09,251
get this woman out of here. And don't ever let her inside again.

849
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,521
- Yes, Chairman. 
 - Yes, Chairman.

850
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,471
No, I can't leave!

851
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:16,441
I can never leave!

852
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:19,551
I'm still Chairman Gong Dae Gil's wife.

853
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:22,311
I'm your mother! Mother!

854
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:25,021
Chairman. Chairman...

855
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:27,721
Jin Taek is kicking me out.

856
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:30,121
Aunt is kicking me out!

857
00:58:30,121 --> 00:58:33,081
Get out! Get out right now!

858
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:35,231
Get out. Get out.

859
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:38,041
Don't come anywhere near this house!

860
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:41,211
You deserve to die. You bitch!

861
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:56,601
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks for the meal.

862
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:59,091
- Please come again. Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

863
00:58:59,091 --> 00:59:00,671
Bye.

864
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,391
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

865
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:05,671
Is this Park Do Ra's kalguksu restaurant?

866
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:10,091
Yes, it is.

867
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:13,051
Nice to meet you. I'm your fan.

868
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:14,961
We were right. We were right.

869
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:16,241
Thank you.

870
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:20,161
- Get us three delicious bowls of kalguksu. 
 - Okay.

871
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:25,981
Let's see how delicious the kalguksu made by the prostitute Park Do Ra is.

872
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:28,811
I'll pay you a handsome tip if it's tasty.

873
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:33,501
You know she's crazy about tips.

874
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:36,771
If you entertain me, I'll give you all this as a tip.

875
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,491
I took out a lot of cash. Look.

876
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:41,601
Gentlemen,

877
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:46,011
the prostitution rumor was proven wrong.

878
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:48,781
Didn't you see the article? It's not true.

879
00:59:48,781 --> 00:59:51,561
It was obviously staged. No one believes it.

880
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:53,891
We're not fools.

881
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:56,541
Please leave, then.

882
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:59,501
We won't sell kalguksu to people like you.

883
00:59:59,501 --> 01:00:03,291
- Get out. 
 - I mean... can you treat your customers like this?

884
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:05,601
How dare you look at us like that?

885
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,591
I see. He's that man.

886
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:10,301
The director who defended the prostitute.

887
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:12,191
- You're right. 
 - It's him.

888
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,181
So, what's it like to date Park Do Ra?

889
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:18,811
He's so polite, isn't he?

890
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:19,881
- Get out. 
 - What the?

891
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:22,301
- We don't sell kalguksu to customers like you. 
 - I'm your customer.

892
01:00:22,301 --> 01:00:24,771
- Get out, you bastards. 
 - How dare you push me?

893
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:26,631
Do Sik.

894
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:29,621
How dare you do this to your customers?

895
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:30,761
You bastard!

896
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:34,021
What? How dare you? Hey!

897
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:35,941
Let go!

898
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:39,251
Why are you doing this to me?

899
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:50,220
What did I do to you, exactly?

900
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:52,691
I said it's not true.

901
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,351
I said it's not true!

902
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,751
Why do you do this to me?

903
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,381
Should I have died, then?

904
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:05,651
Don't you have mothers?

905
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:09,041
Don't you have daughters or sisters?

906
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:12,171
Why are you doing this to me?

907
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:16,201
Why do you treat me like this?

908
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:18,491
Is it because I'm an actor?

909
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:22,781
Is it okay to treat actors this way?

910
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:27,631
I'm trying to live quietly selling kalguksu now.

911
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:34,591
Am I... Am I not even allowed to do that?

912
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:37,711
Let's go.

913
01:01:37,711 --> 01:01:41,271
So annoying. That ruined it. That ruined it.

914
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:18,760
We didn't get to sell lunch.

915
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,520
We can't ruin our dinner business, either.

916
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,831
Let's prepare for dinner, okay?

917
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:28,181
Okay, you're right.

918
01:02:28,181 --> 01:02:30,541
We need to prepare dinner.

919
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:38,501
Go inside. I'll clean up the rest.

920
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:58,521
   

921
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:12,260


922
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:19,491
You scared me.

923
01:03:19,491 --> 01:03:22,111
Did I scare you? I'm sorry.

924
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,631
It's okay.

925
01:03:24,411 --> 01:03:26,431
Just stay like this.

926
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:33,331
It's so nice to be hugged by you like this.

927
01:03:38,091 --> 01:03:40,991
You must've been very stressed today.

928
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,671
I'm sorry.

929
01:03:44,651 --> 01:03:46,691
Why did you have to come here, anyway?

930
01:03:46,691 --> 01:03:49,501
I told you not to come.

931
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:54,751
You should leave now, Oppa.

932
01:03:58,131 --> 01:03:59,391
I won't leave.

933
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:02,641
I'll stay right by your side like a piece of gum.

934
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:04,421
Slap.

935
01:04:04,421 --> 01:04:06,751
And who'd knead the kalguksu dough if I weren't here?

936
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:11,261
I think I'm better at kneading than Do Sik.

937
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:14,361
Come on, Oppa. You're a dummy.

938
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,551
You're a big dummy.

939
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:18,891
Yes, I'm a dummy. But...

940
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:21,281
I want to be a dummy for you.

941
01:04:21,281 --> 01:04:23,181
A handsome dummy.

942
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:26,891
Seriously. You're giving me the chills.

943
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:28,891
What if someone sees you?

944
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:31,921
- You're so embarrassing. 
 - What's the problem?

945
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:33,941
It's because I like you.

946
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:41,251
Look at your sweat.

947
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,421
What are you doing?

948
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:51,801
Baby chick.

949
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:57,361
Chirp, chirp.

950
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:07,931
♫  I couldn't do that. Please remember me.  ♫

951
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:12,861
Baby chick.

952
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:14,941
Chirp, chirp.

953
01:05:17,941 --> 01:05:19,941
It suits you.

954
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:30,310


955
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:34,261
   

956
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:39,051
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

957
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:44,531
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

958
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:50,391
♫  I've already fallen for you  ♫

959
01:05:50,391 --> 01:05:56,151
♫  I'm not able to free myself anymore  ♫

960
01:05:56,151 --> 01:06:01,901
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

961
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:09,961
 Chairman, what's the important announcement? What's going on? 

962
01:06:09,961 --> 01:06:11,541
 Dad, hurry up and tell them. 

963
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,771
 - Is there good news? 
 - Congratulations. That's amazing. 

964
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:18,271
 What? Stop saying you can't be without me. 

965
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:22,081
 You need to be cheerful so I can leave in peace. 

966
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:24,831
 - You go in first. 
 - We're in front of my place. 

967
01:06:24,831 --> 01:06:27,321
 I need to see you go first, so I feel relieved. 

968
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:29,281
 Park Do Ra.
