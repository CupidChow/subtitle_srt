1
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:51,375
I know you better than anyone.

2
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:56,175
What grave sin could you have possibly committed?

3
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:59,595
You're not that kind of a person.

4
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:01,745
I'm that kind of a person.

5
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,845
I'm that kind of a woman.

6
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:06,225
Do you know what kind of woman I am?

7
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:08,525
Do you know how terrible I am?

8
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:11,325
Do you know what I've done to you?

9
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,065
I deceived you!

10
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,355
   

11
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:22,135
What's wrong, Honey?

12
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,885
Are you okay?

13
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:29,285
Are you really okay?

14
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:38,215
Honey...

15
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,665
let's get divorced.

16
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:45,145
What?

17
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:47,355
W-What did you say?

18
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:53,645
Did you say divorce just now?

19
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:00,205
Yes.

20
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:08,855
I don't think I can live with you anymore.

21
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:11,605
Please divorce me.

22
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:16,565
What do you mean by divorce?

23
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,075
You can't live with me?

24
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:23,505
We were talking about Seon Yeong. Why are you suddenly saying that?

25
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:27,015
You were having a hard time talking about cutting ties with her.

26
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:30,625
So I visited her trying to help you.

27
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:36,375
Does that make you angry enough to divorce me?

28
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,535
It's not all of a sudden.

29
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,855
I've actually been...

30
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:50,155
considering divorce for a long time.

31
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:53,545
What? For a long time?

32
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:59,800
I've been suffering so much

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,055
living with you all this time.

34
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:04,385
Living with these feelings...

35
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:09,085
is unfair to you. I'm so sorry.

36
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:12,365
I'll move out with Ma Ri...

37
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,915
and live separately.

38
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,075
Please let me.

39
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,755
Honey.

40
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:32,745
Gosh, what was that just now?

41
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,035
Divorce?

42
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:36,665
Honey...

43
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,195
Auntie! Auntie!

44
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,275
What is it? What's going on?

45
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,755
Auntie, this is bad. Really bad.

46
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:54,255
Soo Yeon asked Chairman Gong for a divorce. Divorce.

47
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:57,105
What on earth are you talking about?

48
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,985
I'm not kidding.

49
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,925
It's true. It's true.

50
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,725
Soo Yeon just left the house.

51
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,860
Chairman Gong ran out to grab her.

52
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,265
W-What?

53
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:12,435
Honey! Ma Ri's mom!

54
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:23,110


55
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,565
What do you mean by divorce?

56
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,785
What is going on?

57
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,595
Did you two have a fight?

58
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,905
No, it's nothing. Don't worry so much.

59
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,595
Why would she bring up divorce if it's nothing?

60
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,915
I've never heard her say that before.

61
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,665
Have you been hurting her feelings somehow?

62
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:49,795
Or did you play around behind our backs and get caught?

63
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,775
What do you mean, play around?

64
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,245
It's not like that.

65
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:57,575
You think he would do such a thing?

66
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,225
Seriously.

67
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:03,155
What's in your head that you say stuff like that?

68
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:07,755
Well, Soo Yeon left home at this hour.

69
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,105
This is a big deal.

70
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:13,215
She'll get some fresh air and come back.

71
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:16,065
I'll talk to her when she comes back.

72
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,685
Don't be concerned. Don't worry.

73
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:27,785
Do we give her a hard time or bully her?

74
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,205
I can't believe this.

75
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:34,355
What gives her the right to bring up divorce first?

76
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:35,465
How despicable.

77
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,855
Yes, I know.

78
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,605
Is something going on?

79
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,635
Why are you out here?

80
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:51,435
Soo Yeon wants to divorce Hyung?

81
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,605
Yes, isn't it shocking?

82
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,265
Why does she suddenly want a divorce?

83
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,875
That's what we don't understand.

84
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:03,475
They didn't even bring up divorce back when Auntie told them

85
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:08,285
to get a surrogate mother because of how Ma Ri is.

86
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,735
I think there's only one reason.

87
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:14,675
Chairman Gong denies it, but he definitely cheated.

88
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,225
He has another woman.

89
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:18,195
Hyung?

90
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:19,925
That can't be.

91
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:23,375
Otherwise, why would she leave demanding a divorce?

92
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,465
Jin Dan, you should look into it, just in case.

93
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:29,905
What if they get divorced, and a young woman moves in and has a baby?

94
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:32,705
That'd be a huge headache.

95
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,685
- I suppose. 
 - I'm telling you.

96
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:40,275
If it's true, we need to separate him from that woman somehow.

97
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,355
They can never get a divorce.

98
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:47,725
It's better for Soo Yeon, who's infertile, to stay with him.

99
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:52,025
   

100
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,965
It's me. Where are you right now?

101
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:01,785
I'm at a hotel.

102
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,245
 W-What? A hotel? 

103
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,785
Which hotel? I'll pick you up right now.

104
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,265
 No. 

105
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,315
I won't go back home anymore.

106
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:17,105
I'll talk to Ma Ri.

107
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:22,215
Call me when the divorce paper is ready.

108
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:25,915
Why are you suddenly doing this? What do you mean by divorce?

109
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:28,575
Honey! Honey!

110
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,595
Is she serious right now?

111
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:38,565
Why is she doing this? Why?

112
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,665
 The call is not going through. 

113
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,865
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep... 

114
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:57,555
Auntie, Auntie! Soo Yeon didn't come home last night.

115
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,715
This has got to be something serious.

116
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:01,355
I think she really wants a divorce.

117
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,385
What do we do? She won't answer my call, either.

118
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,035
What?

119
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:09,295
There's an elder in the house. How dare she sleep outside without telling me?

120
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:14,225
She won't answer the phone, either? What's she doing?

121
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:20,105
Chairman Gong, I heard Soo Yeon didn't come home last night.

122
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:23,565
Please tell me what's going on.

123
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:28,465
Is Soo Yeon really trying to get a divorce?

124
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:31,815
Not at all. There's no way.

125
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:35,795
I'll talk to her and figure things out. Don't worry.

126
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:38,305
I'll get going now, then.

127
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,925
How dare she?

128
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,485
What did she even do since marrying into our family?

129
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:52,405
I tried to tolerate and forgive her, but this is no good.

130
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:56,405
Let her get divorced if she wants it so badly.

131
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,535
Unbelievable.

132
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,445
Gosh, what if they actually get divorced?

133
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:04,935
But why are they suddenly doing this?

134
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,585
Gosh, I'm so curious.

135
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,955
What? What are they talking about?

136
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:26,835
Mom, did you run away?

137
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,255
Did you really demand Dad a divorce?

138
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,345
Where are you right now?

139
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:34,715
You really asked Dad for a divorce?

140
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,985
- Yes. 
 - Why?

141
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,515
It's because I feel so bad for him.

142
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:48,845
It's been so hard keeping Pil Sung a secret from Dad.

143
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:53,055
I can't go on because it's too hard, and I feel bad for him. So...

144
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,145
Dad doesn't know anything.

145
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,005
Mom, I'll be more careful.

146
00:09:57,005 --> 00:10:01,245
So please don't get divorced.

147
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:05,705
No, Ma Ri. There's no point in being careful now.

148
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,965
Pil Sung's family ended up finding out, too.

149
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:12,865
There's no secret in this world.

150
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:15,355
Dad will eventually...

151
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:19,905
find out about everything, too.

152
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:22,840
When he does...

153
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:27,905
he'd get hurt so greatly.

154
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,245
So, Ma Ri,

155
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:34,435
I should leave somewhere far away before that.

156
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,965
You're all grown up now.

157
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:40,285
You understand me, right?

158
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:44,075
Mom, but still. Don't you care about Dad and me?

159
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,705
What would I do if you got divorced? Who will I live with?

160
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:50,385
And how about Dad? You're everything to him.

161
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:57,405
Ma Ri, should we just live somewhere far away?

162
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:58,975
I don't want to.

163
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,555
Why would I leave? Why would I only live with you?

164
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:03,235
I want to live with Dad, too.

165
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:06,115
Why would you separate Dad and me?

166
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:09,805
And what would Dad do if you do this now?

167
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:12,245
Why are you so bad?

168
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,855
Yes.

169
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,775
I'm bad. I'm a really bad person.

170
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:22,045
That's why I don't have the right to live with someone as nice as your dad.

171
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,725
So, Ma Ri—

172
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:29,405
So, are you insisting on divorcing him?

173
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:37,265
Ma Ri, please understand me.

174
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,905
Fine.

175
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:42,265
You do whatever you want to do.

176
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:45,585
Instead, I'll live however I want. Don't regret it later.

177
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:49,385
Ma Ri.

178
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,995
Wow, my country, Korea.

179
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:58,535
This familiar smell. It's been so long.

180
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,935
Yes, Ma'am.

181
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,095
An apartment is available?

182
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,245
Excuse me, you dropped your wallet.

183
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,325
I'll call you back in a moment.

184
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:19,095
Gosh, thank you. Thank you.

185
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,145
Don't mention it.

186
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,065
Thank you.

187
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,595
Wow, Korean people are so friendly and nice.

188
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:30,765
They pick up your wallet, too.

189
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:34,525
Wow...

190
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,925
Seon Yeong, you're getting a call.

191
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,615
Okay.

192
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,435
Hello?

193
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,995
Yes, Sir.

194
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,385
Our rental unit?

195
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:01,035
Right now? Okay, come.

196
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:06,225
Mother, did you put the rental unit on the market?

197
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:10,535
Yes, I did. What's the point of keeping it empty?

198
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:13,185
We might as well make some money off of it.

199
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,985
Well done.

200
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:18,615
And I insisted on a man this time.

201
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,185
Let's not let women in anymore.

202
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,955
Maybe that place is cursed.

203
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:25,565
It keeps attracting gold diggers for some reason.

204
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,915
 Come on in. 

205
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:51,755
This is the cleanest place with the cheapest deposit around here.

206
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:54,495
I'll go with this one, then.

207
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:57,915
How big is your family?

208
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:00,025
Do you have other family members?

209
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:03,045
No, it's just me.

210
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,165
Chairman Gong really doesn't have a woman?

211
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,365
Are you sure you looked into it properly?

212
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:17,805
Yes, I looked thoroughly. He's clean.

213
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,865
- Is he, really? 
 - Yes.

214
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:22,785
He never even goes to a bar. He only works.

215
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:26,235
He plays golf only for work. He does nothing. He's way too clean.

216
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:29,185
- Really? 
 - Yes.

217
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:32,135
Hyung is so impressive.

218
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,795
By the way, why does he live like that?

219
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,155
I really don't understand it.

220
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:39,315
Hey, you think everyone's like you?

221
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:43,375
Why did Soo Yeon leave demanding divorce, then?

222
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,305
I thought it was because he cheated.

223
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:48,425
What other reasons are there?

224
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:51,275
Anyway, it's not him. It must be Soo Yeon.

225
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:52,675
Look into her instead.

226
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,785
Soo Yeon? Gosh, what's it about?

227
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,525
I'm really dying to know.

228
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:11,025
Why did you come all the way here?

229
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,735
Come on.

230
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:16,785
Are you treating me coldly because you had a falling out with Soo Yeon?

231
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:24,345
Gosh, the shikhye is so refreshing and tasty.

232
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,285
If you have something to say, get to it and leave.

233
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,835
I need to start dinner.

234
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,045
How could you be like this?

235
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:35,900
Fine, I'll keep it short and leave.

236
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:41,455
The thing is...Soo Yeon left the house demanding a divorce.

237
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,675
What?

238
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,225
 What did you say? Huh? 

239
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:50,965
Ma Ri's mom is getting divorced?

240
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:54,275
- Why? 
 - Gosh, Mother.

241
00:15:54,275 --> 00:16:00,135
Yes, I shouldn't have interrupted your conversation. Silly me.

242
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:03,175
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 - No, it's okay.

243
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,505
We all know each other.

244
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,495
Have a seat here.

245
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,285
So...

246
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:16,095
did Ma Ri's mom really leave home demanding a divorce?

247
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,145
- Why? 
 - I came here because I don't know why.

248
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,725
I guess he won't tell Chairman Gong why, either.

249
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:26,315
She said she's been thinking about it for a long time.

250
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,705
He's in shock and totally panicking right now.

251
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:33,095
He can't show it because he's so reserved.

252
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:38,185
So, she's been considering divorce for a long time?

253
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:40,995
Yes, I was shocked, too.

254
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:44,165
So, I was wondering if you knew anything about it, Seon Yeong.

255
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:46,645
Has Soo Yeon mentioned divorce with you?

256
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,925
You must know.

257
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,385
I don't know. I never heard such a thing.

258
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,635
I don't care if she gets divorced or not.

259
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:57,235
Please leave if that's all you have to say.

260
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:02,110
I know you two had a fight, but this is a serious matter.

261
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:05,115
Please tell me if you know anything.

262
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:09,095
- By chance... does she have a man? 
 - Hey!

263
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,645
- Geez. 
 - Geez.

264
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,525
Gosh, why are you yelling?

265
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:17,145
You think you can just say anything?

266
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:20,175
Are you saying Soo Yeon's cheating or something?

267
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:24,065
Just say she isn't. Why are you scaring me?

268
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:30,795
Excuse me, Ma'am. I think you went too far.

269
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:33,885
Ma Ri's mom wouldn't do such a thing.

270
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,835
I mean, they don't have a reason to get divorced.

271
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:39,885
So, I was just asking to make sure.

272
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,055
Why can't I ask you that in this situation?

273
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:45,135
You're making me look bad.

274
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:47,985
Fine! You're superior, Kim Seon Yeong.

275
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,075
I'll go now.

276
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,925
Excuse me...

277
00:17:55,145 --> 00:17:58,425
What's in Ae Gyo's head, exactly?

278
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,735
I can't believe the crap she spews.

279
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:07,935
It's because she felt guilty about Pil Sung.

280
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:11,045
That's why she suggested getting divorced.

281
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,905
Soo Yeon is such a devious thing.

282
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:19,255
Whether she gets divorced has nothing to do with us.

283
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,985
I don't think so.

284
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:30,125
I don't think we're entirely irrelevant, though.

285
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,405
But I feel so sorry for Ma Ri.

286
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:40,235
She's an adult physically, but she's just a 12-year-old.

287
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,715
Director, how about this place?

288
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:45,495
It's pretty good. Let's do it here.

289
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,875
Okay. Please take photos of the exterior.

290
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,345
Okay.

291
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,200
   

292
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,055
 Isn't that Ma Ri? 

293
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:00,815
 No, it can't be. 

294
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:04,235
 She wouldn't go to a club like that alone at this hour. 

295
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:08,725
Director, let's go.

296
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:10,175
Okay.

297
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,945
Ma Ri's mom must want a divorce

298
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:20,925
because she has a tiny bit of conscience.

299
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:24,255
She has no choice since we found out she abandoned Pil Sung.

300
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:27,015
There are no secrets in this world.

301
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:31,585
But you know, I do feel sorry for Chairman Gong.

302
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:36,895
It's sad if he gets divorced, and it's unfortunate if they stay together.

303
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:43,295
It's not like we can tell him Pil Sung is his wife's illegitimate child.

304
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,035
Mom.

305
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:46,945
What?

306
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:52,795
If they actually get divorced, what would Ma Ri do?

307
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,995
She's not a normal kid. I'm so worried.

308
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,375
She's just a 12-year-old.

309
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:03,545
They can't get divorced when they have a child like her.

310
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:06,615
What are you talking about?

311
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,795
Who's getting divorced?

312
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:14,525
Ma Ri's mom asked... Chairman Gong for a divorce.

313
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:19,395
I suppose she couldn't handle it anymore since we found out

314
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:22,085
she was your birth mother.

315
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:26,005
No matter how shameless, she can't keep it a secret forever.

316
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,785
Pil Sung, did you eat dinner?

317
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:31,285
Join us if you haven't eaten. I'll get you rice and soup.

318
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:34,545
I had dinner. I'll let you finish. I'll be upstairs.

319
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,095
Okay.

320
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:43,885
Mom, don't say stuff like that in front of Pil Sung.

321
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:48,405
What? It's not like I wanted him to hear it.

322
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:52,965
He heard while coming in. What am I supposed to do?

323
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,485
Ma Ri, have dinner—

324
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,885
Where did she go this time? My gosh!

325
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:06,145
"I'll run away, too. I'll live however I want, too.

326
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:08,255
So don't look for me."

327
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:11,015
Gosh, what's this about now?

328
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:13,535
You've got to be kidding me!

329
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,667
How did you find me here?

330
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,677
Did you think I couldn't find you here?

331
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:37,677
I said we should meet once Attorney Kang prepares the divorce papers.

332
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,857
Why are you doing this?

333
00:21:41,857 --> 00:21:44,517
I should know the reason, at least.

334
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:47,877
Do I need a special reason?

335
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:51,987
I just feel tired and stressed living with you.

336
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,657
I no longer want to live with you.

337
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:58,727
What? You no longer want to live with me?

338
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:03,157
You're still young.

339
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:08,367
Find someone nice and have a fresh start.

340
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:11,127
Are you serious right now?

341
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:14,177
   

342
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,847
Yes, Auntie.

343
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:21,747
What did you say? Ma Ri disappeared?

344
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:42,997
 Director Go, have you heard from Ma Ri, by chance? 

345
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:46,047
 She went missing. 

346
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:49,017
 She left a note and ran away. 

347
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:58,347
President Jang, what do you mean Ma Ri's missing?

348
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:00,387
She ran away from home?

349
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:07,057
Okay, then. I'll look into it and get back to you.

350
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,217
   

351
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:17,027
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep 

352
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:18,967
 and there will be an additional charge. 

353
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,547
Where did she go off to?

354
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:34,547
Yes. That was Ma Ri. I wasn't mistaken.

355
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:40,237
Yes, President Jang. I think I know where she is.

356
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,287
Are you alone, by chance?

357
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:58,507
Did you come here alone?

358
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:01,027
- Yes. 
 - Do you want to hang out with me?

359
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:08,207
- No. 
 - Come hang out with my friends.

360
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,297
- I don't want to! 
 - Why not—

361
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:12,387
Hey!

362
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:14,577
She said no. What are you doing?

363
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:15,797
Who the hell?

364
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:18,867
She's my sister. Get lost.

365
00:24:21,107 --> 00:24:24,047
Oppa, how did you know I was here?

366
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,727
Gong Ma Ri, come with me for now. Let's talk outside.

367
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,387
Ma Ri! Gong Ma Ri!

368
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:35,067
Oppa, did you tell Mom?

369
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:38,277
What happened? What are you doing here?

370
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:42,407
Your phone is off, too. Do you know how worried I was?

371
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:45,207
Let's talk outside. Follow me.

372
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:48,897
Okay. Okay!

373
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,327
Ma Ri, look at yourself.

374
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,887
What's with this outfit?

375
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:57,307
Why are you doing this?

376
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,947
Did you drink, too?

377
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:03,277
Yes, I drank. Why?

378
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:05,347
Am I not supposed to? I'm 28 years old.

379
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:07,477
I'm an adult. Of course, I can drink.

380
00:25:07,477 --> 00:25:10,337
Seriously! Do you want me to hit you?

381
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:13,527
Aren't you the one who should be hit?

382
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:17,617
You abandoned Oppa and now me. You do whatever you want to do.

383
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:21,057
I want to do that, too! I'll do everything I want to do!

384
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:25,577
Gong Ma Ri, how dare you raise your voice right now?

385
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:27,457
You kept your phone off, too.

386
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,747
Do you know how many people were looking for you?

387
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:32,237
Are you saying you did nothing wrong?

388
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,637
I didn't say that.

389
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:38,297
You don't know how I feel.

390
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:43,867
Mom and Dad are the only people who can protect me in this world.

391
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:48,737
But how would I live if they got divorced?

392
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:52,927
You can live alone fine since you're smart, but not me.

393
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:57,447
I can't live alone without Mom and Dad!

394
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:12,827
President Jang, look at us now.

395
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:19,737
I blame you, and Ma Ri blames you.

396
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:22,207
Is this what you wanted?

397
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:26,867
You abandoned me because you had a situation.

398
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:30,387
Now, you're abandoning Ma Ri because of your shallow sense of guilt.

399
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:36,537
You'll never understand how miserable it is

400
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:40,477
to be abandoned, President Jang.

401
00:26:43,697 --> 00:26:46,767
Abandoning me should've been enough.

402
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:49,058
Don't do the same thing to Ma Ri.

403
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,398
I can't...

404
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,628
just watch Ma Ri getting hurt.

405
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:57,827
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:01,117
I'm sorry, Pil Sung.

407
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,577
Oppa, don't be like that.

408
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:07,037
It's my fault. Don't yell at Mom.

409
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:09,647
She's crying.

410
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:13,707
Ma Ri.

411
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:23,557
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

412
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:26,907
I'm sorry.

413
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:31,607
It's okay. I'm sorry for causing trouble.

414
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:46,947
Gosh, Ma Ri. Why did you run away like that?

415
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:49,997
Do you know how much we worried?

416
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:52,297
Is Ma Ri okay?

417
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:57,097
Yes, we found her, thanks to Pil Sung.

418
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:59,307
That's a relief.

419
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,507
Go rest upstairs, Ma Ri.

420
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:03,817
- Yeojudaek. 
 - Yes.

421
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,127
What are you doing right now?

422
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:17,217
You put us in this mess by running away and demanding a divorce.

423
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:19,767
Yes, get divorced.

424
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,577
That's for the better.

425
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:24,327
Jin Taek, get divorced tomorrow immediately.

426
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,207
How can you live with a woman like this?

427
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:31,877
She made her daughter run away and caused chaos at home.

428
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,087
Don't you respect the hierarchy of this family?

429
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,307
I'm sorry.

430
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:39,957
I wasn't thinking clearly.

431
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,427
Honey, I'm sorry.

432
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:46,857
It's my fault. Forgive me.

433
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:50,977
Look at you. You're so unruly.

434
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:55,047
You wanted a divorce yesterday, and you're asking for forgiveness now.

435
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,727
What are you trying to pull now?

436
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:03,427
Yes, it's up to you two if you get divorced or not.

437
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:06,127
But let me hear the reason.

438
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:09,087
Why did you want to get divorced?

439
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:11,887
What's the reason, anyway?

440
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:14,207
I'm sorry, Auntie.

441
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:20,417
Great Auntie, stop! Stop!

442
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,107
Mom said she was sorry.

443
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:24,807
She's asking for forgiveness. Why keep doing this? Why?

444
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,647
Ma Ri, it's okay.

445
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,737
- It's okay. 
 - Please stop.

446
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:30,217
It's okay.

447
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:39,097
Chairman Gong, I think Soo Yeon might be going through this.

448
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:41,357
Menopause depression.

449
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:43,937
Menopause depression?

450
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:47,897
Yes, it's one of the menopause symptoms.

451
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:52,567
You get irritable about everything for no reason. You get annoyed and can't be bothered.

452
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:57,547
When it's bad, you can demand a divorce and end up getting divorced out of the blue.

453
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,997
I heard a lot of women are like that these days.

454
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:05,337
So, you should take Soo Yeon to the hospital and talk to a doctor.

455
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,177
The culture became so generous.

456
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:14,667
You get annoyed and bothered for no reason and get divorced, too?

457
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,757
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

458
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:22,217
Chairman Gong, she might change her mind again and demand a divorce again.

459
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:23,937
You can't live with that.

460
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:26,667
When she asks for it,

461
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:31,187
say thank you and let her have it. Don't you think that's better?

462
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:39,427
 Oppa, Mom and Dad aren't getting divorced. 

463
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,547
 It's all thanks to you. 

464
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:43,447
 Thank you, Oppa. 

465
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:47,997
 And I'll never cause trouble again. I promise. 

466
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,648
   

467
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,287
   

468
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:00,087
Yes, Ji Yeong.

469
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:04,267
 Director, is this Director Go Pil Sung? 

470
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:09,477
Well, yes. You're Ji Yeong's grandmother, right?

471
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:12,167
Yes, I am.

472
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:20,177
I was looking at Ji Yeong's phone, and I noticed your number.

473
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:23,797
That's why I gave you a call.

474
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:27,987
Have you had breakfast yet?

475
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,937
No, not yet. Have you eaten, Ma'am?

476
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,897
 Of course, I ate already. 

477
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:37,297
 You wake up early when you're old. 

478
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:40,377
Is it because I wake up early?

479
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:44,047
I don't know why a day is so long.

480
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:48,617
The weather is nice today. Go somewhere fun with Ji Yeong.

481
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:53,727
 She's a country bumpkin. She doesn't know her way around Seoul. 

482
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:59,627
Why is the subway and bus system so complicated here?

483
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:04,357
I'd be grateful if we didn't get lost.

484
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,877
What will you do today, then?

485
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:09,867
 Well? I'm thinking of stopping by 

486
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:13,747
Bokgae Canal nearby with Ji Yeong later.

487
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:18,427
By the way, what are you doing today?

488
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:25,657
Mom, why did you answer a call in the room while eating?

489
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:27,477
I talked to Ma Ri.

490
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:30,467
I texted her earlier.

491
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:38,457
She says President Jang isn't getting divorced.

492
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,847
I have a plan. I'll get going now.

493
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:42,887
Okay.

494
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,707
- Pil Sung— 
 - Take care.

495
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,037
Seriously.

496
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:51,747
Mom, why would you say that in front of him?

497
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:54,757
He barely eats these days.

498
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:58,447
And why should we care if she gets divorced or not?

499
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:01,867
Stop bringing them up, please.

500
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:06,127
Hyeon Cheol, you should face the reality now, too.

501
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:10,317
President Jang can't get divorced for Pil Sung's sake.

502
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:13,417
What are you talking about? I'm losing my appetite.

503
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,677
Listen to me carefully now.

504
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:19,457
We need to face the reality directly now.

505
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:24,927
No matter how much you don't like it, President Jang is Pil Sung's birth mother.

506
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,437
That can't be changed.

507
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:28,217
Mom.

508
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:33,787
I need to say this, no matter how angrily you look at me.

509
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:37,257
It would be best if you thought about what's really good for Pil Sung.

510
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:40,787
What's the point of always saying, "My son, my Pil Sung"?

511
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,487
That doesn't get him money or anything.

512
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:46,277
Aigoo...

513
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:50,807
If President Jang gets divorced,

514
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:54,737
Pil Sung has to take care of Ma Ri.

515
00:34:54,737 --> 00:34:56,857
You think that's all?

516
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:59,557
Since President Jang is afraid that her husband might find out,

517
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:04,337
she keeps apologizing to us profusely now.

518
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:05,887
But what if they get divorced?

519
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,527
She won't care about anything then.

520
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:11,617
What if she says Pil Sung is her son and tries to take him?

521
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:14,627
What will you do then?

522
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:21,477
See? I'm right, aren't I?

523
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:24,567
That's why President Jang can't get divorced.

524
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:29,497
She should never, for the sake of Pil Sung's future.

525
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:33,837
Let's be honest. Pil Sung's birth mother showed up.

526
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:36,877
Rather than being poor and trying to leech off of Pil Sung,

527
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:41,027
isn't it much better that she's a chaebol's wife like President Jang?

528
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:44,967
It's such a relief that his birth mother is well-off.

529
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:47,587
Stop obsessing over that family!

530
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:50,847
I can't eat because of you! Geez!

531
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:53,047
Gosh, Mother.

532
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,717
Please stop now.

533
00:35:57,987 --> 00:36:01,857
What do they mean, stop?

534
00:36:03,147 --> 00:36:05,307
Hey, Myeong Dong.

535
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:08,687
Do you think I'm wrong?

536
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:10,967
I think you have a point this time.

537
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,537
Listening to you now,

538
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:17,617
I see that this is way better than having a pitiful

539
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:20,887
birth mother begging Pil Sung for money.

540
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,187
Right?

541
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:27,627
Having a chaebol birth mother is way better, right?

542
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:30,467
But Mom, you'd better stop.

543
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:32,957
You're about to get kicked out at this rate.

544
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:37,987
I'll say everything I want to say, even if it comes to that.

545
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,727
But...

546
00:36:39,727 --> 00:36:44,837
by the way, Myeong Dong, what if Chairman Gong dies or something?

547
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:48,247
Ma Ri will get the inheritance,

548
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,968
but doesn't President Jang own half of his assets?

549
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,737
So, what are you trying to say?

550
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:58,988
So, I'm saying there's no need

551
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:03,228
to burn the bridge with her like this.

552
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,977
I've always wanted to tell you this.

553
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:09,827
I think you're the smartest person in this family.

554
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:13,967
You should've made money with that brain. Why did you waste it?

555
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:19,067
Yes, I only recently realized how smart I am.

556
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:23,097
Mom, do you know how devious you are?

557
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:40,197
Do Jun, are you angry?

558
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:42,427
Please stop being angry.

559
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:46,897
I feel so bad and scared because you're angry.

560
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,857
I thought we were friends.

561
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,157
But I'm not sure if I'm your friend.

562
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:55,717
We're friends, Do Jun.

563
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,977
When you ran away from home,

564
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:05,577
I thought my heart would explode because I was so worried something might've happened to you.

565
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:09,587
If we're friends, you should've told me something.

566
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,927
You ran away without telling me anything.

567
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:15,387
How could you dare to go to a club like that alone?

568
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:18,087
That's why you're angry.

569
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:24,857
I'm sorry. Because Mom said she was getting divorced, I was so scared that I wasn't myself.

570
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:28,347
Don't you need friends when you're so scared and devastated?

571
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:31,567
You didn't think of me in that moment?

572
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,797
Thank you, Do Jun.

573
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:39,177
I'll think of you first from now on.

574
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:41,627
So stop being angry.

575
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:43,987
You mean it, right?

576
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:46,077
Yes, I mean it.

577
00:38:48,837 --> 00:38:51,907
Let's go. I'll take you to the academy.

578
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:58,357
So, was your heart really about to explode from worrying about me?

579
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,147
Yes.

580
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:05,647
Okay. I won't make your heart explode again. I swear.

581
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:21,267
Gosh, Station Director! Station Director.

582
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:25,187
I heard you're preparing a miniseries named "Confession."

583
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:27,857
President Baek, how did you know that?

584
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:30,667
Seriously, you're so good at getting information.

585
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:34,107
I need to be quick with stuff like this to make a living.

586
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,647
Of course, you do.

587
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:38,707
That's why I like you.

588
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:44,267
I mean, that's why you're cool. You're cool.

589
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,437
I don't have time right now. Let's talk later.

590
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:48,627
- Gosh, Station Director. 
 - What? What?

591
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:50,317
Please have a look at this.

592
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:53,897
She's a new actor named Kim Ji Yeong I started 
working with. 
    

593
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:58,247
You know Director Go's new miniseries, "House of Roses"?

594
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:02,207
- Yes. 
 - She was cast as a supporting actor.

595
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:03,977
- Supporting actor? 
 - Yes.

596
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:09,197
The infamously picky Director Go Pil Sung and Writer Kim Oh Gyeong liked her.

597
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:14,077
She was picked unanimously in the audition.

598
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,277
- Writer Kim, too? 
 - Yes.

599
00:40:16,277 --> 00:40:22,317
So you should keep an eye on Kim Ji Yeong, too.

600
00:40:22,317 --> 00:40:24,657
Okay, see you later. I'll have a look.

601
00:40:24,657 --> 00:40:26,057
- Promise, Station Director. 
 - Okay.

602
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,027
- Promise, okay? 
 - Okay!

603
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:37,907
The weather's hot, and I'm tired.

604
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:40,847
I was able to do this way back when I was young.

605
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,477
Seriously.

606
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:46,747
It's so hard running around at my age.

607
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,157
   

608
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:55,367
They should've given her a prettier face than before while they were at it.

609
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:58,577
What is this? How will she be a star with her country bumpkin image?

610
00:40:58,577 --> 00:41:01,417
When will she become a top celebrity and get ad deals?

611
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:07,257
Seriously, how bleak. Seriously.

612
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:19,437
Did you look?

613
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:21,277
Gosh, why are they here?

614
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:23,467
I asked if you looked.

615
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:31,537
My goodness.

616
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:33,227
I almost got caught.

617
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:35,137
What do I do?

618
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,507
Grandma, what are you doing?

619
00:41:52,497 --> 00:41:55,947
I'm getting ready to meet someone.

620
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,147
Meet someone?

621
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:02,467
You don't know anyone in Seoul. Who are you meeting?

622
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,927
Of course, I know someone.

623
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:11,407
I'm having a date with Director Go.

624
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:16,377
What? Why are you meeting him?

625
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:19,927
Gosh, is he already here? Aigoo!

626
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:24,277
Grandma! Hold on! Grandma!

627
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,277
Get in, ma'am.

628
00:42:28,277 --> 00:42:30,167
Gosh, Director. Thank you!

629
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,527
Grandma!

630
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:36,447
Grandma!

631
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:38,527
Director, what are you doing?

632
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:41,177
Why would you see my grandma?

633
00:42:41,177 --> 00:42:42,697
Why would you?

634
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:44,317
I decided to become friends with her.

635
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:46,607
What? Friends?

636
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:50,657
How could you and Grandma become friends? That's nonsense.

637
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:54,477
People become friends regardless of age overseas.

638
00:42:54,477 --> 00:42:59,727
I was in Paris recently. That's why I decided to be friends with her, like overseas.

639
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,297
Stop talking nonsense.

640
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:03,867
Cancel your friendship.

641
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,167
- I can't do that. 
 - What?

642
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:11,457
I didn't want to say anything, but I think I need to.

643
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:13,887
You say you love your grandmother so much,

644
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:17,477
but you never showed her around Seoul. You can't do that.

645
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:23,107
So, I agreed to show her around Seoul as her friend.

646
00:43:23,107 --> 00:43:25,577
So, you should go back inside.

647
00:43:25,577 --> 00:43:28,717
Gosh, no. I'll do it.

648
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:32,677
I'll show her around Seoul. You should leave instead.

649
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,217
No!

650
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:38,017
Ji Yeong, I'll go with Director Go.

651
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:41,617
- You should stay at home, okay? 
 - What?

652
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:44,327
You heard that, right? Well, then.

653
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:51,417
Gosh, Grandma! How could I let you go on your own?

654
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,827
Why don't you come with us, then?

655
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:57,557
Seriously...

656
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:07,297
I never got to wear a school uniform.

657
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:09,947
I'm so happy I finally got to wear one.

658
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,347
It looks great on you.

659
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:12,597
- Do I look pretty? 
 - Yes.

660
00:44:12,597 --> 00:44:15,827
Take a photo of me, then.

661
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:18,337
Let's just take one.

662
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:20,157
One, two...

663
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:26,577
I'm making you look pretty.

664
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,807
Gosh, where did they get all this?

665
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:32,577
Aigoo.

666
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:39,407
♫  Dear sister who's holding a shiny diploma  ♫

667
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:45,767
♫  My love always feels new  ♫

668
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:50,877
♫  In your arms, I opened my eyes  ♫

669
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:56,447
♫  I'll close my eyes in your arms, too  ♫

670
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:01,767
♫  I'll close my eyes in your arms  ♫

671
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:19,227
Well, Director,

672
00:45:19,227 --> 00:45:21,477
thank you.

673
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:26,837
Seeing Grandma being so happy almost made me cry.

674
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:30,757
You're better than me.

675
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:34,317
Thank you so much.

676
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:38,037
No problem. I've been feeling down lately, too.

677
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,817
It was nice to change things up a bit.

678
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:49,067
I suppose some negative things happened to you recently.

679
00:45:53,797 --> 00:45:57,707
There was a bit of a situation.

680
00:46:04,147 --> 00:46:06,987
I heard this from somewhere.

681
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:10,067
They say no pain is meaningless

682
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:14,047
and people grow through pain.

683
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:19,187
"This too shall pass." There's that famous quote, too.

684
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:23,497
I don't know what happened,

685
00:46:23,497 --> 00:46:27,797
but I hope you overcome it and cheer up.

686
00:46:31,977 --> 00:46:33,507
Thank you.

687
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:36,907
I feel much better hearing you say that.

688
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:42,377
I'm so glad to hear that if that's the case.

689
00:46:42,377 --> 00:46:47,017
If you're grateful, show me the 63 Building next time.

690
00:46:47,017 --> 00:46:48,937
Grandma!

691
00:46:48,937 --> 00:46:52,777
You should buy us food next time, then.

692
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:56,987
The director paid for everything. You should treat us, too.

693
00:46:56,987 --> 00:46:59,967
What do you mean next time?

694
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:04,657
Director, don't bring your wallet next time.

695
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:07,437
Ji Yeong will treat you.

696
00:47:07,437 --> 00:47:09,007
Keep talking.

697
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:10,627
I'll go look around.

698
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,047
Grandma!

699
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,147
You heard her, right?

700
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:18,417
You planned this together, didn't you?

701
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:20,187
Did you write a script for this, too?

702
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:22,827
I didn't. Just buy me a meal.

703
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,547
- Oh, my. 
 - Ji Yeong, Ji Yeong.

704
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,687
Hey, hey!

705
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:35,157
What? What's wrong with you?

706
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:37,607
You meanie!

707
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:41,627
You should cook for him if you married a younger man.

708
00:47:41,627 --> 00:47:43,557
How could you make him ramen?

709
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:48,477
You made her nothing but ramen, too, right?

710
00:47:48,477 --> 00:47:50,167
You shameless thing!

711
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,127
Gosh, seriously... Seriously...

712
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:57,927
Geum Dong, why do you have such bad taste in women?

713
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:04,187
If you wanted an older woman, you should've chosen one that can cook.

714
00:48:04,187 --> 00:48:09,937
It's not too late to kick that useless woman out. Marry someone else.

715
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:12,257
- Are you serious right now? 
 - Mom! Mom!

716
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:14,857
- I can't take this anymore! 
 - Mom! Mom!

717
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:18,627
Mom! Mom! Mom!

718
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:21,717
Mom, I didn't just have ramen.

719
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:25,657
And I wanted it. So I made it for myself.

720
00:48:25,657 --> 00:48:28,437
Aigoo, you stupid man.

721
00:48:28,437 --> 00:48:31,837
Are you defending that old bitch in this situation?

722
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:33,977
No, no.

723
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:39,027
She's busy with work, but she's a good cook.

724
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:42,037
It's not like she doesn't know how to cook.

725
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:46,138
And look at my face.

726
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:48,657
Do I look like I'm starving?

727
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:52,287
Gosh, yes! Look at him. Look at him.

728
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:56,577
He's head over heels for the old bitch.

729
00:48:56,577 --> 00:49:00,737
Wow, you're so talented.

730
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,817
How did you seduce my son?

731
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,007
How did you trick him that...

732
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:11,927
my son, Geum Dong, who's all about his mother is defending you right now?

733
00:49:11,927 --> 00:49:13,257
Wow, seriously!

734
00:49:13,257 --> 00:49:17,787
Aigoo, why are you so full of energy, Grandma?

735
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:19,807
Grandma, let's go out.

736
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:22,527
I'll buy you something tasty. Let's go.

737
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:23,807
What are you buying me?

738
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,977
Something tasty, I said.

739
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:29,047
- Aigoo, let's go. 
 - Seriously...

740
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:30,937
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

741
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:34,467
Seriously, this is hopeless. How will we live?

742
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,637
This is hopeless.

743
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:53,827
 Director, thank you so much for today. 

744
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,557
 I like you. 

745
00:49:56,557 --> 00:49:58,887
 I love you. 

746
00:50:06,347 --> 00:50:08,487
Here, Grandma.

747
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:10,427
Yes, yes.

748
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:18,487
Did you crave strawberry ice cream that much?

749
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:20,647
Yes.

750
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:24,137
If I eat this when I'm angry,

751
00:50:24,137 --> 00:50:29,957
the anger in me melts away.

752
00:50:31,037 --> 00:50:34,177
Why do you hate Ahjumma so much?

753
00:50:34,177 --> 00:50:35,817
I don't know.

754
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:40,157
That stepmother makes me angry somehow.

755
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,897
 I love you, too, Ji Yeong. 

756
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,147
What's this?

757
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:56,447
Why... Why is the Director saying "I love you" to me?

758
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,607
He said "I love you" to you?

759
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:04,727
Yes. I didn't even text him.

760
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:08,027
   

761
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:09,797
What's this?

762
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:13,037
Grandma! You sent this, didn't you?

763
00:51:14,397 --> 00:51:16,477
It's because you can't tell him.

764
00:51:16,477 --> 00:51:20,327
So, I told him on your behalf.

765
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,837
Brave women get beautiful men. Like me.

766
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:29,837
 Director, I didn't send this. 

767
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,377
 My grandma was joking around. 

768
00:51:31,377 --> 00:51:33,667
 Don't be mistaken, okay? 

769
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:39,687
 I'll just be mistaken. 

770
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:47,907
Ji Yeong, I find Director Go so cute.

771
00:51:47,907 --> 00:51:49,497
He's not just cute.

772
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:52,887
He's polite, kind,

773
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:57,587
and most of all, he likes you so much.

774
00:51:57,587 --> 00:52:00,737
That's my favorite part.

775
00:52:00,737 --> 00:52:06,467
Grandma, I can never be with the Director.

776
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:09,047
I'm not supposed to like him.

777
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:11,847
That makes no sense.

778
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:17,847
You say you can't like him because you like him a lot.

779
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:20,387
Just give in.

780
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,787
Life is short.

781
00:52:21,787 --> 00:52:25,287
There's a reason why I can't like him.

782
00:52:25,287 --> 00:52:28,477
So, stop tempting me.

783
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:30,757
You fool.

784
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:35,887
You think it's easy to find someone you like?

785
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,407
Seize him while you have him.

786
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:41,757
Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

787
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:51,137
I have twice as much to do with one more person.

788
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:52,637
Gosh, my legs.

789
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,007
My legs...

790
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:56,447
My legs...

791
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:09,987
Hold on. Are those loan sharks looking for me?

792
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:13,797
No, they must think I'm still in jail.

793
00:53:13,797 --> 00:53:16,857
I'm sure they didn't see me.

794
00:53:16,857 --> 00:53:19,487
Gosh, my legs. My legs...

795
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:25,277
Seriously.

796
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:30,077
I was already living pitifully, and a senile old lady moved in now.

797
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:33,957
I made Do Ra into a star.

798
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:36,547
She had a chance because she worked since she was 12.

799
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,867
But Ji Yeong is 29. She'll turn 30 soon.

800
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:42,557
When will she become successful at this rate?

801
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:47,377
Can't a wad of cash fall from the sky?

802
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:49,037
Seriously.

803
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:57,007
   

804
00:53:58,087 --> 00:53:59,757
Yes, Tae Hee.

805
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:03,217
 Jin Dan, you know we're going to the wedding dress shop, right? 

806
00:54:03,217 --> 00:54:04,417
Pardon?

807
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:09,807
Oh, of course. I know.

808
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:11,547
Tae Hee,

809
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:16,887
the wedding is two months away. Are we getting the dress already?

810
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:21,147
 What do you mean, already? It takes a long time to make the dress. 

811
00:54:21,147 --> 00:54:23,977
Okay, got it.

812
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:27,477
See you at the shop, then. Bye.

813
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:56,337
Jin Dan, what do you think?

814
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:01,517
It's nice. I like it.

815
00:55:01,517 --> 00:55:05,207
Really? Let me try just one more, then.

816
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,757
Okay. Go ahead.

817
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:23,347
I mean...

818
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:27,977
why is the illusion of Do Ra so vivid?

819
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:33,307
What's wrong with me? Seriously...

820
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:09,577
President... President Gong.

821
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,497
What are you doing here?

822
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:14,217
Huh? President Baek.

823
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:18,147
I'm so glad I ran into you.

824
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:23,997
President Bake, I need to see Kim Ji Yeong,

825
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:26,337
but she won't pick up her phone.

826
00:56:26,337 --> 00:56:30,787
President Baek, please call her for me.

827
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,867
Ji Yeong?

828
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:36,877
You came here to see Ji Yeong, not me?

829
00:56:36,877 --> 00:56:39,407
How do you know her?

830
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:43,457
President Baek.

831
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:47,257
She's an actor you represent.

832
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:49,337
You live with her.

833
00:56:49,337 --> 00:56:52,347
So, please call her for me.

834
00:56:52,347 --> 00:56:56,297
 Gosh, what? He knows Do Ra and I live together? 

835
00:56:56,297 --> 00:56:58,917
 Did he research me? 

836
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,827
 Or Ji Yeong? 

837
00:57:00,827 --> 00:57:05,597
So, why do you want me to call Ji Yeong this late?

838
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:08,447
Do you know each other by chance?

839
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:17,927
President Baek, I think I have pent-up regrets ever since Park Do Ra died.

840
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:21,007
I still can't get over her.

841
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:26,407
I still miss Do Ra so much.

842
00:57:27,547 --> 00:57:32,037
But whenever I see Ji Yeong,

843
00:57:32,037 --> 00:57:34,937
I feel like I'm with Do Ra.

844
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:39,937
That's why I've seen Ji Yeong many times.

845
00:57:41,307 --> 00:57:43,227
What did you say?

846
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:47,337
So, President Baek, please help me.

847
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:51,327
It's because I miss Do Ra so much today.

848
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:56,147
So, I need to see Ji Yeong instead.

849
00:57:56,147 --> 00:58:02,277
Hold on, hold on. So, you want to see Ji Yeong instead of Do Ra, as a replacement right now?

850
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:04,187
Just so you don't get bored?

851
00:58:04,187 --> 00:58:11,177
President Baek, be honest. Isn't that why you're keeping Ji Yeong around?

852
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:15,477
Because she resembles Park Do Ra. She looks like her.

853
00:58:15,477 --> 00:58:17,897
I feel the same.

854
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:23,647
Whenever I see Ji Yeong, I keep seeing Park Do Ra.

855
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:26,727
I'm even taking meds for it.

856
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:32,177
So, President Baek, please help me.

857
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:36,957
Let me see Ji Yeong just once today.

858
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:55,867
 I think I have pent-up regrets ever since Park Do Ra died. 

859
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:58,987
 I still can't get over her. 

860
00:59:01,127 --> 00:59:04,377
 I still miss Do Ra so much. 

861
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:09,337
 He hasn't gotten over Do Ra yet? 

862
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,767
 That's why he wants to see Ji Yeong? 

863
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:15,107
 Gosh, that bastard is out of his mind. 

864
00:59:15,107 --> 00:59:17,657
 I should keep an eye on Ji Yeong from now on. 

865
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:22,167
 It'd be a disaster if he found out she was Do Ra. 

866
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,587
 Noona, I'm here! 

867
00:59:29,587 --> 00:59:31,497
Gosh, Do Jun.

868
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:34,277
What's all this? Why did you bring so much?

869
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:37,067
Welcome, Do Jun.

870
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:39,227
I bought some meat and fruit on the way.

871
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:40,737
I got paid yesterday.

872
00:59:40,737 --> 00:59:43,087
You don't get paid much. You should spend it on yourself.

873
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:47,427
Thank you, Do Jun. My baby. Seriously.

874
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:50,417
"My baby"? What do you mean...

875
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:54,647
Huh? "M-My baby"?

876
00:59:54,647 --> 01:00:00,037
Geum Dong, you had a son?

877
01:00:00,037 --> 01:00:02,427
Is this my grandson, then?

878
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:06,777
Gosh, gosh. How handsome.

879
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,097
He looks just like Geum Dong.

880
01:00:09,097 --> 01:00:11,607
Gosh, my head hurts.

881
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,567
Hyung, who's she?

882
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,917
She's my mom.

883
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:19,317
What? What do you mean?

884
01:00:19,317 --> 01:00:22,107
The thing is, Do Jun...

885
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:25,567
She's my grandma. The one who saved me.

886
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:27,407
That grandma?

887
01:00:29,537 --> 01:00:32,357
Hello, Ma'am. I'm Park Do Jun.

888
01:00:32,357 --> 01:00:35,237
Thank you. Thank you so much.

889
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:38,747
Gosh, yes, yes.

890
01:00:38,747 --> 01:00:43,147
Do Jun, what took you so long?

891
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:48,997
Meanie, what are you doing?

892
01:00:48,997 --> 01:00:52,667
Geum Dong, Ji Yeong, and Do Jun are all here.

893
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:57,267
You should prepare a spread for them.

894
01:00:57,267 --> 01:01:02,057
You want your old mother-in-law to cook instead?

895
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:05,887
Ma'am, I'm not your daughter-in-law.

896
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:07,987
Mom, just let it go.

897
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:11,037
What do you mean, let it go?

898
01:01:11,037 --> 01:01:13,957
Let's eat meat. Do Jun brought us some. Mom, let's eat.

899
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:15,327
Mom, let's have a barbecue party.

900
01:01:15,327 --> 01:01:19,677
Yes, yes, son. Let's have a barbecue party.

901
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,967
Barbecue party!

902
01:01:33,477 --> 01:01:35,377
Yes, yes.

903
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:42,907
Eat slowly. Slowly.

904
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,467
Ahjumma.

905
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,467
Me?

906
01:01:46,467 --> 01:01:48,257
Gosh.

907
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:50,587
Thank you, Ji Yeong.

908
01:01:58,947 --> 01:02:02,317
 Yes, Do Ra is alive... 

909
01:02:02,317 --> 01:02:06,367
 Do Jun is back, and Do Shik is dependable. 

910
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:08,987
 If this isn't happiness, what is? 

911
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:12,037
 Yes, yes. Let's not get greedy anymore. 

912
01:02:12,037 --> 01:02:16,357
 We'll just live together through thick and thin. 

913
01:02:17,407 --> 01:02:20,837
- Eat, eat. 
 - Yes, let's eat.

914
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,697
Let's eat more.

915
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:26,857
Oppa, you can't eat because you're grilling.

916
01:02:26,857 --> 01:02:30,787
- It's okay. It's okay. 
 - Let me do it.

917
01:02:31,997 --> 01:02:34,847
Hey, Baek Mi Ja!

918
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,507
You thought we couldn't find you if you hid?

919
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:42,757
- Gosh, seriously! 
 - Where are you running to?

920
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:44,957
Hey, hey, hey!

921
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:47,047
Bring her safely.

922
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:50,207
Hey, what are you doing? Let go! Gosh!

923
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:54,147
Spare me! Brother, it's not like that!

924
01:02:56,157 --> 01:02:59,117
Where did the nail clipper go?

925
01:02:59,117 --> 01:03:02,647
Why does it disappear all the time?

926
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:09,717
Why does she keep the nail clipper hidden?

927
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:11,377
What's this? Gosh.

928
01:03:11,377 --> 01:03:13,897
My goodness.

929
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:20,057
What? This is a picture of a baby.

930
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,447
Is it Ma Ri as a baby?

931
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:23,347
No, it's not.

932
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:29,397
Whose picture is it that she's keeping it hidden like this?

933
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:36,817
 Soo Yeon had a baby with that man and they planned to get married, too. 

934
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:41,397
Could this be that baby? My gosh.

935
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:45,347
This baby looks a bit familiar.

936
01:03:45,347 --> 01:03:47,177
Where have I seen him?

937
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:53,667
Guys, take a close look at this picture.

938
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,867
Have you seen this baby somewhere?

939
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:57,747
What's the baby picture for all of a sudden?

940
01:03:57,747 --> 01:04:01,877
Gosh, whose baby is so cute?

941
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:07,067
Gosh, I think this is Seon Yeong's son, Pil Sung, as a baby.

942
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:08,947
Who? Pil Sung?

943
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:11,727
Yes, I think you're right.

944
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:14,997
Ae Gyo, why do you have this picture?

945
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:16,337
Huh?

946
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:24,548
   

947
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,097
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong!

948
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:33,837
Ae Gyo, please leave if you'll bring up Soo Yeon again.

949
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:36,997
I'm busy. I don't have time to chat with you.

950
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:39,497
Seon Yeong, the thing is...

951
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:41,137
Have a look at this.

952
01:04:41,137 --> 01:04:43,207
Do you remember this picture?

953
01:04:46,067 --> 01:04:47,847
Gosh, Ae Gyo.

954
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:52,207
Why do you have my Pil Sung's photo?

955
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:55,468
Seon Yeong, is this really Pil Sung?

956
01:04:55,468 --> 01:05:03,578


957
01:05:03,587 --> 01:05:06,427
   

958
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:11,427
♫  It's so tough  ♫

959
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:17,467
♫  I'd feel better if I could see you the way you are  ♫

960
01:05:17,467 --> 01:05:22,287
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

961
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:25,617
♫  The pain is unbearable  ♫

962
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:34,057
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

963
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:42,477
 I'll be generous and give you until tomorrow. Bring me 500 million won. 

964
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:44,497
 Try running away again. 

965
01:05:44,497 --> 01:05:47,677
 Your sons, Park Do Sik and Park Do Jun, won't be safe. 

966
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:51,807
 What are you to me? Why do you always ask me for money? 

967
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:55,077
 Ji Yeong, don't forget I'm always by your side. 

968
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:57,277
 Call me if you need my help anytime. 

969
01:05:57,277 --> 01:06:01,297
 Are they together again? Gosh, what am I supposed to do? 

970
01:06:01,297 --> 01:06:04,837
