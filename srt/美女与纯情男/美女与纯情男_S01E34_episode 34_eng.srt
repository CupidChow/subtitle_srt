1
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:48,910
   

2
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,810


3
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,776
Jang Soo Yeon!

4
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,306
Go Pil Sung...

5
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:06,146
Is it true he's your son?

6
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:12,400
I want...

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,426
you to tell me yourself.

8
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,606
Is Go Pil Sung...

9
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:20,636
really your son?

10
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:29,476
Yes.

11
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:31,396
He is.

12
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,096
Pil Sung is my son.

13
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,746
You little...

14
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,686
Get out!

15
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,066
Get out of my house immediately!

16
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:50,026
I was doubtful, but...

17
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,736
I didn't believe you could've done that.

18
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:59,386
How dare you had someone else's child, raised him secretly, and act like the madam of this house?

19
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,656
How dare you fool us?

20
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,126
How dare you fool Chairman Gong?

21
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,486
You awful bitch.

22
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:09,746
Hey, Jang Soo Yeon, you're really something.

23
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:15,326
How could you keep Pil Sung by your side and fool us all with that innocent face...

24
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:18,056
for 30 years, not just a few days?

25
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:21,266
You started Go Go Entertainment to give it to your son, right?

26
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,556
You wanted to give all of the family's money to him little by little.

27
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:26,566
My gosh, you're so scary.

28
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,646
How dare you pretend to be human?

29
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:31,516
There's no need to say all that.

30
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:35,546
I can't live in the same house with her for even a minute or second.

31
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:38,696
Get out immediately. Get out!

32
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:41,636
- Get out now. 
 - Why are you doing this to my mom?

33
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,866
What right do you have to tell her to leave?

34
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:48,156
Hey, Gong Ma Ri. You knew Pil Sung was your brother, too, right?

35
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,256
That's why you defended him when he and Jin Dan were fighting.

36
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:56,186
Your mom got caught lying to us all this time, okay?

37
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:01,486
Mr. Kim! Where's Mr. Kim?

38
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,756
Yeojudaek! Mr. Kim!

39
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:06,186
Get Soo Yeon out of here.

40
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,366
Kick her out immediately!

41
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:14,546
What are you all doing?

42
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:16,946
- Yes. 
 - Get her out immediately.

43
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,980
I'm sorry, ma'am.

44
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,980
Ma'am...

45
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,916
- Mom! 
 - Ma Ri...

46
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,396
Ma Ri, Ma Ri. No, go upstairs.

47
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,646
Dad, did you tell Mom to leave? No, right?

48
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:54,446
Great Aunt was lying, right?

49
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,526
No, Dad.

50
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:00,956
Don't kick her out.

51
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:05,566
When I first heard about Pil Sung, I couldn't forgive her, either.

52
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,980
I hated her so much.

53
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:11,316
Gong Ma Ri.

54
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,276
You knew, too?

55
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,576
Yes.

56
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,616
Mom said she felt so guilty toward you.

57
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,316
Very, very much.

58
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,606
That's why she couldn't tell you.

59
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:29,936
Dad, it's true Mom did the wrong thing, but I have a good brother.

60
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,246
That's why I no longer hate her.

61
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:35,486
Could you please think that way, too?

62
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,076
Did you...

63
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,646
Did you lie to me, too?

64
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:43,906
No, Dad, I wasn't trying to lie to you.

65
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:48,156
I was afraid you'd get this angry, and Mom would get kicked out.

66
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:52,656
- I was too scared to tell you. 
 - Gong Ma Ri...

67
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:55,146
Dad, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:59,526
But could you please forgive Mom just once?

69
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:01,976
You said you loved her.

70
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:05,896
You and I can't be without Mom.

71
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,866
Gong Ma Ri...

72
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,006
listen carefully.

73
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,396
I cannot...

74
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,346
live with your mom.

75
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:22,676
Okay.

76
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:25,116
I'll live with Mom, then.

77
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,596
I'll go to her.

78
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,576
Yeojudaek!

79
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:33,626
Secretary Kim!

80
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:52,576
- You confirmed the payment I sent, right? 
 - Yes, yes! I did.

81
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:56,876
By the way, I did a thorough research on you.

82
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:59,556
You had no money. Not even a penny.

83
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:03,836
Where did you get 500 million all of a sudden?

84
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,626
Stop talking and give me the receipt.

85
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,566
Receipt?

86
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:13,516
The record on the bank book is a receipt.

87
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:16,536
Give me one. I'm still demanding one.

88
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:19,546
Aigoo. Okay, got it.

89
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,326
I should give it to you, then.

90
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:23,866
Wait a moment.

91
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,916
Come back anytime if you need money again.

92
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,116
Mind your business, and you live it up, you money-obsessed bastards.

93
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,536
Are you leaving now?

94
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,336
Yes.

95
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,820
Ji Yeong, thank you.

96
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,270
Thank you so much.

97
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:10,780
Don't mention it.

98
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,200
Please take good care of my grandma.

99
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,656
Okay. Don't worry about her.

100
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:19,580
Ji Yeong, I really

101
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,160
want you and CEO Gong to work out.

102
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,586
Ji Yeong, are you going somewhere?

103
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:29,916
I'll come, too. Let me come with you.

104
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,896
Grandma, you're hanging out with me today.

105
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,096
Get out of the way.

106
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,896
I don't want to hang out with you.

107
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,736
Take me with you.

108
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:41,806
Grandma, you can't come today.

109
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:43,826
I need to do something very important.

110
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:47,466
Behave yourself and stay with Ahjumma.

111
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,396
I'll be back soon, okay?

112
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:52,116
I said I don't want to hang out with her.

113
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:55,166
Grandma, you know Go Stop, right? Go Stop.

114
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,736
It's a really fun game.

115
00:07:57,736 --> 00:08:00,756
I'll teach you how to play it, okay?

116
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,736
Have a seat. Have a seat here.

117
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:03,856
- Go Stop? 
 - Yes.

118
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:07,276
- I know how to play it, too. 
 - Let's play it, the two of us, okay?

119
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:09,806
We're playing Go Stop.

120
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:13,976
- Let's play right now. 
 - Okay, okay.

121
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:16,836
Look. You do it like this.

122
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:19,596
You shuffle them well like this, okay?

123
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:22,766
After shuffling them...

124
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,696
 What? Is that really Ji Yeong? 

125
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:38,086
 Wow, how come she's so pretty? 

126
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,366
Welcome, Ji Yeong.

127
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,336
I tried to come early.

128
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:55,816
Did you wait long?

129
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:57,976
No, no. Not at all.

130
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:02,746
I came earlier because I was excited to see you.

131
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:07,626
Have a seat, Ji Yeong.

132
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,916
Daebak, Kim Tae Hee!

133
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,326
You look like a goddess in wedding dresses.

134
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,926
Jin Dan took all of these photos.

135
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,256
Gosh, I'm jealous of you, girl.

136
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:32,726
By the way, when is the wedding?

137
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:35,126
Right after the engagement ceremony, I think.

138
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:38,636
I want to get married quickly and become his wife.

139
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:40,576
I want to have a child soon, too.

140
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:43,106
Tell Jin Dan to join us.

141
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,996
Should I? Just one moment.

142
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:57,436
Is he busy? He won't answer.

143
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:00,966
Shouldn't he answer your call, no matter how busy he is?

144
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,886
I know. My boyfriend wakes up to answer my calls at night.

145
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:07,166
He must be busy.

146
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:24,036
Ji Yeong, today was our first date.

147
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:27,626
- What did you think? 
 - Pardon?

148
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,720
I'm asking if you liked it.

149
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,870
I did.

150
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,876
Yes, I liked it, too.

151
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:39,796
We had tasty food and watched a movie.

152
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:42,630
- It was nice. 
 - Yes.

153
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,040
Ji Yeong, you're my girlfriend now.

154
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,740
You know, right?

155
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,416
Yes.

156
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,636
- I know. 
 - Okay.

157
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,156
See you tomorrow, then. I'll call you.

158
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,806
Okay.

159
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:02,696
Get home safely.

160
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,766
Yes, Kim Ji Yeong.

161
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:27,166
CEO Gong is my boyfriend from now on.

162
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:33,026
To me, CEO Gong is someone I'm very grateful to...

163
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:42,016
for saving my mom, oppa, and little brother.

164
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,106
So from now on, I should...

165
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,706
truly love him.

166
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,726
Okay, Kim Ji Yeong?

167
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:02,586
Okay, Kim Ji Yeong?

168
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,676
Ji Yeong, what did you two do today?

169
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:20,056
Did he take you somewhere nice?

170
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:25,246
We had pasta at a restaurant and had tea.

171
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:29,286
Meanie, take this!

172
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:33,056
Ji Yeong came back from work.

173
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,366
Why aren't you making dinner?

174
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:40,086
Make dumplings right now. Make a hundred of them.

175
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,816
- Hundred dumplings? 
 - Grandma...

176
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:45,756
All right, then. I'll do anything.

177
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,486
I'm willing to do anything.

178
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:53,746
Did she eat rat poison? Why is she being so nice?

179
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,946
I'm home.

180
00:12:55,946 --> 00:13:00,396
- Welcome home. 
 - Geum Dong, you're back. My baby.

181
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,636
Have you been well, Mom? What did you do today?

182
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:07,486
I played Go Stop with her.

183
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:11,756
By the way, she took 1,500 won from me.

184
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:13,526
She's really vicious.

185
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,666
- What? She took all of your money? 
 - Yes.

186
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,926
Give it back. Give the 1,500 won back.

187
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:23,846
- You little. I lost it! I lost all of the 1,500 won. 
 - Oh, my.

188
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,696
- Okay, okay! Mom, Mom... 
 - How dare you try to hit him?

189
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,356
My gosh, you're always using her.

190
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,516
Gosh, Mom, hold it, hold it. Okay, okay.

191
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,536
I'll let it out on you...

192
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:38,336
- Come here. Come here. 
 - Okay, okay.

193
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,166
What are you talking about?

194
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,986
Soo Yeon had a secret illegitimate son,

195
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:49,226
and he was Director Go Pil Sung from her company, Go Go Entertainment?

196
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,766
That Go Pil Sung, whom I know?

197
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:55,406
Yes. But I revealed all of her dirty secrets.

198
00:13:55,406 --> 00:14:00,806
Your brother kicked her out and... he kept Ma Ri in her room so she couldn't join her.

199
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,526
It's a big mess right now.

200
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,456
Go Pil Sung...

201
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:07,746
Go Pil Sung is Soo Yeon's hidden son?

202
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,286
No way.

203
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,556
Is this for real?

204
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,376
I'm telling you.

205
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:16,106
She's been fooling Chairman Gong and all of us. How could she?

206
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,126
People are the scariest.

207
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:24,396
You should've seen Aunt slapping her face.

208
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,116
Aunt slapped her face?

209
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,326
That's not even a big deal right now.

210
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,506
She deserves to be stoned.

211
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,586
Anyway, you need to get your act together.

212
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:38,836
The fact that she started Go Go Entertainment and hired Go Pil Sung

213
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,026
must mean she's been planning this for a long time.

214
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:46,466
She's afraid you'd become the successor instead of Ma Ri because she's slow.

215
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:50,606
That's why she put Pil Sung next to her so she could take the entire APP Group.

216
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,086
Who says? Who does she think she is?

217
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:56,516
Anyway, your brother is in shock right now.

218
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,986
Aunt is sick in bed, too.

219
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:02,216
Gosh, what's going on?

220
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,346
Go Pil Sung. I wondered why he was so cheeky.

221
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,916
It was because Soo Yeon had his back?

222
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,426
Seriously. What's with that Go Pil Sung?

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,846
He lurked around Park Do Ra, now, Kim Ji Yeong,

224
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:29,066
and he wanted our family and company, too?

225
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,836
I can't just let him be.

226
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,456
I need to destroy him from the start.

227
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,086
Mom, why won't you answer?

228
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,966
Ma Ri!

229
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,106
You must want to get out.

230
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,466
But try to wait a bit longer.

231
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,516
Do Jun, I need to go to Mom now.

232
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,856
She won't even answer my call.

233
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,916
Help me, please?

234
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,786
Ma Ri, I'd like to do anything for you.

235
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,296
But it's the Chairman's order. I have no choice.

236
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:32,006
I don't know what's going on but wait in the room for now.

237
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,616
Please, Ma Ri.

238
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:37,256
Hey, Park Do Jun! I can't reach my mom right now.

239
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:40,446
I need to find out where she is!

240
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,016
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,186
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

242
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:48,626
There's still nothing I can do.

243
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:52,566
Mr. Kim and Yeojudaek are standing guard downstairs, too.

244
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,356
I don't think I'd be able to help you.

245
00:16:56,706 --> 00:17:00,936
Do Jun, what do I do with my mom?

246
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,256
She's probably okay, right?

247
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,106
She'd call me, right?

248
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:08,086
Of course, she will.

249
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:11,426
She'll definitely call you. Don't worry.

250
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,166
Nothing is going to happen.

251
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,316
Yes, I'm sure.

252
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:21,696
Nothing will happen to her.

253
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:28,656
The grapes are nice and ripe.

254
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:31,476
- The melon is small but tasty, too. 
 - It is.

255
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:34,186
Hold on. Ma Ri is calling me.

256
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:41,996
Hello?

257
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,856
Ma Ri, what made you call at this hour?

258
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,996
Grandma, my mom got kicked out.

259
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:50,696
So I called Oppa, but he won't answer. That's why I'm calling you.

260
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,476
Grandma, where's Oppa right now?

261
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:57,256
M-Ma Ri, what do you mean your mom got kicked out...

262
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:00,416
W-What are you talking about?

263
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,796
Dad found out Oppa is Mom's son.

264
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:07,516
That's why he told her to leave.

265
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:10,066
Y-Your dad found out?

266
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,306
A-And she got kicked out?

267
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:17,866
 Yes, but she can't be reached right now. I'm so scared. 

268
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:22,806
 I want to look for her, but I can't leave my room. 

269
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:27,796
My goodness, Ma Ri. What do we do?

270
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,976
Who's that? Is something going on?

271
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,086
Chairman Gong found out you're Soo Yeon's son.

272
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,656
She got kicked out of the house.

273
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,086
Pardon?

274
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:47,876
Ma Ri just called me because her mom went missing, and she couldn't reach you.

275
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,506
Let me talk to her, Grandma.

276
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,226
Yes, hold on.

277
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,516
Ma Ri, wait just a moment.

278
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,726
Yes, Ma Ri. It's Oppa.

279
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,116
I'm sorry I missed your call.

280
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,736
Don't cry, Ma Ri. I'm sure she's okay.

281
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:08,526
I'm sure she'll call you.

282
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:12,756
Of course. So don't worry and stop crying.

283
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:16,446
Yes, let me know if you hear from her.

284
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,586
Okay, I'll hang up.

285
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,986
Yes, they say there's no secret in this world.

286
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:29,976
I expected they'd find out eventually.

287
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,556
But so suddenly, in the middle of the night...

288
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,426
What are we going to do about this?

289
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:42,706
I wonder if we should try calling Ma Ri's mom.

290
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,456
Seriously, how upsetting.

291
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:47,646
Mom, why would we call her?

292
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,936
Why should we worry about her?

293
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:55,396
Thinking about what she's done to us makes me so angry.

294
00:19:55,396 --> 00:20:00,006
Honey, you'd better not soften up and try calling her, okay?

295
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,376
Why would I call her?

296
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:06,466
I have no interest in getting involved in another family's business.

297
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,156
Why should I care what happens?

298
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:16,866
Gosh, seriously! Ma Ri is so worried right now.

299
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:22,206
That woman should answer her calls even if she got kicked out.

300
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,256
Mom, where are you right now? Why didn't you answer my calls?

301
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:36,486
I was worried you passed out after you left.

302
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:40,416
Do you know how worried I was that something might've happened to you?

303
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,806
Ma Ri, I'm okay. I'm really okay.

304
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:45,286
Don't worry about me.

305
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,486
 Mom, where are you right now? 

306
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:49,546
I want to be where you are.

307
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:51,926
I want to be by your side.

308
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,756
But Dad won't let me leave.

309
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:57,856
I hate him so much.

310
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,016
Ma Ri, listen to him for now.

311
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,656
He's already upset because of me.

312
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:05,236
You don't want to give him a hard time, too.

313
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:08,396
I know you miss me but wait a bit longer.

314
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,146
I'll call you when things get sorted out.

315
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,786
You mean it, right?

316
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:18,776
You won't go somewhere far away without me, right?

317
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,126
What are you talking about?

318
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:26,836
I'll never leave you behind and go somewhere.

319
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,876
So don't cry. Don't worry about me, either.

320
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,536
You really promise me, right?

321
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,656
Of course.

322
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:43,906
So promise to eat well and be well, okay?

323
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,696
Be strong, okay?

324
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:47,676
Okay, I promise.

325
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:49,786
You should eat well, too.

326
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,996
 Don't get sick. 

327
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:53,716
Okay.

328
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,194
What did you say? You talked to Mom on the phone?

329
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:11,923
Yes.

330
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,130
Is she okay?

331
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,390
That's a relief.

332
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,630
Stop worrying and go to sleep, Ma Ri.

333
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,830
Yes, feel free to call me anytime.

334
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,200
Okay, bye.

335
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,190
Was that Ma Ri?

336
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,290
Well, yes.

337
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,470
CEO Jang said she'd call her when things get sorted out.

338
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,050
She told her not to worry since she was okay.

339
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,500
Really?

340
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,030
Gosh, that's a relief.

341
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,870
Try calling Ma Ri's mom if you're worried about her, too.

342
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,930
It's okay. Why would I?

343
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,240
It's okay since she called Ma Ri.

344
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,520
Yes.

345
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,370
Have some fruit here.

346
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,300
Thank you, Mom.

347
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,550
Aigoo, you're working so hard these days.

348
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,850
People might think you make all the TV dramas in Korea.

349
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,730
Don't overdo it.

350
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,260
Okay, Mom. I'm managing things all right. Don't worry.

351
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,840
Okay. Get some rest. I'll be downstairs.

352
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,770
- You, too. 
 - Okay.

353
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,950
   

354
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,300
   

355
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,510
Chairman, Madam Jang is here.

356
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,710
Let her in.

357
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,440
We don't need tea.

358
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,470
You can wait outside.

359
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,210
I'm sure you have nothing to say.

360
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,300
What made you come all the way here?

361
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm sorry, Honey.

362
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,890
I've wronged you greatly.

363
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,970
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,210
You're sorry?

365
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,300
I've trusted you all this time.

366
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,100
I only loved you.

367
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:29,120
I thought we loved and trusted each other as a couple.

368
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,220
But you've had another man's son in your heart

369
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,640
and you've been watching him all this time.

370
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,110
What have you been thinking by my side?

371
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,550
What was I to you?

372
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,130
Was I just an empty shell?

373
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,370
No.

374
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,810
That's not true at all.

375
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,950
I cherished our family, too...

376
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,720
and I only loved you.

377
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,430
This is the truth.

378
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,270
- Please believe me. 
 - Believe you?

379
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,740
You deceived me... and you longed for another man's son.

380
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,480
But you loved me?

381
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,070
You didn't love me.

382
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,300
You must've pretended because you felt bad.

383
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,760
Let me ask you one thing.

384
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,880
Until when were you going to deceive me?

385
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,870
Until I was dead and buried?

386
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,470
What were you thinking while fooling me all this time?

387
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,590
I've tried to tell you...

388
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,840
countless times.

389
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,820
But...

390
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,370
But I didn't want you to be disappointed and hurt.

391
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,780
I tried many times, but I couldn't.

392
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,320
But Pil Sung found out recently.

393
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,500
So I tried to tell you and ask for forgiveness, but you ended up finding out this way.

394
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,200
Honey,

395
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,520
I know it's shameless to tell you this now,

396
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,490
but I loved you...

397
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,200
and relied on you a lot.

398
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,410
There's no use shedding tears in front of me anymore.

399
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,590
While studying in the US...

400
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,550
I met Pil Sung's father.

401
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,920
But he ended up dying...

402
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,930
from a hiking accident.

403
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,950
It hurt so much, and I felt hopeless,

404
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,380
but I returned to Korea and...

405
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,860
ended up meeting you...

406
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,540
through my father.

407
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,930
Yes.

408
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,000
I didn't love you from the beginning.

409
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,680
But because of you,

410
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,310
I was able to move on from my painful past

411
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,390
and I started loving you, then.

412
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,870
I really... had no idea

413
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,000
I was pregnant with his child.

414
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,590
A little while after I met you,

415
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,300
when you were sent to a branch abroad,

416
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,220
I...

417
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,290
I gave birth to him then.

418
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,410
I should've...

419
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,860
told you everything then.

420
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,220
I don't know why I couldn't be honest with you then.

421
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,170
I regretted it for over 30 years.

422
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,490
I've been... regretting it...

423
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,620
but I ended up here without being able to tell you.

424
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,570
Honey,

425
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,610
I'm so sorry.

426
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,290
I really didn't want to hurt you.

427
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,950
How could you say that now?

428
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,550
And you made Ma Ri deceive me, too?

429
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:04,540
My daughter, Ma Ri, was hurt and cried because of your past.

430
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,740
You even made her lie to hide it.

431
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,430
I could never forgive you.

432
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,450
Never.

433
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,260
I'll...

434
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,620
leave everything up to you.

435
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,440
Everything.

436
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,930
I'll send Attorney Kang.

437
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,150
Let's end this quietly.

438
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,860
I don't want to see you anymore.

439
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,700
Get out now.

440
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,580
I'm sorry.

441
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll accept any punishment...

442
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,950
for what I've done to you.

443
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,900
Please...

444
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,300
be healthy, Honey.

445
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,780
What?

446
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,980
You left the storyboard book on the desk?

447
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,420
Okay, I'll get it for you.

448
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,740
You owe me one, okay?

449
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,060
- Okay. 
 - What is it?

450
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,540
Did Pil Sung leave something?

451
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,390
Yes, he left the storyboard book.

452
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,420
But he has no time to stop by.

453
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,800
He asked me to bring it to his office.

454
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm busy these days, too.

455
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,520
- I'll go, then. 
 - Really?

456
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,880
911. 911. Are we calling 911?

457
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,080
Shouldn't we call 911? My gosh.

458
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,400
What do we do?

459
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,240
This is urgent.

460
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,930
President Jang!

461
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,890
President Jang...

462
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,450
President Jang.

463
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,890
President Jang!

464
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,210
Wake up. President Jang!

465
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,990
 One, two, three! 

466
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,440
 Well done, everyone. 

467
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,330
 - Dae Chung. 
 - Ahjumma. 

468
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,420
 Congratulations on your graduation. 

469
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,730
 Thank you, Ahjumma. 

470
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,690
 I'm so proud of you, Dae Chung. 

471
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,110
 You're going to a good school, and you turned out so well. 

472
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,070
 I'm so happy for you. 

473
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:45,100
 Gosh, it's a large size, and you're big enough already. 

474
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,320
 You grew a lot, Dae Chung. 

475
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,810
 Ahjumma, I really appreciate it. 

476
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,600
 I'll become successful and return the favor. 

477
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,560
 It's nothing. Don't worry about it. 

478
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,070
Hello?

479
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,630
Chairman, this is Go Pil Sung.

480
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,980
What's this about?

481
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,930
 President Jang passed out in front of the office. 

482
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,800
 So, I brought her to the hospital, but she's still unconscious. 

483
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,240
I think you need to come, Chairman.

484
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,020
I...

485
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,670
have nothing to do with that woman.

486
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,540
 Don't call me about stuff like this anymore. 

487
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,950
Pil Sung.

488
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,480
M-Mom, how did you know I was here?

489
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,930
I went to your office to bring you the storyboard book,

490
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,310
and I heard Soo Yeon... I mean...

491
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,110
Ma Ri's mom passed out and was sent to the hospital.

492
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,230
Is she okay?

493
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,840
The doctor said she was okay, but she is still unconscious.

494
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,100
You should leave now, Pil Sung.

495
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,560
I'll stay here.

496
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,550
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,690
Why would you apologize?

498
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,070
I'm okay.

499
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,410
You said you have a shoot. Go now.

500
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,870
I'm really okay.

501
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,970
Get going.

502
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,850
Don't worry about her.

503
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,990
Okay. Call me if anything happens.

504
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,650
Okay.

505
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:26,259
Seon Yeong,

506
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:30,229
w-what brings you here?

507
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:36,529
You had to pass out in front of Pil Sung, out of all people.

508
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:42,636
He found you passed out in the lobby and brought you here.

509
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:45,816
He did?

510
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:47,936
Yes.

511
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:50,516
He called your husband...

512
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:57,156
Chairman Gong, but... he said he couldn't come, I suppose.

513
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:02,726
So he's been staying here... and left for a shoot just now.

514
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:07,516
That's why I had no choice but to be here.

515
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:10,826
I'm sorry.

516
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,726
Do you even mean it?

517
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,116
How could you put us in this mess?

518
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,126
Look at you...

519
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:22,736
Look at you right now.

520
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:27,916
Because of what you did, Ma Ri called us last night

521
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:31,716
and cried about you going missing.

522
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:35,056
And Pil Sung got upset because of her.

523
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:39,376
You kept the entire family up all night, too.

524
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:43,546
How could you cause so much trouble?

525
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,646
I'm sorry.

526
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:50,716
I'm sorry, Seon Yeong.

527
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:54,616
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

528
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:58,816
I'm sick of hearing you say that now.

529
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:03,796
I have no choice but to be here because of Pil Sung,

530
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:08,466
but I even hate to hear you breathe.

531
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,426
Yes.

532
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:13,986
Yes. Of course, you do.

533
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:18,606
No matter how much you hate me, I have nothing to say.

534
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:20,676
But Seon Yeong,

535
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:26,196
it's been very difficult for me, too.

536
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:32,286
Fooling everyone wasn't easy for me, either.

537
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:39,156
I loved seeing you, but I always felt guilty toward you.

538
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:45,086
But...

539
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:49,796
now that everything is out in the open,

540
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:55,516
I actually feel relieved.

541
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:58,106
What?

542
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:00,306
Relieved?

543
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:05,346
I feel so betrayed by you that...

544
00:41:05,346 --> 00:41:08,806
my heart feels so heavy.

545
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:10,746
But you feel relieved?

546
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:14,246
I will accept any punishment from you.

547
00:41:14,246 --> 00:41:17,370
You can hit me until you feel better.

548
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,286
Hit me as much as you want, Seon Yeong.

549
00:41:20,286 --> 00:41:23,976
I will beg for your...

550
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:27,966
forgiveness until I die.

551
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,570
But...

552
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,600
my husband must feel much pain just like you.

553
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,136
What's he going to do?

554
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:41,026
And what about my Ma Ri?

555
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:43,966
I hurt...

556
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:48,436
the people who trusted and loved me.

557
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:50,646
I can't...

558
00:41:51,346 --> 00:41:53,726
forgive myself for that.

559
00:42:06,236 --> 00:42:08,766
   

560
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:14,776
How upsetting.

561
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:18,636
I talked to Ma Ri earlier over the phone.

562
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,326
She was crying and freaking out.

563
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:26,336
She cried and asked her dad to forgive her mom,

564
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,756
but he won't budge.

565
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:32,466
I suppose they're getting divorced.

566
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,396
- What if they actually do? 
 - What do you mean?

567
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:38,486
She deserves to get divorced.

568
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:40,806
You reap what you sow.

569
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,196
I know.

570
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:45,126
I just feel sorry for Ma Ri.

571
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:50,906
It's Seon Yeong.

572
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:53,956
Yes, Seon Yeong.

573
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:56,546
What? H-Hospital?

574
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:58,486
What are you doing there?

575
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:00,936
Jang Soo Yeon is really unbelievable.

576
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:03,856
She looked down on me, acting superior.

577
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:09,426
But she abandoned her illegitimate son with her friend and she's been deceiving us.

578
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:11,916
What a joke. Seriously.

579
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,086
That looks like Sang Gu.

580
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,886
I must be crazy.

581
00:43:23,886 --> 00:43:27,686
He's in the Philippines. Why would he be here?

582
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:30,826
Have I not gotten over him yet?

583
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:36,246
Why think of a man who's happily married to another woman?

584
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:40,206
   

585
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:51,306
Have you eaten?

586
00:43:51,306 --> 00:43:52,436
What?

587
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:56,476
Go Pil Sung, that bastard. Why is he still here?

588
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,016
What's going on?

589
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:11,076
Will you let Go Pil Sung stay at the company?

590
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,476
Soo Yeon hired him at the company and fooled us all.

591
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:18,176
Aren't you angry?

592
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:21,836
What if the rumor spreads? How would that make us look?

593
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:24,676
Please leave if that's all you have to say.

594
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:26,506
I'll do it if you can't.

595
00:44:26,506 --> 00:44:28,126
I'll take care of everything.

596
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:31,876
Gong Jin Dan! Stay out of this!

597
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,516
   

598
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,786
We have a shoot here today.

599
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,306
What? No?

600
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:48,886
Director.

601
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,186
What's going on? We need to shoot.

602
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:56,596
No one can go in here.

603
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,076
What are you talking about?

604
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:01,576
This is our studio. Please move.

605
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,906
What? What's going on?

606
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:06,686
Why won't they let us shoot?

607
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,856
Okay. Director Go has been dismissed as of today.

608
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:17,576
The shoot will resume after the director is replaced.

609
00:45:17,576 --> 00:45:19,246
Keep that in mind.

610
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:21,836
Replace the director?

611
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:24,056
Says who?

612
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:25,846
What are you talking about right now?

613
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:27,576
Director Go,

614
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,286
talk to me for a moment.

615
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:46,556
Director Go, pack up and leave Go Go Entertainment immediately.

616
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:50,586
The shoot can't continue until you leave.

617
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:53,646
What reason do you have to fire me?

618
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:56,766
I can't leave unless you provide a just reason.

619
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,886
Do you really not know or are you playing ignorant?

620
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:09,156
You're Jang Soo Yeon's illegitimate son.

621
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,006
Is that why?

622
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:18,156
Wow, I've been so curious all this time.

623
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:22,946
Why did Soo Yeon pay you a large sum to hire you?

624
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,016
It was really shocking.

625
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:29,616
She hired you just because you're her son she's been keeping a secret.

626
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,566
Isn't that enough of a reason to fire you?

627
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:38,376
I can't leave if that's the reason.

628
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:41,936
I don't know what right you have,

629
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:46,710
but I can't leave until we finish House of Roses.

630
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,856
Seriously.

631
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,276
I tried to be nice and let you leave gracefully,

632
00:46:55,276 --> 00:46:57,586
but looks like you want to be dragged out.

633
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,936
Fine, I'll make that happen.

634
00:47:18,556 --> 00:47:22,016
They're replacing the director when we're premiering the day after tomorrow?

635
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:23,636
They won't let us enter the set.

636
00:47:23,636 --> 00:47:26,696
Do they think using force works in this day and age?

637
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:30,486
Chief, please explain what's going on.

638
00:47:30,486 --> 00:47:32,206
Where's President Jang right now?

639
00:47:32,206 --> 00:47:34,816
Was this her idea?

640
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:40,576
No, she passed out, and she's at a hospital now.

641
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:46,106
Is that President Gong Jin Dan person doing this, then?

642
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:50,606
I understand he's a stockholder, but what gives him the right to do this?

643
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,736
So what if he's the heir of APP Group?

644
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,876
And Jang Soo Yeon is the President of Go Go Entertainment.

645
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,126
How dare he tell us what to do?

646
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:01,366
Why would he fire a director who's doing a good job?

647
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:04,476
Did Director Go embezzle the production money or something?

648
00:48:04,476 --> 00:48:08,016
N-No, of course not.

649
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,886
The thing is...

650
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,556
What is it, exactly? Be honest with us.

651
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,776
We need to know the reason to come up with a solution.

652
00:48:16,776 --> 00:48:19,506
What if we can't air in time?

653
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,086
Director Go...

654
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:26,396
is President Jang's illegitimate son.

655
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,666
Pardon? W-What...

656
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,216
What did you say? What's he talking about?

657
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:38,196
Chief, what do you mean?

658
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:41,806
I was on a video call with Director Go's mom.

659
00:48:41,806 --> 00:48:43,666
Who's she, then?

660
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:46,426
I suppose she raised him.

661
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:50,836
There was a secret regarding Director Go's birth.

662
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:52,806
President Jang passed out because that was revealed.

663
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:57,586
Rumor has it that she'd get divorced and fired as CEO soon.

664
00:48:57,586 --> 00:49:00,496
Wow, this is crazy.

665
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:02,186
Gosh, I don't know!

666
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:05,686
Crazy or not, that's their family's business.

667
00:49:05,686 --> 00:49:07,656
We still need to air the drama.

668
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:09,936
We promised the viewers we would air the drama.

669
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:13,126
What will happen to the drama if we replace the director now?

670
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:17,316
I suppose you're right. We need to finish the drama. Yes.

671
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:19,896
Let them take care of the family business.

672
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:24,266
And I won't release the script if that's why they're firing Director Go.

673
00:49:24,266 --> 00:49:26,656
Chief, relay my message clearly.

674
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:30,506
If they replace the director, I'm quitting.

675
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:32,906
I'll quit if he gets replaced, too.

676
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:34,926
I came here because of him.

677
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:38,896
I'd have no reason to stay here without him.

678
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:42,466
Chief, call President Jang and check her condition.

679
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:45,886
Tell her to come in and take care of this problem.

680
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,696
You must be busy running the restaurant, but you made me porridge?

681
00:49:51,696 --> 00:49:53,336
Eat it.

682
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,946
I didn't make it because I like you.

683
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:59,736
I did it so Pil Sung won't have to worry.

684
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:04,136
Pil Sung would worry if you stay in bed like this.

685
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,966
Eat it, get your health back, and go on your way.

686
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,686
Thank you.

687
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,636
I'll eat it later.

688
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:21,196
Eat it now.

689
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:22,610
Go ahead.

690
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,420
That way, I can leave, too.

691
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:28,226
I'll wait until you finish it.

692
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,696
Okay, I'll eat.

693
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,056
   

694
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,446
Yes, Chief Yun.

695
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,406
What did you say?

696
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:12,326
Director Go?

697
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:21,346
President Jang, what's going on?

698
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:23,586
Did Chairman Gong really do this?

699
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:27,066
How could they not let us shoot a show that is about to air?

700
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:30,056
And why would they fire a director who's doing a good job?

701
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:33,456
I've been in this field for over 20 years, but I've never experienced this.

702
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:35,976
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

703
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:38,496
I'll take care of this soon.

704
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,276
Director Go, let's talk for a moment.

705
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,956
You must be very shocked.

706
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:53,346
Are you feeling okay?

707
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:56,026
Yes, I'm okay.

708
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:59,376
Director Go, I'm sorry.

709
00:51:59,376 --> 00:52:01,266
It's my fault things ended up this way.

710
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:03,826
I'll take care of it, no matter what.

711
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:07,196
Did Chairman Gong order this?

712
00:52:07,196 --> 00:52:08,956
If so, I'll talk to him.

713
00:52:08,956 --> 00:52:11,926
The drama is airing the day after tomorrow. This isn't right.

714
00:52:11,926 --> 00:52:15,716
Director Go, you can't do that.

715
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,136
You shouldn't get involved in this.

716
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,356
You know what I mean, right?

717
00:52:20,356 --> 00:52:21,666
Let me fix this.

718
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,946
I'll take care of things and let you know.

719
00:52:39,596 --> 00:52:44,116
Today's shoot has been canceled.

720
00:52:44,116 --> 00:52:49,586
I'll get this resolved, reschedule the shoot, and let you know.

721
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:53,536
Director Go, we're all on your side.

722
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,056
Cheer up.

723
00:52:55,056 --> 00:53:00,086
Tell Chairman Gong Jin Taek I won't write if they replace you.

724
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:02,216
Director Go, cheer up.

725
00:53:02,216 --> 00:53:05,786
Should we say "Fighting" for Director Go?

726
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,216
Director Go,

727
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:09,356
 Fighting! 

728
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,766
Fighting!

729
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:13,146
Let's go!

730
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:18,676
Fighting.

731
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,986
How could you do this?

732
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:27,516
What's this now?

733
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:31,206
Don't barge in here without my permission.

734
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:35,116
Honey, I know you hate me,

735
00:53:35,116 --> 00:53:37,876
but how could you close the set?

736
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:42,966
The director, writer, many staff members, and actors are working hard right now!

737
00:53:45,326 --> 00:53:48,096
Do you really not know why?

738
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:51,486
You've been fooling me and lying to me all this time.

739
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:54,706
And you hired your illegitimate son for the job.

740
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:57,226
Did you think I'd just ignore it?

741
00:53:57,226 --> 00:53:59,226
- Honey. 
 - Honey?

742
00:53:59,226 --> 00:54:01,526
Don't call me that anymore.

743
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:09,046
I don't expect you to forgive me at all.

744
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:12,646
I indeed did something unforgivable to you.

745
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:16,496
But Pil Sung didn't know anything. He's innocent.

746
00:54:16,496 --> 00:54:19,136
I hired him when he was doing well at the broadcasting station.

747
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:22,306
It was my greed. It's all my fault. My fault!

748
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:25,636
Why would you let other people suffer when it's my fault?

749
00:54:25,636 --> 00:54:29,576
Honey, please let them use the set.

750
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:30,926
I beg you.

751
00:54:30,926 --> 00:54:32,626
The drama is airing soon.

752
00:54:32,626 --> 00:54:35,726
How could you do this at this point?

753
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:39,246
Tell Go Pil Sung to leave.

754
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:42,446
I'll let them use the set, then.

755
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:48,246
The drama can go on without Go Pil Sung.

756
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:49,986
I told you.

757
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,676
My Pil Sung did nothing wrong.

758
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:54,436
Why are you doing this? Why?

759
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:57,826
"My Pil Sung"?

760
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:00,936
Secretary Kim!

761
00:55:00,936 --> 00:55:02,616
Secretary Kim!

762
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,666
- Yes, Chairman. 
 - Get this woman out immediately.

763
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:07,096
Don't let her in my office again.

764
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,026
Honey, Honey, Honey! Hold on, Honey!

765
00:55:10,026 --> 00:55:12,956
Don't do this to Pil Sung. Leave him alone!

766
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:14,966
Throw rocks at me instead!

767
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:16,336
Hold on, let go.

768
00:55:16,336 --> 00:55:17,636
Secretary Kim, what are you doing?

769
00:55:17,636 --> 00:55:19,446
I'm sorry, Madam. Please leave.

770
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:25,516
Honey, please don't mess up Pil Sung. Please...

771
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:39,346
Looks like Chairman Gong will definitely divorce Soo Yeon.

772
00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:42,246
What would happen if they get divorced?

773
00:55:42,246 --> 00:55:45,746
What if he gets a new woman and has a baby?

774
00:55:45,746 --> 00:55:48,696
Gosh, what a headache.

775
00:55:48,696 --> 00:55:51,136
Maybe I should've played ignorant.

776
00:55:51,136 --> 00:55:54,356
Gosh, no. How could I let that slide?

777
00:55:54,356 --> 00:55:59,236
How dare she get her illegitimate son involved in the family?

778
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:01,976
Gosh, what a scary bitch.

779
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:07,076
Who's this?

780
00:56:09,156 --> 00:56:10,816
Hello?

781
00:56:10,816 --> 00:56:13,396
 It's me, Ae Gyo. 

782
00:56:14,986 --> 00:56:17,266
S-S-Sang Gu?

783
00:56:30,906 --> 00:56:33,236
Long time no see.

784
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:36,956
Yes, long time no see.

785
00:57:19,886 --> 00:57:21,746
Director.

786
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:28,636
Ji Yeong.

787
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:32,236
Why did you stay here so late?

788
00:57:38,936 --> 00:57:42,346
All the actors drank together.

789
00:57:42,346 --> 00:57:44,486
We were all so upset.

790
00:57:45,306 --> 00:57:51,116
I was going to leave afterward, but I saw you sitting here alone.

791
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:55,136
Director,

792
00:57:56,376 --> 00:57:58,936
you must be very upset.

793
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:04,636
Don't worry, Ji Yeong.

794
00:58:04,636 --> 00:58:08,766
I'll take care of this somehow and finish the drama.

795
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:13,256
You can just focus on your acting.

796
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:18,126
But you're suffering so much.

797
00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:23,266
I wish I could help you, but I can't.

798
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,626
But don't worry.

799
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:28,686
The actors and staff members are combining forces.

800
00:58:28,686 --> 00:58:31,876
We agreed to quit if they replace you.

801
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:35,336
So cheer up.

802
00:58:38,256 --> 00:58:40,176
Thank you.

803
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:44,626
Having you by my side cheers me up.

804
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:00,366
What?

805
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:03,976
Why is she alone with Go Pil Sung?

806
00:59:12,076 --> 00:59:13,766
 Ji Yeong, where are you? 

807
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:15,356
 Let's meet in a bit. 

808
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:17,366
 Let's have dinner together, too. 

809
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:44,366
 I'm sorry, I can't tonight. 

810
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:46,806
 I need to go home early because of my grandma. 

811
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:49,366
 Let's have dinner tomorrow. 

812
00:59:55,686 --> 00:59:58,556
President Gong, this way.

813
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:11,000


814
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,756
President Gong.

815
01:00:18,176 --> 01:00:21,846
Ji Yeong, why are you coming back now?

816
01:00:21,846 --> 01:00:24,296
You said you were going home early because of your grandma.

817
01:00:27,886 --> 01:00:29,936
You drank, too.

818
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,806
Who did you drink with?

819
01:00:32,806 --> 01:00:36,886
I drank with the staff members and actors.

820
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:40,796
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong. Why are you lying to me?

821
01:00:40,796 --> 01:00:43,326
You were with Go Pil Sung just now.

822
01:00:43,326 --> 01:00:44,616
Pardon?

823
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:47,236
You agreed to date me. Why are you seeing someone else?

824
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:48,966
Are you cheating on me?

825
01:00:48,966 --> 01:00:51,456
No, no. It's not like that.

826
01:00:51,456 --> 01:00:54,936
Why are you lying to me? Why were you with Go Pil Sung?

827
01:00:54,936 --> 01:00:57,186
A big thing happened today.

828
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:01,206
We were told the Director was getting fired, and the set was shut down.

829
01:01:01,206 --> 01:01:06,076
So I wanted to comfort him as his actor.

830
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:09,486
Why would you comfort him?

831
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:11,976
You should be comforting me instead.

832
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:14,426
I'm your boyfriend, Ji Yeong!

833
01:01:14,426 --> 01:01:17,676
I work with Director Go. How could I ignore him?

834
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:19,806
I'm saying I don't like it.

835
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:23,306
I can't stand to see you with Go Pil Sung.

836
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:29,006
Okay.

837
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:31,636
I'm sorry.

838
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:36,636
It's fine as long as you understand.

839
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:45,396
By the way, President Gong, I need to tell you something.

840
01:01:45,396 --> 01:01:49,166
What is it? Do you need clothes? A necklace?

841
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:52,126
Tell me if you need anything.

842
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,446
It's not that.

843
01:01:56,326 --> 01:02:00,326
What you did today wasn't right.

844
01:02:00,326 --> 01:02:02,176
The drama is airing the day after tomorrow.

845
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,236
The staff members and actors are working so hard.

846
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:08,676
But you fired the Director regarding a family matter and you shut down production.

847
01:02:08,676 --> 01:02:11,220
That's just not right.

848
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,426
You're discouraging people working on the drama.

849
01:02:15,426 --> 01:02:19,196
Please don't do that, Presiden Gong.

850
01:02:19,196 --> 01:02:23,716
Excuse me, Ji Yeong. What makes you think you can say that?

851
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:26,856
This isn't just a simple family matter.

852
01:02:26,856 --> 01:02:30,496
Go Pil Sung was hired because of his connection with Jang Soo Yeon.

853
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,156
He should get fired, then.

854
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:37,216
To be honest, it wasn't because of the connection.

855
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:42,036
Everyone knows Director Go is talented.

856
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:45,606
The staff members trust and respect him, too.

857
01:02:45,606 --> 01:02:49,406
Kim Ji Yeong! You need to believe what I say.

858
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:51,936
Are you defending him in front of me again?

859
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:54,856
Hey, you bastard! Bastard!

860
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:58,126
How dare you yell at my granddaughter?

861
01:02:58,126 --> 01:03:01,416
You bastard! You're dead!

862
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,876
- You're dead! 
 - What's this? What's wrong with her?

863
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:06,976
Grandma, what are you doing?

864
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:09,246
Don't do it, Grandma.

865
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:14,196
♪  Until the East Sea's waves are dry, Mt. Baekdu worn away  ♪  

866
01:03:14,196 --> 01:03:16,556
What's wrong with her?

867
01:03:16,556 --> 01:03:18,306
Is she crazy?

868
01:03:18,306 --> 01:03:21,266
She isn't crazy.

869
01:03:21,266 --> 01:03:25,416
She has dementia episodes sometimes.

870
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:31,536
You bastard. How dare you yell at my granddaughter? You son of a bitch.

871
01:03:31,536 --> 01:03:33,766
Grandma! Grandma!

872
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:36,146
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

873
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,866
Gosh, let's go in, Grandma!

874
01:03:39,676 --> 01:03:41,746
Gosh, I'm so tired.

875
01:03:41,746 --> 01:03:46,126
Where's Myeong Dong, that little brat right now?

876
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,946
She didn't help us at the restaurant.

877
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:50,636
It was so tiring to serve so many customers all day.

878
01:03:50,636 --> 01:03:52,916
Mom! Oppa! Unni! This is bad!

879
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,266
Pil Sung is in trouble! Come and sit down.

880
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:56,906
- Hurry. 
 - What's wrong with you?

881
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:57,966
What about Pil Sung?

882
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:00,526
Why? What happened to him?

883
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:02,526
What is it? Come on and tell us.

884
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:05,966
I just ran into a writer I know.

885
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:08,556
APP Group is firing Pil Sung.

886
01:04:08,556 --> 01:04:10,746
They shut down the set, and everything's a mess.

887
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,856
What did you say?

888
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:19,006
   

889
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:22,826
Yes, Bong Soo.

890
01:04:24,526 --> 01:04:25,896
What?

891
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,766
President and Writer, too?

892
01:04:32,456 --> 01:04:34,636
Okay, got it.

893
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:36,936
Yes, see you tomorrow.

894
01:04:42,866 --> 01:04:46,066
Stop the harassment toward Director Go Pil Sung!

895
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:49,456
 Stop! Stop! 

896
01:04:49,456 --> 01:04:52,166
Stop keeping us out of our set!

897
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:54,986
 Stop! Stop! 

898
01:04:54,986 --> 01:04:57,326
Step down, President Gong Jin Dan!

899
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,106
 Step down! Step down! 

900
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:02,536
Stop keeping us out of our set!

901
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:04,576
 Stop! Stop! 

902
01:05:04,576 --> 01:05:06,966
Step down, President Gong Jin Dan!

903
01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:09,866
 Step down! Step down! 

904
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:14,800
Hey.

905
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:17,636
Get them out of here.

906
01:05:17,636 --> 01:05:19,656
What? What are you doing?

907
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:22,096
Stay away!

908
01:05:22,096 --> 01:05:24,236
Let go!

909
01:05:24,236 --> 01:05:26,266
Let go!

910
01:05:26,266 --> 01:05:28,166
Let go of her!

911
01:05:31,486 --> 01:05:33,256
Let go!

912
01:05:33,256 --> 01:05:35,096
Let go!

913
01:05:41,526 --> 01:05:42,966
Director!

914
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:45,166
Stop it!

915
01:05:49,106 --> 01:05:51,176
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Ji Yeong!

916

925
01:06:30,426 --> 01:06:32,106
 Why should we tolerate this? 

926
01:06:32,106 --> 01:06:35,686
 Pil Sung was treated unjustly, and he's protesting. 

927
01:06:35,686 --> 01:06:37,386
 How could we sit still? 

928
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:38,776
 What do we do? 

929
01:06:38,776 --> 01:06:41,856
 Did we do something wrong? Did Pil Sung do something wrong? 

930
01:06:41,856 --> 01:06:43,646
 Why should we suffer? 

931
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:46,996
 It's okay. I'll take care of it, no matter what. Don't worry. 

932
01:06:46,996 --> 01:06:49,156
 What's left for us to say to each other? 

933
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:51,176
 I don't want to see you again. Leave. 

934
01:06:51,176 --> 01:06:53,836
 I'll shut down Go Go Entertainment.
