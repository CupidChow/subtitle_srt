1
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:50,333
S-Spare us just once. 
    

2
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,823
If you spare me, I'll do anything.

3
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:57,253
I'll do whatever it takes.

4
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,163
Spare me.

5
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:01,373
Just once.

6
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:04,843
President Gong.

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:14,290


8
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,143
Please get up now.

9
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:27,633
President Gong.

10
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:32,473
You didn't have to go this far.

11
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:43,843
President Gong, we're in a very bad situation now.

12
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:49,623
If Do Ra stops getting ads and work, I'm really going down.

13
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:53,743
No, our company and Do Ra are all done for.

14
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:55,913
I know.

15
00:01:55,913 --> 00:02:01,153
Everything worth anything is on collateral and you're swimming in debt.

16
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,663
It was ridiculous.

17
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:06,833
How did you know that...

18
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:12,053
But Ms. Park doesn't know anything about this.

19
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:15,653
President Gong, Do Ra can't find out. She can never—

20
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:21,053
President Baek, that's why Ms. Park is acting so immature.

21
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:28,583
If she knew her reality and that her empire was built out of sand,

22
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,143
she would've been more wise.

23
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:38,053
But she was acting proud since she didn't know. Don't you agree?

24
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:40,903
President Gong, I get it now.

25
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:43,223
I get everything now.

26
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:46,103
Just once... Give me a chance just once.

27
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:48,653
Spare me just once, please?

28
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:51,143
Please leave now.

29
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:56,123
You're the one who said it was over between us, President Baek.

30
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:59,563
I said I'll do anything. Whatever it takes.

31
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,743
So, please... Please...

32
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:04,853
How could I lie to you in this situation?

33
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,843
Don't you think?

34
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:28,333
What do I do? Do Ra is smitten with Go Dae Chung or whatever.

35
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,833
Should I come clean with Do Ra now?

36
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,263
That we're in serious debt and about to go down?

37
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:39,603
Would she listen to me, then?

38
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:43,603
No, no, it won't work that way.

39
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:46,653
What do I do, then? What do I do?

40
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:51,843
Yes.

41
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:55,223
We need to do that, at least. At least...

42
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,853
we need to do that.

43
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,793
Mom, my heart is beating too fast.

44
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:12,583
What if I can't make eye contact with him because he's too handsome?

45
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,283
It's okay. Don't get nervous and drink water.

46
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,783
Yeah.

47
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,943
Oh, here he comes.

48
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,313
That ahjussi is my blind date today?

49
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,423
That ahjussi who's coming in with the bald grandpa?

50
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,343
Gosh, Ma Ri.

51
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,323
Get up.

52
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:38,343
Aigoo, Chairman. You were here. Hello.

53
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:39,823
- Yes, Director Yang.
- Hello.

54
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,923
We came a little early.

55
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:44,683
- Have you been well, ma'am? 
 - Yes, welcome.

56
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,493
Hello.

57
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,143
Ma Ri, say hello.

58
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:57,173
Hello.

59
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,333
Okay, have a seat. Have a seat.

60
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:05,243
Chairman, why don't we go out for tea so they can talk freely?

61
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,583
Shall we?

62
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:11,193
Please keep Ma Ri entertained, Director Yang.

63
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,893
I will. Thank you.

64
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,523
Honey.

65
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,323
Let's go.

66
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:21,103
I'm leaving.

67
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,853
Have a seat.

68
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,613
Mom, Dad, how could you do that to me?

69
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:47,333
How could you make me have a blind date with an old man?

70
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,073
Gosh, Ma Ri, I told you he's a bit older.

71
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:52,863
You said you'd like that, too.

72
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:54,703
I did, but...

73
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:58,273
I thought he'd be an oppa, not an ahjussi.

74
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:00,173
Anyway, I don't like him.

75
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:03,663
He's definitely not my type. No way.

76
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,793
Ma Ri, you can't judge a person by their looks.

77
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,993
You need to assess their heart and character first.

78
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:15,613
And he looks dependable and proper enough.

79
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:19,223
I think he's a great person.

80
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:22,753
So, try seeing him a few more times, please?

81
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:25,563
If you like him so much, you date him.

82
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:28,193
You can date him instead!

83
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,663
What are you doing here, Mom? Where's Jae Dong?

84
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:11,723
I sent him home because he had a situation at home.

85
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:17,283
And I wanted to go on a drive with you since you're going to Ganghwa-do.

86
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,323
Let me be your driver today, Ms. Park.

87
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:22,623
Got it. I'm in your care.

88
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:30,553
Mom, why did the photo shoot suddenly get rescheduled?

89
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:33,093
They can't suddenly change the date like this.

90
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:36,153
- What if the schedules overlap? 
 - Things happen sometimes.

91
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:39,443
I said it's okay since you have no work today.

92
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,303
Put the seat belt on.

93
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:49,573
By the way, we haven't been alone like this in a long time, right?

94
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:53,073
Should we get something tasty while we're in Ganghwa-do?

95
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,633
Yes, let's.

96
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,923
We'll get going.

97
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,493
Okay.

98
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,753
 Oppa, where are you? 

99
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,143
 I'm at the broadcasting station. How about you? 

100
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:26,163
 I'm on my way to Ganghwa-do for a photoshoot with Mom. 

101
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:28,623
 I want to hang out with you instead. 

102
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:35,143
 Didn't you say you have no work today? 

103
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:38,933
 Yes, but the schedule suddenly changed, apparently. 

104
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:44,053
 I'll be back in Seoul late since I'm shooting all the way in Ganghwa-do. 

105
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,593
 It's okay. Let me know when you're done with the shoot. 

106
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:51,493
 Okay, Oppa. See you later. 

107
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,473
 Kiss, kiss. 

108
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:59,223
Gosh, she says "Kiss, kiss" all the time.

109
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:02,083
- Who does? 
 - Gosh, you scared me.

110
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,013
Couldn't you make some noise?

111
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:07,143
Why do you always surprise people?

112
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,303
- Are you dating someone? 
 - Date, my foot.

113
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:13,223
It's not like you give me time for that.

114
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,223
He's acting suspiciously.

115
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:26,503
Wow, the air is so nice here. How nice.

116
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,923
By the way, why isn't anyone here?

117
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,543
Are you sure this is the shoot location?

118
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,453
Yes, it is.

119
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,823
Maybe we're too early since I rushed to avoid traffic.

120
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:43,403
Really? I guess they'll be here soon.

121
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:44,553
- Let's go inside. 
 - Oh, I-I almost forgot.

122
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,773
Oh, I-I almost forgot.

123
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:49,203
We're almost out of gas.

124
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:53,103
Do Ra, I'll get gas at a nearby gas station. Wait for me inside.

125
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:56,103
The gas station might close later.

126
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,303
Since we're in the countryside. Wait inside.

127
00:09:58,303 --> 00:09:59,583
Okay.

128
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,683
- Mom, bring in the bag later. 
 - Okay.

129
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,473
I'm not telling her to date just anyone.

130
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:25,333
I hope Do Ra opens up her heart toward President Gong this time.

131
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,653
Do Ra, please listen to me.

132
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:30,143
Please do what I want you to do.

133
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:33,093
That's how we'll live. That's how.

134
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,473
Is anyone here?

135
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,223
Is this really the shoot location?

136
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:01,203
It really doesn't feel like one.

137
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:05,143
We must've come to the wrong place.

138
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:06,843
Hold on.

139
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:12,073
My phone is in the bag.

140
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,933
President Gong.

141
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:30,323
President Gong, what are you doing here?

142
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,803
W-Well, how did you come all the way here?

143
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:40,573
Do Ra, your mother arranged this for us.

144
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:42,893
What did you say?

145
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:45,933
- My mom? 
 - Yes.

146
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,613
I think there's been a misunderstanding between us.

147
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:51,533
And I don't think you know me well.

148
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:57,223
Do Ra, let's drink wine and get things off our chest. Here, have a seat.

149
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,513
S-So...

150
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:07,783
are you saying you and my mom planned this and brought me here?

151
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:11,413
How could you take things this far?

152
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:16,023
This far? I'm just suggesting we talk.

153
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:19,693
I told you many times that I'm not interested in you.

154
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:22,093
Why are you doing this?

155
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:24,773
I-I'll get going now.

156
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,873
Do Ra.

157
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,223
I made myself clear earlier...

158
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:34,833
that your mother arranged this today, not me.

159
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:40,053
She wants things to work out for us, too.

160
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:43,613
So let's relax and have a conversation, okay?

161
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,693
No.

162
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,663
I-I think she made a mistake.

163
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:51,853
I apologize on her behalf.

164
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,953
I'm sorry. I'll get going now.

165
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:00,523
I just want to talk.

166
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:02,713
Is that so hard?

167
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,213
You don't even want to talk to me?

168
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,143
For what reason?

169
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,623
You think you're that impressive?

170
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,933
L-Let go of me.

171
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:16,133
What are you doing? Let go!

172
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,763
No.

173
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:23,493
You can't leave without my permission now that you've come this far.

174
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:29,443
You came in here of your own volition but not when you leave.

175
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:33,053
No, no!

176
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:35,023
No, let go of me!

177
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,993
Let go!

178
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:48,553
How dare you...

179
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:52,573
Where are you going?

180
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,483
Let go of me! Let go of me!

181
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,433
What are you doing?

182
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:10,623
Do you know... that I'm holding back right now?

183
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:14,063
Don't make me any angrier.

184
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:17,893
I don't want to hurt you,

185
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,513
and put you in distress.

186
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:25,033
So don't make me go crazy, okay?

187
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:31,003
Yes, let me ask you something.

188
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,463
What did I do so wrong, huh?

189
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:38,853
I just wanted to have a talk with you,

190
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:41,903
but why do you treat me like a weirdo?

191
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,833
Ms. Park,

192
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:53,273
you're completely mistaken right now.

193
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:57,653
What I'm trying to do is to give you a chance.

194
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:01,953
So, if you're ready to open up and talk to me,

195
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:04,573
let's talk again then.

196
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:23,683
Open the door. Open the door!

197
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,943
Open the door!

198
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,913
Help!

199
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:31,303
Help! Someone's trapped in here!

200
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:34,503
 Screaming like that won't do anything. 

201
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:37,343
 There's no one around here, 

202
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:41,443
 and no one can come here without my permission. 

203
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,773
 This is my vacation home. 

204
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:52,303
Open the door! Open the door!

205
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,193
 President Gong, 

206
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,093
 are you there? 

207
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,423
What is it?

208
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:36,003
Are you ready to talk to me now?

209
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,983
 Yes. 

210
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:57,473
You must've felt stuck.

211
00:16:57,473 --> 00:17:00,033
You could've been like this from the beginning.

212
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:05,843
I can come out, right?

213
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:07,933
Of course.

214
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:33,323
I'll have some wine, too.

215
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,523
- Wine? 
 - Yes.

216
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,223
Okay.

217
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:42,443
Look at this, Do Ra.

218
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:44,343
I decanted it.

219
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:54,033
Goodness. I drank a few glasses because I was upset about you.

220
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,473
But I swear I'm not drunk.

221
00:17:57,473 --> 00:18:03,003
It won't prevent us from having a candid conversation.

222
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:04,943
Don't worry.

223
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,863
Okay, it's all good now.

224
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,903
I'm a bit hungry, too.

225
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:20,573
Is there something to eat?

226
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:23,763
- Cheese or anything. 
 - Of course, there is.

227
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:26,823
I prepared everything you might like.

228
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:29,253
Wait just a moment, okay?

229
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:05,033
Do Ra—

230
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,973
Park Do Ra!

231
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:22,493
Park Do Ra!

232
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,893
Where did you go, Park Do Ra?

233
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:29,023
You think you'd be fine leaving like this?

234
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,283
Fine!

235
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,813
Leave! Go!

236
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:52,243
I don't want a woman who runs away from me, either!

237
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:59,603
Ma'am! Ma'am!

238
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:07,023
Is Do Ra not done yet?

239
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:12,763
Yes, she said she'd let me know when she's done.

240
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,783
   

241
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:21,843
Hello?

242
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:23,843
 Oppa, it's me. 

243
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,773
Is that you, Do Ra?

244
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:28,653
What's this number...

245
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:32,003
What's wrong with your voice? Is something wrong?

246
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:34,703
 Please pick me up now. 

247
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:42,103
I don't have my wallet, phone, purse, or anything, Oppa.

248
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:46,023
Please pick me up right now, Oppa.

249
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:50,263
I... I'm scared. Please hurry.

250
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:54,463
Park Do Ra, where are you right now? Huh?

251
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:18,924
Do Ra!

252
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:20,744
Park Do Ra!

253
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,854
I think this is the place.

254
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:26,194
- Do Ra! 
 - Pil Sung!

255
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:28,144
Pil Sung!

256
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,104
Do Ra.

257
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:37,064
Oppa.

258
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
Do Ra.

259
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:43,404
What happened to you?

260
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,954
What's going on? Why are you alone?

261
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:47,824
Weren't you with your mother?

262
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,414
Why are you alone this late without your wallet or phone?

263
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,824
The thing is...

264
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:03,064
Let's get going, Oppa.

265
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,794
I want to get out of here.

266
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:10,724
Okay, got it. Let's leave for now.

267
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:18,714
I'm here. It's okay now.

268
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,634
It's okay.

269
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,134
Are you feeling better?

270
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:33,754
Tell me.

271
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:36,464
What on earth happened?

272
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:49,524
I had a fight with Mom.

273
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:55,674
What do you mean?

274
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:58,914
How seriously did you fight that you were here like this?

275
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:01,274
Your clothes are covered in dirt, too.

276
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:05,944
Did she leave you here?

277
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,254
Oppa...

278
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:14,364
I'll tell you later.

279
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:20,194
Okay. Close your eyes and get some sleep.

280
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:22,764
I'll let you know when we arrive in Seoul.

281
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,154
 You should've done it properly. Properly. 

282
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:45,514
 - We only made 300,000 won because of you. 
 - Mom, I don't want to. 

283
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,174
 Why are you so selfish? 

284
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:50,664
 Fine. If you don't want to, let's all jump into the Han River and die. 

285
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:54,294
 - Let's go. Let's die. 
 - Mom, Mom, no. 

286
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:08,364
Mom, I'm so sick I could die.

287
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:12,854
- Please help me. 
 - Yes, I hear you.

288
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,514
But we still need to do this shoot.

289
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,584
Let's just shoot this, and I'll take you to the hospital.

290
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,299
Hurry. We need to shoot. Come out.

291
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:22,549
Come out. Hurry. Get up.

292
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:30,514
Hey, Do Ra!

293
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:33,154
Hey, what's wrong with her? Check on her.

294
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:36,364
- Do Ra, Do Ra!
- Do Ra!

295
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:37,694
Call an ambulance!

296
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:41,114
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

297
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:46,334
 Do Ra, you just need to do what I tell you to do. 

298
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:51,984
 I told you. That's how you get cast and you need to get cast to shoot ads, too. 

299
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:55,004
 That's how you make money. 

300
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:02,974
Do Ra.

301
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:53,614
What's going on?

302
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,834
What happened, exactly?

303
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:00,044
Tell me...

304
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:03,364
Tell your oppa. I'll listen to everything.

305
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:06,344
Oppa...

306
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:11,924
I didn't come this far easily.

307
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:15,984
I suffered so much.

308
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:24,604
I did a lot of things I didn't want to do.

309
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:28,154
It was so difficult to come this far.

310
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,274
I know, I know.

311
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:39,414
But you've been doing well all this time.

312
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:42,904
I'm very proud of you, Do Ra.

313
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:47,414
But...

314
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:53,594
I thought I'd come this far bravely,

315
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,754
but a day like today is too hard.

316
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:04,390
It's been so hard because

317
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:10,730
my mom thinks of me as a money-making machine.

318
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:19,454
To be honest, I wanted to die because of Mom today.

319
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:26,534
I don't know what to do, Oppa.

320
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:29,544
She's my mom.

321
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:34,294
If she were someone else, I could cut ties with her,

322
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:36,844
but she's my mom.

323
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:41,994
She's my mom. She's my mom.

324
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:48,534
It's okay. It's okay.

325
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:52,284
Do Ra,

326
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:56,134
I don't know what exactly happened,

327
00:28:57,864 --> 00:29:01,274
but you can do whatever you want from now on.

328
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:04,634
You don't have to try too hard.

329
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:27,254
It's not like I sold you off to be sacrificed to some terrible place.

330
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:29,884
President Gong is a chaebol...

331
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,794
and he'll become the chairman of APP Group.

332
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:35,174
And most importantly, he likes you a lot.

333
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:38,494
I didn't do anything to cause you any loss.

334
00:29:38,494 --> 00:29:41,204
So, Do Ra, just this one night...

335
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:45,694
Please let all of us live, Do Ra.

336
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:51,464
Is that you, Do Shik?

337
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,374
Mom...

338
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:09,504
Mom, how could you do this to me?

339
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:12,394
Do Ra...

340
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:14,764
how did you...

341
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:17,574
How did you come home? Why are you here?

342
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:20,734
Are you really my mom?

343
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:23,804
Am I your biological daughter?

344
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:28,154
I want to get a DNA test to see if you're my real mom.

345
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:32,504
You dragged me around and made me sing as a child,

346
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:35,404
and you exploited me for money, and that should've been enough.

347
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:37,594
How...

348
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:42,654
How could you just leave me there?

349
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:47,364
How could you try to sell me to someone like him?

350
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:49,244
What more do you need?

351
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:51,044
What else do you want?

352
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:53,644
What did I do wrong that you're flipping out like this?

353
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,224
What's wrong with President Gong?

354
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:59,714
Hey, ask a hundred people on the streets.

355
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:03,824
Will they date the APP Group successor or that abandoned kid from that shitty family?

356
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:07,104
Ask them if I'm sane or you are!

357
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:13,414
And hey, you should be grateful when someone like President Gong likes you.

358
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:17,264
But why Go Dae Chung? Go Dae Chung?

359
00:31:17,264 --> 00:31:20,454
So, are you saying you did a good thing?

360
00:31:20,454 --> 00:31:23,294
Yes, I did a good thing.

361
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,524
I did it for you. For you!

362
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:28,614
But how dare you come back like this?

363
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:32,484
How dare you ruin everything like this?

364
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:34,604
You're crazy.

365
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:37,604
You're crazy!

366
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,014
What? What did you say?

367
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,964
I... I'll cut ties with you starting today.

368
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:53,204
What? Cut ties?

369
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:59,104
From now on, you're not my mom, and I'm not your daughter.

370
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:03,484
You and I are over as of today.

371
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:05,904
I'll move out of this house, too.

372
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:10,224
What? Over?

373
00:32:11,174 --> 00:32:13,954
Hey, hey!

374
00:32:13,954 --> 00:32:15,434
Hey, Park Do Ra!

375
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:19,454
You're my daughter, and I'm your mom, even if the sky collapses.

376
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:23,604
That's why I couldn't abandon you! I couldn't!

377
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,354
Don't you know how I raised you?

378
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,034
How dare you say that to me?

379
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:34,974
Of all people, how could you say that to me?

380
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:37,974
Do you...

381
00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:42,084
Do you think I did that for my well-being?

382
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:45,684
Do you think I did that just for me? Park Do...

383
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:47,594
Park Do Ra...

384
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:53,054
 You can't do this to me! 

385
00:33:00,744 --> 00:33:04,574
 You can't do this to me! 

386
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:10,774
 How could you... 

387
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:18,834
 You can't do this to me. 

388
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:23,044
 Don't you know how... 

389
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:31,414
 You can't do this to me. 

390
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:34,114
The grapes are so sweet.

391
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:37,344
- Yes, they are. 
 - Help yourself.

392
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:41,114
Pil Sung still hasn't come home.

393
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:43,794
He must be on a date today, too.

394
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:53,184
Why are you looking at me and sighing while saying that?

395
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:59,314
I sigh automatically whenever I see you. What can I do?

396
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:01,484
Is it automatic?

397
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:04,544
- Oppa, are you joking right now? 
 - Yes!

398
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,114
Seriously, I can't enjoy the fruits.

399
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:10,284
By the way, I heard Do Ra... makes hundreds of millions per ad. Is that true?

400
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:14,514
makes hundreds of millions per ad. Is that true?

401
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:16,804
Probably.

402
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:20,234
Gosh, she's unbelievable. She makes that much money,

403
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:22,664
but how could she not visit us once?

404
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:26,254
Shouldn't she bring a Korean beef gift set, at least?

405
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:29,764
Mother, why are you like this?

406
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:33,954
What? I didn't say anything wrong.

407
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:37,214
Are they married? Is she your granddaughter-in-law? Why would she visit?

408
00:34:37,214 --> 00:34:39,784
They're still just dating.

409
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:43,614
But Pil Sung must not spend money on dates.

410
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,304
Because Do Ra makes so much money.

411
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:51,484
I heard that young people these days can't even date because it's costly.

412
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:55,424
Pil Sung will be saving a lot of money.

413
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:00,514
I'm home.

414
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:01,824
- Hey. 
 - Hi.

415
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:04,084
Did you see Do Ra today, too?

416
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:05,524
Yes, briefly.

417
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:08,864
- You must be tired. Go take a shower and rest. 
 - Okay.

418
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:11,634
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

419
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:19,854
Mother, don't ever say that in front of Pil Sung.

420
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:24,744
Okay. I might as well keep my mouth stitched.

421
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,484
Gosh, my back. My back...

422
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:31,874
Unni, don't worry about her.

423
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:48,804
 A day like today is too hard. 

424
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:54,494
 It's been so hard because 

425
00:35:54,494 --> 00:36:00,614
 my mom thinks of me as a money-making machine. 

426
00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:06,254
 To be honest, I wanted to die because of Mom today. 

427
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,254
Do Ra...

428
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,214
must've been suffering a lot.

429
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,460
By the way,

430
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:24,454
what kind of photoshoot did she make her do?

431
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,954
I hate you, Dad. I'm disappointed.

432
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,204
He doesn't understand how I feel.

433
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:42,584
Gosh, be careful!

434
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:50,044
Thank you.

435
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:51,854
Are you okay?

436
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:55,914
Yes.

437
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:03,964
 Can't believe such a handsome and gentle oppa exists. 

438
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:09,294
What is it? Is something wrong?

439
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,574
No, it's not that.

440
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:16,784
Do you like lemons, by the way?

441
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:19,414
Lemons?

442
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:30,214
Thank you for saving my sister, Lulu.

443
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:36,864
I'll enjoy the lemon candy. Thank you.

444
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:45,864
My favorite romantic novel protagonists, the Northern Prince and Lala Yeong Ae, met like this.

445
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,624
What do I do?

446
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:51,094
Maybe that oppa and I are meant to be, too.

447
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:55,244
Lulu, what did you say?

448
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:57,554
Catch that oppa?

449
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:27,384
How foolish. I didn't even get to ask his name.

450
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:30,424
Lulu, what did you say?

451
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:33,914
We'll meet again if we're meant to be?

452
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:37,964
Okay, I know what you mean.

453
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:43,974
What did you say? You lost Ma Ri?

454
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:48,164
Okay, keep looking in that area, Mr. Kang.

455
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:50,054
I'll be right there.

456
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:53,864
He lost Ma Ri? What do we do? Her phone is here, too.

457
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:57,754
She probably didn't go far. I'm sure she's nearby. Don't worry.

458
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,134
- I'll go look for her, too. 
 - I'll come with you.

459
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:02,634
Mom, Dad!

460
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:05,194
Ma Ri, where have you been?

461
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:08,454
Ma Ri, what are you doing?

462
00:39:08,454 --> 00:39:10,464
You left home without Mr. Kang?

463
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:14,094
And you left your phone here, too.

464
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:17,254
Don't you know how worried we were?

465
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,464
Dad, don't worry. No, no.

466
00:39:19,464 --> 00:39:23,074
I finally met the man of my fate.

467
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:26,364
What? What do you mean?

468
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,914
I just met an oppa who's totally my type,

469
00:39:30,914 --> 00:39:34,924
but... he got away.

470
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:37,404
I didn't even get to ask his name.

471
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:39,644
What?

472
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,414
But don't worry, Dad.

473
00:39:41,414 --> 00:39:45,154
I'll be sure to find him and see him again.

474
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:48,964
So don't mention that ahjussi to me anymore.

475
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:50,784
Okay, Dad?

476
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:01,274
Who did she meet that she's saying that?

477
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,694
Honey, let's not rush things too much.

478
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:08,364
I don't think we should do this to Ma Ri yet.

479
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:14,274
CEO Yang's son is a good fellow, though.

480
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:24,434
Do Ra, are you going on a trip?

481
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:27,084
Oppa, I'm moving out.

482
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:29,184
I also cut ties with Mom, just so you know.

483
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,564
What do you mean, you cut ties with her? Are you crazy?

484
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:35,504
Come here. Let's sit and talk. Come.

485
00:40:36,614 --> 00:40:38,304
Let go of me! Let go!

486
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:40,084
Do Ra! Do Ra, Do Ra...

487
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:42,474
Don't do this. Don't do this, Do Ra.

488
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,154
Let go of me!

489
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:46,334
I don't even want to hear your voice.

490
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:49,594
D-Do Ra, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.

491
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:53,844
Do Ra, being an actor is so hard and precarious.

492
00:40:53,844 --> 00:40:55,954
You don't know when you'd stop getting work, either.

493
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,864
And you won't always be a top celebrity.

494
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,364
So I thought if you met a good man,

495
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:03,454
you won't worry about money and only work on projects you want.

496
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:06,564
That's why I made you meet President Gong. It was all for you.

497
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,954
But thinking now, I did the wrong thing.

498
00:41:10,954 --> 00:41:13,044
I didn't even ask your opinion.

499
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:15,714
It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.

500
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,514
I'm sorry. Please? Please?

501
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:21,074
Stop. I don't want to hear that anymore.

502
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:23,294
Hey, Park Do Ra!

503
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,144
Aren't you going too far?

504
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:27,394
Is it that wrong for her to have you see President Gong?

505
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,434
Don't see him if you don't want to.

506
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:31,684
But you want to cut ties with her?

507
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:33,534
How could you say that to your family?

508
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,964
She's no longer my family.

509
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:39,054
How could you be my family when you sold off your daughter?

510
00:41:39,054 --> 00:41:40,684
Sold you off?

511
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:43,214
You think you can just talk like that?

512
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:46,054
That little...

513
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:49,974
- Are you okay, Mom? 
 - Excuse me.

514
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,354
Gosh, who are you?

515
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:53,454
Who are you that you're barging in?

516
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,344
Is this Ms. Baek Mi Ja's residence?

517
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:57,684
Yes, but we're asking who you are.

518
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,784
We're from the court.

519
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:04,574
We'll seize Ms. Baek's bond bank account and tangible movable property.

520
00:42:04,574 --> 00:42:06,124
We ask for your cooperation.

521
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,984
- Get started. 
 - Got it.

522
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,894
H-Hold on, hold on, hold on.

523
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:14,034
Seize? What do you mean?

524
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,354
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

525
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:18,804
- You said this is Ms. Baek's residence. 
 - Yes, but...

526
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:22,564
Mom, what's going on? Why are they seizing our property?

527
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:27,214
Mom, did something happen behind my back?

528
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:30,954
How much debt do you have that they're seizing our property?

529
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:35,784
Gosh, w-what do I do?

530
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:39,974
- Wait, hold on, sir. 
 - Please...

531
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,584
No, I think there's a misunderstanding!

532
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:46,044
Hold on!

533
00:42:46,044 --> 00:42:48,294
Gosh, what do I do?

534
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,332
What did you say?

535
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:54,954
We financed 90% of the apartment and building?

536
00:42:54,954 --> 00:42:59,484
Yes. Dora Entertainment also borrowed three billion won.

537
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,474
Three billion?

538
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:09,344
There's money in my bank account. I'll pay back with that.

539
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:12,144
That account balance is below zero.

540
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:13,984
Didn't you know?

541
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:17,624
You loaned 300 million with that minus bank account.

542
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:19,174
Pardon?

543
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:24,104
So, you're saying...

544
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:28,462
there's no money in the bank account,

545
00:43:29,124 --> 00:43:33,074
and the building and apartment are gone, too?

546
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:36,334
And I'm 3.3 billion in debt?

547
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:39,324
Yes, that's why we kept notifying you about seizing.

548
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,214
Didn't you know?

549
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:44,714
They will be put on auction soon.

550
00:43:55,824 --> 00:43:59,584
Ma'am! Ma'am, are you okay?

551
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:12,164
Hyung, Hyung, Hyung, she's waking up.

552
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:17,314
Noona, it's me, Jae Dong.

553
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:19,024
Do Ra, are you okay?

554
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,524
You passed out at the bank earlier.

555
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:23,244
Do you remember?

556
00:44:23,814 --> 00:44:25,914
Oppa...

557
00:44:28,304 --> 00:44:32,164
Oppa, our building and apartment...

558
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:36,314
We lost both for a loan.

559
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:38,954
And there's more debt on top of it.

560
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:43,834
Oppa, that's not true, right?

561
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:46,164
This is not real, right?

562
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:48,334
This is a dream, right?

563
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:52,684
Oppa, please say it's a dream.

564
00:44:53,644 --> 00:44:55,414
Do Ra...

565
00:44:57,374 --> 00:45:00,224
I wish it were a dream, too.

566
00:45:00,852 --> 00:45:03,212
But Mom has been gambling.

567
00:45:03,212 --> 00:45:05,872
What? Gambling?

568
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:10,712
What gambling?

569
00:45:10,712 --> 00:45:15,072
Noona, Hyung, your debt news is going viral on social media.

570
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:16,882
What do we do?

571
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:22,282
   

572
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:25,742
W-What's all this?

573
00:45:25,742 --> 00:45:27,992
Is this all about me?

574
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:33,412
There are tons of articles and comments on her right now.

575
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:36,312
Everyone's suspecting P is Park Do Ra. What do we do?

576
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:41,042
Where's Mom? Where's Mom?

577
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,132
Noona, Noona, Noona, Noona!

578
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:44,752
Hey, Do Ra!

579
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:48,292
   

580
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:56,802
What will my Do Ra do? What will my Do Ra do?

581
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:10,882
Mom, what's going on here?

582
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,852
What have you been doing, exactly?

583
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,882
Did you really gamble?

584
00:46:15,882 --> 00:46:18,842
What are all these articles? Are they true?

585
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,182
Do Ra...

586
00:46:21,182 --> 00:46:23,822
Mom, explain it to me.

587
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:28,442
I mean, how could something like this happen?

588
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:30,842
How much do you have to gamble for this to happen?

589
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:33,192
Explain it to me! Explain it!

590
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:37,322
Well, I did gamble. But it wasn't just that.

591
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:40,272
I invested in something to make things work,

592
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:42,792
but I got scammed. And...

593
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:44,962
I gambled to make up for it, but...

594
00:46:44,962 --> 00:46:46,692
I kept losing more, so...

595
00:46:46,692 --> 00:46:50,172
 I gambled more to get that back. 

596
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:55,192
 I tried to fix things myself, so you don't worry. 

597
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:58,672
So that's how it happened...

598
00:46:58,672 --> 00:47:00,872
Mom...

599
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:06,442
you know how I've been living all this time.

600
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:09,732
Don't you know how I've been living?

601
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:14,202
I've been working...

602
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:18,372
like a money-making machine, as you told me to.

603
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:21,262
You know that better than anyone.

604
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:25,332
But of all people, how could you do this to me?

605
00:47:25,332 --> 00:47:28,752
How could you do this?

606
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:30,530
Do Ra...

607
00:47:31,322 --> 00:47:34,632
Do Ra, I didn't think this would happen, either.

608
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:36,512
I didn't know this would happen, Do Ra.

609
00:47:36,512 --> 00:47:40,112
I-I know how hard you worked to get here.

610
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:43,062
We can't... We can't let everything go to waste.

611
00:47:43,062 --> 00:47:50,262
So...So, Do Ra, tell me you'd see President Gong now.

612
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:54,322
What did you say?

613
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:56,152
Let's go.

614
00:47:56,152 --> 00:47:58,942
If you agree to see President Gong now...

615
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:04,162
As long as you say you'd see him, he'd take care of everything.

616
00:48:04,162 --> 00:48:08,382
He'll control the media and... pay off all of our debts, too.

617
00:48:08,382 --> 00:48:11,142
So... So, Do Ra... Do Ra...

618
00:48:11,142 --> 00:48:13,252
- Do Ra! 
 - Mom...

619
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:19,042
You're trying to sell your daughter to pay off your gambling debt now?

620
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:23,952
How? How could you do this?

621
00:48:24,962 --> 00:48:28,602
Do Ra!

622
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:31,080
What do I do?

623
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:34,262
What do I do, Do Ra?

624
00:48:34,262 --> 00:48:35,662
Huh? It's Park Do Ra!

625
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,622
Who are you? Why are you coming in?

626
00:48:38,622 --> 00:48:42,122
- Park Do Ra, I'm glad I ran into you. 
 - There she was.

627
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:44,302
What's this? Someone claimed them already.

628
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:45,892
What are these red tags?

629
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:47,612
- Shit. 
 - What's all this?

630
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:49,642
Did they go bankrupt?

631
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:52,032
Hey! Pay me back right now.

632
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:54,882
I don't need your mom anymore. You pay me immediately.

633
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:58,752
This is the IOU your mom wrote to borrow 500 million from me.

634
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:02,052
Look at this! Guarantor Park Do Ra. You see your seal, right?

635
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:05,722
I loaned her money because of your fame, not your mom.

636
00:49:05,722 --> 00:49:07,622
So, pay me 500 million right now!

637
00:49:07,622 --> 00:49:09,332
You owe me 300 million!

638
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:11,882
I won't leave this house until you pay me!

639
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,682
I have an IOU, too.

640
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:16,932
It's my money! When will you pay me back?

641
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:23,412
I have no idea what you're saying right now.

642
00:49:23,412 --> 00:49:25,192
I don't know anything.

643
00:49:25,192 --> 00:49:27,152
What? You don't know anything?

644
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:30,092
How dare you play innocent after taking my money?

645
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,752
- Hey! 
 - What are you doing?

646
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,092
- Pay me back! 
 - That money is like my blood, you scammer!

647
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:37,852
You need to be punished to come to your senses.

648
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:40,112
You need to pay us back if your mom can't.

649
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:42,152
How dare you play innocent right now?

650
00:49:42,152 --> 00:49:45,542
Hey! Get away from my daughter!

651
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:47,822
Get away from her. She doesn't know anything!

652
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:50,420
What? What are you saying?

653
00:49:54,572 --> 00:49:56,552
That's enough! Stop!

654
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:59,062
What's this now?

655
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,812
I'll pay all of your money back.

656
00:50:14,482 --> 00:50:16,612
I'm sorry.

657
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:21,602
I learned today that my mom was in debt.

658
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,212
I'll pay you back, no matter what it takes.

659
00:50:26,212 --> 00:50:28,982
Please stop now.

660
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:32,142
Have faith in me and give me more time.

661
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:34,482
No matter what it takes...

662
00:50:34,482 --> 00:50:38,662
No matter how many years it takes, I'll pay you back.

663
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:43,692
So, please stop.

664
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:48,362
I'll pay all of you back.

665
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:53,122
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

666
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,872
I'm sorry!

667
00:50:56,942 --> 00:50:59,002
I'm sorry!

668
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,642
I'm sorry.

669
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:14,192
President Gong. President Gong, my Do Ra passed out.

670
00:51:14,192 --> 00:51:16,072
Please spare my Do Ra.

671
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,632
She's about to die now, President Gong.

672
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:21,102
President Gong, please...

673
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:26,792
Do you know what your daughter did to me at my vacation home?

674
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,592
She made me a pushover and an idiot.

675
00:51:29,592 --> 00:51:31,952
How could you say that now?

676
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:36,912
If you really need my help, tell Park Do Ra to come and kneel in front of me.

677
00:51:36,912 --> 00:51:39,772
Secretary Jo, get this woman out of here.

678
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:41,532
President Gong, it's not that.

679
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:44,212
Listen to me, President Gong! Let go!

680
00:51:44,212 --> 00:51:47,992
President Gong, listen to me! President Gong!

681
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:49,642
 It's my fault! 

682
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:53,672
 President Gong, I... I'm sorry, President Gong... 

683
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:56,572
Pil Sung! Pil Sung! Pil Sung!

684
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,262
What? Is something wrong?

685
00:51:58,262 --> 00:51:59,742
Haven't you seen the news?

686
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:03,182
Park Do Ra's debts are going viral.

687
00:52:03,182 --> 00:52:05,582
What? Her debts are going viral?

688
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:08,592
My gosh, what's going on?

689
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,062
I'm glad "Straightforward Romance" ended last week.

690
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:12,862
Imagine this happening in the middle of it.

691
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:15,962
Our show almost failed. 
    

692
00:52:15,962 --> 00:52:18,012
Gosh, my ancestors helped me.

693
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:20,442
Thank God...

694
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:22,072
Hyung,

695
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:24,602
is this all true?

696
00:52:24,602 --> 00:52:26,202
How am I supposed to know?

697
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:29,222
The articles must be flooding in because it must be.

698
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:33,022
By the way, what's wrong with Park Do Ra's mom?

699
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:35,592
Why would she gamble?

700
00:52:35,592 --> 00:52:37,592
How could she gamble away her entire assets?

701
00:52:37,592 --> 00:52:40,222
Park Do Ra's been making tons of money.

702
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:43,192
What's wrong with him?

703
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:46,732
Do Ra, I just saw the articles.

704
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:48,222
Are you okay?

705
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:50,072
Where are you right now?

706
00:53:07,482 --> 00:53:09,122
Do Ra,

707
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:13,482
you can't get weak.

708
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:18,252
You have to be strong in times like this.

709
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:19,972
You know, right?

710
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:24,482
Yes, Oppa.

711
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:27,652
Don't worry about me.

712
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:29,812
I can overcome it.

713
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:33,992
You have no idea how tough I am.

714
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:38,772
I've lasted in this industry since I was 12.

715
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:44,282
I can get started again.

716
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:47,682
And I'll pay off all the debt.

717
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,392
I won't crumble like this.

718
00:53:50,392 --> 00:53:54,072
Yes, Do Ra. You can do it.

719
00:53:54,072 --> 00:53:56,352
You can overcome this.

720
00:53:56,352 --> 00:53:58,252
You're Park Do Ra, after all.

721
00:53:58,252 --> 00:54:02,592
Yes. So you shouldn't worry, either.

722
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:04,872
I'll help with anything.

723
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:09,262
So, let's overcome this situation together.

724
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:12,332
Do Ra,

725
00:54:13,452 --> 00:54:17,292
you can never get weak, okay?

726
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:19,862
Of course not.

727
00:54:19,862 --> 00:54:22,742
I have you by my side.

728
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:25,012
I can do anything.

729
00:54:32,742 --> 00:54:34,352
Oppa,

730
00:54:36,582 --> 00:54:39,822
no matter what happens to me,

731
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:43,922
you'll stay by my side, right?

732
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:46,272
Of course.

733
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:50,952
I'll stay right by your side.

734
00:54:50,952 --> 00:54:53,212
I'm not going anywhere.

735
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,622
So, Do Ra,

736
00:54:58,202 --> 00:54:59,932
cheer up.

737
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,772
Thank you.

738
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:11,122
Thank you, Oppa.

739
00:55:28,172 --> 00:55:31,112
Oppa, don't make a face like that.

740
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:33,062
I'll never crumble.

741
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:35,392
I'm Park Do Ra.

742
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:40,522
We used to run away at night all the time because of Mom's debt collectors.

743
00:55:40,522 --> 00:55:44,072
We've been through worse than this. This is nothing.

744
00:55:44,072 --> 00:55:47,672
So, say yes to everything. Everything.

745
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:52,772
Those are the canceled ad contracts.

746
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:55,222
What?

747
00:55:55,222 --> 00:55:56,822
Do Ra,

748
00:55:57,572 --> 00:56:00,922
getting new ads isn't the issue right now.

749
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,512
We need to pay penalties for breaching contracts.

750
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,142
Penalties?

751
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:09,372
How much?

752
00:56:09,372 --> 00:56:11,952
I did the calculation and...

753
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:15,252
it's about 10 billion won.

754
00:56:16,262 --> 00:56:17,892
What?

755
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:21,392
A hundred billion?

756
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:30,612
- Noona, Noona... 
 - Do Ra, Do Ra!

757
00:56:51,832 --> 00:56:56,222
Do Ra, you shouldn't have gone to work so early.

758
00:56:56,222 --> 00:57:00,292
Drink this. You need to eat something to get energy.

759
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,922
Get out.

760
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:07,152
Do Ra, you have a potential project.

761
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:11,192
They'll pay two billion if you say yes.

762
00:57:14,462 --> 00:57:17,432
We can pay the interest with that.

763
00:57:17,432 --> 00:57:22,922
You can buy time so we don't lose this apartment and building.

764
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:29,252
What is it?

765
00:57:30,552 --> 00:57:33,542
It's a nude photoshoot.

766
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:39,142
What... Nude photoshoot?

767
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:42,382
Mom...

768
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:46,132
how can you say that now...

769
00:57:48,522 --> 00:57:50,122
Do Ra,

770
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:54,582
it's not bad to do a nude photoshoot.

771
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:57,742
You should do it while you're young and in your prime.

772
00:57:57,742 --> 00:57:59,472
That's now.

773
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:03,702
They said they'll turn you into a beautiful and artistic work of art.

774
00:58:03,702 --> 00:58:07,482
This is art. Art.

775
00:58:07,482 --> 00:58:10,202
You worked so hard to buy this apartment and the building.

776
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:14,082
You can't lose everything, Do Ra.

777
00:58:31,982 --> 00:58:35,992
 Do Ra, why haven't you been in touch? 

778
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:38,092
 Are you okay? 

779
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:45,172
   

780
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:51,002
Pil Sung,

781
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:57,192
how did Park Do Ra end up in this mess?

782
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:00,852
Why would you say such a thing?

783
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:03,012
She's out of her mind right now.

784
00:59:03,012 --> 00:59:05,402
She says she'll do a nude photoshoot.

785
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:13,772
What are you talking about?

786
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:17,272
Where did you hear that nonsense?

787
00:59:17,272 --> 00:59:19,762
Who said such a ridiculous thing?

788
00:59:19,762 --> 00:59:22,742
Cha Il Tae, the cinematographer, is shooting it.

789
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:26,262
A foreign company invested a fortune in Park Do Ra's nude photoshoot.

790
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,572
They scheduled the shoot today. It's definitely happening.

791
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:34,002
T-Today?

792
00:59:34,002 --> 00:59:36,062
Yes.

793
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:39,952
Gosh, she was a goddess of romance.

794
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,472
How could she crumble like this at once?

795
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:48,072
I have to see my female lead crumbling like this.

796
00:59:48,072 --> 00:59:52,722
My heart is breaking. Seriously...

797
01:00:25,282 --> 01:00:27,690
   

798
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,550


799
01:00:42,962 --> 01:00:45,562
Oppa, I'm at work right now.

800
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:47,482
I'll call you later.

801
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:51,632
Park Do Ra, where are you right now? Tell me where you are.

802
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:54,632
Why do you want to know where I'm working?

803
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:56,942
Tell me right now!

804
01:00:56,942 --> 01:00:59,402
 Why can't you tell me? 

805
01:01:00,752 --> 01:01:05,462
Park Do Ra, is it true you're doing a nude photoshoot today?

806
01:01:13,322 --> 01:01:14,992
Oppa,

807
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:18,812
I said I'm working right now.

808
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:21,072
I'll call you later.

809
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:47,992
Oppa, let go!

810
01:01:47,992 --> 01:01:50,242
What's wrong with you, Oppa?

811
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:52,522
What do you mean?

812
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,932
You don't belong here.

813
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:57,032
Let's go, Do Ra.

814
01:01:57,982 --> 01:01:59,922
Oppa, what are you doing right now?

815
01:01:59,922 --> 01:02:02,452
You're on my set.

816
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,652
I'm working here right now.

817
01:02:06,112 --> 01:02:11,962
Do Ra, you told me... that you'll start from the beginning.

818
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,752
That you'll work hard again.

819
01:02:13,752 --> 01:02:15,402
Is this the beginning you meant?

820
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,682
What's wrong with this?

821
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:20,642
Only I can do something like this.

822
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:24,502
And are you telling me this without knowing my situation?

823
01:02:27,332 --> 01:02:30,602
So, are you doing this...

824
01:02:30,602 --> 01:02:32,692
- because of money? 
 - Of course.

825
01:02:32,692 --> 01:02:34,862
It's because of money!

826
01:02:35,482 --> 01:02:37,942
Don't you know that?

827
01:02:40,432 --> 01:02:44,292
Do Ra, you still can't do something like this.

828
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:47,342
You need to seek another solution somehow.

829
01:02:48,622 --> 01:02:50,972
I'm worried you'll regret it later.

830
01:02:52,512 --> 01:02:56,732
Do Ra, I know you're suffering.

831
01:02:57,832 --> 01:03:00,642
But I don't want you to do this.

832
01:03:02,052 --> 01:03:03,692
Oppa,

833
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:07,792
I get two billion for doing this.

834
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:10,122
Do you have two billion?

835
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:13,912
What?

836
01:03:13,912 --> 01:03:16,622
I'll make two billion if I do this for a few hours.

837
01:03:16,622 --> 01:03:19,352
Can you give me that money?

838
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:22,342
I'll be the one who'd regret it.

839
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:25,822
So, shut up and leave unless you have two billion!

840
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,412
Just one moment.

841
01:04:24,522 --> 01:04:28,612
 Oppa, I get two billion for doing this. 

842
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:30,152
 Do you have two billion? 

843
01:04:30,152 --> 01:04:32,172
 Can you give me that money? 

844
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,992
 I'll be the one who'd regret it. 

845
01:04:33,992 --> 01:04:37,602
 So, shut up and leave unless you have two billion! 

846
01:04:42,372 --> 01:04:45,252
We'll start shooting now.

847
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:50,942
Okay.

848
01:04:58,012 --> 01:05:00,232
Okay, we'll start now, Ms. Park.

849
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:02,352
Please take the robe off.

850
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:50,152
   

851
01:05:50,152 --> 01:06:00,022


852
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:07,262
♫  I turn my head and try to deny it  ♫

853
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:12,992
♫  But it's you in the end  ♫

854
01:06:12,992 --> 01:06:20,822
♫  Even if I close my eyes and cover my mouth  ♫

855
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:25,502
 I should've done something that makes tons of money. 

856
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:27,472
 I feel a bit regretful today. 

857
01:06:27,472 --> 01:06:29,502
 She must've learned her place now. 

858
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:31,232
 She knows she's nothing now. 

859
01:06:31,232 --> 01:06:34,492
 Oppa, I said I liked you. 

860
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:36,342
 But it was all a lie. 

861
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:39,252
 I was playing with you because I was bored. 

862
01:06:39,252 --> 01:06:42,012
 So, forget a terrible person like me. 

863
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,362
 Be happy, Oppa. 

864
01:06:45,362 --> 01:06:48,700
♫  But it's you in the end  ♫
