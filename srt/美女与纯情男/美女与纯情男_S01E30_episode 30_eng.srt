1
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:49,427
   

2
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,847
Seon Yeong, what brings you here at this hour?

3
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,407
You bitch.

4
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:05,107
- Seon Yeong. 
 - You bitch!

5
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:09,447
You abandoned Pil Sung with me.

6
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:11,957
You abandoned the newborn with me.

7
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:14,767
And you've been lying to me all this time?

8
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:20,917
That's why you approached me to befriend me, right?

9
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:26,517
You pretended to be my friend so you could keep an eye on Pil Sung.

10
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,187
How could you do that?

11
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:31,237
How could you do that? How?

12
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:33,157
You call yourself a human?

13
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,617
What kind of person are you?

14
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:42,187
That newborn... That tiny little newborn.

15
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,947
You abandoned that poor baby yourself.

16
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:51,357
You touched my son and hugged him with those dirty hands.

17
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:54,177
You washed him and carried him on your back!

18
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:58,107
You rubbed your evil face...

19
00:01:58,107 --> 00:02:03,187
on my son's cheeks, kissed him, and caressed him!

20
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:14,237
I can't forgive you when I think about it.

21
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:18,877
No, I want to stomp on you and kill you!

22
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,597
You bitch! You bitch!

23
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,487
You dirty bitch!

24
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,367
You ugly bitch!

25
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,237
- How could you! 
 - Honey! Honey!

26
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:28,777
How could you? How?

27
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,877
Honey, Honey, Honey.

28
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:33,607
Aigoo, Seon Yeong!

29
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:39,137
Honey, she's not a human.

30
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,107
Honey, she really isn't.

31
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:44,587
Yes, she's not even a human.

32
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:47,637
So, let's go home. Let's go.

33
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,587
How could you do this to me?

34
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,857
How could you do that, pretending to be a friend?

35
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:56,327
Let's go home. Let's go home.

36
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:06,467
Aigoo, aigoo! Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

37
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,827
You should be punished for abandoning your own child alone.

38
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:14,247
But you attached yourself to us and did all this crazy stuff?

39
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:19,597
I've never seen such an awful bitch like you in my life!

40
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,717
Without knowing anything,

41
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:25,167
we've been wearing and eating what you've been giving us.

42
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:29,197
And we bowed at you profusely to thank you!

43
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:34,137
Aigoo, you horrible bitch!

44
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:37,097
You awful bitch!

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:06,040


46
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:15,427
 Let me see. 

47
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:18,617
 Aigoo. You already kicked the blanket? 

48
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:21,857
 Did it feel stuffy? Did it? 

49
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,117
 Cutie. 

50
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,657
 Let's go. 

51
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,057
 Oh, my. 

52
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:33,127
 Gosh, Seon Yeong! 

53
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,477
I'm sorry, Seon Yeong.

54
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:48,257
That's how much I wanted to see Pil Sung.

55
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,997
I knew I shouldn't have,

56
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:57,127
but I wanted to be by his side somehow.

57
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,337
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,037
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:25,257
Mom, I need to go to the restaurant now.

60
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:29,487
I'll stay with Seon Yeong. You can get going now.

61
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:33,177
You just opened the restaurant.

62
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:35,677
The owner can't be absent too much. Go.

63
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:38,807
Myeong Dong, stay at the restaurant with Hyeon Cheol.

64
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,717
Okay.

65
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:47,117
Honey, Pil Sung is our son, no matter what people say.

66
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:51,487
So hang in there for Pil Sung's sake, okay?

67
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,767
I'll be right back.

68
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,327
Mom, make sure to stay close to her, okay?

69
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,897
Okay, don't worry.

70
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,317
Aigoo, Seon Yeong.

71
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,297
Aigoo, Seon Yeong.

72
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:17,187
Aigoo, Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong...

73
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,937
   

74
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:32,407
It's because you didn't have enough time to say goodbye.

75
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:37,887
Don't avoid sadness or regrets. Just accept it.

76
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,287
You need time to do that.

77
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:45,647
It's been two years, not two weeks or months.

78
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:47,167
But that wasn't enough?

79
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:52,007
It can happen when you have a lot of regrets or guilt toward the deceased.

80
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,720
Guilt?

81
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,400
   

82
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:10,637
 It can happen when you have a lot of regrets or guilt toward the deceased. 

83
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,977
That quack doctor.

84
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,637
Guilt?

85
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,567
Guilt?

86
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,157
The only thing I'm guilty of is loving Do Ra sincerely.

87
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:25,407
I didn't wrong her in any way.

88
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,467
Did I push her to die?

89
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:30,677
She died on her own. On her own!

90
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,990
   

91
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:39,297
Why did you do that?

92
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,157
Why?

93
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:07,087
Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong...

94
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,067
Seon Yeong, I made you some porridge.

95
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,157
Get up and have some.

96
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,877
You can't keep skipping meals like this.

97
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:19,027
Get up. Yes.

98
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,907
Goodness...

99
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,237
You need to eat something...

100
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:32,607
and get energy back if you want to hate her.

101
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:37,787
You can't even hate someone if you have no energy.

102
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,077
Here.

103
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:46,237
Have some mulkimchi* broth and squid jeotgal, too. 
  (Water kimchi) 

104
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:49,427
Gosh, seriously.

105
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,577
That Jang Soo Yeon.

106
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,577
The more I think about her, the more sneaky she is.

107
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:02,537
We were so thankful when she paid Pil Sung so much for the contract money.

108
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,637
But all of that was calculated.

109
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:08,557
It was to keep Pil Sung by her side.

110
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:10,997
Gosh, seriously.

111
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,657
Hey! Seon Yeong!

112
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:16,777
Gosh, Seon Yeong!

113
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:18,347
What's wrong, Seon Yeong?

114
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:21,387
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong!

115
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:26,807
Yes, Seon Yeong. Where are you? I just came out.

116
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,507
Why was it me?

117
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:35,347
Why did you abandon Pil Sung in front of my house?

118
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,357
Because you knew I couldn't have a baby?

119
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:41,847
You thought I'd raise him happily if you gave him to me?

120
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:47,947
You deceived me and stayed close to Pil Sung.

121
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,547
Did I seem that easy to you?

122
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,797
Did you think so little of me?

123
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,737
Seon Yeong, I'm sorry.

124
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:58,797
It's my fault.

125
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,347
It really is my fault.

126
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:04,347
It's your fault?

127
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,537
You've been lying to me for 34 years.

128
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,197
Your fault?

129
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:12,507
It's your fault?

130
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:21,997
Seon Yeong, that's how much I wanted to stay by Pil Sung's side.

131
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,637
That's how much I wanted to see my son, Seon Yeong...

132
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,757
What? Your son?

133
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:31,137
Did you just say "my son"?

134
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,597
How dare you say that?

135
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,207
How is Pil Sung your son?

136
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,817
How dare you call him your son? How dare you?

137
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:45,337
What right do you have to call him your son?

138
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:48,757
How dare you! You bitch!

139
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,107
How could you!

140
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:57,577
How could you do this to me?

141
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:01,737
I thought of you as my friend without knowing all this.

142
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:04,597
I thought of someone like you as my friend.

143
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,597
How...

144
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:10,597
- How could you? 
 - Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong, no! Stop!

145
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,597
Stop, Seon Yeong!

146
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:15,857
I... I'll do it. Move!

147
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:20,437
Hey! How dare you make Seon Yeong cry?

148
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:25,377
Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? You bitch!

149
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:28,027
Gosh, what's going on?

150
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:30,357
How could you do this to me...

151
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,477
How dare you...

152
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:36,467
Why are Seon Yeong and her mother-in-law doing that to Soo Yeon?

153
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:38,527
How could you do that?

154
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,557
What are you doing right now?

155
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:41,997
Are you crazy?

156
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,357
My gosh.

157
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,787
Soo Yeon, are you okay? What's going on?

158
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,277
Why are you letting them beat you?

159
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:50,197
Kim Seon Yeong, Ma'am, what are you doing?

160
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,977
Why do this out in the streets like children?

161
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,717
Why would you two beat up Soo Yeon?

162
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:57,710
- What's the reason, exactly? 
 - We beat her for a reason!

163
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,180
Why would I beat her for no reason?

164
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,047
What do you mean? What could she have done?

165
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:06,037
I can't believe it. Even if she deserved to die, you can't do this out in the streets.

166
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,377
Go inside.

167
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:10,767
Ae Gyo, I'm okay. Don't butt in and just go inside.

168
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,587
What are you talking about? Don't butt in?

169
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,837
You mean you'll keep getting hit?

170
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,907
Go inside!

171
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:20,027
Where are you going? Where are you going?

172
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,657
Come here. Where are you going, you bitch?

173
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:26,697
- Gosh, she must be crazy. What's wrong with her? 
 - Hey, hey!

174
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:28,697
Gosh, seriously!

175
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,257
Mother...

176
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:31,997
Seon Yeong.

177
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:39,067
Hey, Jang Soo Yeon. Are you stupid? Are you a fool?

178
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,307
You should've fought them back.

179
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,677
Why did you just let them beat you?

180
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:47,307
What did you do to deserve that, exactly?

181
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,937
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:54,907
Gosh, what happened to you?

183
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,197
Who did that to you?

184
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,567
You know her friend, Pil Sung's mom.

185
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:03,347
Seon Yeong and her mother-in-law were pulling out her hair together.

186
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,257
Out in the streets, of all places. So vulgar.

187
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,937
W-What?

188
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:09,757
I-Is that true?

189
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:11,417
Why?

190
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:15,387
It's nothing. I'm okay.

191
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:22,147
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon!

192
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,347
Gosh, she even locked the door.

193
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,027
Soo Yeon, open the door!

194
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:27,457
Talk to me, Soo Yeon.

195
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:30,087
What's going on?

196
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:35,087
Pil Sung's mom and grandma grabbed my mom by her hair? Is that true?

197
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,807
- Yes. 
 - Why?

198
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,377
How am I supposed to know that?

199
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:42,707
They beat her up as if she had committed adultery.

200
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:44,697
They were like, "You need to be punished!"

201
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:48,657
What could she have possibly done to deserve that?

202
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:53,297
I know. I don't know why her best friend is doing this to her.

203
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:57,447
 Did Pil Sung's grandma reveal our secret by chance? 

204
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,167
 No, no. She promised to keep it a secret. 

205
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,807
 It can't be. 

206
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:07,597
President Jang can't attend the meeting due to an emergency.

207
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:14,457
The President Jang said she would go with Writer and Director Go's decision regarding Ms. Kim.

208
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:20,387
I looked into the matter. It looks like Ms. Kim was forced to do that due to a situation at home.

209
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:24,917
Writer, things are taken care of at the nightclub.

210
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:29,527
So, let's just keep Ms. Kim. She fits the character well, too.

211
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:34,217
I know she's inexperienced, but how could she cause trouble like this?

212
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,847
She has no basic understanding.

213
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,477
I don't have a good feeling.

214
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:43,027
Writer, she's the actor we chose.

215
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:46,737
She's very much regretting her actions.

216
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:48,957
We've been working with her all this time.

217
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:52,477
I hate to lose Ms. Kim, too.

218
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:57,087
You know how much I insisted on her since she was perfect for the role.

219
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:03,227
You know how much I fought President Jang to cast Ms. Kim.

220
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,387
But how could she disappoint me like this?

221
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,457
Gosh, what am I supposed to do?

222
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:13,123
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

223
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:19,387
Did they have to fire you because you sang at a nightclub a few times?

224
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:21,877
It's not like you stripped or anything.

225
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,327
What are we going to do?

226
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:29,317
President Lee said he'd look into it. I wonder what happened.

227
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,397
You got fired. You got fired.

228
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,867
That Pil Sung bastard must've been eager to fire you.

229
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,817
You managed to seize a good opportunity,

230
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:41,297
but because I suggest you perform at the nightclub...

231
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:44,047
I should've gotten money elsewhere.

232
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:47,157
No, it's okay.

233
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,567
Ji Yeong, what's this?

234
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,437
Why is your face here? Why do you do stuff like this?

235
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:56,137
What do you mean, why? It was because of you.

236
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:59,097
It was to pay for your settlement.

237
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,237
Settlement? You said it didn't cost money.

238
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:06,317
Aigoo, you believed that? How could you be out without settlement money?

239
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:07,977
What?

240
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:14,197
Did you make her do this, then?

241
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,307
Was I supposed to let you go to jail?

242
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:19,227
But this isn't right. You should've just let me go to jail!

243
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,607
You bastard, do you even...

244
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:26,357
You have no idea what jails are like! Seriously...

245
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:30,097
Mom, how could you do this?

246
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,407
You promised not to make Do Ra do stuff like this.

247
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:38,747
Don't you remember how bad we felt after she died because we only made her suffer?

248
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,477
That's why you promised not to do this to Do Ra... Ji Yeong ever again.

249
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,407
- But how could you do this? 
 - No, Oppa.

250
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,417
I said I'd do it. I did.

251
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,177
I'm really okay. I mean it.

252
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,867
I'm the one who was at fault.

253
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:55,567
I could've gone to jail. Why would you...

254
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,917
Why would you do something like this?

255
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,677
Hey, Park Do Shik! "Something like this"?

256
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:04,507
What's so bad about singing a few songs at a nightclub?

257
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:08,087
It's their fault for firing her after casting her because of it.

258
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,477
Did she commit a grave sin or something?

259
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,637
Do they think they're so above it all?

260
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:17,067
Mom, you can't just do that.

261
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,737
You little bastard!

262
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:23,817
We saved you from going to jail. What did you say just now?

263
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:26,817
Gosh, there's no point in having a son!

264
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:31,107
How could he not understand how I feel? How could he?

265
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:33,227
Gosh, seriously!

266
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,637
 Having hobbies would be great. 

267
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:42,517
 Seeing someone else would help, too. 

268
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:45,877
 I'll prescribe you medicine. Make sure to take it, too. 

269
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:52,987
Fine, I'll take the medicine.

270
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:55,807
He must be an expert for a reason.

271
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,287
Park Do Ra is dead.

272
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,617
But I keep thinking the country bumpkin is her.

273
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:06,197
It's just an illusion created by my weak heart.

274
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:09,927
I'll take the medicine and fix it.

275
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:29,017
   

276
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:42,327
Yes, Tae Hee.

277
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:02,197
What did you want to tell me urgently?

278
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:08,667
I got fired, right?

279
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:12,187
You wanted to tell me that, right?

280
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,657
Of course, I got fired.

281
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:21,977
I have to perform at the nightclub nine more times.

282
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:23,957
How could they work with me?

283
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,907
No, you didn't get fired.

284
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,387
Stop teasing me.

285
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:39,717
I know President Jang and Writer wanted me fired since they couldn't allow me to perform at the nightclub.

286
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:45,407
Ji Yeong, Director Go took care of all that.

287
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:46,837
Pardon?

288
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,757
Director Go did? How?

289
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:53,837
I managed to put together 10 million won

290
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,167
and went to the nightclub to cancel your contract.

291
00:20:57,167 --> 00:21:02,547
But they said your contract was canceled, and the penalty was paid, too.

292
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,677
W-What are you talking about?

293
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:10,267
Director Go went to the nightclub and even paid the penalty.

294
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,067
- What? 
 - And...

295
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,617
President Jang and Writer kept insisting on replacing you,

296
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:18,737
but Director Go said he'd work with you

297
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:22,887
and he'd be responsible until the end.

298
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,757
Is that true?

299
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,547
Yes.

300
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:31,527
Ji Yeong, we really need to work hard from now on.

301
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:35,047
That's how we'd return the favor to him. You know what I mean?

302
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:37,267
You would've gotten fired immediately if it wasn't for him.

303
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,867
But he saved us.

304
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:44,747
Director Go must care about you a lot.

305
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:47,107
Director Go?

306
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:04,837
 Hello, Director. Can we meet right now? 

307
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:16,253
Director, thank you.

308
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,673
President Lee told me everything.

309
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,443
I should've gotten fired,

310
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:26,903
but you paid the penalty for me

311
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:33,053
and you told Writer and President Jang that you'd be responsible for me.

312
00:22:34,023 --> 00:22:36,873
Thank you so much.

313
00:22:36,873 --> 00:22:42,293
And I'm so sorry I caused trouble.

314
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:48,233
Work hard and return the favor with good acting.

315
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,263
Okay. I really will work hard.

316
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:55,043
I'll do the best I can. But...

317
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:03,923
I can't pay you back right now.

318
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:11,073
I'll pay you back as soon as I get the contract money.

319
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:14,343
Please wait until then.

320
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:18,053
Take your time with that.

321
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:21,703
And Ji Yeong,

322
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:25,933
we said you made a mistake since you're inexperienced,

323
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:29,713
but if you do this again, it'd no longer be a mistake.

324
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:33,663
All the efforts you've made might get ruined then.

325
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,963
Yes, I'll make sure this never happens again.

326
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:38,163
I swear I won't allow it.

327
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:43,853
Okay. Put everything in the past and solely focus on acting now.

328
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,183
Okay.

329
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:54,803
The writer gave in at the last minute because we really need you on our drama.

330
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:59,223
So, don't be so discouraged from this.

331
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:01,513
Okay.

332
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,873
Director,

333
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:19,723
you're being so generous to me.

334
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:23,413
I really don't know what to do.

335
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:26,753
Don't feel pressured, Ji Yeong.

336
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:31,893
I promised you that I'll always help you whenever you face hardship.

337
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:34,373
That I'll always protect you.

338
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:38,563
So, talk to me first if you face any trouble.

339
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:46,643
Ji Yeong, do you know why I'm just waiting for you instead of approaching you?

340
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:48,433
Pardon?

341
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,853
You must be confused enough right now.

342
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,623
I don't want to add to your stress.

343
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,743
Until you understand, accept the situation,

344
00:24:56,743 --> 00:25:01,353
and get settled, I'm giving it some time.

345
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:07,323
You live with President Baek now, but if I kept approaching you,

346
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:11,343
you'd feel more stressed between President Baek and me.

347
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,583
I don't want you to feel stressed.

348
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:20,803
When you were Do Ra, you had a rough time because of President Baek.

349
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:25,023
I'm sure President Baek read through your contract.

350
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,163
She must've known performing at a nightclub was against the contract.

351
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:32,523
But she still made you perform there.

352
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:37,033
Do you think she would've done that if she cared about you?

353
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:43,353
You had such a hard time because of this incident.

354
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:49,113
President Baek did that to Do Ra, too. That's why I wanted you to move on from your past

355
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:51,753
and live as Kim Ji Yeong.

356
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:59,203
Director, I'm so thankful that you thought of me and cared for me.

357
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,963
I can't thank you enough for that.

358
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:08,023
But... please don't speak badly of my mom anymore.

359
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:14,453
I'm just happy having a meal with my mom, older brother, and little brother.

360
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:18,213
I have no money, and we can't all live together yet,

361
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:21,303
but I'm happy I have a family.

362
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:27,833
Okay, I understand.

363
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:41,133
Here's a present to express my gratitude.

364
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,983
I'll get going now.

365
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:14,923
Why does my heart keep leaning toward the Director?

366
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:20,543
Why do I keep having feelings for the man who criticizes my mom?

367
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,403
No, Kim Ji Yeong.

368
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:29,303
Director Go is a bad man who tried to separate a mother and child.

369
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:35,393
But...

370
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:41,143
I don't think he's a bad man.

371
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:48,523
How could those moist and deer-like eyes belong to a bad man?

372
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:56,383
What am I supposed to do now?

373
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:17,243
Aigoo, Ji Yeong!

374
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:19,503
I just got a call from Jae Dong.

375
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:22,673
My gosh, I can't believe you didn't get fired.

376
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:26,093
This is so wonderful.

377
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:29,653
Wait just a moment. The potato and beef stew are almost done. Let's eat this

378
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:35,313
and look for a salon to do your hair and makeup, okay?

379
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:39,033
Excuse me, Ahjumma.

380
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,583
Yes?

381
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,283
Well...

382
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:49,603
I keep thinking Director Go isn't a bad man.

383
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,863
He paid the penalty for canceling the contract.

384
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:56,093
The writer kept insisting on replacing me,

385
00:28:56,093 --> 00:29:02,703
but he said he'd take responsibility and helped me not get fired, apparently.

386
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:10,023
The fact that he didn't tell me I was Park Do Ra

387
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:16,053
and you were my mom because I think he really cares about me.

388
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:20,053
Because he wanted me to live as Kim Ji Yeong, not Park Do Ra.

389
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:25,593
Because I'd have a hard time if people found out I was Park Do Ra.

390
00:29:25,593 --> 00:29:29,453
So? What are you trying to say?

391
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:34,733
I think I was too harsh on him.

392
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:40,043
I don't think I should've been harsh to him and broke up with him.

393
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:46,953
So... Are you saying you'll get back together with him?

394
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,053
Pardon?

395
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,873
Wake up, Kim Ji Yeong!

396
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,673
You're still being tricked by that bastard like a fool.

397
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:56,673
Why do you think he paid for your penalty?

398
00:29:56,673 --> 00:30:00,823
He's trying to use you with money. He's toying with your heart!

399
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:03,963
Gosh, seriously.

400
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:10,763
How could you get tempted by someone who tried to separate us?

401
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:12,793
Don't you care about how I feel?

402
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,803
Do you care about him more than me?

403
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:17,143
N-No, it's not like that.

404
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:19,193
Once you receive the contract money,

405
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:23,143
we'll pay him back first. Stop with the silly thoughts, okay?

406
00:30:24,203 --> 00:30:25,493
Okay.

407
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:29,433
Gosh. Gosh, seriously...

408
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:32,063
Gosh, I'm so upset...

409
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,173
Seon Yeong, have some porridge.

410
00:30:46,173 --> 00:30:47,873
You need to have a bite.

411
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:50,973
It's bad for you if you don't eat anything.

412
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:55,313
Mother,

413
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,713
why have I been living so foolishly?

414
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:05,773
I thought she was a good friend.

415
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:09,543
I only felt grateful...

416
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:13,813
and I wanted to return the favor.

417
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:19,503
Why didn't I ever suspect it?

418
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:26,583
Is there anyone as foolish as me?

419
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:30,493
Seon Yeong,

420
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:36,703
anyone can fall for it if a fraudster is determined to deceive to you.

421
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:39,373
You know how good that bitch was to you.

422
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:42,873
And she loved Pil Sung so much as a baby.

423
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:46,503
It was because he was her baby.

424
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:51,653
We just thanked her without suspecting anything.

425
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:58,823
She abandoned her baby in someone else's nest like a cuckoo.

426
00:31:58,823 --> 00:32:02,673
Why are you a fool? She's the devious one.

427
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:06,323
How could she be so terrible while pretending to be a human?

428
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:09,043
Gosh, what a bitch.

429
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:14,063
 Are you in there? It's Ma Ri! 

430
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:18,053
Seon Yeong, stay in here.

431
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:20,463
I'll send her back.

432
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:39,073
Ma Ri, what are you doing here?

433
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:41,213
Grandma, what happened?

434
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:43,933
Why did you grab my mom's hair with Seon Yeong?

435
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:50,723
Did you tell her all about our secret by chance?

436
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:52,223
What?

437
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:58,763
You promised me to keep it a secret!

438
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:04,383
M-Ma Ri, I tried to keep it a secret at first, too.

439
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:08,343
But you can't keep this a secret.

440
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:12,123
Your mom committed a grave sin.

441
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,023
That's why I couldn't keep it a secret.

442
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:17,263
But you can't just do that.

443
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:22,383
How could you pull my mom's hair like that?

444
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:27,223
Young lady, I know she's your mom, but you can't defend her for that.

445
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:30,283
How about us, whom she fooled all this time?

446
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:33,583
Get out right now. And don't ever come back.

447
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:37,643
I hate to see your whole family.

448
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:41,053
Get out right now. Get out!

449
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,543
I'm sorry.

450
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:44,823
Ma Ri, Ma Ri... Seriously!

451
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,773
Why would you say that to her? You scared her.

452
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:49,883
Ma Ri! Ma Ri!

453
00:33:49,883 --> 00:33:52,133
 Ma Ri! 

454
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,973
Ma Ri, hold on! Ma Ri.

455
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:58,123
Gosh, Ma Ri.

456
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:01,823
I'm so sorry I didn't keep the promise.

457
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:05,733
But your mom indeed did the wrong thing.

458
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:09,953
She abandoned Pil Sung in front of our house when he was a baby.

459
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:13,683
And she kept frequenting our house, acting innocent.

460
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:20,583
Ma Ri, imagine your close friend lied to you.

461
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,823
Imagine how much you'd feel betrayed and angry.

462
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:30,933
Pil Sung's mom has been lied to by your mom for 34 years.

463
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:35,143
So, even if my daughter-in-law plucked all of your mom's hair,

464
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:38,453
she won't be able to blame her for it.

465
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:42,713
- You know that, right? 
 - Yes. I do, Grandma.

466
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,133
Take care.

467
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,863
Ma Ri.

468
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,073
Hey.

469
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:51,853
Gosh, seriously.

470
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:54,093
What's going on?

471
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:57,323
This is so upsetting.

472
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:03,003
Honey, I'm home.

473
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:07,023
Are you feeling sick?

474
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,303
It's nothing.

475
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:13,023
I'm just tired.

476
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:16,173
Take a shower and have dinner.

477
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:20,523
I came home from work, but you won't even let me see your face?

478
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:22,753
What's with you?

479
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,753
Are you angry with me about something?

480
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:32,053
Honey, what happened to your face?

481
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,923
Did something happen?

482
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:38,183
It's nothing.

483
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:44,013
Chairman Gong, come out for a second.

484
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,113
What did you say?

485
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:50,463
Seon Yeong grabbed her by her hair?

486
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:52,043
In front of our house, even?

487
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:57,223
Yes, it wasn't just Seon Yeong. Her mother-in-law, too.

488
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:00,963
Why?

489
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:03,813
We want to know, too, but she won't tell us.

490
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:08,923
But considering the circumstances, Soo Yeon must've done something terribly wrong.

491
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:10,953
But still.

492
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:14,413
What could she have done to yank her hair like that?

493
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,513
They could've just talked it out.

494
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:19,993
Everyone knows we're the APP Group's chairman's family.

495
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:24,233
What if someone saw her getting beaten?

496
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:28,263
I heard they beat her up like she was an adulterer or something.

497
00:36:28,263 --> 00:36:32,403
What if a false rumor like that ends up spreading?

498
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:36,173
Auntie, how could you say that?

499
00:36:36,173 --> 00:36:37,983
Hold on.

500
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:44,723
Honey, sit up straight.

501
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:55,123
Is that all true?

502
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:58,193
Seon Yeong and her mother-in-law did this?

503
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:01,543
I'm asking if they did that to your face.

504
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:05,683
There was a reason for it.

505
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,923
So, you should just play ignorant.

506
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:14,373
Even if there were a reason for it, how am I supposed to just ignore this?

507
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:16,233
Honey,

508
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,243
I...

509
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:23,133
did something bad to Seon Yeong.

510
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:26,533
So, please don't do anything.

511
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:30,703
Please just play ignorant.

512
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:34,063
What did you do wrong, exactly?

513
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:37,463
Honey, just tell me. Tell me.

514
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:41,813
Yes, Seon Yeong. Tell us.

515
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:44,893
That way, we can understand and let it go.

516
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:46,753
Yes, Soo Yeon.

517
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:50,413
How could you be treated like this by that poor family?

518
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:53,900
It's not like you fought them back, either.

519
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,430
She was just letting them beat her up.

520
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:00,953
I'll tell you later. Later.

521
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:05,633
I said I'll tell you later! So, stop this, everyone!

522
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:08,423
Mom said she'll tell you later!

523
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:11,293
Everyone get out of this room! Right now!

524
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:14,793
Ma Ri, calm down. It's nothing.

525
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:19,193
We're asking out of concern since it seems like something's going on with her.

526
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:23,113
Please leave so she can rest.

527
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:26,453
Ma Ri, you, too. Let's go.

528
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,723
Don't give her a hard time.

529
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:41,693
She doesn't want to talk. Why do you keep asking?

530
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:44,213
Dad, Great Aunt, and Second Grandma,

531
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:47,473
do you want to talk to someone who keeps asking when you're stressed out?

532
00:38:47,473 --> 00:38:50,043
Just leave her alone!

533
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,151
Mother,

534
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:08,651
Hyeon Cheol, and Auntie.

535
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:14,431
Please don't let Pil Sung know about this.

536
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:19,061
I beg you, Mother.

537
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:22,911
I don't want to break his heart.

538
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:25,101
I beg you, Mother.

539
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,678
Gosh, Seon Yeong.

540
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:31,738
I know I can't keep a secret, but I won't tell him about this.

541
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:35,288
I can assess the situation, too.

542
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:40,848
Seriously. I said I wouldn't tell him!

543
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,888
 I'm home. 

544
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:45,818
Pil Sung, you're home.

545
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:49,488
 Hello! Hello! 

546
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,278
What's with the atmosphere?

547
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:53,038
Is something going on?

548
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:54,948
What are you talking about?

549
00:39:54,948 --> 00:39:58,508
We're all watching TV together.

550
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:00,858
Are you sure nothing's going on?

551
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:02,418
What are you talking about?

552
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:05,488
You must be tired. Go rest upstairs.

553
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:07,198
Okay.

554
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:10,868
 I'm Lee Sa Rang, twin cousin of Lee Ye Ran. 

555
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:15,488
 I hope you have a wonderful time with the twins today. 

556
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:17,348
 Thank you! 

557
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:22,338
 Actually, it's been longer than 10 years for me since I saw her... 

558
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,428
Gosh, seriously.

559
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:27,868
How could that woman abandon a child at her friend's house?

560
00:40:27,868 --> 00:40:29,418
What's going on right now?

561
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:33,328
Shut your mouth. Gosh, I told you to be careful!

562
00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:36,288
I told you to never talk about it.

563
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:38,228
All right.

564
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:57,538
 Please don't speak badly of my mom anymore. 

565
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:04,188
 I'm just happy having a meal with my mom, older brother, and little brother. 

566
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:07,918
 I have no money, and we can't all live together yet, 

567
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:10,688
 but I'm happy I have a family. 

568
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:37,358
 Ji Yeong, thank you for the bag. 

569
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:39,208
 I'll enjoy it. 

570
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:52,038
 I don't want to pressure you in any way. So feel comfortable with me. 

571
00:41:52,038 --> 00:41:56,898
 Once you get your memory back, you'll find out the truth 

572
00:41:56,898 --> 00:42:00,128
 and you'd no longer misunderstand me. 

573
00:42:00,128 --> 00:42:06,128
 But I want you to live happily as Ji Yeong without hurting. 

574
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:10,888
 And no matter how you'd end up being, I'm rooting for you. 

575
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:12,488
 Good night. 

576
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:20,758
 Why am I tearing up? 

577
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:26,228
 Why is he texting me that and making my heart waver again? 

578
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:30,398
 He should've just thanked me for the present and left it at that. 

579
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:32,928
Gosh, who is it at this hour?

580
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,508
It's nothing.

581
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:49,828
Where are we going? 
    

582
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:52,388
Just follow me. Be quiet.

583
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:54,828
Welcome. Ms. Baek Mi Ja?

584
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:58,818
Yes, hello. Ms. Kim Ji Yeong is having her first shoot today.

585
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:00,968
Please take extra care of her.

586
00:43:00,968 --> 00:43:03,358
- Okay. Come this way. 
 - Okay.

587
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:05,358
Let's go. Let's go.

588
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:07,618
Gosh, that feels great.

589
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:11,348
Gosh, how are you feeling, Ms. Kim?

590
00:43:11,348 --> 00:43:13,048
Oh, my...

591
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,618
It's really nice.

592
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:18,388
I've been so tired the past few days.

593
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:22,298
My whole body feels relaxed now.

594
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:28,318
Right, Ms. Kim? I'll be in charge of taking care of you from now on.

595
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:30,948
You'll become a star soon.

596
00:43:30,948 --> 00:43:33,298
You need to take good care of yourself.

597
00:43:33,298 --> 00:43:35,238
Thank you...

598
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:40,658
President Baek.

599
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:49,008
Enjoy, enjoy.

600
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,678
- Take a lot of photos. 
 - Okay.

601
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:52,618
Hashtag Cha Bong Soo.

602
00:43:52,618 --> 00:43:55,568
Have another one. Another one. You must be tired.

603
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:58,658
Gosh, Gong Hyung. My Gong Hyung.

604
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:00,818
Why did you send stuff like this again?

605
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,978
I've never done anything for you. You're making me feel bad.

606
00:44:02,978 --> 00:44:06,368
I should celebrate your new project as your big bro.

607
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:09,088
And I invested in this drama, too.

608
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:12,518
So let's make it another hit, okay?

609
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:17,298
Okay. I'll act with my heart and soul so you don't suffer loss.

610
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:19,078
Okay.

611
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:22,648
I'm sorry, but I need to start shooting soon.

612
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:25,808
Do you want to see the shoot since you're here?

613
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:28,238
- Sure, sounds good. 
 - Okay, got it.

614
00:44:28,238 --> 00:44:29,908
Shouldn't we go golfing sometime?

615
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:31,838
I know.

616
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:37,978
I'm uneducated since I lived in the countryside my whole life,

617
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:41,688
but I'm strong, and I'm good at cleaning, too.

618
00:44:41,688 --> 00:44:45,598
And I have worked at a Korean restaurant for years.

619
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:50,088
So I'm an amazing cook, too.

620
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:53,248
Tell me if you're craving anything.

621
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,778
I can cook anything for you.

622
00:44:55,778 --> 00:45:00,108
Make soft tofu stew with clams, then.

623
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:04,968
I'll taste it and decide if I'd hire you.

624
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,618
Okay.

625
00:45:07,198 --> 00:45:09,528
Got it.

626
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:17,118
Cut, okay! Nice!

627
00:45:17,118 --> 00:45:18,798
Ji Yeong.

628
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:24,528
Aigoo, what do we do with her?

629
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:28,728
She's smitten because that Go Pil Sung complimented her once.

630
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:32,258
I need to keep my eye on her. Seriously.

631
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:37,708
What's Gong Jin Dan doing here?

632
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:47,478
 That country bumpkin looks just like Park Do Ra when she's like that. 

633
00:45:49,408 --> 00:45:54,088
 No, why am I looking at her here? 

634
00:46:00,468 --> 00:46:03,518
What brings you here, President Gong?

635
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:06,108
I'm here to cheer for Cha Bong Soo.

636
00:46:06,108 --> 00:46:08,218
I invested in this drama, too.

637
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:11,388
By the way, what are you doing here?

638
00:46:11,388 --> 00:46:14,808
I'm here for work, too.

639
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:18,048
I'll leave you to it, then, President Gong.

640
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:26,988
Is that actor named Do Do in this drama?

641
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:30,818
I don't think I saw her on the list.

642
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:35,058
Gosh. Good job, Ji Yeong. Here.

643
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:38,788
How did you finish a scene with so many lines in one go?

644
00:46:38,788 --> 00:46:42,628
You lost memory, but your body must remember how to act.

645
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:44,378
Your passion for acting.

646
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:47,978
Yes, your instincts are still alive.

647
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:49,538
You must be hot.

648
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:51,378
What's this?

649
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:54,528
Why is Baek Mi Ja with Ji Yeong?

650
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:56,538
Is she her manager?

651
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:59,338
Why didn't she tell me so, then?

652
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:03,998
 What an amazing coincidence. 

653
00:47:11,068 --> 00:47:12,868
What's wrong with me now?

654
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:17,108
It's hot, isn't it? You worked so hard.

655
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:18,748
Why does that country bumpkin look like Park Do Ra?

656
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:21,598
- Is the water cold? 
 - Yes, it's nice.

657
00:47:21,598 --> 00:47:23,770
Drink more. Drink more.

658
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,090
   

659
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,860
   

660
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:45,948
 It's hot, isn't it? You worked so hard. 

661
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:48,578
Why were they together?

662
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:59,278
Hey, Secretary Jo. I need you to look into something.

663
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:06,638
Ma'am, why did you do that to my daughter-in-law, Soo Yeon?

664
00:48:06,638 --> 00:48:10,648
Everyone knows Seon Yeong and Soo Yeon are best friends.

665
00:48:10,648 --> 00:48:15,908
How could you join in and pull out her hair?

666
00:48:15,908 --> 00:48:21,318
I don't know what's going on, but I can't tolerate it.

667
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,388
That's why I came to hear your apology.

668
00:48:23,388 --> 00:48:26,798
Seon Yeong and you need to apologize to Soo Yeon sincerely.

669
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:29,668
What did you say? Apologize?

670
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:31,498
Apologize?

671
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:33,908
Talk about turning on us!

672
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:36,248
How dare you tell me to apologize?

673
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:39,158
- How dare you tell me to apologize? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

674
00:48:39,158 --> 00:48:42,538
Gosh, I mean, ma'am...

675
00:48:42,538 --> 00:48:46,418
We wanted to sue you for assault,

676
00:48:46,418 --> 00:48:49,548
but I'm here to talk it out, considering their old friendship.

677
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:51,828
How could you take it out on me, too?

678
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,438
Gosh, what did you say? Assault?

679
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:57,058
Yes, sue us! Sue us!

680
00:48:57,058 --> 00:48:59,978
My daughter-in-law can't eat because of her.

681
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,838
She can't sleep a wink since she feels betrayed and hurt.

682
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:04,328
And what did you say just now?

683
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:07,518
Assault? Sue? Old friendship?

684
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:10,368
Gosh, get out! Get out, you scoundrels!

685
00:49:10,368 --> 00:49:14,548
You people make my blood boil. Get out, get out!

686
00:49:14,548 --> 00:49:15,818
Don't be like that.

687
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:19,018
Aigoo, you've got to be kidding me.

688
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:23,328
Guys, guys, Seon Yeong and Soo Yeon had a fight.

689
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:26,868
- Gosh, what are you talking about? 
 - Don't try to lie about stuff like that.

690
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:31,288
It's true. Soo Yeon was attacked by Seon Yeong, even.

691
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:33,048
She even pulled out her hair.

692
00:49:33,048 --> 00:49:34,768
- She pulled out her hair? 
 - She pulled out her hair?

693
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:38,898
Yes, so I even went to Seon Yeong's house to complain about it.

694
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:41,798
I wanted to sue them for assault.

695
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:46,948
But that I'd let it go as long as Seon Yeong apologized, considering their old friendship.

696
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:49,588
Seon Yeong wouldn't even see me

697
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:53,228
and her mother-in-law told me to go ahead and sue.

698
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:57,638
She said Seon Yeong is dying right now because of  Soo Yeon's betrayal.

699
00:49:57,638 --> 00:50:03,888
You guys, have you heard if anything happened between them recently?

700
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:07,238
Gosh, maybe they fought about that.

701
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,208
- About what? 
 - About what?

702
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:15,838
There had been a rumor about Seon Yeong's son, Pil Sung, being an abandoned child.

703
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:22,528
I'm guessing Soo Yeon must've told someone about that. And Seon Yeong found out.

704
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:25,148
Do they have another reason to fight but that?

705
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,898
Soo Yeon is unbelievable if that were true.

706
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:31,678
She seemed to be devoted to Seon Yeong, but she's been saying that behind her back?

707
00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:34,678
I can't believe Soo Yeon would've done that, though.

708
00:50:34,678 --> 00:50:41,558
But if they fought, it had to be about him being an abandoned baby, as Mi Sook said.

709
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:46,108
What did you say?

710
00:50:46,688 --> 00:50:51,958
So, Pil Sung wasn't Seon Yeong's biological son...

711
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,978
but an abandoned baby?

712
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:58,008
Yes. That means Soo Yeon knew that

713
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:03,248
he was an abandoned baby a long time ago.

714
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:07,148
She must've known since they've been so close.

715
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:12,638
That's why she defended her when there was a rumor like that.

716
00:51:12,638 --> 00:51:16,108
She should've kept the secret to the grave, then.

717
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:19,768
How could she betray her like this?

718
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:24,268
B-Betray? What do you mean by that?

719
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:27,608
The fact that Pil Sung was an abandoned baby...

720
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:30,678
It was a secret only Soo Yeon knew about.

721
00:51:30,678 --> 00:51:33,788
But now, all of my classmates know about it.

722
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:36,258
Because Soo Yeon told everyone.

723
00:51:37,258 --> 00:51:39,768
Is that true?

724
00:51:39,768 --> 00:51:43,498
Yes. I heard about it just today.

725
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:48,688
That's why I'm telling you now that Pil Sung was an abandoned baby.

726
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:54,238
Seon Yeong acting like that toward my wife is...

727
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:56,338
because...

728
00:51:56,338 --> 00:51:59,548
Yes, I think so.

729
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:02,188
Seon Yeong was betrayed by her trusty friend.

730
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:05,308
She must've been so shocked.

731
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:17,928
Mom,

732
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:23,018
Pil Sung's grandma apparently overheard

733
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:26,358
my conversation with you in the parking lot.

734
00:52:27,158 --> 00:52:33,628
So, she asked me if Pil Sung was your son.

735
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:36,458
So, I said yes.

736
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:41,598
I asked her to keep it a secret,

737
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:45,338
but Seon Yeong ended up finding out about it, too.

738
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:48,968
Mom, this is all my fault.

739
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:51,318
I'm the one to blame.

740
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:55,028
No, Ma Ri.

741
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:57,298
You did nothing wrong.

742
00:52:57,948 --> 00:53:00,878
This is all my fault.

743
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:04,618
I deserve to be punished.

744
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:11,588
I should've held back even though I missed Pil Sung a lot.

745
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,708
I should've been more careful.

746
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:17,308
I shouldn't have talked about him in the parking lot.

747
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:20,118
Mom,

748
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:22,848
I'm sorry.

749
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:30,498
It's okay, Ma Ri.

750
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,628
I hurt you, Ma Ri...

751
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:39,428
I also hurt Pil Sung and Seon Yeong, too.

752
00:53:40,058 --> 00:53:45,268
I'm the one who shouldn't be forgiven. Why are you sorry? Why?

753
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:50,138
Mom, don't cry.

754
00:53:57,448 --> 00:54:01,108
I feel so guilty that I want to die.

755
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:07,758
I'm sorry, Ma Ri. I'm sorry.

756
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:16,798
I don't know what to do since Seon Yeong is refusing to eat.

757
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:22,028
I hope she eats beansprouts and kimchi soup, at least.

758
00:54:26,668 --> 00:54:28,998
Gosh, Seon Yeong!

759
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:31,758
Seon Yeong, aigoo.

760
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:35,018
Seon Yeong, are you okay?

761
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:40,268
Hold on. Seon Yeong, would you like something to drink?

762
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,858
No, Mother.

763
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:46,398
I'll stop lying down now.

764
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:49,618
Yes, Seon Yeong. I'm glad to hear you say that.

765
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:53,418
Why should you be so upset about that bitch?

766
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,168
Yes, let's forget everything now.

767
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,278
Just let go of everything now.

768
00:54:59,278 --> 00:55:03,208
Yes, I'm going to.

769
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:07,788
But there's one thing that bothers me.

770
00:55:07,788 --> 00:55:13,078
Pil Sung still works at that woman's company.

771
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:17,128
As you said, she must've started that company

772
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:22,448
to keep Pil Sung by her side. I'm sure of it.

773
00:55:22,448 --> 00:55:24,838
It's so obvious.

774
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:30,658
I know all that, but...

775
00:55:30,658 --> 00:55:35,358
I can't even tell Pil Sung to quit working there.

776
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,558
He must see her face all the time.

777
00:55:39,558 --> 00:55:43,958
Thinking about that drives me insane, Mother.

778
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,798
Seon Yeong, the thing is...

779
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:47,758
 Is anyone home? 

780
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:51,008
 Seon Yeong. 

781
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,658
Hold on. What was that noise?

782
00:55:54,658 --> 00:55:57,628
Isn't it that bitch?

783
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:00,848
My gosh.

784
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,568
I mean, are you serious right now?

785
00:56:05,568 --> 00:56:09,068
How dare you set your foot in our house?

786
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:12,788
How dare you have the gall to do such a thing?

787
00:56:14,328 --> 00:56:16,308
Hello.

788
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:21,758
Seon Yeong, I'm here.

789
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:23,668
How...

790
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:26,378
How dare you come here?

791
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:29,118
How dare you come here?

792
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,738
Seon Yeong, I'm sorry.

793
00:56:41,738 --> 00:56:44,388
I really deserve to die.

794
00:56:44,388 --> 00:56:48,548
I know I can't be forgiven, no matter how much I beg.

795
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:54,988
So, I never thought of Pil Sung as my son.

796
00:56:55,988 --> 00:56:58,858
I never even dared to dream that.

797
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:00,648
You raised Pil Sung.

798
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:03,168
He's your son, Seon Yeong.

799
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:09,388
But Seon Yeong, I just wanted to see my Pil Sung growing up. That's all.

800
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:11,068
What?

801
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:14,668
My Pil Sung?

802
00:57:14,668 --> 00:57:19,238
Seon Yeong, that's all I wanted.

803
00:57:19,238 --> 00:57:23,908
I just wanted to see how Pil Sung grows up. That's all.

804
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,408
How dare you?

805
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,308
What gives you the right to say "my Pil Sung"?

806
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:31,258
How dare you keep an eye on Pil Sung?

807
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:32,928
Don't you have any shame?

808
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:35,888
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong. That's enough.

809
00:57:35,888 --> 00:57:38,668
You'll pass out at this rate. Stop.

810
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:43,848
You started the company to take Pil Sung away, right?

811
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:47,058
I raised him all my life, and you took him using money?

812
00:57:47,058 --> 00:57:49,478
What kind of person are you?

813
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:53,398
You...

814
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:55,738
You said you were sorry, right?

815
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,278
You said you deserve to die, right?

816
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:02,148
Let go of Pil Sung from your company, then.

817
00:58:02,148 --> 00:58:07,368
Fire Pil Sung yourself and let go of him immediately.

818
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:11,308
- Seon Yeong! 
 - Let go of Pil Sung right now!

819
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:13,768
- Seon Yeong! 
 - Let go of Pil Sung!

820
00:58:13,768 --> 00:58:16,358
Seon Yeong, hold on! Stop that!

821
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:20,008
Hey, hey! Go! Get out of here right now!

822
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:23,558
Stop, Seon Yeong. Stop. Stop...

823
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:26,088
Get out! Get out! Get out!

824
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:29,658
Seon Yeong, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

825
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:32,888
Gosh, what's going on? Leave!

826
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:34,668
Have a seat, Seon Yeong.

827
00:58:34,668 --> 00:58:38,308
My Pil Sung? My Pil Sung?

828
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:40,588
I'm sorry, Seon Yeong.

829
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:42,128
Get out, I said!

830
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:45,168
Don't, Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong...

831
00:58:46,158 --> 00:58:48,748
Welcome, Chairman.

832
00:58:48,748 --> 00:58:51,028
How's my wife doing?

833
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:55,398
She left. She said she'd stop by somewhere briefly.

834
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:57,788
What did you say?

835
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:00,698
She didn't say where she was going?

836
00:59:01,908 --> 00:59:03,708
Honey.

837
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,478
Honey! Honey, are you okay?

838
00:59:06,478 --> 00:59:09,488
Hold her. Honey.

839
00:59:10,178 --> 00:59:12,988
Did she see Seon Yeong again?

840
00:59:20,678 --> 00:59:25,248
Did you see Seon Yeong again?

841
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:30,668
Did you...

842
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:35,128
really say something hurtful to Seon Yeong?

843
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:39,408
Is that why she's doing this to you?

844
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:43,478
No, right?

845
00:59:45,698 --> 00:59:49,008
You're not that kind of a person.

846
00:59:56,078 --> 00:59:57,788
Honey,

847
00:59:58,688 --> 01:00:00,558
do me a favor.

848
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:02,398
Please...

849
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,688
just play ignorant for now.

850
01:00:06,548 --> 01:00:08,208
I...

851
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,448
I'll straighten everything out.

852
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:12,338
Honey.

853
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:14,328
Please.

854
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:22,478
Okay, then.

855
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,758
Get some rest.

856
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:46,948
   

857
01:00:46,948 --> 01:00:50,158
Kim Ji Yeong is represented by Bbaek Entertainment?

858
01:00:50,158 --> 01:00:53,958
That's CEO Baek Mi Ja's company.

859
01:00:54,758 --> 01:00:58,118
So, Kim Ji Yeong is CEO Baek's actor?

860
01:00:58,868 --> 01:00:59,988
What?

861
01:00:59,988 --> 01:01:02,578
   

862
01:01:02,578 --> 01:01:06,398
And why do they share the same address?

863
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:09,328
Could they be...

864
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:12,768
living together?

865
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:27,288
They really live together.

866
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:32,088
Whoa. What does this mean?

867
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:41,488
How dare you come back here again?

868
01:01:41,488 --> 01:01:44,768
I wanted to discuss something with you.

869
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:47,038
Regarding Pil sung.

870
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,718
How dare you...

871
01:01:50,718 --> 01:01:54,168
How dare you discuss Pil Sung with me?

872
01:01:55,928 --> 01:01:58,588
Seon Yeong, as you said,

873
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:03,038
I tried to shut down the company and not see Pil Sung.

874
01:02:03,738 --> 01:02:05,848
But now,

875
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,688
the production of the drama already started.

876
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:13,918
If we quit now, Pil Sung will be responsible for everything.

877
01:02:13,918 --> 01:02:15,948
So, Seon Yeong,

878
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:19,428
I know you hate me, but please...

879
01:02:19,428 --> 01:02:24,828
wait until... this project ends.

880
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:30,018
You think I'd be fooled by you again?

881
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:33,298
Don't try to pull tricks and let go of him immediately.

882
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:35,218
No, Seon Yeong. No.

883
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:38,948
I swear I won't see Pil Sung.

884
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:44,188
I'll only treat him as the CEO of the production company.

885
01:02:44,188 --> 01:02:47,438
I won't hint at it for the rest of my life.

886
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:55,258
Promise me.

887
01:02:55,258 --> 01:02:59,348
You have to swear to me about this with your mouth.

888
01:02:59,868 --> 01:03:02,868
Okay, I promise.

889
01:03:02,868 --> 01:03:05,188
I swear.

890
01:03:05,188 --> 01:03:07,318
I'll keep the promise, Seon Yeong.

891
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:12,368
Let me warn you.

892
01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:16,348
Don't ever be by Pil Sung's side.

893
01:03:16,348 --> 01:03:23,728
And make sure to kick him out as soon as this project ends.

894
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:26,108
Understand?

895
01:03:27,078 --> 01:03:28,568
Yes.

896
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:31,958
I will. I'll do that.

897
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:35,868
Leave if you're finished.

898
01:03:35,868 --> 01:03:38,448
I can't stand the sight of you.

899
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:44,558
Seon Yeong, I know it's hard to believe,

900
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:49,748
but I really liked you.

901
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:55,728
I was sincerely thankful that you were my friend, and I was happy.

902
01:03:57,438 --> 01:04:00,178
As long as you forgive me,

903
01:04:01,828 --> 01:04:05,098
I'd like to go back to the way we were.

904
01:04:07,658 --> 01:04:09,448
You...

905
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,968
are the only friend I have.

906
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:17,548
You're the only one I consider a friend.

907
01:04:19,138 --> 01:04:20,898
What?

908
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,878
What? Friend?

909
01:04:24,248 --> 01:04:28,798
Did you say "friend" just now?

910
01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:34,798
Because you thought of me as your friend,

911
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,388
you abandoned Pil Sung in front of my house

912
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:44,878
and have been peeping at him like a thief his whole life?

913
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:49,688
Hey, you disgusting bitch!

914
01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:53,448
Does Seon Yeong still look like a pushover to you?

915
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:54,938
You bitch!

916
01:04:54,938 --> 01:04:56,918
How dare you...

917
01:04:56,918 --> 01:04:59,078
You little bitch...

918
01:04:59,078 --> 01:05:01,988
- Mom! 
 - Are you kidding me?

919
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:04,548
Mom, come here.

920
01:05:14,648 --> 01:05:16,958
What did you just say?

921
01:05:19,068 --> 01:05:23,588
Ms. Soo Yeon... abandoned me?

922
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:33,388
President Jang...

923
01:05:35,118 --> 01:05:36,990
This person?

924
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:46,600


925
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:49,678
   

926
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:51,988
♫  And tell you  ♫

927
01:05:51,988 --> 01:05:57,398
♫  I shout out your name  ♫

928
01:05:57,398 --> 01:05:59,638
♫  My love  ♫

929
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:04,728
♫  My last tears you won't get to see  ♫

930
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:10,268
♫  I'll hold you tightly and let you go  ♫

931
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:15,568
♫  I call for you again  ♫

932
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:17,898
♫  My love  ♫

933
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:21,818
♫  I say, "I love you," but you can't  ♫

934
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:24,398
 Grandma? Your grandma from the countryside? 

935
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:25,908
 What are you doing? 

936
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:28,728
 Your husband is here. Won't you prepare a meal? 

937
01:06:28,728 --> 01:06:31,308
 Oppa found out? 

938
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:34,458
 It's because I'm so stupid. I'm sorry about everything. 

939
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,708
 Ahjumma, could you forgive my mom? 

940
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:39,478
 I'm so mad at her, too. 

941
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:45,178
 But I think my mom spent a hard time by Oppa's side, too. 

942
01:06:45,178 --> 01:06:48,278
 Is Seon Yeong still mad at you? 

943
01:06:48,278 --> 01:06:53,438
 I'm curious how you two ended up this way.
