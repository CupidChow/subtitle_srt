1
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,959
   

2
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:55,352
I thought Ma Ri just had childish curiosity toward Pil Sung,

3
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:58,272
but as I talked to her,

4
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:05,612
I noticed she likes him very sincerely.

5
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:09,922
Yes, yes. It seems that way.

6
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:14,962
She still might be immature, but she's old enough to marry.

7
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:19,912
I'm telling you this because I couldn't just ignore it as her father.

8
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:21,682
To be honest,

9
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:28,802
I've been considering Pil Sung for a long time.

10
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:37,482
I'm thinking of seeing him once because of that.

11
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:40,762
But since Ma Ri is lacking in a lot of ways,

12
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:44,752
I thought it'd be the right thing to do to ask you first.

13
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:48,272
So, I risked being impolite and came by.

14
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:56,532
 My gosh, will we become in-laws with a chaebol family if we're okay with it? 

15
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:01,502
I know you're very shocked.

16
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:06,192
Ma Ri might be lacking a lot,

17
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,632
but she's very sweet and pure.

18
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:11,992
She's still improving a lot.

19
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:16,712
Ma Ri is the only child I have.

20
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:22,942
I can give anything as long as she can be happy.

21
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,972
I wouldn't mind giving her everything I have.

22
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:32,032
What did you say?

23
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:35,162
You were at Seon Yeong's just now?

24
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:41,452
Yes. I asked them if I could tell Pil Sung about Ma Ri.

25
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:45,952
They said they'd think about it since it was so sudden.

26
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,172
Honey!

27
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:51,472
What is wrong with you?

28
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:54,952
How could you do such a thing without discussing it with me?

29
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,952
Do you think this makes any sense?

30
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:01,162
Well, "do such a thing"?

31
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:03,832
Did I do something wrong?

32
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:07,432
Why are you getting so angry?

33
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:13,862
We should coax Ma Ri and help her get over it.

34
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:17,212
But you're making things even worse right now.

35
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:19,752
This is why I went there by myself.

36
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:23,762
Because you keep saying it won't work without trying.

37
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,612
There's nothing I can't do right now.

38
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:27,922
It's for our Ma Ri.

39
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:30,712
She says she likes him so much.

40
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,962
Don't you care about her at all?

41
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,512
She's crying right now.

42
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:39,612
Does that not bother you? My heart is ripping apart.

43
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:45,252
I want to win Pil Sung's heart with money if I could.

44
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,152
What did you say?

45
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,872
Yes, you did the right thing.

46
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:59,202
He must've felt so desperate to go and beg them.

47
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:03,052
You should be comforting him. Why are you getting angry at him?

48
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:07,072
I know. You like Pil Sung, too, Soo Yeon.

49
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,982
Wouldn't it be good if it worked out?

50
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:15,982
Honey, I could kneel in front of them for Ma Ri.

51
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:18,972
If you're worried about your friendship being ruined,

52
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:21,602
I'll be responsible for that, too.

53
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:29,032
Honey, let's give it a try for Ma Ri together. Please?

54
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:41,132
What do we do about this?

55
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,732
What do you mean? Didn't you hear him just now?

56
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:49,982
The moment Pil Sung marries into that family, he'll become a chaebol's son-in-law.

57
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:54,892
A chance like this is rarer than winning a lottery.

58
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,862
This is a chance given to us by God.

59
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,492
There's no point worrying about this. I'm on board.

60
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:02,782
I-I don't want it.

61
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:08,732
I just want Pil Sung to find someone ordinary and live happily.

62
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:13,172
Aigoo. Happily paying off the loan, you mean?

63
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,322
And what's wrong with Ma Ri?

64
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:18,522
There are tons of strange women these days.

65
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:21,982
She's a hundred times better than someone who'd betray him.

66
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,422
Don't you agree, Hyeon Cheol?

67
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:26,652
Do you think so, too?

68
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,692
How Pil Sung feels is important.

69
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:32,432
If he likes Ma Ri, it will happen.

70
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,082
If he doesn't, it won't.

71
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,682
Yes, I think how Pil Sung feels is important, too.

72
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,512
Yes, yes.

73
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,022
How about you?

74
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,002
I like Ma Ri, too.

75
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,452
But if he marries her,

76
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:55,422
he'd have to care for her his whole life.

77
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:59,372
What's the point of being rich? It's better to have a peace of mind.

78
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:11,682
Yes, I agree with what Seon Yeong said, too.

79
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:17,562
But we'd regret it forever if we missed an opportunity like this.

80
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:22,262
According to my life experience, money is the most important thing in the world.

81
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,632
Money is a filial child, and it determines your happiness.

82
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:31,762
As long as Pil Sung likes Ma Ri, all of us would be set for life.

83
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,112
Hold on.

84
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:40,282
What if he says he'd become the son-in-law of APP Group?

85
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:44,782
How about us? What would happen to the rest of us?

86
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:47,492
 I'm home. 

87
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,932
 Pil Sung, you're home. 

88
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,492
Hey, hey...

89
00:06:57,202 --> 00:07:01,712
Chairman Gong said he wants me as his son-in-law?

90
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:06,572
Yes, he says he always liked you.

91
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,452
Hey, since Ma Ri likes you so much,

92
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:15,572
you have the option of becoming a chaebol son-in-law.

93
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:18,442
The entire APP Group will be yours, Pil Sung.

94
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,462
Mother.

95
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:25,072
What? You haven't heard what he thinks yet.

96
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:29,042
Pil Sung, think carefully.

97
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,972
One decision can determine your whole life.

98
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:36,342
This would change your life and all of our lives.

99
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:44,232
I...

100
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,072
I don't want to.

101
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,442
I don't know Ma Ri well.

102
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,762
She's just Soo Yeon's daughter to me.

103
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:57,712
Is it because she became disabled from the accident?

104
00:07:57,712 --> 00:08:01,932
Gosh. If that's why, you have nothing to worry about, Pil Sung.

105
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:07,312
From what I saw, she might sound a little awkward,

106
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:11,612
but she's very pure, sweet, and so pretty.

107
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:18,152
Regardless of all that, I'm not interested in seeing anyone now.

108
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:21,972
So, Mom and Dad, please talk to Chairman Gong for me.

109
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:24,072
So we avoid any miscommunication.

110
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,352
I'll go to my room now.

111
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,522
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

112
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:31,862
My gosh.

113
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,822
Pil Sung, that little...

114
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:36,002
He's not our child at all.

115
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:37,212
Mother.

116
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,572
What? Did I say something wrong?

117
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:44,802
He could make his father the CEO of a subsidiary company and all of us could live comfortably.

118
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:49,122
How could he say no immediately without even considering it?

119
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:52,652
He has no gratitude for raising him.

120
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:55,382
He's totally a son of a bitch.

121
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:58,302
- Mom! 
 - Mother!

122
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,592
President Gong!

123
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:05,352
Why are you standing here instead of going in?

124
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:06,822
I hate to tell you this, but they're closed because they're under construction.

125
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:09,792
but they're closed because they're under construction.

126
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,242
I should've looked into it beforehand.

127
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:16,022
What do we do, then?

128
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,992
President Gong, do you want webfoot octopus?

129
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:24,592
There's a really amazing webfoot octopus place five minutes walk from here.

130
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:27,552
How about we eat there instead?

131
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:29,752
- Webfoot octopus? 
 - Yes.

132
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:33,362
It tastes totally out of this world, I'm telling you.

133
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,202
Just trust me.

134
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,472
It's really amazing. Let's go.

135
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,962
Okay, let's go.

136
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,432
Let's see how tasty they are.

137
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,532
Okay. You can just follow me.

138
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:46,992
Okay.

139
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,822
Why is it suddenly raining?

140
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,442
 Gosh, what do I do? 

141
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,492
 He can't ruin his clothes again. 

142
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:57,862
 Those clothes must've cost several million won, too. 

143
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,682
 I need to do something. 

144
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,582
Wait...

145
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:08,082
Let's go.

146
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,602
What are you doing?

147
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,532
Your clothes will get wet. Let's go.

148
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:24,782
Well, okay.

149
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:39,282
She got off work early today.

150
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,732
She still hasn't come home.

151
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:45,112
Is she meeting someone?

152
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:07,112
I could drop you off at the house.

153
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:10,802
No, it's okay. It stopped raining.

154
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,672
I'm just grateful you drove me this far.

155
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,852
I live right nearby.

156
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:19,782
I enjoyed the meal. Thank you.

157
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:22,582
I'm the one who should thank you.

158
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:26,152
We have four more meals left, then.

159
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:30,432
Yes, four more.

160
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:34,252
Get home safely, then.

161
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:36,832
Yes, bye.

162
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,132
You scared me.

163
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:55,042
You scared the crap out of me.

164
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:59,792
Why are you standing there like a ghost?

165
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,992
Why did you come out of President Gong's car?

166
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:05,342
I had a meal with him.

167
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,122
He drove me here since it was raining.

168
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:14,442
But why would you have a meal with President Gong?

169
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:19,022
I said I'd treat him to a meal instead of compensating him for the jacket.

170
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:23,412
Why? Am I not supposed to eat with President Gong?

171
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,442
Don't eat with him from now on.

172
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:26,862
Don't see him privately, either!

173
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,562
Why not?

174
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:32,952
What gives you the right to decide who I hang out with?

175
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,372
- Why would you tell me that? 
 - Why?

176
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,942
It's a scary world out there.

177
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:41,522
You can't just get into a random man's car with no fear.

178
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:44,172
I'm worried, as I live in the same house as you.

179
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:46,672
You're talking nonsense again.

180
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:51,502
You drove me around day and night because you wanted to carpool, too.

181
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:52,912
What was that, then?

182
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:55,452
Are you not a man?

183
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:57,292
This is different from that.

184
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,142
I'm not just a random man.

185
00:12:59,142 --> 00:13:00,932
I'm a director who works with you

186
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,442
and I'm a trustworthy man who lives in the same house as you.

187
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:09,922
Aigoo, President Gong has great manners. He's a gentleman, too.

188
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:15,762
And even though I ruined his five million won jacket,

189
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:19,442
he doesn't tell me to pay him back. He just lets me buy him a meal.

190
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:22,672
He's a very kind man, too.

191
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:24,222
Ji Yeong,

192
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:30,172
I'm concerned about you as an older brother figure.

193
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:31,912
Why do you get bent out of shape?

194
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,962
What older brother?

195
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:38,352
We don't share the same last name or blood.

196
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,452
I don't like how that sounds at all.

197
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,612
And I can manage my business myself.

198
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:46,062
It's none of your concern.

199
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:49,162
Use this umbrella.

200
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,482
Forget it.

201
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:53,842
Take it, I said! You'll catch a cold!

202
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,662
 She's crying right now. 

203
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:18,642
 Does that not bother you? My heart is ripping apart. 

204
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:24,762
 I want to win Pil Sung's heart with money if I could. 

205
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:28,102
He's being so aggressive without a care.

206
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:33,762
What if Pil Sung wants to try seeing Ma Ri?

207
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,892
It can never happen. Never.

208
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,732
The Director is so nosy.

209
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,702
How dare he tell me what to do?

210
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:56,542
Why does he care if I take someone else's car or not?

211
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,932
 You scared me. 

212
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:14,082
By the way, why was he holding umbrellas at the bus stop at night?

213
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,462
He brought two, even.

214
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,402
By chance...

215
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,212
This is no good.

216
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:30,292
I'll see this through tonight.

217
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,342
 Director, I need to talk to you for a second. 

218
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:40,032
 I need to tell you something right now. 

219
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:46,202
You said you wanted to say something. What is it?

220
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:54,162
Director, I've been thinking a lot about this.

221
00:15:54,162 --> 00:16:00,342
There's only one reason for you to get mad that I was in another man's car.

222
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:04,672
Are you jealous by chance?

223
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,392
No, this is jealousy.

224
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,672
There are no other explanations for it.

225
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,492
Jealous?

226
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:14,532
M-Me?

227
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,052
Yes.

228
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:20,942
And why were you standing at the bus stop?

229
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:23,882
You were even holding two umbrellas.

230
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,932
Since it's been raining a lot all day,

231
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:31,272
you came to pick me up so I don't get rained on, right?

232
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:33,302
Well, that's—

233
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:37,182
I'm right since you're getting flustered.

234
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:42,682
As someone who works with you and lives next to you,

235
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,752
I should be doing that, at least. And...

236
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:46,882
what if you catch a cold and miss work?

237
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,782
Everyone on set would suffer, then.

238
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,472
It's all for our staff—

239
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:53,722
How does that make any sense?

240
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,452
Try to sound more sensible.

241
00:16:56,452 --> 00:17:01,882
Every little thing you do for me is something you'd do to a woman you like.

242
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:05,262
Should I ask everyone on set tomorrow? To see if I'm right or wrong?

243
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:09,022
Why would you do that? Don't bring your personal life to work.

244
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:13,222
I noticed your feelings for me. Why do you keep denying it?

245
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:16,442
Why do you keep denying how you feel?

246
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:22,312
The night you brought me ttoekbokki, you definitely told me

247
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:25,422
that there's a reason you can't like me.

248
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:29,092
What's that reason, exactly?

249
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:35,522
I can handle any reason.

250
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,642
Because...

251
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:41,182
I really...

252
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:45,272
like you very sincerely.

253
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,602
I never said such a thing.

254
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:59,642
I don't even remember.

255
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:01,612
I don't know what you're talking about.

256
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:04,362
I definitely heard it.

257
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,652
Do you really not remember?

258
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,202
I must've talked nonsense while drunk.

259
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:17,052
I wanted to help you since you're our team's newest staff member.

260
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:20,742
And since you're so careless like you were today, I tried to help you out of concern.

261
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:24,432
But you can't keep being mistaken about it.

262
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:30,512
Mistaken?

263
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:39,862
That's why I asked you not to be nice to me.

264
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:45,692
Since I'm stupid, I think you like me if you're nice to me even a little bit.

265
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,922
Why were you standing with umbrellas so late at night?

266
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:52,762
How dare you stir up my emotions carelessly?

267
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:57,142
And you're denying it again after doing all that.

268
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:01,462
You really are a bad man.

269
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:06,102
You're a bad man.

270
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,132
Ji Yeong,

271
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:14,872
I think I was wrong. No, I was wrong.

272
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,492
I'm so sorry. I won't do it again.

273
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:23,822
I'll never wait for you with umbrellas again and I won't insist we carpool, either.

274
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:26,482
I won't suggest we eat together, either.

275
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:33,012
It's so nice to clarify everything.

276
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:39,742
If I ever flirt with you again...

277
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:43,822
I'd be Park Ji Yeong, not Kim Ji Yeong.

278
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:52,442
 Park Do Ra. 

279
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,912
 Tell me, then. Tell me. 

280
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:59,092
 What should I do? 

281
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:02,292
 What am I supposed to do? 

282
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,472
 Just tell me, please. 

283
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:09,422
 When will you come back? 

284
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,282
 When? 

285
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:21,682
   

286
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,582
No.

287
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:33,952
No, if I bring that up at this hour, he'd find it strange.

288
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,162
I've been getting along well with Pil Sung.

289
00:20:41,552 --> 00:20:46,222
No, no. I still need to stop this, no matter what.

290
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,972
It's Pil Sung.

291
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:59,982
Why is he getting all wet?

292
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,812
Pil Sung!

293
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,402
- Ahjumma. 
 - Hey.

294
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:17,142
Why are you walking in the rain?

295
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,702
Did something happen?

296
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:23,022
No, I stepped out, but it started raining.

297
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:26,472
It's nice and cooling to get rained on.

298
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:30,442
What did you say? Nice and cooling?

299
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,522
Still, you might catch a cold.

300
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:35,482
I'm okay. You're getting wet.

301
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:38,942
By the way, what brings you here?

302
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:45,042
I was running an errand nearby, and I saw you walking in the rain.

303
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,972
And Pil Sung...

304
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,162
Ma Ri bothers you a lot.

305
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:58,792
But my husband visited you and said something weird, too. I'm sorry.

306
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:02,052
I know Ma Ri is lacking a lot.

307
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:05,392
I yelled at Ma Ri's dad a lot for doing that.

308
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,382
No, I'm sorry.

309
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:11,612
But it's not because of Ma Ri's condition.

310
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:14,862
I can't afford to see someone and consider marriage now.

311
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:18,032
Anyway, I'm sorry.

312
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:24,812
I just want to think of her as your daughter and a little sister instead.

313
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:28,362
No, no. I'm sorry.

314
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:31,312
Don't worry about it. It's really okay.

315
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:39,252
I just want you and Ma Ri to be more like siblings, too.

316
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:44,252
Thank you for saying that.

317
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:47,192
Drive safely since it's raining.

318
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:50,802
Okay. Hey, hey, Pil Sung. Take this with you.

319
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,452
No, I wanted to get rained on a lot for a change.

320
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:57,592
- Drive safely. 
 - No, hey!

321
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,680
   

322
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,360
Seon Yeong, there you are.

323
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,680
Soo Yeon, you came early.

324
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,580
Soo Yeon,

325
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm so sorry.

326
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,830
It looks like Pil Sung wants to focus solely on work now.

327
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,960
He said he doesn't want to see anyone yet.

328
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,920
Come on. Don't feel so guilty telling me that.

329
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm the one who's sorry.

330
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,390
Not only did Ma Ri bother you at your house,

331
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,370
even my husband visited you and pressured you.

332
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,270
I would've stopped him if I had known, but I had no idea.

333
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm so sorry.

334
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,670
No, I'm sorry.

335
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,850
Pil Sung is in an important period in life, too.

336
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,850
He needs to work and build his career now.

337
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,430
And it's not something the elders can just force on him.

338
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,500
That's what I'm saying.

339
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,800
And maybe it's because I've seen him since he was a baby...

340
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,100
He feels like a son to me.

341
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:34,640
And he should meet a healthy and nice woman and be happy.

342
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,970
I'll make sure to find someone like that for him.

343
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,310
Gosh, Soo Yeon.

344
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm so thankful for you saying that.

345
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:49,900
I was so worried about how I should talk about this.

346
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,750
I didn't want our friendship to suffer from it.

347
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,260
What?

348
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,320
He said no?

349
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Is he not interested in seeing Ma Ri?

350
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,040
He wouldn't have said no if he were.

351
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,710
He said no immediately?

352
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,300
Yes.

353
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,320
I think that's better than giving her false hope.

354
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,250
So, stop getting bossed around by Ma Ri and move on.

355
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,800
We'll find someone nice for her if we just wait.

356
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,930
How should I explain this to Ma Ri?

357
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,030
She's waiting, feeling hopeful.

358
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,330
You can't start something when you have nothing.

359
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,410
I need some contract money to find someone to represent.

360
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,400
Yes.

361
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,980
My life was ruined because of that Gong Jin Dan bastard.

362
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,550
If he didn't cancel all of the ad contracts,

363
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,120
Do Ra wouldn't have died... and I wouldn't be in this mess.

364
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,730
Come on, let go of me.

365
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,240
This lady is back.

366
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,770
We'd be in trouble if President Gong found out. Let's kick her out.

367
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,200
Let go! Let go!

368
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,710
I'm Baek Mi Ja! Let go, I said!

369
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,570
President Gong! President Gong!

370
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,440
President Gong! I need to tell you something.

371
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,660
Please let me talk to you. Let me talk to you.

372
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,380
I need to tell you something!

373
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,350
President Gong...

374
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,560
I'm sorry for causing a scene, President Gong.

375
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,330
I have common sense, too.

376
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:01,170
It wasn't easy for me to come here myself.

377
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:07,110
But this is the only place I could go to in this world.

378
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:17,670
Since Do Ra died, I lost everything.

379
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,390
I lost money, my house, people, and everything.

380
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,850
But I couldn't end my life, so...

381
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,380
I tried selling kimbap on the subway and I washed dishes at restaurants, too.

382
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,030
I've been doing all sorts of things to survive.

383
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,910
I really liked you a lot, President Gong.

384
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,550
I really wanted you to be my son-in-law.

385
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,930
But forget about everything else.

386
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,800
Just think of my Do Ra and help me just once.

387
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:07,380
If you help me just once, I'll never ever come back here again.

388
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,220
You're nothing to me.

389
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,990
Why are you squeezing out tears here?

390
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,900
Huh? 
    

391
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,080
He should've just made it 100 million won. Only 50 million?

392
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,420
President Gong used to be cooler than this.

393
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,600
No. This is still a lot.

394
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,850
I'll get back on my feet with this.

395
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,020
Yes, I'll have a fresh start.

396
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,780
So hot.

397
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,150
Do Shik! Do Shik!

398
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,580
Mom, what are these shopping bags?

399
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,110
Did you use my card again? You promised not to do this!

400
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,500
You promised not to do this!

401
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,730
I didn't use your card! Do you think I only cause trouble?

402
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,400
How did you pay for this, then? You have no money.

403
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,190
Someone invested in me.

404
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,360
Who'd invest in you? That makes no sense.

405
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,090
It's true.

406
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,560
I'll get back into the management business.

407
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,890
At least I made Do Ra a top celebrity.

408
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,050
I swear I'll create the next Park Do Ra. Just wait and see.

409
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,150
Yes. So how much did you get?

410
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,110
Not that much. 50 million.

411
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,880
50 million...

412
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,930
Are you sure there are no strings attached?

413
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,130
No, I said. Have you always been fooled?

414
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,620
There's nothing wrong with the money. Don't worry.

415
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,570
Isn't 50 million kind of low?

416
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,910
These days, it costs a lot of money to create a star.

417
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,160
Even when I didn't have a single penny,

418
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,630
I turned Park Do Ra into a top celebrity.

419
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,500
This is nothing compared to that.

420
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,610
I'm confident.

421
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,700
So, Do Shik, just trust me and wait.

422
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,060
And when I get back on my feet, you'd work with me, okay?

423
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,050
Make me some ramen. I need to go look for an actor afterward.

424
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,080
Make me one. Hurry.

425
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,250
Okay.

426
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,030
   

427
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,830
How come there's no one good?

428
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,410
I got rejected again.

429
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,540
It's so annoying.

430
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,960
Excuse me, are you trying to be an actor by chance?

431
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,060
Yes. Who are you, by the way?

432
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:56,260
I'm President Baek Mi Ja of Bbaek Entertainment.

433
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,800
   

434
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,070
Dad, did I get dumped?

435
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,210
It's not because he doesn't like you. He just doesn't feel the same.

436
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,530
So, forget about Pil Sung now.

437
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't think about him anymore. Give up.

438
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,740
Dad, Pil Sung doesn't even have a girlfriend.

439
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,160
Why do you tell me to give up, then?

440
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,970
We have a lot of money. Tell him you'd give him the company and all the money we have.

441
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,270
That'd work, then.

442
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,340
Ma Ri, you can't win someone's heart with money.

443
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,010
There are things you just can't have.

444
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,720
Remember President Yang's son I asked you to meet?

445
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,230
You said you didn't like him.

446
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:59,070
I asked you and begged you, but you still didn't like him.

447
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,520
That's how one's heart is.

448
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,400
Begging and asking can't change it.

449
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,730
Okay.

450
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,350
I understand what you mean.

451
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,280
Please leave now. I want to be alone.

452
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,110
Get out, I said! I said I want to be alone!

453
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,470
Cut, okay! Nice!

454
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,700
That's a wrap for the day!

455
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,550
Thank you.

456
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,160
I heard Cha Bong Soo and Bi Bi had a fight and broke up.

457
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,080
It must be true.

458
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,100
Their eyes were so intense during the ending scene.

459
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,110
I'm glad we're almost done shooting.

460
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,980
The chemistry would've been ruined otherwise.

461
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,710
Ji Yeong, please pack the props in Room 1001.

462
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,260
Okay.

463
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,600
Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

464
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,240
Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

465
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,710
Ji Yeong! My gosh!

466
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,560
Ji Yeong, open your eyes. Ji Yeong!

467
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,650
Director,

468
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,410
I want to go home.

469
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,920
I... I want to get out of here.

470
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,090
Please take me home now.

471
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,850
I'm so scared.

472
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:52,580
Someone tried to take me away!

473
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,770
There's no one in here.

474
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,460
- Okay, okay. 
 - Ji Yeong.

475
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,740
It's okay. Let's go home.

476
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,380
Assistant Director.

477
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,200
Ji Yeong, are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

478
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,720
I just want to go home.

479
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,710
Let me just go home.

480
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay.

481
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,200
Thank you.

482
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,020
Ji Yeong.

483
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,630
Ji Yeong, what's wrong?

484
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,075
I don't know.

485
00:35:48,075 --> 00:35:52,435
I can't stop crying for some reason.

486
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,770
My head hurts so much...

487
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,480
and I'm so scared.

488
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,630
What do we do?

489
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,220
This is no good. Let's go to the hospital.

490
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,370
We should go to the ER since it's late at night.

491
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,690
Ji Yeong, let's get up.

492
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,540
I don't want to. I don't want to go to the hospital.

493
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,080
I don't want to go anywhere right now.

494
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,190
I just want to stay here.

495
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,080
Okay. I'll get you some medicine, then.

496
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,210
Director, she has a fever. She's boiling.

497
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,090
Okay.

498
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,460
Someone was shocked by something. Her head hurts, and she's scared.

499
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,990
She has a fever since she got rained on yesterday, too.

500
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,040
Just one moment.

501
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,040
That hotel...

502
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,930
   

503
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:30,620
Yes, it was that hotel.

504
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,790
It was the same hotel.

505
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,110
Why did I completely forget about this hotel?

506
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,210
Gosh, why did I shoot there?

507
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,650
She fell asleep after crying for a long time.

508
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,870
Did she say anything? What did she say happened?

509
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,960
She said she saw something strange at the hotel.

510
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,220
She said a dark figure pulled her in.

511
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,740
I guess that's why she's in shock.

512
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,490
Does that hotel have a ghost or something?

513
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,510
Or maybe she has some kind of trauma.

514
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,700
Trauma?

515
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,120
Should I wake her up?

516
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,620
I think we should give her the medicine.

517
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,240
No, sleeping might be better for her now.

518
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Let's give her the medicine when she wakes up.

519
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,900
Okay.

520
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,970
Hello?

521
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,790
Yes.

522
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

523
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,070
I'm sorry, Director. I think I need to get back on set.

524
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,270
I didn't get to clean up after the shoot at the hotel.

525
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,190
I need to settle the bill, too.

526
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,510
Yes, get going. Call me if anything happens.

527
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,060
Okay.

528
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,350
What do you think?

529
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,570
She's not bad.

530
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,230
She's pretty. She looks like Do Ra—

531
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,030
She looks like Do Ra when she was young.

532
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,450
She's nice and refreshing.

533
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,910
Right? Her age is perfect, too. She's 23.

534
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,760
She's a senior at acting school.

535
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,940
So, will she sign the contract?

536
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,290
Yes. I said I made Do Ra a star...

537
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,800
and I'd make her a star, no matter what.

538
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,940
And she said yes immediately. We picked her name, too.

539
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,280
- What's the name? 
 - Do Do.

540
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,520
Do Do.

541
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,090
I'll make Do Do the next Park Do Ra. I promise.

542
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,660
Since...

543
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,230
I sent Do Ra away like that,

544
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,680
I'll make up for it somehow. Somehow.

545
00:40:06,644 --> 00:40:10,644
 You bitch! Go away! 

546
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:35,361
Ji Yeong, what's wrong?

547
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:41,071
Director...Director, I'm scared.

548
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,421
I'm so scared.

549
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,351
It's okay, Ji Yeong.

550
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:50,921
Calm down. I'm here. Don't worry.

551
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:53,751
Did you have a nightmare?

552
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,161
I don't know.

553
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:59,451
I don't know if it was a memory or a dream.

554
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:09,191
Director, I think something happened to me at that hotel.

555
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:14,211
It was so vivid and scary.

556
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:26,701
Ji Yeong.

557
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:31,841
Ji Yeong, look me in the eyes.

558
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:38,431
Nothing happened to you.

559
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:42,991
You just had a bad dream.

560
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:44,821
It's okay.

561
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:50,361
Director...

562
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:55,868
I don't think I should get my memory back.

563
00:41:56,381 --> 00:42:01,741
I must've done something very bad in the past.

564
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:09,021
People followed me, swore, and pointed fingers at me.

565
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:13,981
They hit me and threw eggs at me, too.

566
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:18,471
While I was running away from them,

567
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,671
I fell into the water.

568
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:27,711
But it didn't feel like a dream. It felt so real.

569
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:34,931
Director, could this be the memory I lost?

570
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:44,123
I no longer want my memory back.

571
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:48,173
I'll just live like this instead of trying to get it back.

572
00:42:48,173 --> 00:42:50,473
I'd be relieved if it were a dream,

573
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:55,333
but if it's the memory I lost,

574
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:59,373
I don't ever want to remember it again.

575
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,893
I never...

576
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:07,293
want to remember it again.

577
00:43:18,253 --> 00:43:19,983
Ji Yeong,

578
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,403
it was a dream.

579
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:28,873
You had a bad dream since you've been tired lately.

580
00:43:30,453 --> 00:43:32,153
It happens to me sometimes, too.

581
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:36,413
So, don't worry about anything.

582
00:44:17,873 --> 00:44:20,753
 What do you mean? I was catching octopuses. 

583
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:22,673
 I need to sell them tomorrow. 

584
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:25,883
 Let's move to the next location! 

585
00:44:27,183 --> 00:44:32,623
 This world is so beautiful and worth living. 

586
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:34,693
 That's what I thought. 

587
00:44:34,693 --> 00:44:38,633
 I'll just live like this instead of trying to get my memory back. 

588
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:46,143
 Yes, Do Ra. 

589
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:48,633
 Just live as Kim Ji Yeong. 

590
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:52,903
 Don't go back to the painful life. 

591
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:57,613
 Let's just live this way, Do Ra. 

592
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:07,053
Aigoo, that was so rejuvenating.

593
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:09,593
This is why you should bathe in the morning.

594
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:12,813
- Right, no one was there, either. 
 - Yes.

595
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:15,013
- Do you want banana milk? 
 - That's why I'm here.

596
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:18,203
Looks like you're coming back from the bathhouse.

597
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:19,703
Yes.

598
00:45:19,703 --> 00:45:23,293
Right, I wanted to ask you something.

599
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:27,643
Is Pil Sung dating the lady in the rental unit by chance?

600
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:29,733
Pardon?

601
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:31,723
What do you mean?

602
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:35,883
Why would you say something so offensive first thing in the morning?

603
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,773
Why would Pil Sung date someone like that?

604
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:42,963
Well, I noticed they drive together every day.

605
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:46,933
What? She rides with him? With Pil Sung?

606
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:48,533
Yes.

607
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,033
Well, they work together.

608
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,113
He must've given her a ride a few times.

609
00:45:54,113 --> 00:45:55,563
Really?

610
00:45:55,563 --> 00:45:58,713
But it wasn't just a few times. They commute every day together.

611
00:45:58,713 --> 00:46:01,473
I thought something was going on.

612
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:03,493
Never mind, then.

613
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:05,453
Well...

614
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:06,963
Hey.

615
00:46:07,913 --> 00:46:09,623
What was that, anyway?

616
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:11,293
What's wrong with that lady?

617
00:46:11,293 --> 00:46:13,903
You should make it clear with Pil Sung.

618
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:16,843
What did she mean he drives her every day?

619
00:46:16,843 --> 00:46:19,253
Tell him not to do that again since people are watching him.

620
00:46:19,253 --> 00:46:21,653
Why would he drive her every day?

621
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:25,673
She must be exaggerating when it was just a few times.

622
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:34,973
My gosh. Oh, my...

623
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:36,753
Who's that?

624
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:40,973
What did I see just now?

625
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:43,440
That was Pil Sung, right?

626
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:50,063
But why did he come out of her rental unit at this early hour?

627
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:54,233
Did he sleep in her room, then?

628
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:57,363
Since when have they been doing this?

629
00:46:57,363 --> 00:47:01,183
Gosh, why would you say that, Mother?

630
00:47:01,183 --> 00:47:05,083
There's no way. He must've stopped by to ask something.

631
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,733
What would he ask at the crack of dawn?

632
00:47:08,733 --> 00:47:11,733
Mother, I'll go inside.

633
00:47:14,023 --> 00:47:20,243
Has he been rejecting Ma Ri because of this?

634
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:24,213
That little...

635
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:28,553
You scared me.

636
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:30,263
Mom, can't you knock?

637
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:36,213
Hey, Go Pil Sung, it looked like you were coming out of the rental unit just now.

638
00:47:36,213 --> 00:47:38,403
What's going on?

639
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:41,443
Why did you come out of there at this hour?

640
00:47:42,323 --> 00:47:45,253
Well, Ji Yeong is very sick.

641
00:47:45,253 --> 00:47:47,803
I bought her medicine and cared for her all night.

642
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:49,143
What?

643
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:52,103
She passed out on set yesterday.

644
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,223
I'm the person in charge. How could I ignore it?

645
00:47:54,223 --> 00:47:56,523
She had a fever all night, and she was in pain.

646
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:59,753
So, I made her porridge, too.

647
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:04,213
So, you mean you stayed up all night there?

648
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:07,213
Alone with her?

649
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:10,443
Mom, why are you making it sound so weird?

650
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:12,493
I just explained everything.

651
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:16,533
You should've told Auntie or me if she was sick.

652
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:21,363
Why would you stay up all night there? What if someone saw you?

653
00:48:21,363 --> 00:48:26,450
And what if she thinks you're a weirdo?

654
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:31,483
Hey, hey! Don't you know how the world is these days? You have no fear!

655
00:48:31,483 --> 00:48:35,123
You can't visit a woman who lives alone like that.

656
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:37,693
Mom, what are you thinking?

657
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:40,463
It's not like that. Don't get the wrong idea.

658
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:42,083
Are you sure?

659
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,863
Are you sure there's nothing going on between you two?

660
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:49,013
What do you mean? It's not like that.

661
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:51,173
Are you sure?

662
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:52,953
Yes.

663
00:48:52,953 --> 00:48:56,623
Why do you commute with her every day, then?

664
00:48:57,263 --> 00:48:58,313
What?

665
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:02,963
Why would people in the neighborhood ask if you two are dating?

666
00:49:02,963 --> 00:49:07,263
Why would you drive with her to work every day?

667
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:11,313
Mom, she works with me, and we live in the same house.

668
00:49:11,313 --> 00:49:14,663
It'd be weird for me to drive to work by myself.

669
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:17,083
That's why we commute together.

670
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,823
- I'll go to work. 
 - Don't commute with her from now on.

671
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,283
Don't do it! People might get the wrong idea...

672
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:23,923
Hey, hey, hey! Look at him.

673
00:49:23,923 --> 00:49:26,943
Look how he's leaving, ignoring you.

674
00:49:26,943 --> 00:49:30,103
Wow, what's going on?

675
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,423
Seon Yeong, this is serious.

676
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:36,693
You'd better do something about this.

677
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:42,193
Seon Yeong! Hey, hey!

678
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,793
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong!

679
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:49,193
You have to watch Pil Sung closely.

680
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:51,863
Wow, this is a serious matter.

681
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:56,133
He visits a woman who lives alone at this early hour.

682
00:49:56,133 --> 00:50:02,243
I looked down on her since she's a country bumpkin, but she's so cunning.

683
00:50:02,243 --> 00:50:05,473
They say the least likely person causes the biggest trouble.

684
00:50:05,473 --> 00:50:10,413
Seon Yeong, if you do nothing, things would get worse and worse.

685
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:14,753
You'd better keep that in mind, okay?

686
00:50:38,023 --> 00:50:40,503
Gosh, I'm in trouble!

687
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:42,983
It's already past 10.

688
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:45,713
I'm late for work.

689
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:55,123
 Ji Yeong, rest up today. 

690
00:50:55,123 --> 00:50:57,063
 I put you on sick leave. 

691
00:50:57,063 --> 00:50:59,573
 We have no shoot today. We just have plans internally. 

692
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:03,883
 You'd have nothing to do, anyway. Don't worry, and rest up. 

693
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:05,753
 And I made you porridge. 

694
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:10,223
 Heat that up and eat it. Don't forget to take the medicine, too. 

695
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:19,443
Why does the Director move me so much?

696
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:24,153
Aigoo! Kim Ji Yeong, you can't be like this anymore.

697
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:28,403
I have to hold back even if I like him.

698
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:34,743
But saying thank you would be the right thing to do.

699
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,373
Who's that?

700
00:51:47,373 --> 00:51:49,483
Who's there?

701
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:52,053
 Ji Yeong, it's me. 

702
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:54,413
Gosh, it's the owner lady.

703
00:51:57,523 --> 00:52:02,123
Hello. What brings you all the way here?

704
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:11,283
Let's talk for a moment.

705
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:17,053
I don't want to bring up stuff like this,

706
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:23,933
but Ji Yeong, why do you commute with Pil Sung in his car every day?

707
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,463
Pardon?

708
00:52:25,463 --> 00:52:32,123
It's because he suggested we carpool so I save money on transportation.

709
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:34,943
He could've said that.

710
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,373
But you should've said no to him.

711
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:41,790
You can't just ride his car every day because he asked you to.

712
00:52:42,553 --> 00:52:44,973
You are young people who aren't married yet.

713
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:47,733
You have to be careful.

714
00:52:47,733 --> 00:52:49,873
We've lived in this neighborhood for a long time.

715
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:54,133
Everyone here knows Pil Sung and the rest of the family.

716
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:58,813
And the same with last night.

717
00:52:58,813 --> 00:53:00,953
You could've told me you were sick.

718
00:53:00,953 --> 00:53:04,243
I heard Pil Sung cared for you here all night.

719
00:53:04,243 --> 00:53:09,093
Even if he said he would, you should've said no and made him leave.

720
00:53:09,093 --> 00:53:12,393
It would've looked bad if someone saw it.

721
00:53:12,393 --> 00:53:14,353
I'm sorry.

722
00:53:14,353 --> 00:53:17,823
I didn't know he was here all night.

723
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:21,583
I thought he just dropped off the medicine and left.

724
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:25,063
Anyway, be careful from now on.

725
00:53:25,063 --> 00:53:27,933
Rumors spread fast in this neighborhood.

726
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:29,513
Yes.

727
00:53:29,513 --> 00:53:31,863
I understand.

728
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:43,803
Ji Yeong, a chaebol family wants Pil Sung as their son-in-law.

729
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:49,603
He got you a job, and we gave you a huge discount on the rent, too.

730
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:52,483
You can't behave this way.

731
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,353
I'm sorry.

732
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:59,533
Pil Sung said nothing is going on between you two.

733
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:02,113
That's true, right?

734
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:07,033
Yes, nothing is going on.

735
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:11,353
Okay. I'll trust you, then.

736
00:54:28,463 --> 00:54:30,433
Yes.

737
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,603
I was a fool.

738
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:37,133
Grandma was right.

739
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:44,583
I climbed a tree too tall and... fell and cracked my head.

740
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:50,563
I need to stop now.

741
00:54:52,203 --> 00:54:54,553
I really need to.

742
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,320
   

743
00:55:08,023 --> 00:55:09,613
 Let's go. 

744
00:55:21,413 --> 00:55:23,973
What's wrong with me?

745
00:55:23,973 --> 00:55:27,823
I think of Park Do Ra whenever I see Ji Yeong,

746
00:55:27,823 --> 00:55:30,983
and whenever I think of Park Do Ra, I think of Ji Yeong.

747
00:55:30,983 --> 00:55:34,613
Why do they keep overlapping in my head?

748
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:37,263
What kind of nonsense is this?

749
00:55:39,593 --> 00:55:41,533
I can't help it.

750
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:44,353
I'll try seeing her again.

751
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:48,273
 Ms. Kim, let's have our second meal today. 

752
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:13,553
 Ji Yeong, let's have dinner together tonight. 

753
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:15,603
 I need to tell you something, too. 

754
00:56:17,023 --> 00:56:19,533
   

755
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:26,153
   

756
00:56:29,673 --> 00:56:34,873
She read the text, but why isn't she responding?

757
00:56:35,863 --> 00:56:38,143
Is she still very sick?

758
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:50,823
Ji Yeong!

759
00:56:53,653 --> 00:56:55,613
Ji Yeong!

760
00:56:58,093 --> 00:57:01,713
Where did she go? She's still sick.

761
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:07,023
She won't respond, either.

762
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:09,863
Is something going on?

763
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:18,443
 She looks different now that she's tired. 

764
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:20,573
 She looks moody, too. 

765
00:57:20,573 --> 00:57:22,483
 What's with this woman? 

766
00:57:22,483 --> 00:57:24,653
 She's like a chameleon. 

767
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:30,753
What is it?

768
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:33,863
Oh, it's nothing.

769
00:57:34,763 --> 00:57:37,393
By the way, did something happen, Ji Yeong?

770
00:57:37,393 --> 00:57:40,503
You don't look so well today.

771
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:43,643
No, I'm okay.

772
00:57:43,643 --> 00:57:45,943
You really enjoyed the webfoot octopus last time.

773
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:47,443
Do you not like sushi?

774
00:57:47,443 --> 00:57:50,493
I do. I really love sushi.

775
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,103
That's a relief.

776
00:58:01,573 --> 00:58:03,763
My gosh. Geez...

777
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:06,283
What? What's wrong?

778
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:11,703
Gosh, by accident, I—

779
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:14,673
Here, here. Have some water.

780
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:22,563
I almost died eating that thing.

781
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:24,643
You should be careful, too.

782
00:58:24,643 --> 00:58:28,323
There's already wasabi in there. Why did you dip more of it?

783
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:29,943
Gosh...

784
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:36,563
 She can't be more different. 

785
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:39,583
 But why does she keep reminding me of Do Ra? 

786
00:58:47,553 --> 00:58:49,203
Ji Yeong.

787
00:58:51,203 --> 00:58:54,413
Director, what are you doing here?

788
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:56,158
I was worried about you.

789
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,858
You're sick, but you couldn't be reached.

790
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:02,483
Where did you go?

791
00:59:02,483 --> 00:59:05,163
I met up with someone.

792
00:59:13,603 --> 00:59:15,603
Take this.

793
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:26,433
Why would I accept flowers from you?

794
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:30,333
I told you. You can't do this.

795
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:36,013
Ji Yeong, you must've been upset and frustrated because of me.

796
00:59:36,013 --> 00:59:38,273
I'm so sorry.

797
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:42,623
There has been a situation I couldn't tell you about.

798
00:59:42,623 --> 00:59:46,863
But I decided not to think too much anymore.

799
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:49,433
Ji Yeong,

800
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:52,913
to be honest, I like you, too.

801
00:59:58,743 --> 01:00:01,293
Is that so?

802
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:04,193
You're so impressive.

803
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:07,343
You say you didn't like me, and now you say you like me.

804
01:00:07,343 --> 01:00:11,783
It must be nice that you do whatever you want to do.

805
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:15,803
But I don't like you anymore.

806
01:00:15,803 --> 01:00:18,963
So, I can't accept these flowers.

807
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:21,233
You said you liked me a few days ago.

808
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:23,673
How could you suddenly change your mind?

809
01:00:23,673 --> 01:00:27,383
You're suddenly saying you like me, too.

810
01:00:27,383 --> 01:00:30,783
Do you expect me to always like you?

811
01:00:30,783 --> 01:00:34,503
I used to like you, but not anymore.

812
01:00:34,503 --> 01:00:37,563
Am I supposed to be gone when you don't like me

813
01:00:37,563 --> 01:00:40,883
and say, "Yes!" when you say you like me?

814
01:00:41,963 --> 01:00:43,863
Well, that's not what I meant—

815
01:00:43,863 --> 01:00:46,453
Let me make this clear.

816
01:00:46,453 --> 01:00:50,493
You're not the type I like.

817
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:54,323
I hate a flippant man who confuses women.

818
01:00:54,323 --> 01:00:57,463
I hate men who do whatever they want, like you.

819
01:00:57,463 --> 01:01:00,003
I don't believe you now, either.

820
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:02,013
You say you like me today,

821
01:01:02,013 --> 01:01:05,963
but I think you'd take it back tomorrow, saying something changed.

822
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:10,743
Anyway, I'll go inside now.

823
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:14,243
But still, take these flowers with you.

824
01:01:14,243 --> 01:01:16,463
I don't want them.

825
01:01:19,823 --> 01:01:22,233
Here's the information on Kim Ji Yeong you requested.

826
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:24,803
Okay, thank you.

827
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,600
   

828
01:01:30,893 --> 01:01:34,423
Name, Kim Ji Yeong. 28 years old.

829
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:37,873
I see. She's a year younger than Do Ra.

830
01:01:39,023 --> 01:01:41,523
Her parents died in an accident.

831
01:01:41,523 --> 01:01:44,653
And her only relative is her grandmother.

832
01:01:44,653 --> 01:01:47,393
She went to school in Chungcheong Province, too.

833
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:54,553
But why does she keep reminding me of Do Ra?

834
01:01:54,553 --> 01:01:57,073
They have nothing in common.

835
01:01:59,323 --> 01:02:01,283
Anyway,

836
01:02:01,873 --> 01:02:08,303
whenever I'm with her, my heart flutters like it did with Do Ra.

837
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:12,213
Maybe that's why.

838
01:02:12,213 --> 01:02:14,553
I keep wanting to see her.

839
01:02:18,753 --> 01:02:20,713
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Gosh.

840
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:26,253
You came.

841
01:02:26,253 --> 01:02:28,583
You scared me.

842
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,103
Let's go.

843
01:02:31,663 --> 01:02:36,123
Do you want to eat at the food court at the mall today?

844
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:37,753
Follow me.

845
01:02:52,003 --> 01:02:55,033
- Do you want to try holding the purse, too? 
 - Yes.

846
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:01,263
 She looks more like Do Ra dressed like that. 

847
01:03:01,263 --> 01:03:03,543
It's not bad. We'll take this, too.

848
01:03:03,543 --> 01:03:04,783
Yes, sir.

849
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:08,363
Next is... that one.

850
01:03:08,363 --> 01:03:09,883
Let her try that one, too.

851
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:11,993
What? Another one?

852
01:03:11,993 --> 01:03:14,593
No. Stop, stop, stop.

853
01:03:14,593 --> 01:03:16,003
I can't try them on anymore.

854
01:03:16,003 --> 01:03:18,943
I'm about to pass out!

855
01:03:22,043 --> 01:03:24,343
Okay. I'm sorry.

856
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,093
That's it for the day.

857
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:29,523
Okay. Take this away.

858
01:03:30,313 --> 01:03:32,213
My feet hurt.

859
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:33,663
Here.

860
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:39,783
You asked me to try them on to gift them to someone.

861
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:44,203
So, I tried on the clothes, shoes, and the purse, too.

862
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:47,693
But you're giving me all these?

863
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:49,393
Yes.

864
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:53,383
I knew you wouldn't want them if I said they were for you.

865
01:03:53,383 --> 01:03:55,893
So, I lied to you a bit.

866
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:01,583
But still, I can't accept such expensive gifts.

867
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:05,053
My grandma said nothing is free in this world.

868
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:08,323
She said I'd go bald if I liked freebies too much.

869
01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:11,463
What did you say? Bald?

870
01:04:16,663 --> 01:04:18,763
Was it that funny?

871
01:04:18,763 --> 01:04:20,433
I mean...

872
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:23,283
It's so fun talking to you.

873
01:04:23,283 --> 01:04:27,633
I've never heard that you go bald if you like freebies.

874
01:04:29,983 --> 01:04:31,683
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

875
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:33,393
You came yesterday. You're back again.

876
01:04:33,393 --> 01:04:37,713
Yes. Please make a bouquet twice as big as the previous one.

877
01:04:37,713 --> 01:04:39,893
Okay, got it.

878
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:03,003
- Gosh. No, no, no. 
 - Here.

879
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:05,183
I can't accept such expensive gifts.

880
01:05:05,183 --> 01:05:07,303
Don't feel pressured, I said.

881
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:10,673
You won't go bald for taking these.

882
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:14,533
I should be buying you clothes. But it's the opposite.

883
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:18,033
This just doesn't add up right.

884
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:21,163
Why are you doing this to me, President Gong?

885
01:05:21,163 --> 01:05:23,763
Because I like you.

886
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:25,693
Pardon?

887
01:05:25,693 --> 01:05:29,483
Ji Yeong, let's try seeing each other.

888
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:32,430
Pardon?

889
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:40,743


890
01:05:40,743 --> 01:05:43,723
   

891
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:56,253
♫  You can't forget just because you try  ♫

892
01:05:56,253 --> 01:06:03,613
♫  You can't erase things just because you try  ♫

893
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:07,043
♫  The countless days  ♫

894
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:11,053
♫  The time we spent together  ♫

895
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:15,803
♫  As if none of that happened  ♫

896
01:06:15,803 --> 01:06:18,323
 Tae Hee wants to get married quickly. 

897
01:06:18,323 --> 01:06:20,443
 She must like Jin Dan a lot. 

898
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:23,093
 This is an apartment I own. You can just move in here. 

899
01:06:23,093 --> 01:06:27,343
 I don't want the woman I like to live in a crappy place like that. 

900
01:06:27,343 --> 01:06:29,973
 Do you regret it now that I'm seeing another man? 

901
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:33,043
 I'm sorry, but the bus has left already. 

902
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:35,113
 Give me a chance just once. 

903
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:40,063
 Try going on dates with me and decide later as your heart wants.
