1
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:56,190


2
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:20,396
 You're my star, and I'm your moon. 

3
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:33,862
   

4
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:36,072
   

5
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:41,232
What's going on?

6
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:45,822
Why does Ji Yeong have that star tattoo on her ankle?

7
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,402
Is...

8
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:53,052
Kim Ji Yeong really Park Do Ra?

9
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:54,482
Director!

10
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,002
Director, here's your card.

11
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,722
I forgot to give it to you earlier.

12
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:02,862
What's wrong, Director?

13
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:05,112
Is something wrong?

14
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:07,432
No, it's nothing.

15
00:02:07,432 --> 00:02:10,562
I need to tend to something urgent now.

16
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,992
Please take care of Ji Yeong.

17
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:14,942
Okay, don't worry and get going.

18
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,822
I'll take care of her.

19
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:19,242
Thank you. Call me if something happens.

20
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,822
Okay.

21
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:27,512
 Yes, I need to find out... who Kim Ji Yeong is. 

22
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,592
 Yes, I need to find out... who Kim Ji Yeong is. 

23
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:32,222
 Is she really that old lady's granddaughter? 

24
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:45,272
Mom. Mom, let's visit Seon Yeong's place.

25
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:49,072
I really want to see Pil Sung Oppa.

26
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:51,072
Ma Ri, I told you.

27
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:53,412
He won't be there even if you went there.

28
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:56,092
He's so busy shooting the drama.

29
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,952
Even Seon Yeong doesn't get to see him often.

30
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:03,722
Let's go to the film set, then. That should work.

31
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:08,492
Gosh, what are you talking about? Why go to his workplace?

32
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,742
That makes no sense. It's rude.

33
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,022
You say you don't know his phone number.

34
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,392
You don't let me visit the film set, either.

35
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:20,482
Then, at least give me his address.

36
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,872
Give it to me.

37
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,922
Gosh, Ma Ri, why are you doing this?

38
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,952
You can't insist on something like this.

39
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:32,772
I finally reunited with the man of fate. Why won't you let me see him?

40
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:36,322
I'll wait at his place until he comes back.

41
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,872
That's how much I want to see him.

42
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:42,142
Okay, okay. Okay, Ma Ri. Later.

43
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,912
Pil Sung Oppa is busy, and I'm busy today as well.

44
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:47,182
Today isn't the only chance.

45
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:49,422
Later when? When will it be?

46
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,842
I hate you, Mom!

47
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:52,472
Ma Ri!

48
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:04,252
Gosh, Ma Ri's crush whom she's been looking for was Seon Yeong's son?

49
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,682
Gosh, Ma Ri's crush whom she's been looking for was Seon Yeong's son?

50
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:09,972
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,872
Grandma, there you were.

52
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,622
I've been looking for you everywhere.

53
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:23,492
Me? What for, Ma Ri?

54
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:28,922
Grandma, you're friends with Seon Yeong, too, right?

55
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:30,642
Of course, I am.

56
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:33,722
You must know where she lives, then.

57
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:37,742
Please give me her address. Please?

58
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:46,672
Hey, this is so plump and tender.

59
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:48,662
It'd make excellent water kimchi.

60
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,432
Let's make it, then.

61
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:52,472
We'll make yeolmu guksu, too.

62
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,902
Yes, that sounds good.

63
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:58,122
Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

64
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:01,912
 Are you in there? Are you in there, Ahjumma? 

65
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,582
Who's that?

66
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:07,952
Who is it?

67
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:10,292
Gosh, welcome.

68
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,032
Hello, Ahjumma.

69
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,532
Hey, Ma Ri.

70
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:16,472
What brings you to our house?

71
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,852
Seon Yeong, who's she?

72
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:23,142
- She's my friend Soo Yeon's daughter. 
 - Oh, right!

73
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:25,982
- That chaebol madam— 
 - Mother.

74
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:29,472
I mean, that friend's daughter?

75
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:33,242
Ma Ri, say hello to her. She's Pil Sung’s grandma.

76
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:37,512
Oh, hello, Ma’am. I'm Gong Ma Ri.

77
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:39,662
Oh, hello.

78
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,102
Do Joon, you should say hello, too.

79
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:43,672
He's my driver and bodyguard.

80
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:45,132
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

81
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,642
- Here you go. 
 - My gosh.

82
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:50,642
You shouldn't have. Thank you.

83
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,502
Do Jun, wait in the car.

84
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,372
Okay. Take care.

85
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,692
Yes, thank you.

86
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:05,672
Ahjumma, is Pil Sung Oppa home?

87
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:07,542
What?

88
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,632
Is someone here?

89
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,992
Soo Yeon's daughter came by.

90
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:27,172
So, you fell for Pil Sung at first sight?

91
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:30,262
Yes. To be honest, about two years ago,

92
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:33,532
I got so angry at my dad.

93
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:38,712
I have my type, too, but he kept forcing me to see someone I didn't like.

94
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:42,702
- So I got pissed off fighting with him— 
 - What?

95
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,752
Well, Mom told me not to talk like this.

96
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:52,572
Anyway, I ran out of the house to run away.

97
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,892
But I bumped into a man in front of the subway station

98
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:59,292
and I dropped my sister, Lulu.

99
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,942
Your sister, Lulu?

100
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:05,332
Her doll. The doll. The doll.

101
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:09,842
The man I bumped into picked up Lulu for me.

102
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:13,852
And that man turns out to be Pil Sung Oppa.

103
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:17,632
He looked so handsome then.

104
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,962
His face was glowing

105
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:23,402
and he looked like a prince from a romance novel.

106
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,482
My goodness.

107
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:27,002
What?

108
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:30,272
But since he was so handsome,

109
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:34,512
I was shocked. So I didn't get to ask for his phone number.

110
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:37,122
I was so upset there was no way to find him,

111
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:42,912
but my mom said I'd see him again if it were meant to be.

112
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:46,872
And I met him again as if it was meant to be.

113
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:48,642
By the way, young lady.

114
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:52,952
Unni, I'm Gong Ma Ri. Just call me Ma Ri.

115
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:56,842
I'm sorry to be ruining things,

116
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:00,392
but my nephew, Pil Sung, isn't a prince.

117
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:03,552
What kind of prince lives in a house like this?

118
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:05,332
I know that, too.

119
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:09,732
He's not a real prince, but he looked like one.

120
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:12,772
She's so eloquent.

121
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:17,962
By the way, Ahjumma, when is Pil Sung Oppa coming back?

122
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:20,842
He's been coming home late these days.

123
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:23,802
He must be busy since he's still shooting.

124
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,772
I see.

125
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:29,502
If so, can you give him a call?

126
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,132
A call?

127
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:36,362
Call him. It's not hard to do.

128
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,502
Okay.

129
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:41,172
I think he's busy.

130
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,752
He's not answering.

131
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:56,122
I think he's been busy these days.

132
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:59,442
I'm okay. I can just wait.

133
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,752
Yes, that's right.

134
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:18,572
I used to live here when I was little.

135
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:22,692
I remember that Ahjumma and the old lady, too.

136
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:26,982
Should I go say hello later?

137
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:30,682
That I'm the youngest, Do Jun, who used to live here?

138
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:38,272
No, we ran away when we left.

139
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:44,422
And what would I say if they asked about Noona and the rest of the family?

140
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:47,782
Right, I shouldn't.

141
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:51,282
They don't even recognize me. Why bother?

142
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:56,752
By the way, why don't I see the grandfather?

143
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,542
Here.

144
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:05,172
Ma'am, you know that two-story house over there?

145
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,752
Their grandfather is still healthy, right?

146
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:09,702
The two-story house?

147
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:13,342
The principal passed away a long time ago.

148
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,262
Pardon?

149
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:18,812
He passed away?

150
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,382
When?

151
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:24,682
It's been about 15 or 17 years already.

152
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:27,262
Anyway, it's been that long.

153
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:32,022
By the way, how do you know him?

154
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,972
It's nothing. Thank you.

155
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,882
 Mom! 

156
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,062
 Seo Joon! 

157
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:56,472
 - Min Joo! 
 - Mom! 

158
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,312
 Did you have fun today? 

159
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:00,762
 Oh? It's Grandpa. 

160
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,342
 I came because it's supposed to rain. 

161
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,392
 - Really? 
 - Yes. 

162
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,632
 Your mom is tending to something very urgent. 

163
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:15,792
 Even if it rains, I know how to dodge it. 

164
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,802
 What? You dodge the rain? 

165
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:22,522
 That's so impressive, Do Jun. 

166
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:28,072
 Do Jun, do you want to get jjajangmyeon? 

167
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:30,662
 - Yes, sounds good. 
 - Okay. 

168
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,232
 Grandpa, it tastes amazing. 

169
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,292
 - It's that good? 
 - Yes. 

170
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,392
 Jjajangmyeon is my favorite in the world. 

171
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,842
 Really? 

172
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:51,482
 What about this tangsuyuk, then? 

173
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:53,382
 I shouldn't have ordered it. 

174
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:56,172
 That doesn't mean I dislike tangsuyuk. 

175
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,082
 Really? 

176
00:11:58,082 --> 00:11:59,742
 Eat a lot, then. 

177
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,882
 Okay. You should eat a lot, too. 

178
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,522
 Okay. Let's try it. 

179
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:29,092
   

180
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,242
How have you been, Ma'am?

181
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:50,622
My gosh, look who's here.

182
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:53,872
You're the director Ji Yeong works for.

183
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,412
Right? Am I right?

184
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,342
Yes.

185
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,782
I stopped by since I was in the area for work.

186
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:03,822
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

187
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:09,172
Instead of standing here, have a seat here.

188
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:10,702
Just wait a moment.

189
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:14,602
I'll make kalguksu with tons of octopus and clams.

190
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:18,032
No, Ma'am. I ate just now.

191
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,992
Did you?

192
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:24,252
You came all this way, but I can't even make you kalguksu.

193
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:26,092
It makes me so upset.

194
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:29,042
I'll come back for it next time. Please make it for me then.

195
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,832
I'll get you some coffee, at least.

196
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:36,942
- Have a seat and wait a moment. 
 - Okay.

197
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,082
- Have some. 
 - Thank you.

198
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:49,112
It's nice and sweet.

199
00:13:55,842 --> 00:14:04,262
I don't know if Ji Yeong is worth her pay.

200
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:07,592
She's not afraid to work,

201
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:12,322
but she's working at a broadcasting studio now.

202
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:17,622
Did Ji Yeong do something wrong by chance?

203
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,772
No, she's doing a good job. Don't worry.

204
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:23,542
Gosh, is that true?

205
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:31,822
Aigoo, I was so worried about leaving her alone there.

206
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:37,242
But I'm so relieved that you said that.

207
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:41,562
By the way, Ma'am,

208
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:47,562
I heard she was in a serious accident about two years ago.

209
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:52,782
Ji Yeong's accident?

210
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,072
I told her not to talk about that.

211
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:03,352
Did she tell you everything by chance?

212
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:07,422
Yes, she said she was hospitalized for a long time.

213
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,252
Yes, she was.

214
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:17,812
Since she told you everything,

215
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:22,052
I might as well be honest with you, too.

216
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:27,842
Because of the awful accident,

217
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:31,232
she has no memory of what happened...

218
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:35,022
before the accident.

219
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:41,720
The doctor said she had memory loss.

220
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:44,042
Memory loss?

221
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,202
Yes.

222
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:50,722
And her entire face was redone, too.

223
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:57,722
Her face was redone? What do you mean...

224
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:03,012
To be honest, that awful accident...

225
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,782
involved her falling into the ocean.

226
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:09,072
Just imagine what must've happened.

227
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:14,142
She got swept by the waves and ran into rocks.

228
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:18,872
Aigoo, my Ji Yeong basically died and came back to life.

229
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:23,372
She got tons of surgeries, too.

230
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:28,912
That's why her face looks a lot different than before.

231
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:34,222
So, you mean she doesn't like how she looked before?

232
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:36,502
Of course.

233
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:40,892
How could she look the same after what she went through?

234
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:43,982
Of course, she looks different.

235
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:50,942
You must've been very shocked, then, too.

236
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,992
You might've thought she changed...

237
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:57,892
since she looked different.

238
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,832
Not at all, Director.

239
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:06,182
My son and daughter-in-law died together in a car accident.

240
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:11,082
So, I raised Ji Yeong since she was in elementary school.

241
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:15,972
She's the only family I have in this world.

242
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:20,042
I can't feel that way just because her face changed.

243
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:24,662
No, not at all.

244
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:30,462
Not just her face, but even if her entire body changed,

245
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:33,402
she will still be my granddaughter.

246
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:36,642
Why would that not make her my granddaughter?

247
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,872
Don't you agree?

248
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:44,142
Well, yes.

249
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,552
Yes.

250
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:58,502
Kim Ji Yeong isn't Park Do Ra.

251
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,862
She's her granddaughter.

252
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:07,312
As she said, there's no way she didn't recognize her granddaughter.

253
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,642
But that ankle tattoo...

254
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:17,632
How could there be a coincidence like this?

255
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:21,982
It's still a coincidence.

256
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:25,102
Everything's a coincidence.

257
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:31,172
My gosh, aren't you the director?

258
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:34,572
What brings you here?

259
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,052
I was tending to a business nearby.

260
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,192
Oh, I see.

261
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,362
Ji Yeong is doing a good job, right?

262
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:43,862
Yes, she is.

263
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:49,892
If so, tell her not to worry about her grandma's dementia.

264
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:55,072
Tell her Auntie Deok Ja is always right by her.

265
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,402
Ji Yeong's grandmother has dementia?

266
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:02,602
Yes, but it's okay since she's in an early stage.

267
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:08,372
So, Ji Yeong refused to go to Seoul because she was worried about her,

268
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:12,512
but I convinced her to go. I did.

269
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:15,572
The whole neighborhood knows about her filial heart.

270
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,922
So, I told her to just worry about her future.

271
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,672
I see.

272
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:27,542
Her grandmother was worried because Ji Yeong lost her memory due to a serious accident.

273
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:31,392
Aigoo, pay no attention to that.

274
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:36,152
Ji Yeong became so sweet since the memory loss.

275
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:38,872
She's better off that way.

276
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,442
What do you mean by that?

277
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:45,682
To be honest, Ji Yeong used to give her grandma such a hard time.

278
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:49,462
She never called home whenever she went to Seoul.

279
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:53,552
So, we thought she died when she went missing last time.

280
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:57,322
But she came back alive.

281
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,360
That's why there was a strange rumor, too.

282
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,412
Strange rumor? Like what?

283
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:07,562
Because her entire face changed.

284
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:11,132
She wasn't Ji Yeong we used to know.

285
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:14,322
And she lost all of her memory of her past.

286
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:16,932
She acted like a completely different person, too.

287
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:20,772
That's why everyone said she wasn't Ji Yeong.

288
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:26,362
They said that Soon Jeong got the wrong person because of her dementia.

289
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:33,022
Is that true?

290
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:36,042
My gosh, what did I say just now?

291
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:40,992
Pretend you didn't hear what I just said.

292
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:43,952
Her grandma would beat me up if she found out.

293
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,342
Okay? Gosh, what did I do?

294
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,322
Because of her dementia...

295
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:55,882
there was a rumor that Ji Yeong wasn't her real granddaughter?

296
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,822
If that's true...

297
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,394
Jae Dong, it's me.

298
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:15,234
Park Do Ra's mom, CEO Baek Mi Ja.

299
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,914
Could you tell me where she lives?

300
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:47,136
   

301
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:49,196
When will the result come out?

302
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:52,386
Ma'am, Yeojudaek?

303
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:54,126
Yes, Ma'am.

304
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:57,036
Ma Ri isn't in her room. She won't answer her phone, either.

305
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,716
She left with Mr. Park earlier today.

306
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:01,846
- Earlier today? 
 - Yes.

307
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,866
Where did she go?

308
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,696
Do Jun, you're with Ma Ri, right?

309
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,476
Where are you?

310
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,466
What did you say? Where?

311
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,836
- It's tasty. 
 - Help yourself.

312
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:33,716
I used to hate cheonggukjang because it smells like a foot.

313
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:37,756
But yours tastes good somehow.

314
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:40,766
It smells like a foot?

315
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:44,566
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

316
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:47,626
Eat a lot. Eat bulgogi and omelet, too.

317
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,906
Okay.

318
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:51,556
Ma Ri is really into Pil Sung.

319
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:55,963
You say you like the cheonggukjang that smells like foot.

320
00:23:56,656 --> 00:24:01,556
By the way, what about Pil Sung did you like so much?

321
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:04,586
Everything. I like everything from head to toe.

322
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:06,226
I like his eyes, nose, and mouth, too.

323
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,226
The curly hair is cute, too.

324
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:12,186
I think even his nostrils are cute.

325
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:15,796
What did you say? Even his nostrils are cute?

326
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:18,006
He sure is cute.

327
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,916
Seon Yeong.

328
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,506
My gosh, Soo Yeon.

329
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,426
- Mom? 
 - Gosh.

330
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,786
W-Welcome, Soo Yeon.

331
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:31,476
Welcome, Soo Yeon.

332
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:35,536
Seon Yeong, I came to pick up Ma Ri.

333
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:38,366
Ma Ri, let's go.

334
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:44,566
I don't want to. I won't go.

335
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:48,546
What's wrong with her?

336
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:50,266
Ma Ri?

337
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,876
Come here. Let's go home.

338
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,006
Let's go.

339
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:57,356
I didn't get to see Pil Sung Oppa yet.

340
00:24:57,356 --> 00:24:59,426
I'll see him when he comes home.

341
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:03,456
Ma Ri, you're being impolite right now.

342
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:06,716
I don't want to. I won't go!

343
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:10,986
Well, we really don't mind. She's not being impolite.

344
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:16,576
Yes, Soo Yeon. Might as well join us for dinner and see Pil Sung when he comes, too.

345
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,216
No, Seon Yeong.

346
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,726
I'm sorry to interrupt dinner.

347
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,456
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:23,376
Take care. Enjoy your dinner.

349
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:27,296
Hey, Ma Ri didn't get to finish dinner.

350
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,746
Enjoy. I'm sorry.

351
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:30,136
It's okay.

352
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:33,886
- I don't want to. 
 - Mom is in a hurry.

353
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:36,186
- Take care. 
 - Yes, get home safely.

354
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:38,776
Let me put my shoes on!

355
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,996
Why did she have to leave like that?

356
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:51,946
Mom, let go of me!

357
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:55,606
- It hurts! It hurts! 
 - What do you mean, it hurts?

358
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:02,906
You're making me so upset.

359
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:05,766
What am I supposed to do with you?

360
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:09,096
What did I do? What did I do, exactly?

361
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:10,806
Don't you know?

362
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:14,166
You went to someone's house and insisted on staying for dinner.

363
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,546
You said Pil Seung was your man of fate and stuff

364
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:21,386
and insisted on waiting until he came home. Don't you have self respect?

365
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:24,026
And what would Seon Yeong think of me?

366
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:25,956
Don't you care about me at all?

367
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:28,336
I didn't just go to a stranger's house.

368
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:32,096
You and Seon Yeong are BFFs. You're her best friend.

369
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:39,236
Seon Yeong, Grandma, Ahjussi, and Auntie told me to stay until Pil Sung Oppa came home.

370
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:41,256
But you ruined everything!

371
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:42,996
I find you even weirder.

372
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:45,756
Why are you getting so angry?

373
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:50,036
Why are you making her cry?

374
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:54,136
It sounds like she was at Seon Yeong's. Why are you scolding her?

375
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,936
It's not like she can't be there.

376
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:58,426
So what if she sees Pil Sung?

377
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:03,276
- Pil Sung has a girlfriend. That's why. 
 - What?

378
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,266
Mom, Pil Sung has a girlfriend?

379
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:10,326
Is that true, Mom?

380
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:15,586
Yes, so don't do that at his place anymore, okay?

381
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:18,211
Why are you telling me that now?

382
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:21,601
I was so happy that I found him.

383
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,413
My gosh.

384
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,939
Pil Sung has a girlfriend?

385
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,169
How could you give her their address without asking me?

386
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:36,399
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

387
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,239
And it's okay for her to visit Seon Yeong's regardless of that.

388
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,789
Why are you overreacting?

389
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,829
Why are you...

390
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,349
Is something going on?

391
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:54,429
H-Honey, it's nothing.

392
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,239
Is that true?

393
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:03,449
Pil Sung really has a girlfriend?

394
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,309
Yes, apparently.

395
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:12,959
So, you shouldn't talk about him in front of Ma Ri anymore.

396
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:20,639
She's been waiting and longing for him, calling him the man of fate.

397
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:24,319
Ma Ri must be very disappointed.

398
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,129
But we need to make this clear.

399
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,129
So she doesn't get hurt even more.

400
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:36,199
Honey, let's hurry up and find someone for her. I'll look into it, too.

401
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,529
Let's do that.

402
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:08,259
   

403
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,289
Do Ra...

404
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,242
Do Ra...

405
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,422
She is Do Ra.

406
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:34,859
She really is Do Ra.

407
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,639
Do Ra...

408
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,279
Yes, Director. It's me.

409
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:02,569
 Hello? 

410
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:06,789
 Hello? Director? 

411
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:18,889
Ji Yeong, where are you right now?

412
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:24,029
Me? I got discharged, and I'm on my way home.

413
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:27,369
- Are you okay? 
  - Gosh. 

414
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,399
 I'm okay now. 

415
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,739
 The test results came out normal, too. 

416
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:37,189
So where are you now?

417
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,149
I'll come pick you up.

418
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:43,059
Gosh, you don't have to.

419
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,879
I'm really okay.

420
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:47,213
I'm on my way to take the bus now.

421
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,023
♫  It's been forgotten  ♫

422
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:50,569
Okay.

423
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:53,573
♫  Trying to erase it  ♫

424
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,299
Why does he sound so emotional?

425
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:05,444
He must've worried a lot that I was seriously injured.

426
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:11,063
♫  As if none of that happened  ♫

427
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:19,289
♫  The memories that I've been collecting  ♫

428
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,229
 Say you love me a thousand times. 

429
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,459
 What would be the use of it? 

430
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:31,019
 It's a mirage without substance. 

431
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,039
 None of that matters without money. 

432
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,989
 So, let's end things now. 

433
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:44,733
 Okay. 

434
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,853
 Let's do that. 

435
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:52,219
 I didn't know you were like this. 

436
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:58,499
 I regret every moment I liked you. 

437
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:06,769
 As you wish, get engaged to President Gong, marry him, and live a happy life. 

438
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:09,449
 And that precious money of yours... 

439
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,079
 I hope you get smothered in a pile of money. 

440
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,849
 You saw the article, too, right? 

441
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:20,039
 The article is wrong. 

442
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,449
 Even if everyone else gets me wrong, 

443
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:26,019
 I don't want you to think of me that way. 

444
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,529
 None of that is true. 

445
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,909
 It was all fabricated. 

446
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,699
 What's with the photo taken at the hotel? 

447
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:41,439
 How much does one have to pay you to do that? 

448
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,459
 Why do you live like this? 

449
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:46,649
 How did you live your life all this time? 

450
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,489
 No. 

451
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:54,879
 How you live doesn't concern me. 

452
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:56,649
 Live however you want. 

453
00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:00,889
 Instead, don't ever show up in front of me again. 

454
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:08,899
 Oppa, I said I liked you. But it was all a lie. 

455
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,119
 I was playing with you because I was bored. 

456
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,399
 So, forget a terrible person like me. 

457
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,609
 Be happy, Oppa. 

458
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:24,889
I'm sorry.

 It's me. 

475
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:52,489
Gosh, Director, is that you?

476
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,299
Just one moment.

477
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:10,759
Gosh, Director.

478
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:14,009
Ji Yeong, may I come in?

479
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:17,079
Yes, yes. Come on in.

480
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:27,719
Director, what brings you here at this hour?

481
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,739
And what's all this?

482
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,859
It's okay if I open the fridge, right?

483
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,539
Well, yes.

484
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:55,069
What's all this, Director?

485
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,539
Who did you bring all this for?

486
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:02,429
I bought all sorts of things because I don't know what you like.

487
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,729
You got injured while saving me.

488
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,489
You need to eat well to get better.

489
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:10,329
But still, that's too much.

490
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,129
Take your time going through it.

491
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,169
Let me know if you need anything else.

492
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:19,389
Gosh, it's okay. That's enough to keep me full.

493
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,969
Ji Yeong, do you need to go back to the hospital?

494
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:29,199
Are you sure you're okay?

495
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:32,079
I'm okay.

496
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,669
Look. I'm totally fine.

497
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:41,599
Ji Yeong, I'm sorry about earlier today.

498
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,689
Something urgent came up.

499
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:47,259
I left you alone at the hospital.

500
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,239
I should've stayed by your side.

501
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,639
Well, why should you stay by my side?

502
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,159
What am I, a child?

503
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,819
And the Assistant Director took good care of me.

504
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:07,919
It looks like you feel bad that I got injured while protecting you.

505
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,549
Don't feel so bad.

506
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:12,199
I'm not in pain at all anymore.

507
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:23,629
Ji Yeong,

508
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:28,039
if you feel sick or crave something to eat,

509
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,449
or need anything, call me right away.

510
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,969
I'll be available 24-7, okay?

511
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:38,749
That's enough, Director.

512
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:41,419
You're embarrassing me.

513
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,649
You saved my life, Ji Yeong.

514
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:46,979
Of course, I should care for you.

515
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:51,889
So, don't feel burdened and call me if anything happens.

516
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:55,219
Okay, I will.

517
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:59,949
I'm okay, so go home and rest.

518
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,659
- I'll let you rest, then. 
 - Okay.

519
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:15,999
Make sure to contact me if you need me. Promise, okay?

520
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,209
Okay, I promise to contact you.

521
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:33,239
Thank you.

522
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,269
Get some rest.

523
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:43,439
Why is he being so nice to me all of a sudden?

524
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:45,399
He's embarrassing me.

525
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:50,949
He'd be carrying me around if I saved his life again.

526
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:58,519
Do Ra, I won't let you feel lonely anymore.

527
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,899
No matter what happens,

528
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:07,869
I'll never let go of your hand again.

529
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,559
I'll never...

530
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,369
let you leave like that again.

531
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:26,504
The deadline is coming up soon.

532
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:29,414
What's wrong with me?

533
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:34,094
Maybe I should quit now.

534
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:37,964
Maybe I have no talent, as Mom said.

535
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:43,664
Why can't I write? Why?

536
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:49,374
Yes.

537
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:53,514
I'll just drink one glass...

538
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:56,354
and work hard at home.

539
00:39:57,324 --> 00:39:59,394
Welcome.

540
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:08,164
L-Long time, no see.

541
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:13,384
L-Long time no see, Noonim.

542
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:16,324
Well, then...

543
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:27,754
Are you here alone?

544
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:32,514
I felt like drinking on the way home.

545
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,404
If so,

546
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:42,284
should I join you?

547
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:48,354
It'd be awkward to drink separately in the same space.

548
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:56,624
Yes, let's drink together. It's been a while.

549
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:07,934
I wonder what kind of fate binds us.

550
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:16,064
You end up with someone after you keep running into them in dramas.

551
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:20,534
You and I ended a long time ago, but...

552
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:24,454
This is so crazy.

553
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:26,964
Can't believe I ran into you again.

554
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:31,804
But still, it's nice.

555
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:34,904
I didn't want to drink alone.

556
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:40,554
I know. I felt lonely drinking alone, too.

557
00:41:41,594 --> 00:41:44,584
Let's clank our glasses for that, then.

558
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:59,764
Looks like you're enjoying that purse.

559
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:03,084
It definitely suits you perfectly.

560
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,194
The purse?

561
00:42:05,194 --> 00:42:06,824
Oh, right.

562
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:12,094
I'm making such great use of this purse.

563
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:15,394
To be honest, this is my first designer purse.

564
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,804
But that's not the reason.

565
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:23,574
Anyway, I'm finding it very useful.

566
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,374
Thank you.

567
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:30,194
I'm thankful that you're using it without tossing it.

568
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:34,794
To be honest, I thought about it since I was mad at you,

569
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:39,904
but the purse didn't do anything wrong. Think about it.

570
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:48,374
Let's go home since we drank enough now.

571
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:51,084
I'll pay for this one.

572
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:52,674
No, let me pay.

573
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:54,484
We haven't seen each other in a while...

574
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,494
No, no.

575
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,884
- Here. 
 - Well...

576
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,334
Do you have another card?

577
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,334
It was declined.

578
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:12,994
Declined? How strange...

579
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:15,334
I said I'll pay.

580
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:18,194
It's only a fraction of how much this purse cost.

581
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:19,924
Just think I'm paying for this purse.

582
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:22,084
I'll pay with this.

583
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:33,564
I think I brought the wrong card. I'm sorry.

584
00:43:33,564 --> 00:43:36,684
That happens. I do that sometimes, too.

585
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:42,294
And we ran into each other by chance and shared drinks together.

586
00:43:42,294 --> 00:43:44,684
It doesn't matter who pays.

587
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:49,304
I need to be somewhere. I'll leave now.

588
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:51,104
Well...

589
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:52,634
Your number hasn't changed, right?

590
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:55,494
I'll make sure to buy you a drink later.

591
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:58,104
Okay, let's do that.

592
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:22,284
Ji Yeong.

593
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:27,624
Hello, Director.

594
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,394
Get in, Ji Yeong.

595
00:44:29,394 --> 00:44:31,624
Gosh, it's okay.

596
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:34,874
I can take the bus. You can go without me.

597
00:44:34,874 --> 00:44:37,404
We're going to the same broadcasting station. Why go separately?

598
00:44:37,404 --> 00:44:39,104
Do you have a lot of money?

599
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:41,064
Why waste money on transportation?

600
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:42,674
It's not that...

601
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:46,164
We'll both be late at this rate. Hop in.

602
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:49,724
But I can't be in the same car as you.

603
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:51,444
I'm really okay.

604
00:44:51,444 --> 00:44:54,154
Just think we're carpooling.

605
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:57,084
Carpooling?

606
00:44:57,084 --> 00:44:58,424
What's that?

607
00:44:58,424 --> 00:45:03,144
People who work together share a ride to conserve energy.

608
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:07,064
Our country doesn't produce a drop of oil. We need to conserve energy together.

609
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:11,204
You'll save the bus fare, and I'll save oil. How nice is that?

610
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:13,574
You're right. What a great thing that is.

611
00:45:13,574 --> 00:45:15,364
Of course, it's a great thing.

612
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:17,984
Here. Get in.

613
00:45:18,684 --> 00:45:21,534
Here. Watch your head.

614
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:36,704
 The Director must have some good news or something. 

615
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:43,124
Right, Ji Yeong, we've been living in the same house and working in the same team for a month,

616
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:45,564
but we don't know much about each other.

617
00:45:45,564 --> 00:45:50,224
Shouldn't we get to know each other since we'd be carpooling?

618
00:45:50,224 --> 00:45:54,744
Well, yes. That'd be nice.

619
00:45:54,744 --> 00:45:56,434
What do you like, Ji Yeong?

620
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,964
What do you mean?

621
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,784
What's your favorite food?

622
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:03,574
Korean, Chinese, Japanese, or Thai?

623
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:07,374
I like any kind of food.

624
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:09,944
There's nothing I can't eat.

625
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:13,494
But still, what's your favorite?

626
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:18,104
Well, I like kalguksu,

627
00:46:18,104 --> 00:46:22,484
bibimguksu, sujebi, and everything, but...

628
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:26,924
my absolute favorite is tteokbokki.

629
00:46:28,094 --> 00:46:30,244
I knew it.

630
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:33,064
You knew it?

631
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:35,004
How?

632
00:46:37,554 --> 00:46:39,784
Why are you laughing?

633
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:42,264
What's so funny about that?

634
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:46,434
Driving with you makes my commute less boring. It's nice.

635
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:47,874
Really?

636
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:49,604
Yes, really.

637
00:46:49,604 --> 00:46:52,364
I'm glad I decided to carpool with you.

638
00:46:52,364 --> 00:46:55,074
 He's enjoying driving with me? 

639
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:57,664
 What does that mean? 

640
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:07,014
 What? Why does he keep smiling sweetly at me? 

641
00:47:07,014 --> 00:47:09,054
 He's making me nervous. 

642
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:10,874
 No, no. 

643
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:14,564
 It's because I saved him yesterday. That's why. 

644
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:22,054
 Kim Ji Yeong, don't get the wrong idea. 

645
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,184
Here's the script, Director.

646
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:39,324
Okay, the script is fresh off the press.

647
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:43,894
- Thank you, Ji Yeong. 
  - Of course. You're welcome.

648
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,744
Ji Yeong, are you okay? Are you hurt?

649
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,264
Pardon?

650
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:57,824
I just dropped a script. That's all.

651
00:47:57,824 --> 00:48:00,184
Why would I get injured from that?

652
00:48:00,184 --> 00:48:03,604
I'm totally okay now. You don't have to worry.

653
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,764
But still, be careful.

654
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:11,624
 What? Why is he staring at me so intensely? 

655
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:14,604
 W-What's with the intense staring? 

656
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:16,444
 Gosh. 

657
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:18,344
 My face is feeling hot. 

658
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:22,014
 I'm about to get burnt from his stares. 

659
00:48:40,944 --> 00:48:44,814
Why is he acting like that since yesterday?

660
00:48:44,814 --> 00:48:47,684
I know I saved his life,

661
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:51,664
but why does he look at me so sweetly?

662
00:48:51,664 --> 00:48:54,184
Isn't that a romantic eye?

663
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:59,314
I promised to think of him as a rock.

664
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:02,264
What am I supposed to do if he keeps doing this?

665
00:49:02,264 --> 00:49:06,914
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy.

666
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,724
Auntie.

667
00:49:22,484 --> 00:49:25,224
Jin Dan is leaving for work now.

668
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:27,764
I'll get going now.

669
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,434
Have a seat here for a moment.

670
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,094
Okay.

671
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:41,434
Jin Dan, you know how important this blind date is, right?

672
00:49:41,434 --> 00:49:44,532
It was difficult for me to arrange this.

673
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:47,434
Yes, I know.

674
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:54,934
Jin Dan, you're the only person I can trust in this family now.

675
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:58,454
You know I own shares, right?

676
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,484
Once you get married, have kids, and settle down,

677
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:05,714
I'll give you all of my shares.

678
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:10,794
You might become the owner of APP Group, then.

679
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:16,324
The woman you meet today will be helpful to you, too.

680
00:50:16,324 --> 00:50:21,584
I can't stand APP Group being owned by someone with a different surname.

681
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:25,184
My father worked so hard to build the company.

682
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:28,834
You know how I feel, right?

683
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:34,964
Yes, I'll make sure not to disappoint you.

684
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:38,904
Okay. Meet her and say no if you don't like her.

685
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:41,334
You shouldn't be forced to marry someone.

686
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:44,384
I'll arrange another date for you, then.

687
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:45,774
Okay.

688
00:50:45,774 --> 00:50:47,844
Don't worry, Auntie.

689
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:52,024
Jin Dan is determined. He'll do a good job from now on.

690
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:54,954
Yes, you should.

691
00:51:08,894 --> 00:51:11,494
Hello, I'm Gong Jin Dan.

692
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:12,794
Ms. Kim Tae Hee?

693
00:51:12,794 --> 00:51:15,454
Yes, it's been a while, Jin Dan.

694
00:51:16,054 --> 00:51:18,134
Do you know me?

695
00:51:19,064 --> 00:51:21,124
Have we met somewhere?

696
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:25,054
We said hello at Michael's wedding in New York six years ago.

697
00:51:25,054 --> 00:51:27,144
Michael's wedding?

698
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:34,684
Oh, but your name wasn't Tae Hee, then. Right?

699
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,834
Thank you.

700
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:46,294
That's right. I went by Linda in the US, Linda Kim.

701
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:50,564
Oh, I remember everything now, Linda.

702
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:54,304
It was fun having a dance party with Michael then.

703
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:56,744
It's so nice to see you again.

704
00:51:56,744 --> 00:51:59,634
It's nice to see you again, too.

705
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,794
To be honest, that's why I came here.

706
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:05,034
Because I heard it'd be you.

707
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,904
Really?

708
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:13,494
Gosh, Ma Ri. You came.

709
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:18,884
I'm so sorry, but Pil Sung is gone since he's at work.

710
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:24,594
I came knowing he'd be at work at this hour.

711
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:29,324
I came today to ask you for his phone number.

712
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:36,474
Ahjumma, I need to have a serious private conversation with him.

713
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:41,574
Could you give me his phone number?

714
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,004
Ma Ri, have a seat for now.

715
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,154
Have a seat.

716
00:52:57,784 --> 00:53:01,294
Ma Ri, I might be his mom,

717
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:05,174
but I don't think I should give away his phone number.

718
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:09,344
I'll ask him if it's okay first and then tell you.

719
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:11,424
That'd be okay, right?

720
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:18,424
Yes, instead, you need to give it to me if he says yes.

721
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:20,574
Okay, I will.

722
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:28,274
By the way, what did you want to ask him privately?

723
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:35,954
What is it? Don't you want to tell us?

724
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:43,994
To be honest, I...

725
00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:48,224
felt a bit betrayed by both of you.

726
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,584
My gosh, you felt betrayed?

727
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,194
What do you mean?

728
00:53:53,194 --> 00:53:55,774
What did we do, exactly?

729
00:53:56,824 --> 00:54:01,914
Ma Ri, did we make a mistake with you?

730
00:54:01,914 --> 00:54:05,094
It's okay. Tell us.

731
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:11,864
I told you that I fell for Pil Sung at first sight.

732
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:14,944
That he's like a prince to me...

733
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:19,534
and I want to marry him because I really like him.

734
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:25,434
But how come you didn't tell me?

735
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:29,034
That Pil Sung has a girlfriend.

736
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:32,304
Why didn't you tell me that?

737
00:54:32,304 --> 00:54:34,734
What? A girlfriend?

738
00:54:34,734 --> 00:54:37,224
Does he have a girlfriend?

739
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:39,904
Ahjumma, who is she?

740
00:54:39,904 --> 00:54:42,084
How old is she?

741
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:45,184
Is she prettier than me?

742
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:48,394
But he doesn't have a girlfriend.

743
00:54:48,394 --> 00:54:49,694
How strange.

744
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:53,554
Where did you hear that?

745
00:54:53,554 --> 00:54:56,894
He doesn't have a girlfriend?

746
00:54:56,894 --> 00:55:02,914
No, he doesn't. I would've said so if he did.

747
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:05,994
Really? He really doesn't?

748
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:08,584
What did you say? Ma Ri disappeared?

749
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:12,444
She won't answer her phone. Do Joon doesn't know, either.

750
00:55:12,444 --> 00:55:15,654
She snuck out without his knowledge, too?

751
00:55:15,654 --> 00:55:18,634
Maybe she went over there again.

752
00:55:18,634 --> 00:55:20,514
Call Seong Yeong right now.

753
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:22,334
Okay.

754
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:25,884
Wait...

755
00:55:27,362 --> 00:55:31,684
Gong Ma Ri, where did you go without a word?

756
00:55:31,684 --> 00:55:34,474
Why didn't you answer your phone?

757
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:38,114
Mom, why did you lie?

758
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:42,514
Pil Seung doesn't have a girlfriend. Why did you lie that he does?

759
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:44,084
What—

760
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:47,574
M-Ma Ri, what...

761
00:55:47,574 --> 00:55:52,654
I just went to his house and asked Ahjumma myself.

762
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:54,684
She said he doesn't have a girlfriend.

763
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,264
Why did you lie to me, then?

764
00:55:58,164 --> 00:56:04,014
Honey, did you really do that?

765
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:17,674
Why did you do that?

766
00:56:20,184 --> 00:56:24,304
That's the only way to make Ma Ri give up.

767
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:28,604
But why... Why do this without even trying?

768
00:56:28,604 --> 00:56:32,904
I've been interested in him and asked you about him, too.

769
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:39,674
Have you been lying to me for two years, then?

770
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:49,764
Seon Yeong and I are best friends.

771
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:53,314
I don't want things to get awkward because of the kids.

772
00:56:53,314 --> 00:56:55,604
What would happen to us, then?

773
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:59,824
And it's rude for Ma Ri to act like this, too.

774
00:56:59,824 --> 00:57:01,744
She can't act like that.

775
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:05,114
Are you serious right now?

776
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:09,694
You care more about your friendship than Ma Ri?

777
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:15,384
Don't you feel sorry for Ma Ri for chasing after Pil Sung like that?

778
00:57:15,384 --> 00:57:17,424
How...

779
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:21,154
You should be helping her, but how could you...

780
00:57:21,154 --> 00:57:26,244
Honey, I didn't want Ma Ri to get hurt.

781
00:57:26,244 --> 00:57:28,434
That's why I did that, Honey.

782
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:31,054
That makes no sense.

783
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:43,944
I haven't seen Jin Taek getting this angry in a while.

784
00:57:43,944 --> 00:57:47,154
I don't understand you, either.

785
00:57:47,154 --> 00:57:52,274
He's trying so hard to find someone for Ma Ri.

786
00:57:52,274 --> 00:57:59,824
That's why he tried to get Ma Ri to meet someone she didn't like.

787
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:06,374
But there's a man Ma Ri's obsessed with, but why won't you even try?

788
00:58:06,374 --> 00:58:09,174
You even lied to ruin things for her?

789
00:58:09,174 --> 00:58:13,164
She's right. You're in the wrong in this case.

790
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:15,924
It makes no sense you did this not to ruin your friendship.

791
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:21,334
By chance, is there a reason Pil Sung and Ma Ri can't be together?

792
00:58:22,222 --> 00:58:24,144
W-What did you say?

793
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:29,134
I mean, it's because I don't understand.

794
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:34,504
To be honest, Seon Yeong's family has no money and her husband doesn't do really anything.

795
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:39,164
If her son would become APP Group's son-in-law, they might want this to happen.

796
00:58:39,164 --> 00:58:43,834
Should I meet Seon Yeong and arrange a date if you don't want to?

797
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:46,574
Yes, why don't you do something?

798
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:48,634
Please!

799
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:52,864
Please don't butt in. Please.

800
00:58:55,684 --> 00:58:57,874
Are you as upset as I am?

801
00:58:57,874 --> 00:59:00,044
Do you worry about Ma Ri as much as I do?

802
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:03,694
Do you care about her happiness as much as I do?

803
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:06,244
So, please stay put.

804
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:09,514
I'll take care of my daughter myself.

805
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:10,954
Aigoo...

806
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:14,344
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

807
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:17,192
She must be crazy, Auntie.

808
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:18,872
Geez!

809
00:59:27,904 --> 00:59:29,564
When did you get here?

810
00:59:29,564 --> 00:59:31,714
Did you wait long?

811
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:38,334
By the way, w-w-why are you staring at me so much?

812
00:59:41,284 --> 00:59:44,354
Because you look so pretty today.

813
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:50,754
I submitted my writing, and the weather is nice,

814
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:55,064
and you said you'd buy me dinner. So I dolled up a bit.

815
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:58,674
Is this it? Let's go in.

816
01:00:11,704 --> 01:00:13,824
This place is so nice.

817
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:16,004
The night view is so nice, too.

818
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:18,014
And the fried chicken is tasty.

819
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:22,214
Help yourself.

820
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:25,834
Okay, I'm already helping myself.

821
01:00:32,952 --> 01:00:36,474
Why do you keep staring at me today?

822
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:40,024
Do I have more wrinkles now?

823
01:00:40,024 --> 01:00:43,604
Geez, I hate getting old.

824
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,054
It's not that.

825
01:00:49,624 --> 01:00:52,704
I keep looking at you because you're so pretty.

826
01:01:00,892 --> 01:01:06,364
How about... we start seeing each other officially?

827
01:01:06,364 --> 01:01:07,894
Pardon?

828
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:14,374
You're the first one who looked at me and found me pretty.

829
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:19,014
We parted ways without even knowing each other's names,

830
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:24,174
but I liked you a lot. You know, right?

831
01:01:28,024 --> 01:01:30,594
What...

832
01:01:31,474 --> 01:01:33,354
What's wrong?

833
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:40,054
I'm sorry. I need to go.

834
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,444
H-Hold on! Hold on!

835
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:51,374
You can't just leave while I'm talking.

836
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,984
You're the one who arranged all this.

837
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:57,644
I think I'm being punished because I hurt you a lot.

838
01:01:57,644 --> 01:02:01,334
No, let's stop sounding pathetic.

839
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:06,424
Let's just say that it bothered me that you bought me a drink last time we ran into each other.

840
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:08,674
So I'm buying you dinner. Let's leave it at that.

841
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:10,544
I'm sorry.

842
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,624
Be well, Noonim.

843
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:16,914
Hey, hold on.

844
01:02:16,914 --> 01:02:19,634
Are you running away after shaking me up again?

845
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:23,364
Why did you buy me dinner and say I'm pretty, then?

846
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:27,154
Or did you play me again?

847
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:31,204
Or do you have someone else?

848
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:32,964
No, I didn't play you.

849
01:02:32,964 --> 01:02:35,084
I don't have someone else, either.

850
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,614
I just...

851
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:41,884
have no confidence that I'd make you happy.

852
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:45,324
What do you mean by that?

853
01:02:45,324 --> 01:02:48,154
You have no confidence? What confidence?

854
01:02:48,154 --> 01:02:50,654
Do you need to feel confident seeing someone?

855
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:53,424
You see someone if you want to.

856
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:55,024
Noonim,

857
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:58,874
I lost everything.

858
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:01,674
I'm a beggar now.

859
01:03:01,674 --> 01:03:03,264
What?

860
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:09,414
I barely make ends meet by working random jobs.

861
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:11,824
Do you still want me?

862
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:18,384
I have less than 500,000 won each month left after paying rent and paying for debt.

863
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:22,904
I can't buy you meat or take you to a movie. I'm poor.

864
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:26,394
Do you think you could...

865
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:30,084
date someone poor like me?

866
01:03:35,882 --> 01:03:40,902
So, Noonim... I'm sorry.

867
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:47,254
I sincerely hope that you'll be happy.

868
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:08,964
My eyes. Gosh.

869
01:04:08,964 --> 01:04:13,184
Ahjumma, finish that up quickly and take the meat out of the fridge now. Hurry.

870
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:15,034
Okay.

871
01:04:22,304 --> 01:04:24,304
Gosh, my back.

872
01:04:24,304 --> 01:04:26,534
My back. Gosh.

873
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:34,664
Gosh, my goodness.

874
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:37,464
Gosh, what are you doing right now?

875
01:04:37,464 --> 01:04:39,834
How could you drop that meat?

876
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I suddenly felt weak on my hands.

877
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:45,634
What do I do? I'm sorry. My gosh.

878
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:48,814
What do I do? What do I do?

879
01:04:48,814 --> 01:04:52,434
I'm sorry, ma'am. Oh, no...

880
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:55,354
Ma'am, Ma'am!

881
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:58,954
- Mr. Oh, pull over for a moment. 
 - Okay.

882
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:03,724
Ma'am, you need to pay me for today. I worked my butt off.

883
01:05:03,724 --> 01:05:05,624
You can't just fire me like this.

884
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:08,294
You really have no conscience.

885
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:11,404
You dropped the kimchi container yesterday, and you dropped the meat today.

886
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:13,664
You're ruining my business. Why should I pay you?

887
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:16,534
I'll pay you for today. Pay me for the meat, then.

888
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:19,524
- What did you say? 
 - You're so unbelievably slow.

889
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:22,664
Ahjumma, don't work at other restaurants, either.

890
01:05:22,664 --> 01:05:26,304
That way, you won't hurt other businesses!

891
01:05:26,304 --> 01:05:29,412
Ma'am! Ma'am!

892
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:38,382


893
01:05:38,382 --> 01:05:39,794
   

894
01:05:39,794 --> 01:05:44,814
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

895
01:05:44,814 --> 01:05:47,944
♫  It's so tough  ♫

896
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:54,054
♫  I'd feel better if I could see you the way you are  ♫

897
01:05:54,054 --> 01:05:58,804
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

898
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:02,224
♫  The pain is unbearable  ♫

899
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:11,374
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

900
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,494
 Why are you so nice to me, Director? 

901
01:06:15,494 --> 01:06:17,934
 You can't do this to women. 

902
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:19,434
 I know you like ice cream. 

903
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,624
 Ji Yeong, you like flowers, right? Do you want some? 

904
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:23,774
 This is a very dangerous thing to do. 

905
01:06:23,774 --> 01:06:25,634
 This is called flirting. 

906
01:06:25,634 --> 01:06:28,754
 I heard you lost your memory from an accident. 

907
01:06:28,754 --> 01:06:30,204
 Don't you want to get your memory back? 

908
01:06:30,204 --> 01:06:32,534
 Of course, I want to. 

909
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:36,264
 You might be happier with no memory. Do you still want it back? 

910
01:06:36,264 --> 01:06:40,384
 No matter how painful it might be, that's still a part of me. 

911
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:44,364
 It's my life and my previous path.
