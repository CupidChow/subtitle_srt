1
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,307
Why are you doing this to me, President Gong? 
    

2
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:52,977
Because I like you.

3
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:54,857
Pardon?

4
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:58,597
Ji Yeong, let's try seeing each other.

5
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:01,647
Pardon?

6
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:08,807
If you can't answer right now, take your time to think about it and decide.

7
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,697
We have two more meals left, too.

8
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:15,577
Think more and decide... if you want to be my girlfriend.

9
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:19,307
Until then, I won't rush you and wait.

10
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:23,367
Well, okay.

11
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,717
I'll think about it.

12
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:28,317
You’re giving me the green light for now, then.

13
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,537
- Take these, then. 
 - No, no.

14
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:32,897
I can't take those now.

15
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:36,897
I'll think about it and take them if I decide to be your girlfriend.

16
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,707
This outfit alone is plenty for me.

17
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:41,767
I'm serious.

18
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:44,127
This is why I like you.

19
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,787
Okay, let's do that.

20
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:48,127
I'm leaving. I'll call you tomorrow.

21
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,407
Okay.

22
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:54,167
Aigoo, so heavy. I hope you take them soon.

23
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,310
Good night.

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:05,700


25
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,127
What's all this?

26
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,417
Geez!

27
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:25,157
Director, why are you standing silently like a ghost again?

28
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,917
You're so ridiculous.

29
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:29,867
You scared the crap out of me.

30
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:42,367
Ji Yeong, this oppa told you not to get in just anyone's car.

31
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,307
Why won't you listen to your oppa?

32
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,840
What? What did you say?

33
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:53,137
Who's my oppa right now?

34
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,187
You've got to be kidding me.

35
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:57,667
I decided to be your oppa from now on.

36
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,107
This oppa needs to protect you from now on.

37
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:05,067
You get in any man's car and make me nervous. I can't stand it.

38
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:09,487
I'm speechless because this is so ridiculous.

39
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:13,667
Director, President Gong isn't just any man.

40
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,467
He's my boyfriend. Boyfriend.

41
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:20,567
I decided to see him starting today.

42
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,687
What did you say?

43
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,567
Boyfriend?

44
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,157
I...

45
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:29,237
 If I tell her I heard everything and ask why she's lying, 

46
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:31,257
 she'd get all angry, 

47
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:35,957
 call President Gong in front of me and say she'd be his girlfriend. 

48
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:38,407
 Yes, let's hold back. 

49
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:42,037
Huh? Why are you smiling like that?

50
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,897
Do you think I'm lying?

51
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:46,337
I-I'm serious.

52
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:50,597
President Gong formally confessed his love to me today.

53
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,097
Unlike you-know-who, who always confuses me,

54
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:56,017
he's so straightforward and manly.

55
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:58,097
How cool is that?

56
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:01,157
That's why I said yes.

57
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,137
Don't date President Gong.

58
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:06,477
- I'm against you going out with President Gong. 
 - Aigoo...

59
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:09,227
What gives you the right to be against it?

60
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:10,987
Are you voting right now?

61
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:18,167
I don't know why I'm discussing nonsense with some man right now.

62
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,487
I'll get going now.

63
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,987
Don't go out with President Gong. Go out with me instead.

64
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:29,897
Director, you ran away when I said I liked you.

65
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,947
But do you regret it now that I'm seeing someone else?

66
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:37,887
I'm sorry, but the bus has left already.

67
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:40,037
Take these flowers, still. They're for you.

68
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,747
It's okay.

69
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:44,337
I already have a boyfriend.

70
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:48,197
I can't accept flowers from another man.

71
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:56,407
 Do Ra, you said you don't want your memory back. 

72
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:59,547
 It's too dangerous for you to see President Gong. 

73
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:03,097
 What if he finds out like I did? 

74
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,407
 Please listen to Oppa. 

75
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:15,587
Gosh, seriously...

76
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,327
What's going on today?

77
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,857
Did all men take mouse poison and go crazy?

78
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:32,957
Why are they doing this to a country bumpkin like me?

79
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,187
What's this, by the way?

80
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:40,357
He rejected me, saying there's a reason he can't like me.

81
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:43,077
Why is he suddenly doing that?

82
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:49,917
Is it okay to like me now or something?

83
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,317
 You should've said no to him. 

84
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:55,967
 You can't just ride his car every day because he asked you to. 

85
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,477
 You are young people who aren't married yet. 

86
00:05:58,477 --> 00:05:59,947
 You have to be careful. 

87
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:05,197
 A chaebol family wants Pil Sung as their son-in-law. 

88
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:08,537
Aigoo! Aigoo, yes...

89
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:15,167
Lying to him that I have a boyfriend... was definitely a smart thing to do.

90
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,387
The landlady and the Grandma even begged me.

91
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:21,667
I can't get weak because he's acting like that.

92
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:25,497
The landlady seems devoted to him.

93
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,457
Even a chaebol family wants him.

94
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,727
A country bumpkin like me can't claim him.

95
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:35,287
And he keeps changing his mind making me feel happy and sad.

96
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:38,607
making me feel happy and sad.

97
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,267
He's a bad man.

98
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:47,377
They say love that hurts too much isn't love.

99
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:07,577
 Jin Ok made the finalist, apparently. 

100
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,797
 How did she find out she made the finalist? 

101
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:20,867
 I don't know. I guess she knows someone at the broadcasting station. 

102
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,737
Broadcasting station?

103
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:34,047
 Ji Yeong, let's try seeing each other. 

104
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:37,247
 Okay. I'll think about it. 

105
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,760
What did she mean she'll think about it?

106
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,007
Yes.

107
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:46,147
- Can I come in? 
 - Yes, Auntie.

108
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,847
Why are you still up?

109
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,517
Well...

110
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:55,017
I entered your broadcasting station's screenwriting competition.

111
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,857
Oh, really?

112
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:03,177
Yes, but I guess they picked the finalist.

113
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:06,697
Could you check if I made the finalist or not?

114
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,997
Why does making the finalist matter? Winning matters.

115
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:13,607
There's no point in making the finalist if you don't win.

116
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:18,527
Hey, how could you say something like that?

117
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:24,727
What I meant was they'll contact you if you win.

118
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,407
So, wait until the result comes out.

119
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:31,447
Hey, aren't you being too harsh?

120
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:35,177
You always say it's no good whenever I show you the proposal.

121
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,227
So what if you're a drama director?

122
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,967
So what if you're my family?

123
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:47,287
Auntie, there's no family in this field.

124
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:50,237
You know connections don't get you anywhere.

125
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,167
If connections get you jobs,

126
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,987
all the writers' children would be writers, and the actors' children would be actors.

127
00:08:55,987 --> 00:09:00,147
Even the president's child won't be hired unless they're talented.

128
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:02,367
- You know that. 
 - Hey.

129
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,027
Of course, she knows that.

130
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:07,257
But still, would it kill you to help her a bit?

131
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:10,967
She's been struggling trying to become a screenwriter for over 10 years.

132
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,027
Don't you feel sorry for your aunt at all?

133
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,437
That's enough, Mom!

134
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,947
Huh? Seriously.

135
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:21,127
Mom, why are you yelling at Pil Sung?

136
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,177
Did he tell Myeong Dong to struggle?

137
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,407
She's doing that because she wants to.

138
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:29,207
Come out, Mom. Come out.

139
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:32,917
Gosh, what's so great about being a screenwriter?

140
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,897
She's even refusing to get married at that age to pursue it.

141
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:39,427
Pil Sung, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

142
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,077
- Please. 
 - Gosh, seriously!

143
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:52,387
How could he do this to us if he considers us as his family?

144
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,907
It's all because he was adopted.

145
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:57,427
It becomes apparent in moments like this.

146
00:09:57,427 --> 00:10:00,667
Mother, I thought you got better. Why are you doing this again?

147
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,307
Aigoo, yes. I deserve to die.

148
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:06,807
I deserve to die.

149
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:14,357
Why do you not say anything when she says stuff like that?

150
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:19,317
Gosh, seriously. I don't want to live with her whenever she does that.

151
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,147
Do whatever you want to do.

152
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:23,787
You say that all the time.

153
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:25,917
My gosh.

154
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:31,237
I can't believe it. Is he yelling at me now?

155
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,407
   

156
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:44,707
 Cheer up, Auntie. 

157
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:47,257
 I support you, Go Myeong Dong. 

158
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,927
Good morning, Ji Yeong.

159
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,777
Where are you going, Ji Yeong?

160
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,507
Come on and get in.

161
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:34,877
Director, I'm a woman with a boyfriend.

162
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:37,887
Why would a woman with a boyfriend get into another man's car?

163
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:41,727
I won't get into other men's cars anymore. We're done carpooling.

164
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:45,467
Ji Yeong, you already paid me half of your bus fare.

165
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,437
You should do it for a month, then.

166
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:50,387
You can't just turn me into a thief.

167
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,507
Consider that as a tip.

168
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,007
Buy some rice cake with the rest of it.

169
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,387
I'll get going now.

170
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,597
What? Tip?

171
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:15,017
Director, were you following me?

172
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,957
What are you doing right now?

173
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:20,297
Follow you? Do you own this bus?

174
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:22,957
This is public transportation used by everyone.

175
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,527
I have the right to use it, too.

176
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:27,147
You were ready to drive earlier.

177
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,127
You got into the bus following me.

178
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:33,787
I just felt like taking the bus to work today.

179
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,097
And I normally ride buses often.

180
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:41,917
So, you shouldn't care if I take the bus or subway.

181
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,427
Be careful.

182
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:03,217
Ji Yeong, you held me just now, didn't you?

183
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:08,407
What kind of nonsense is that?

184
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:10,237
What do you mean, I held you?

185
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:15,017
I was helping you so you don't fall and get injured.

186
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,807
I thought you held me because you liked me.

187
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:24,687
I'd better not talk to you at all.

188
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:28,457
I can't deal with this person at all.

189
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:36,637
Ma Ri, these gifts are too much.

190
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:38,917
I didn't do anything for you.

191
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:43,167
And you're treating me to a meal here, too.

192
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:47,257
I should get you gifts and a meal since I suggested going shopping.

193
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,247
No.

194
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:53,437
I don't know how expensive this place is, but let me pay for this meal.

195
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,157
I have a conscience, too.

196
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,547
Grandma, my dad told me...

197
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:02,427
not to be skimpy when buying meals or gifts for friends.

198
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,087
You're my friend.

199
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:06,177
You listen to everything I say and you're so nice to me.

200
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:08,337
and you're so nice to me.

201
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:11,087
I really like you a lot, Grandma.

202
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:13,967
So, don't worry about today's date expenses.

203
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,817
We're BFFs, you know.

204
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:20,487
B-BFFs? Best friends?

205
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:24,477
Gosh, you're so sweet with words, too.

206
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:29,047
Ma Ri, I really feel like you're my friend, too.

207
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:33,727
A true friend despite the difference in age and background.

208
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,457
 What's so bad about Ma Ri? 

209
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,897
 Pil Sung, that fool. 

210
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:41,517
 I think she's just the sweetest thing. 

211
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:44,357
 I would've loved her if I were a man. 

212
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:46,747
By the way, Ma Ri,

213
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:51,487
I know we're friends, but I feel bad just taking from you.

214
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:56,237
So, I want to do something for you as a friend, too.

215
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:06,617
Ma Ri, do you want to go on a date with Pil Sung?

216
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:11,227
A date with Pil Sung?

217
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:19,377
Director, we got the edited script. What should we do?

218
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,727
Why? What's wrong?

219
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:24,607
You know the market seller role Ji Yeong filled in last time?

220
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:28,237
- Yes, what about it? 
 - The writer said she made a great impression

221
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:30,367
and he wants to shoot more scenes.

222
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:34,027
What? What kind of nonsense is that?

223
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,417
Ji Yeong isn't even an actress. Why would she shoot more scenes?

224
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:41,967
I explained that she was a staff member who filled in for a sick actor,

225
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:46,257
but he said it's fine and he asked us to shoot the scenes since there aren't many lines.

226
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,977
I guess he's really into Ji Yeong.

227
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,457
He can't suddenly do this.

228
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,877
What's Mr. Kim thinking?

229
00:15:56,877 --> 00:16:00,667
Ji Yeong did a great job then.

230
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,417
I saw the script. There aren't many lines.

231
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,087
Here...

232
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:12,477
We won't be able to shoot today if we edit the script again.

233
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:16,977
We can't get further behind schedule, Director.

234
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:21,297
What's wrong with Mr. Kim? Why would he suddenly be into her?

235
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,107
Who are you...

236
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,737
Are you that "Look around. Look around" ahjumma at the market?

237
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,187
Yes.

238
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,287
That's me.

239
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,087
What brings you here, Ahjumma?

240
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:51,627
Since I've been pretending not to know the truth, I have insomnia.

241
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:56,787
I came because I need to tell you the truth so I can sleep soundly.

242
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,947
What truth?

243
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:02,277
Don't be fooled by that woman you were with.

244
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:05,227
She's a very dangerous woman.

245
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:08,217
Everything about that woman...

246
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:14,677
is a lie.

247
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,257
What did you say?

248
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,167
You...

249
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:23,977
Who are you?

250
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:30,417
Cut. Okay.

251
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:36,247
- Was it Ms. Kim Ji Yeong? 
 - Yes.

252
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:39,677
We just got the edited script today. When did you memorize the lines?

253
00:17:39,677 --> 00:17:42,087
You're a great actor. Why are you so good?

254
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:45,127
Gosh, you're being too generous.

255
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:47,947
I'm embarrassed. Stop it.

256
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,737
I don't know what's gotten into me.

257
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,337
No, seriously. You were great. You're a genius actor.

258
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,477
Maybe you were an actor in your previous life.

259
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:59,727
You got me nervous and got sucked into the scene.

260
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:03,637
I think you're gifted in acting.

261
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,707
Try studying acting properly.

262
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:07,797
- Really? 
 - Really.

263
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,447
You did great. You were the best one today. The best.

264
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,037
The best. Great job.

265
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:14,767
Thank you.

266
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,967
Ji Yeong, you did a great job.

267
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,537
Director, isn't she so good?

268
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,857
Yes. Anyway, well done.

269
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:35,297
 "Anyway, well done"? Is that a compliment or not? 

270
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:38,637
 He might as well give a proper compliment. 

271
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:43,997
 Aigoo, why is my heart racing so much anyway? 

272
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:51,107
Why is my heart racing so much?

273
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:54,197
I didn't know how fun acting can be.

274
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:58,187
A country bumpkin got to act after moving to Seoul.

275
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:02,877
Kim Ji Yeong really made it! I made it!

276
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:05,787
Ji Yeong.

277
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:09,267
I think you're a natural actor.

278
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,677
Did you study acting before?

279
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,737
Study acting?

280
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:18,187
I've never done anything like that.

281
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:20,777
Why are you so good, then?

282
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:25,957
I wonder if I was an actor in my previous life.

283
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:30,197
When the light shines on me, and the Director says "action,"

284
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:34,047
all the cells in my body pop like popcorn

285
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,947
and I start saying lines without realizing it.

286
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:40,267
That moment is so fun and exhilarating—

287
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,617
It's like that.

288
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:50,547
Ji Yeong, why don't you get trained properly as an actor?

289
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:51,967
Pardon?

290
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,677
That's nonsense.

291
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,857
How could someone like me study acting?

292
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:01,037
Acting is for special people.

293
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,487
That's not true. No one is special from the beginning.

294
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,687
You become a special person.

295
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:11,257
I've been a manager for Park Do Ra, Jo Bi Bi, and top actors.

296
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:15,387
I instinctively know if someone's a good actor or not.

297
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:17,727
You're really gifted, Ji Yeong.

298
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,077
Do you mean it?

299
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:22,177
Yes. Just believe me.

300
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,367
I'll recommend an acting school if you're interested.

301
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,177
Acting school?

302
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:31,607
   

303
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,087
This is the place.

304
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:45,907
Can someone like me really study acting?

305
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,597
   

306
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:56,317
Director.

307
00:20:56,317 --> 00:21:00,907
Hello, I'm Baek Mi Ja, Park Do Ra's mom. You remember, right?

308
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,937
Director!

309
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:06,867
It's me, Baek Mi Ja. Park Do Ra's mom. You remember, right?

310
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,337
Well, yes. Hello.

311
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:12,407
It's been so long. Have you been well?

312
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:15,677
I started another management company.

313
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:18,927
Her name is Do Do. She's an actor I'm representing.

314
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:21,687
She's a total hidden gem.

315
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,457
She's in your care, Director.

316
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,677
Oh, okay.

317
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:33,147
My gosh, Station Director! Director Hong!

318
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,947
Baek...

319
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,007
   

320
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,740
After letting Do Ra go like that,

321
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:44,947
I've been going through hell.

322
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:48,847
I've done everything to make a living.

323
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:51,637
I got so sick of the entertainment industry,

324
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:54,597
so I didn't want to even look this way.

325
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:57,587
But since I don't know how to do anything else,

326
00:21:57,587 --> 00:22:01,787
I had no choice but to come back here.

327
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,867
Thank you. Thank you, Director.

328
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,697
- Director. 
 - Yes.

329
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:19,317
- Director Hong. 
 - Yes.

330
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:23,797
I have a talent that's rare in this industry.

331
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:26,897
I have a gift of recognizing a talent at once.

332
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:30,667
I know how to turn a gemstone into a jewel and a star.

333
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:36,007
That's how I turned my Do Ra into a star.

334
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,507
- Station Director. 
 - Yes?

335
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:39,577
- Director Hong. 
 - Yes.

336
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,837
Please help me just once...

337
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:45,907
considering my Do Ra, who passed away like that.

338
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:55,867
Where's Pil Sung?

339
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:58,817
He went on location hunting with the cinematographer.

340
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:04,747
Really? If so, Sook Ja, do you guys need a supporting actress, by chance?

341
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:06,967
- Supporting actress? 
 - Yeah.

342
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,057
Park Do Ra's mom is representing this new actress.

343
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,697
Try casting her even for a small role.

344
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:18,247
We do have a 20-something female character who'd be in about three scenes.

345
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,567
Her face isn't bad.

346
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,697
Really? That's great, then.

347
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,427
Please cast her.

348
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,677
Okay. I'll tell the Director when he comes back.

349
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:29,787
Okay. Tell him that the Station Director asked him to cast her.

350
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,527
- Okay? 
 - Got it.

351
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:34,267
- Okay. Thank you. 
 - Sure.

352
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,450
   

353
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,087
Yes, Director Hong.

354
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,617
Really?

355
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,857
Can Do Do really start filming?

356
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:57,357
 Yes. By the way, 

357
00:23:57,357 --> 00:24:00,917
it's a small role with about three scenes. Is that okay?

358
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,467
Of course, it's okay.

359
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,567
I'll make sure to return this favor.

360
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:08,627
 All I did was run an errand. 

361
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:11,227
The Station Director took special care this time.

362
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:14,307
I really don't know how to return this favor.

363
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:16,637
By the way, how about the script?

364
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:18,577
She needs a script to practice acting.

365
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,327
When can we get the script?

366
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:24,437
 The director needs to approve sending the script first. You'll be contacted soon. 

367
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:26,677
I see. Got it. Thank you.

368
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:29,897
Yes, I'll be waiting. Thank you so much.

369
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:33,627
My gosh. What do I do? What do I do?

370
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:35,507
My gosh!

371
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,477
It's me, Do Do.

372
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:45,267
You've been cast!

373
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,167
Yes! So, don't do anything silly.

374
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:52,567
Follow the diet, work out, and stay at home. Okay?

375
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:57,557
You're dead meat if you get caught misbehaving, okay?

376
00:24:57,557 --> 00:25:00,877
See you there later, then, Ji Yeong.

377
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:02,407
Bye.

378
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:05,617
Okay.

379
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:10,197
Is my outfit not good enough?

380
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:11,857
   

381
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,567
Hello, Tae Hee. Yes.

382
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,697
I was going to call you, anyway.

383
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,567
You beat me to it.

384
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,057
It doesn't matter who calls first. I know you're busy.

385
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:32,017
An investor traveled from overseas yesterday.

386
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,397
I really am busy.

387
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:36,497
I'm completely out of it.

388
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:38,077
Really?

389
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:42,157
I wanted to get dinner with you tonight. And catch a movie, too.

390
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:50,487
I'm sorry. I'm having a meeting over a meal with an investor tonight.

391
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:52,707
I'm sorry, Tae Hee.

392
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:56,867
 Don't be sorry. Work obviously comes first. 

393
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,477
How about tomorrow, Tae Hee?

394
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,497
See you tomorrow, then.

395
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,077
Okay.

396
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,180
   

397
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,787
Hello, Mother. I'm Tae Hee.

398
00:26:14,787 --> 00:26:17,487
Gosh. Welcome, Tae hee.

399
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:19,257
Here you go, Mother.

400
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,727
It's pu'er tea.

401
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:24,847
Jin Dan told me you like pu'er tea.

402
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:27,207
- This is premium stuff. 
 - Really?

403
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:31,107
I love pu'er tea. Thank you so much.

404
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:42,617
I've always wanted to meet you. You're very beautiful.

405
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:45,587
Gosh, not anymore.

406
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:48,877
I was pretty good-looking when I was young.

407
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:50,597
You still are.

408
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:52,307
That must be why Jin Dan is handsome.

409
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:54,347
Gosh, do you really think so?

410
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,107
Of course.

411
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,557
I care about the looks, Mother.

412
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,767
I don't just date anyone.

413
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,857
Gosh. You're so sweet, Tae Hee.

414
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,617
By the way, you like each other so much.

415
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,087
Why wait a whole year to get married?

416
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,077
I agree with you.

417
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:17,257
But my parents are worried since people get divorced a lot these days.

418
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:20,647
You can't make a rash decision and make a mistake.

419
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,867
I suppose that's a good point.

420
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:27,957
But both of you are a bit older, too.

421
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:30,217
Let me try talking to Jin Dan about it.

422
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:32,897
Okay. Have some tea.

423
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:44,697
My gosh, isn't that Jin Dan?

424
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:49,827
Who's that woman next to him?

425
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:01,077
 - The customer is not available...  
 - He's ignoring my call, too.

426
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:02,817
That punk.

427
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:07,207
Is he seeing another woman after lying to Tae Hee about a meeting?

428
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,507
This isn't right.

429
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:21,277
What a nice and spacious place.

430
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:23,567
Why are we here, by the way?

431
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,657
Why don't you move in if you like it?

432
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:29,417
Me?

433
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:36,177
Come on. You're good at making silly jokes.

434
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:38,787
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

435
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:41,477
I told you that I like you.

436
00:28:41,477 --> 00:28:46,027
I don't want the woman I like to live in a crappy place like that.

437
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:49,257
I can't afford a place like this.

438
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:53,077
I own this apartment. You can just move in.

439
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:57,037
How could I live in a nice place like this for free?

440
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,887
What right do I have?

441
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:01,237
It makes no sense.

442
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:06,037
- You definitely deserve it once you become my girlfriend. 
 - Pardon?

443
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:09,827
What I mean is... once you become my girlfriend,

444
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:12,657
a lot of perks would come with it.

445
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:16,357
It's something to consider when you make a decision.

446
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:18,227
Perks?

447
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:22,117
Forget it.

448
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:27,597
I can't live in a big place like this by myself in good conscience.

449
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:30,357
And my current place is perfect for me.

450
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:34,497
It's small and cozy, and I sleep well there.

451
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:39,097
Well, it is a nice place, for sure.

452
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:41,987
 You're a substitute for Park Do Ra. 

453
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,357
 Stay by my side on behalf of her. 

454
00:29:44,357 --> 00:29:47,967
Why don't we get out of here now?

455
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,788
 She's not that great but playing hard to get. 

456
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:58,548
 I suppose it wouldn't be fun if she were so easy. 

457
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:03,948
Yes, let's shoot the vacation home scene at the spot we checked out today.

458
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:06,208
Yes, thank you.

459
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:10,798
Did Ji Yeong go home?

460
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:18,918
She's not seeing CEO Gong because she got off early, right?

461
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,898
Hi, Grandma. It's me.

462
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,628
Yes, I did finish work just now.

463
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:33,288
Pardon?

464
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:35,878
You're near the broadcasting station right now?

465
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,988
Pil Sung.

466
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:40,198
Just one second, Ma Ri.

467
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:54,918
Grandma, what's going on? Why are you with Ma Ri?

468
00:30:54,918 --> 00:31:02,098
To be honest, I set up this date because I felt so sorry for Ma Ri.

469
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:04,248
What do you mean by that?

470
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:08,468
Ma Ri likes you so much. What could I do?

471
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:12,358
She thinks you're a prince, and her heart pounds because of you.

472
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:15,158
I brought her here because I felt so sorry for her.

473
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:18,748
You just need to have a meal with her.

474
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:22,388
Grant that pretty girl's wish just once, Pil Sung.

475
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:27,448
You can't just do this without telling me, Grandma.

476
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:30,008
But I pity her so much.

477
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:35,148
Ma Ri is different from most women. She's a bit unwell.

478
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:40,378
She comes to our house every day and only thinks about you.

479
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:45,918
And she's your mom's best friend's daughter.

480
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:51,998
Pil Sung, being nice to her would bring you good karma.

481
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:53,898
Seriously.

482
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:58,168
I had no idea she had a plan today.

483
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:03,728
Don't get the wrong idea. I came because she suggested getting a meal.

484
00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:06,618
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

485
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:09,468
I won't. Let's eat.

486
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:11,008
Okay.

487
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:15,988
Pil Sung, I want to become close to you.

488
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:20,458
Since our moms are friends, we should be friends, too.

489
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:25,388
To be honest, I don't have many friends.

490
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:30,828
I'd be so happy if you decided to be my friend.

491
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:37,368
Yes, I like Soo Yeon, and she's friends with my mom.

492
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:39,378
We should be good friends, too.

493
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:43,028
I'll treat you to celebrate us becoming friends, then.

494
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,888
No, this oppa should treat you to dinner.

495
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:47,648
Oppa?

496
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:56,698
 Instead of calling him "Oppa" like a kid, call him "Pil Sung." 

497
00:32:56,698 --> 00:33:00,898
 That way, he'd think of you as an adult. 

498
00:33:02,218 --> 00:33:05,558
Yes, feel free to call me "oppa" since our moms are friends.

499
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,288
No, Pil Sung.

500
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:11,258
I prefer "Pil Sung" over "Oppa."

501
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:15,558
Really?

502
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:18,148
Call me that if you prefer that.

503
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:20,568
I don't care either way.

504
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:23,708
Okay. Thank you, Pil Sung.

505
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:41,847
So, you're dropping Ma Ri off right now?

506
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:48,207
I see. Mr. Park said she was with a friend. So that's what I thought.

507
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:50,867
Mr. Park must be around somewhere.

508
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:54,867
She said she sent him home. We're almost there now.

509
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:01,377
Really?

510
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:04,057
Thank you so much for calling me.

511
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:05,807
Bye.

512
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:09,957
What happened?

513
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:17,347
Hey, Mr. Park. Where are you right now?

514
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,440
I'm waiting at the restaurant parking lot right now.

515
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:24,477
Pardon? She's in someone else's car right now?

516
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:28,627
Yes, so don't wait for her and go home.

517
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:35,867
How did she meet Pil Sung?

518
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:39,207
She even lied to Mr. Park that she was meeting a friend.

519
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:44,907
What am I supposed to do with her?

520
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:01,787
Hello.

521
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:03,937
Hey, Pil Sung.

522
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:06,287
I hope Ma Ri didn't give you a hard time.

523
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:07,727
I'm so sorry.

524
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:11,107
No, we enjoyed a meal and had a good time.

525
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:13,967
Mom, I had so much fun with Pil Sung today.

526
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:18,617
We went to the arcade together and we had ice cream on the street, too.

527
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,827
Is that so?

528
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:24,567
I'll get going now, then. Take care.

529
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:28,677
Yes, drive safely. Thank you.

530
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:31,407
See you again, Pil Sung.

531
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:33,957
Okay. See you, Ma Ri.

532
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,397
What happened?

533
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:48,487
You didn't say a word to me.

534
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:51,627
You lied to Mr. Park you were meeting a friend and made him wait, too.

535
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:55,607
It's because I wanted to drive alone with Pil Sung.

536
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,407
What?

537
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:01,307
And what do you mean, "Pil Sung"? He's your oppa.

538
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:05,547
What's the big deal? I thought he thought of me as a child.

539
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:07,487
So, I'll call him that now.

540
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:11,057
That way, he'd think of me as an adult.

541
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:12,337
Is that why?

542
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:16,837
He treated me like a lady instead of a child today.

543
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:22,107
Ma Ri, you promised Mom and Dad that you'd forget about him.

544
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:26,387
Mom, Pil Sung's grandma said he doesn't have a girlfriend.

545
00:36:26,387 --> 00:36:29,317
There's no goalkeeper. Why should I move on and give up?

546
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:32,017
I'll keep shooting the ball until I score.

547
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:33,267
What?

548
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,817
Ma Ri.

549
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:37,697
Why are you out here?

550
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,107
Dad.

551
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:42,487
Dad, I had a date with Pil Sung today. Just the two of us.

552
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:44,797
I had so much fun!

553
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:48,637
W-What? What's she talking about?

554
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:53,654
Are they still on the date?

555
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:57,834
It'd be so nice if they liked each other.

556
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:01,984
Huh? What happened to the melon and stuff?

557
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:04,034
Mother!

558
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:07,474
Mother! I heard you forced Pil Sung and Ma Ri to go on a date.

559
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:09,184
Yes, I did.

560
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:10,754
What's wrong with that?

561
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:12,764
Mother, what's wrong with you?

562
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,114
Why do you give so many people a hard time?

563
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:18,324
We barely managed to coax Ma Ri.

564
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:22,484
Soo Yeon called me and said Ma Ri is having false hope again.

565
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:26,804
She's apparently so obsessed with Pil Sung.

566
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:28,884
They say everyone deserves to get their wishes granted.

567
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:32,064
Is it so bad that I let them have a meal together?

568
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:35,004
Ma Ri isn't like most women.

569
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:38,554
The issue is that she tries to pursue him regardless of his feelings.

570
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:43,794
She should be thanking me since I managed to set up a date for her.

571
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:47,384
What's wrong with your friend? Is she really her biological daughter?

572
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:52,064
How come she doesn't care about her daughter's feelings? How heartless is she?

573
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,954
I'm home.

574
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:55,344
Pil Sung.

575
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:58,744
I heard you met Ma Ri today.

576
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,874
It must've been difficult.

577
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:02,414
Not at all. It was fine.

578
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,874
We ate together and talked.

579
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,204
I owe Soo Yeon a lot, too.

580
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,154
- I'll go upstairs. 
 - Okay.

581
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:13,804
Hey, hey, hey.

582
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:17,544
He just said he's fine with it.

583
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:19,964
I'm home.

584
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:23,564
What's wrong with her?

585
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:27,564
Did you have a fight with her?

586
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:29,304
Did you really...

587
00:38:29,304 --> 00:38:31,484
You knew about this, didn't you?

588
00:38:31,484 --> 00:38:34,244
You plotted with your mother again, didn't you?

589
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,444
What are you talking about out of the blue?

590
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,284
Hey!

591
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:40,244
Hyeon Cheol doesn't know anything!

592
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:41,744
What do you mean, we plotted?

593
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:43,984
And when your husband comes home,

594
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:47,814
you should say, "You worked hard today. Have you eaten?"

595
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:54,954
Even if Hyeon Cheol cheats on you, you'd better not say a word. Got it?

596
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:01,464
My gosh...

597
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,404
What's wrong?

598
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:05,784
Did someone cheat?

599
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,444
Do Jun!

600
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:22,124
Ma Ri.

601
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:24,544
What's going on?

602
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:28,684
I'm sorry about earlier. I came to apologize.

603
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:32,024
I'm glad nothing happened.

604
00:39:34,574 --> 00:39:39,484
But I'm your driver and bodyguard.

605
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:44,004
I have no reason to live here if I can't protect you.

606
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:45,954
I said I'm sorry.

607
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:48,084
I won't do that again.

608
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:50,654
You'll forgive me, right?

609
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,384
Sure.

610
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:55,374
If I told you to leave earlier,

611
00:39:55,374 --> 00:40:00,414
I'm sure you would've insisted on waiting and told my mom.

612
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:04,524
I had no choice because I didn't want my plan to fail.

613
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:06,854
So, did things go as you planned?

614
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:09,474
Yes. With Pil Sung Oppa...

615
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:14,414
I mean, I had a date alone with Pil Sung today. This is monumental.

616
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,684
I'm so happy that I don't think I could sleep.

617
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,744
As long as you're happy.

618
00:40:24,094 --> 00:40:27,684
Wow, daebak.

619
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:32,194
Hey, what are you doing?

620
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:36,444
Can I touch your arm just once?

621
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:37,684
No.

622
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:40,864
Just once, please. Just once.

623
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:45,754
Just once, then, okay?

624
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:47,164
Okay.

625
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,444
Wow.

626
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,124
Wow, it's so hard.

627
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:55,854
Do Jun, you're so cool.

628
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:58,124
This is nothing.

629
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:16,744
Ma Ri must like Pil Sung a lot.

630
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:20,754
She's that happy to have a meal with him.

631
00:41:22,154 --> 00:41:26,444
Honey... this is no good.

632
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:31,724
I'll live in the US with Ma Ri for a year or two.

633
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:35,564
She can study art and design, too.

634
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:37,514
What do you think?

635
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:40,514
You can't do that.

636
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:42,754
Ma Ri had a hard time living in the US.

637
00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:45,314
That's why she came back.

638
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:49,214
It's hard for her to make new friends there, too.

639
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:53,324
And I had a hard time living alone here, too.

640
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:57,564
What else can we do? How do we stop her from doing that to Pil Sung?

641
00:41:57,564 --> 00:42:01,304
Honey, don't worry so much.

642
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:04,114
Let's just try going with the flow.

643
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:09,034
I'm so thankful to Pil Sung for today.

644
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:12,434
She let Ma Ri have fun with him.

645
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:16,704
He really seems to be a nice fellow.

646
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:19,344
Things might work out at this rate.

647
00:42:19,344 --> 00:42:22,224
And even if it doesn't,

648
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:28,104
Ma Ri could grow more through the experience.

649
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:33,344
And I'm sure she'd refuse to go to the US.

650
00:42:36,444 --> 00:42:38,314
I'll take a shower.

651
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:47,700
Yes.

652
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:52,314
Pil Sung has no feelings for Ma Ri, anyway.

653
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:57,224
She'll grow tired and give up eventually.

654
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:05,354
Since I paid for the meal today, we still have two meals left, okay?

655
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:07,604
I should've paid.

656
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:10,164
You shouldn't have paid instead.

657
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:12,574
You haven't agreed to be my girlfriend.

658
00:43:12,574 --> 00:43:15,164
So I'm trying to buy more time.

659
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:18,914
Anyway, you need to decide before we finish two meals, okay?

660
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:20,624
The sooner, the better.

661
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:22,544
Okay.

662
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:24,844
Get home safely.

663
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:39,994
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

664
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,574
CEO Gong isn't your boyfriend yet.

665
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,914
Why did you lie that he was, then?

666
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:07,634
I've already decided in my heart.

667
00:44:07,634 --> 00:44:11,344
I'm just trying to be more careful.

668
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:12,814
What do you call it?

669
00:44:12,814 --> 00:44:15,874
Playing hard to get. That's what I'm doing.

670
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:19,844
So, that means he's not your boyfriend yet.

671
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:25,014
Yes, we're still flirting with each other. Happy?

672
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:30,264
By the way, why are you so interested?

673
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:32,164
How bothersome.

674
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:36,854
I didn't think you were like this, but you're very unfair.

675
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:39,484
Me? What do you mean?

676
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:40,824
I'm not like that.

677
00:44:40,824 --> 00:44:45,314
You eat with CEO Gong, but why not with me?

678
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:48,334
Have three meals with me, too. And then decide.

679
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:50,194
I don't want to.

680
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:52,674
I don't want to share a meal with you.

681
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:54,284
Why not?

682
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:58,224
I have a reason, too.

683
00:44:58,224 --> 00:45:00,534
What's the reason?

684
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:03,264
You said you had a reason you couldn't like me.

685
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:05,484
I'll tell you if you tell me your reason.

686
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:09,604
What is it? You can't tell me, right? Don't ask me, either, then.

687
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,184
Aren't I making you curious?

688
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:13,434
I'm driving you crazy, right?

689
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:33,044
Looks like you didn't have a reason since you can't say anything.

690
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:35,764
You've been testing me, haven't you?

691
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:39,554
And you're poking at me because I said I'm seeing someone, right?

692
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:42,404
I'm not such a fool.

693
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:44,604
I know these things, too.

694
00:45:44,604 --> 00:45:48,064
So, don't poke me.

695
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,334
I'm about to go crazy.

696
00:45:57,784 --> 00:46:00,494
Hey, who was that woman earlier?

697
00:46:00,494 --> 00:46:02,254
Who were you walking around with?

698
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:06,284
You lied to Tae Hee that you had a meeting with an investor.

699
00:46:06,284 --> 00:46:07,904
What woman?

700
00:46:07,904 --> 00:46:09,554
I saw everything earlier.

701
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:11,884
You were walking somewhere with some woman.

702
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:13,904
Are you already seeing someone else?

703
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,864
What would you do if Auntie found out about this?

704
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:19,254
Jin Dan, you promised you wouldn't do this.

705
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:21,794
Aren't you going to marry Tae Hee?

706
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:25,434
What are you talking about? I'll marry Tae Hee.

707
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:28,374
What's your relationship with that woman, then?

708
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:30,594
What's my relationship with her?

709
00:46:30,594 --> 00:46:36,194
Well, she's the buyer's interpreter.

710
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,584
Is that who you're talking about right now?

711
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:40,214
Are you sure there's nothing going on?

712
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,094
Is she really an interpreter?

713
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:43,894
I'm telling you.

714
00:46:47,274 --> 00:46:49,104
What's going on?

715
00:46:49,104 --> 00:46:50,554
Jin Dan, did something happen?

716
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:51,984
No, not at all.

717
00:46:51,984 --> 00:46:54,854
He was joking around.

718
00:46:56,164 --> 00:46:58,644
I thought something was going on.

719
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:02,294
You must be happy to have a son like him.

720
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:05,314
I got a call from Tae Hee's parents.

721
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:07,984
She apparently wants to have a wedding soon.

722
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:10,704
Really?

723
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:13,234
I suppose she likes him a lot.

724
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:15,964
Let's set the date, then.

725
00:47:15,964 --> 00:47:18,734
You're okay with that, too, right?

726
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:21,324
Yes, but...

727
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:25,104
I think we still need to get to know each other more.

728
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:27,594
You like each other. What's there to learn about?

729
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:31,694
I love how pretty and attentive Tae Hee is.

730
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:35,324
Anyway, they like the idea, too. Get to know her more.

731
00:47:35,324 --> 00:47:36,804
Okay.

732
00:47:43,024 --> 00:47:47,134
Jin Dan, you'd better not ruin a good thing, okay?

733
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,954
I'll trust you, okay?

734
00:47:48,954 --> 00:47:50,984
Mom, trust me.

735
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:54,184
I'll make sure to marry Tae Hee. Don't worry.

736
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:56,424
   

737
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:01,084
Director, I forgot to tell you yesterday.

738
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:05,004
We were asked to cast this woman for the male lead's blind date.

739
00:48:05,004 --> 00:48:08,584
It was the Station Director and Director Hong's request.

740
00:48:09,714 --> 00:48:11,744
Do Do?

741
00:48:11,744 --> 00:48:13,984
I've never heard of her.

742
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:15,424
   

743
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:18,024
What? She has no previous experience.

744
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:23,784
That's true, but it was a special request from the Station Director.

745
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:25,924
The Station Director?

746
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:28,004
Who is she, anyway?

747
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:32,884
Bbaek Entertainment. Baek Mi Ja?

748
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:36,454
The late Park Do Ra's mom apparently started the company.

749
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:39,324
I guess that's why the Station Director is asking you.

750
00:48:40,324 --> 00:48:41,864
Say no.

751
00:48:41,864 --> 00:48:42,974
Pardon?

752
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:47,564
The male lead goes on a blind date after breaking up with the female lead, who lies.

753
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:50,104
It's the last dramatic scene in the drama.

754
00:48:50,104 --> 00:48:54,634
I can't cast an actor without any experience for an important scene like that.

755
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:58,994
Make it clear that I don't want her and look for someone else.

756
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:00,514
Okay.

757
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:12,104
Do Sik, just wait a bit.

758
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:16,664
I'll settle down and get you a storefront somehow, okay?

759
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:20,344
Mom, I don't expect anything like that.

760
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:22,864
Just try not to cause any trouble.

761
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,414
I'll be right back.

762
00:49:24,414 --> 00:49:26,904
Be careful on the motorcycle.

763
00:49:29,204 --> 00:49:34,114
I need to get this going for Do Jun and Do Sik.

764
00:49:34,114 --> 00:49:36,224
Why am I not hearing from them-

765
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,004
My gosh.

766
00:49:41,654 --> 00:49:44,564
- Director Hong. 
 - Yes, CEO Baek.

767
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,014
I don't know what to say.

768
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:48,994
I don't think this project would work out.

769
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:51,224
Why not? I thought it was basically decided.

770
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:53,324
Do Do is a good actor.

771
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,284
I heard back from the crew.

772
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,024
They can't cast her since it's an important role.

773
00:49:58,024 --> 00:49:59,634
Really?

774
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:03,724
Please tell me who the director is, then.

775
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:07,244
I'll visit him with Do Do and try to persuade him.

776
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:09,324
Would you like to do that?

777
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:11,114
 You must know him, too. 

778
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:15,394
 It's Director Go Pil Sung, who was the assistant director for "Straightforward Romance." 

779
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:17,954
Who?

780
00:50:17,954 --> 00:50:20,784
Go Pil Sung?

781
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:29,074
Station Director, Director,

782
00:50:29,074 --> 00:50:33,324
could you get her a different role somehow?

783
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,554
There are no other roles right now.

784
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:40,724
That role would've been perfect.

785
00:50:40,724 --> 00:50:43,964
We have no choice since the director said no.

786
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:49,174
CEO Baek, I'll call you when something else comes up.

787
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:50,814
This isn't the only opportunity.

788
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:54,824
No, Director! This is the only chance I have.

789
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:58,504
Let her get that role, no matter what it takes.

790
00:50:58,504 --> 00:51:01,214
Okay, I'll try again.

791
00:51:08,814 --> 00:51:11,094
Why isn't he answering?

792
00:51:13,774 --> 00:51:16,004
Sook Ja, is the Director Go there?

793
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:18,004
Why isn't he answering my call?

794
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:20,794
Huh? There's no shoot today?

795
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:29,384
Sook Ja, is there anything you could do about what I had asked?

796
00:51:31,814 --> 00:51:34,424
Oh, really?

797
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,644
Okay. I'll let you get back to it.

798
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:43,014
They said no.

799
00:51:44,814 --> 00:51:49,864
As you know, all I do is sit at my desk as the station director.

800
00:51:49,864 --> 00:51:52,494
I have no power.

801
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:58,364
There's nothing you can do if the director says no.

802
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:01,044
I'm sorry.

803
00:52:10,144 --> 00:52:11,724
CEO Baek.

804
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:24,594
 How could I live in a nice place like this for free? 

805
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:26,494
 What right do I have? 

806
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:29,404
 You definitely deserve it once you become my girlfriend. 

807
00:52:29,404 --> 00:52:33,084
 You eat with CEO Gong, but why not with me? 

808
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:34,324
 Have three meals with me, too. 

809
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:36,274
 Don't date CEO Gong. 

810
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:39,714
 I'm against you going out with CEO Gong. 

811
00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:41,424
Yes.

812
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,494
It's not just because of what the Director said.

813
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,664
CEO Gong isn't quite right somehow.

814
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:51,494
How could I live in a luxury apartment like that for free?

815
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:56,164
Grandma said there's nothing free in this world.

816
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:59,284
You have to pay for it somehow.

817
00:52:59,284 --> 00:53:02,644
How am I supposed to repay him if I live there for free?

818
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:05,834
Is being his girlfriend the payment?

819
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:11,114
I know I have nothing, but that's not right.

820
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:19,484
 We have no shoot today. 
   

821
00:53:19,484 --> 00:53:21,194
Hello?

822
00:53:21,194 --> 00:53:24,114
We have no shoot today. What's this about?

823
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:26,364
 Ji Yeong, I need your help. 

824
00:53:26,364 --> 00:53:28,884
 Please come here now. Hurry! Hurry! 

825
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:32,684
Oh, my! Director, what's going on?

826
00:53:32,684 --> 00:53:34,514
Where are you?

827
00:53:34,514 --> 00:53:37,934
Director! 
    

828
00:53:37,934 --> 00:53:40,444
What's going on?

829
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:43,814
What is going on?

830
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:47,084
What happened to the Director?

831
00:53:47,084 --> 00:53:50,254
I've never heard him sound like that.

832
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:52,764
What happened to him?

833
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:57,274
Director! Director! Where are you?

834
00:53:57,274 --> 00:53:59,314
Director!

835
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:01,684
Ji Yeong, I'm right here.

836
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:05,334
Director, what happened?

837
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:08,664
Are you okay?

838
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:10,694
You must've been worried about me.

839
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:12,794
I'm totally fine.

840
00:54:15,404 --> 00:54:17,084
What did you say?

841
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:22,324
Did you lie to me, pretending like something happened?

842
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:26,194
Do you know how worried I was while coming here?

843
00:54:26,194 --> 00:54:29,214
I thought my heart was shrinking!

844
00:54:29,214 --> 00:54:30,784
Wow.

845
00:54:31,564 --> 00:54:35,764
You care about me this much? I'm so moved.

846
00:54:35,764 --> 00:54:37,354
Are you kidding me right now?

847
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:39,494
Imagine how desperate I must've been.

848
00:54:39,494 --> 00:54:41,424
I wanted to go on a date with you,

849
00:54:41,424 --> 00:54:43,794
but you wouldn't have come if I just invited you.

850
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:46,664
So, I had no choice but to lie.

851
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:49,584
I'm sorry about that.

852
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:53,314
Forget it.

853
00:54:53,314 --> 00:54:56,904
Ji Yeong, go on a date with me.

854
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:59,584
Please give me just one chance, too.

855
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:02,014
You aren't dating CEO Gong right now.

856
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:06,284
You won't be two-timing or cheating on him.

857
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:09,594
Why don't we do this, then?

858
00:55:09,594 --> 00:55:13,034
You'll have a date with me and with CEO Gong, too.

859
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:16,874
And decide what you want to do later.

860
00:55:16,874 --> 00:55:20,984
 This man really is a bad man. 

861
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,594
 A bad man who shakes me up like this. 

862
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:26,074
Let's go.

863
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:33,394
 Why am I being dragged around by this bad man right now? 

864
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:39,384
♫  Rather than the morning with bright sunshine  ♫

865
00:55:39,384 --> 00:55:43,164
♫  The moonlight suits you more  ♫

866
00:55:43,164 --> 00:55:46,524
♫  The goodbye kiss  ♫

867
00:55:46,524 --> 00:55:48,654
Hello.

868
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:50,724
What's this?

869
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:53,524
It's a gift for everyone who comes here.

870
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:55,674
Thank you.

871
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:57,664
♫  And tell you  ♫

872
00:55:57,664 --> 00:56:01,634
♫  I shout out your name  ♫

873
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:03,634
Isn't this garden so pretty?

874
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:08,344
Yes, I suppose it's pretty.

875
00:56:09,404 --> 00:56:13,514
You should take a deep bow at the flowers to thank them.

876
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:17,354
I would've slapped you for lying if it weren't for these flowers.

877
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:21,874
I'm forgiving you because the flowers are pretty.

878
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:23,694
Thank you, flowers.

879
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:25,914
I dodged the bullet, thanks to you.

880
00:56:26,844 --> 00:56:32,334
♫  I'll hold you tightly and tell you  ♫

881
00:56:32,334 --> 00:56:34,914
Ji Yeong, stand here.

882
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:39,224
We should take a picture since we're in such a nice place, right?

883
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:43,864
I suppose you're right.

884
00:56:44,794 --> 00:56:47,434
Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?

885
00:56:47,434 --> 00:56:49,074
- Sure. 
 - Thank you.

886
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:54,364
♫  I shout out your name one more time  ♫

887
00:56:54,364 --> 00:56:55,794
Here we go.

888
00:56:55,794 --> 00:56:58,564
One, two, three.

889
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:03,334
♫  I'll say I love you  ♫

890
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:07,614
♫  My love  ♫

891
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:12,984
It does look like we make a nice couple.

892
00:57:15,074 --> 00:57:18,394
Oh, my. Kim Ji Yeong, why are you doing this again?

893
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:20,034
I can't like the Director.

894
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:22,304
Get it together!

895
00:57:37,924 --> 00:57:41,794
Hey. Go Myeong Dong.

896
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:44,184
Today is the day, right?

897
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:50,104
It's the day the screenwriting competition result comes out, right?

898
00:57:52,454 --> 00:57:57,954
Hey, d-did you get rejected again?

899
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:02,334
Gosh, I'm so upset!

900
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:05,304
You definitely promised me.

901
00:58:05,304 --> 00:58:09,654
That you'd quit without regrets if you failed this time.

902
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:11,384
You'd better not change your mind.

903
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:14,304
You're giving up completely this time, okay?

904
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:17,144
Okay, I said! That's enough!

905
00:58:17,144 --> 00:58:21,404
You little. How dare you flip out on me?

906
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,624
What?

907
00:58:26,624 --> 00:58:29,224
 Auntie, congratulations! 

908
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:32,774
What? What are you congratulating me for?

909
00:58:32,774 --> 00:58:37,024
 The screenwriting competition result comes out today and I saw your name on the list. 

910
00:58:37,024 --> 00:58:39,044
 You won the Excellence Award. 

911
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:40,534
What?

912
00:58:40,534 --> 00:58:42,514
Is that true, Pil Sung?

913
00:58:44,194 --> 00:58:45,954
Okay, okay!

914
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:49,484
What? What? What? Huh?

915
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,144
Mom, I think I won!

916
00:58:52,144 --> 00:58:55,184
What? Really? Really? Really?

917
00:58:58,194 --> 00:59:00,564
H-Hello?

918
00:59:00,564 --> 00:59:04,614
Yes, I'm Go Myeong Dong.

919
00:59:04,614 --> 00:59:06,224
What did you say?

920
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:08,064
Really?

921
00:59:11,004 --> 00:59:14,764
Thank you! Thank you!

922
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,294
What? What? What?

923
00:59:16,294 --> 00:59:18,814
- Mom! 
 - What? What?

924
00:59:18,814 --> 00:59:20,594
It's true! It's true!

925
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:22,794
They told me to come to the broadcasting station next Wednesday.

926
00:59:22,794 --> 00:59:25,874
They want me to bring some documents!

927
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:29,904
My baby! My baby! My baby!

928
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:32,124
What's going on?

929
00:59:32,124 --> 00:59:33,774
Unni!

930
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:36,974
Seon Yeong, Myeong Dong won the competition.

931
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:40,024
Myeong Dong became a drama writer!

932
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:42,524
My goodness! Is that true?

933
00:59:42,524 --> 00:59:45,034
Unni!

934
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:50,144
My goodness! My baby!

935
00:59:56,214 --> 00:59:57,574
- Manager Go. 
 - Yes.

936
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:59,614
Please train this fellow right here.

937
00:59:59,614 --> 01:00:01,064
Yes, sure.

938
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:05,454
Manager Go worked here the longest. You can learn a lot from him.

939
01:00:05,454 --> 01:00:07,964
- Good luck going forward. 
 - Thank you.

940
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:09,484
Okay.

941
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:14,574
Once the meat is about 80% cooked,

942
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,544
you can move it on the grill like this.

943
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:21,104
Excuse me.

944
01:00:22,924 --> 01:00:23,934
Just one moment.

945
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:25,794
Hello?

946
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:27,744
Hi, Mom.

947
01:00:27,744 --> 01:00:31,104
What? What did you say? Really?

948
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:35,754
Cheers!

949
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:37,804
Cheers!

950
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:40,614
Congratulations!

951
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,934
Myeong Dong, congratulations. You worked so hard.

952
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:47,454
Congratulations, Myeong Dong.

953
01:00:47,454 --> 01:00:50,584
I hope you write lots of fun dramas in the future.

954
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:52,584
Thank you, Unni and Oppa.

955
01:00:52,584 --> 01:00:54,634
- Yes. 
 - Auntie.

956
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:58,194
- Really? 
 - What is it?

957
01:00:58,194 --> 01:01:00,304
Gosh.

958
01:01:00,304 --> 01:01:02,014
I'll go get my phone.

959
01:01:02,014 --> 01:01:06,504
Gosh, I can finally sleep soundly. My gosh!

960
01:01:06,504 --> 01:01:10,134
 Hello? Is anyone home? 

961
01:01:10,134 --> 01:01:14,474
Who's that? That voice sounds familiar.

962
01:01:14,474 --> 01:01:16,494
Who's it?

963
01:01:16,494 --> 01:01:17,704
Who's that?

964
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:19,284
My gosh!

965
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:23,514
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

966
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:26,644
Well, w-what are you doing here?

967
01:01:26,644 --> 01:01:28,464
How could you come to our house?

968
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:35,044
The thing is, I called Director Go, but he didn't answer my call.

969
01:01:35,684 --> 01:01:39,434
Why would you look for my Pil Sung? What business do you have?

970
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:42,864
Aigoo, aigoo. Don't get me wrong. Don't get me wrong.

971
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:46,024
I need to talk to him regarding my actor.

972
01:01:46,024 --> 01:01:49,004
I'd like to talk to Director Go.

973
01:01:49,004 --> 01:01:51,624
Pil Sung! Pil Sung! Come down here!

974
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,334
Okay.

975
01:01:57,834 --> 01:01:59,914
What brings you here?

976
01:02:03,364 --> 01:02:05,984
Director, you must've heard.

977
01:02:05,984 --> 01:02:10,144
I came to talk to you about Do Do.

978
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:13,684
Let's talk outside about that.

979
01:02:13,684 --> 01:02:15,344
Okay, okay.

980
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:17,434
Here, this is a roll cake.

981
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:20,774
I waited in line to get the trendiest cake.

982
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:22,444
I hope you enjoy it.

983
01:02:22,444 --> 01:02:25,864
- Here, here, here. 
 - My goodness.

984
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:31,084
Seon Yeong, what exactly is going on right now?

985
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,484
My goodness.

986
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:38,504
Director Go.

987
01:02:42,154 --> 01:02:44,474
You must've already heard about my decision.

988
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:47,164
You can't come all the way to my house like this.

989
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:52,244
I came all the way here for a reason, Director Go.

990
01:02:52,244 --> 01:02:56,644
Please help me out just once.

991
01:02:56,644 --> 01:03:00,174
This isn't about helping someone.

992
01:03:00,174 --> 01:03:03,704
She isn't the right fit for the role. Let's leave it at that.

993
01:03:03,704 --> 01:03:05,194
I...

994
01:03:06,094 --> 01:03:08,614
went to jail after what happened to Do Ra.

995
01:03:08,614 --> 01:03:11,814
I live in a studio apartment now.

996
01:03:11,814 --> 01:03:14,124
The rest of my family are scattered.

997
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,914
And I don't even know where Do Jun lives.

998
01:03:16,914 --> 01:03:18,984
I'm only living because I couldn't die.

999
01:03:18,984 --> 01:03:22,384
It's so hard to make a living.

1000
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:25,284
I've been so devastated since Do Ra died.

1001
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:31,574
But I got back in this because I wanted to create another star like Do Ra.

1002
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,134
Director Go, please help me just once.

1003
01:03:35,134 --> 01:03:38,114
Do Do has no experience, but I can make her pull it off.

1004
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,234
How could you reject me like this?

1005
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,684
It's not like we don't know each other.

1006
01:03:43,684 --> 01:03:45,744
Please, Director Go? Just once.

1007
01:03:45,744 --> 01:03:48,884
Help me just once. Just once.

1008
01:03:48,884 --> 01:03:50,284
I'm sorry.

1009
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,584
Please leave if that's all you have to say.

1010
01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:56,124
I saw the actor's headshot. She doesn't suit the role.

1011
01:03:56,124 --> 01:04:00,454
And don't ever come to my house.

1012
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:04,034
Hey! You bastard!

1013
01:04:04,034 --> 01:04:08,394
Hey! How could you do this to me?

1014
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:10,544
Are you looking down on me now that you're successful?

1015
01:04:10,544 --> 01:04:12,984
I'm in this position because of you.

1016
01:04:12,984 --> 01:04:18,684
I wouldn't be in this mess if you didn't seduce Do Ra back then!

1017
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:20,884
You...

1018
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:23,484
Bring Do Ra back to life, you bastard!

1019
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:27,304
I came all the way here, but you're kicking me out?

1020
01:04:27,304 --> 01:04:30,004
Bring her back to life, you bastard!

1021
01:04:30,004 --> 01:04:33,134
Director! What are you doing to the Director?

1022
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:35,354
Who is this crazy woman?

1023
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:36,704
Stop this!

1024
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:38,434
Ji Yeong, don't do this.

1025
01:04:38,434 --> 01:04:39,884
Let go of him!

1026
01:04:39,884 --> 01:04:42,634
- Let go! 
 - Ji Yeong!

1027
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:53,620


1028
01:04:56,724 --> 01:04:58,194
   

1029
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:05,134
♫  You keep showing up and make my heart flutter  ♫

1030
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,774
♫  And get me excited over and over  ♫

1031
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:14,664
♫  You keep finding me without fail, so I can't think about anything else  ♫

1032
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:19,454
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

1033
01:05:27,074 --> 01:05:31,684
♫  The sky is clearer than usual, and my feet feel light  ♫

1034
01:05:31,684 --> 01:05:35,854
 I'll make money as a screenwriter and become successful now. 

1035
01:05:35,854 --> 01:05:37,054
 So, let's start seeing each other again. 

1036
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:38,904
 I'll take care of you from now on. 

1037
01:05:38,904 --> 01:05:40,444
 You must not know who that woman is. 

1038
01:05:40,444 --> 01:05:42,484
 She's the only daughter of the APP Group family. 

1039
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:45,924
 Is the Director becoming APP Group's son-in-law, then? 

1040
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:49,584
 She was the heiress his grandmother was talking about. 

1041
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:52,114
 A lightbulb went off when I saw you acting. 

1042
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,834
 You have what it takes, Ji Yeong. 

1043
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:56,394
 Could you become the first actor for my company? 

1044
01:05:56,394 --> 01:05:58,174
 Why would you suddenly act? 

1045
01:05:58,174 --> 01:05:59,544
 Are you saying you'll become an actor? 

1046
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:01,354
 You'd better not act. Got it? 

1047
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:04,964
 Ji Yeong wants to become an actor like Park Do Ra? Is this a coincidence? 

1048
01:06:04,964 --> 01:06:09,674
 It's because I want you to live happily without worries like now. 

1049
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:15,224
 I need to act so I can live happily from now on. Understand?
