1
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,110
   

2
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,740
Mom.

3
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,090
President Jang gave birth to me?

4
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,720
No.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,120
No, no.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,910
No, Pil Sung.

7
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,210
You heard us wrong.

8
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,800
Mom.

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,070
You just said it right now.

10
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,530
That she gave birth to me and left me at our door.

11
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,270
Pil Sung, Pil Sung, no, I...

12
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,200
Hey! How dare you call his name?

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,770
How dare you call his name?

14
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,530
What gives you the right to call his name?

15
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,320
What will you do now? Huh?

16
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,560
What will you do now?

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,370
- Mom... 
 - What will you do now?

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,740
What are you doing, Mom?

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,820
Pil Sung, that bitch abandoned you in front of our house!

20
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,170
When you were less than a week old, that bitch abandoned you in front of our house!

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,330
No way.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,890
This bitch abandoned a baby?

23
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,780
And he was even less than a week old?

24
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,370
Aigoo, what a horrible bitch!

25
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,760
You bitch! How did you abandon your baby?

26
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,410
♪  Until the East Sea's waves are dry, Mt. Baekdu worn away  ♪  

27
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,480
How dare you! How dare you do that...

28
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,870
Director, where's my Ji Yeong?

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,210
Director.

30
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,980
Just one moment, Grandma. I'll take you to Ji Yeong.

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,930
- Please wait just a moment. 
 - Okay.

32
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes, Director.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
Ji Yeong, where are you right now?

34
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm at home.

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,810
What's this about?

36
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,020
Your grandmother came here.

37
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,270
W-What did you say?

38
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,660
My grandma went to your house?

39
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,170
Yes, but I think her dementia is kicking in.

40
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,700
She's singing, looking for you right now.

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,230
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry, but...

42
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,830
please make sure she doesn't go anywhere.

43
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,280
I'll be there right now.

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,750
No, I think it'd be faster if I went.

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,640
She's looking for you so desperately.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,990
I'll get going right now.

47
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,030
Okay. Gosh...

48
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,210
Gosh! What do I do with her?

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,480
Ji Yeong!

50
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,460
Grandma!

51
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,200
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Yes.

52
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,550
Let me see.

53
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,260
Are you back to your senses?

54
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,580
Yes.

55
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,350
I heard you sang the national anthem at the Director's house.

56
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,810
Yes, I think I lost my mind again.

57
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,100
Why did you come alone without telling me?

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,260
What if you got lost?

59
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,230
What if you lost your mind in someone else's house?

60
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,860
Hey, I don't just do that in any situation.

61
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,660
I don't do that at a random place.

62
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,730
Are you joking right now?

63
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,180
This could've been really bad!

64
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,210
Anyway, when did you move?

65
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,510
How come you didn't tell me?

66
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,990
Well, the thing is...

67
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,870
Grandma, I'll explain that to you after we go inside.

68
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,280
- Let's go inside. 
 - Okay, okay.

69
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,430
Director, I'm so sorry about today.

70
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,600
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, just one second.

72
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,750
What's with you?

73
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,910
Seriously.

74
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,270
- Take these... 
 - Ji Yeong, she brought these with her.

75
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,350
I'll get going now.

76
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,070
Thank you, Director.

77
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,100
Thank you so much for driving her here.

78
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,150
I'll get going, Ma'am.

79
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,700
Okay. See you next time, then.

80
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,170
Yes.

81
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,140
Go inside.

82
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,960
What? Grandma? The grandma from the countryside?

83
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,390
Yes, she came because she missed me.

84
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,930
Yes, I kept seeing her in my dreams.

85
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,310
I missed her and was curious about her. So I came.

86
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,800
 Gosh, is she the old lady who rescued Do Ra and got her treated? 

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,500
- Have a seat, Grandma. 
 - Okay, okay.

88
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,820
I'll get you something to drink.

89
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,500
Okay.

90
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,820
By the way, are you really Ji Yeong's boss?

91
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,520
Yes, I am Ji Yeong's boss.

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,810
I've been training her while living with her here.

93
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,480
I see. Train... or whatever.

94
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,180
By the way, on TV...

95
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,000
CEO's houses are huge and flashy.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,690
Yes, I used to be successful once, too.

97
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,440
Grandma, drink this.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,570
Okay, okay, okay.

99
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,720
By the way, Ji Yeong,

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,300
can't you just live at the Director's house?

101
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,510
It's a nice and spacious place.

102
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,220
Do you really have to live here with her?

103
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,100
She'd find it uncomfortable, too.

104
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,220
I don't think this is right.

105
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,000
That's not true, Grandma.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,070
She's a good acting coach, too.

107
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,250
So I need to live here.

108
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,630
♫  Until the East Sea's waves are dry, Mt. Baekdu worn away  ♫

109
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,600
What's wrong with her?

110
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,540
♫  - God watches over our land forever  ♫ 
 - She does this...

111
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,890
♫  - Bless Korea  ♫ 
 - whenever she has dementia episodes.

112
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,840
- I'm home. 
 - Huh?

113
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,590
Do Sik.

114
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,730
My gosh, Geum Dong!

115
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,650
Gosh, my Geum Dong's here.

116
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,140
Gosh, Geum Dong!

117
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,340
Geum Dong, you must be tired from working all day.

118
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,000
Hey! What are you doing?

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,850
Your husband is here. Won't you prepare a meal?

120
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,940
Geum Dong, wait just a moment.

121
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,210
I'll get you some cold water.

122
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,090
So, are you saying she has dementia?

123
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,200
Yes, she was improving for a while, but I think she got worse.

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,390
What do we do with her?

125
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,740
Who's Geum Dong, then?

126
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,300
My dad. My dad, who passed away.

127
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,800
She thinks I'm her son right now, then?

128
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes, I think so.

129
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,810
I think she thinks Ahjumma is my mom.

130
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,580
Stepmom.

131
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,280
This isn't good. We should send her to a nursing home.

132
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,510
You can't handle something like that at home.

133
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,050
No! How could I send her to a nursing home?

134
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,490
She's the reason I'm alive now.

135
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,980
What do we do, then? We need to shoot the show and live together.

136
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll find an apartment and live with her, then.

137
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,640
You can't do that!

138
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,720
We finally found each other. How can we live separately?

139
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,550
And you're my daughter. We need to live together.

140
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,940
Yes, Do Ra. I mean, Ji Yeong.

141
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,470
Why should we be separated again?

142
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,410
That makes no sense.

143
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,080
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

144
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,820
We should just all live here together with her.

145
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,840
- What? 
 - She saved Ji Yeong. We owe her.

146
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,680
We'd be returning the favor that way.

147
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,510
- Gosh, seriously... 
 - Quit complaining.

148
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,490
This is my apartment.

149
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,020
That's true.

150
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,070
 Pil Sung, that bitch abandoned you in front of our house! 

151
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:22,390
 When you were less than a week old, that bitch abandoned you in front of our house! 

152
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,820
I can't take it anymore.

153
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,900
It's true you did the wrong thing, but still.

154
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,250
I can't let them do this to you anymore.

155
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm really okay, Ma Ri.

156
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,730
But...

157
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,440
But Pil Sung found out.

158
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,530
Pil Sung did.

159
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,700
What do we do now?

160
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,400
- What am I supposed to do? 
 - What?

161
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,720
O-Oppa found out?

162
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,190
   

163
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,610
Yes, Pil Sung. I-It's me.

164
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,500
You came.

165
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,940
What I heard earlier...

166
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,590
Is it all true?

167
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,910
I came to confirm it myself.

168
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,550
Are you my biological mother...

169
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,690
who abandoned me?

170
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,570
You can't bring yourself to admit it.

171
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,540
It must be true.

172
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,450
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm sorry, Pil Sung.

174
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,120
Sorry?

175
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,350
Do you think saying sorry is enough?

176
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,070
I really had no choice then.

177
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
I was in a situation where I had no other choice.

178
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,720
What situation would make you... abandon a baby who was born less than a week ago?

179
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:46,440
What reason would make you abandon a baby?

180
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,090
At a friend's house, even.

181
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,500
I wanted to see you that way.

182
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,630
I wanted to make sure you were being raised safely.

183
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,400
That's why I...

184
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,190
How...

185
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,250
could you be so selfish until the end?

186
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,360
You call that an excuse?

187
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,550
Pil Sung.

188
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,090
So...you could see me whenever you want,

189
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,480
you abandoned me with your friend, my mom?

190
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,900
Do you only care about your feelings?

191
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,800
Do you not care about my mom, who thought of you as her friend?

192
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,940
You think only your feelings matter?

193
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,830
Have you ever thought about how much hurt and betrayed my mom would feel?

194
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,090
How can you only think about your feelings? How?

195
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,850
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,940
I'm sorry, Pil Sung.

197
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,560
I really deserve to die.

198
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,060
I'm sorry, Pil Sung.

199
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,830
Why isn't Pil Sung coming back?

200
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,370
Is he drinking somewhere?

201
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,170
He can't just not come home just because he's upset.

202
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,510
Mom, do you think he's a child? He's old enough.

203
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,830
He'll come home.

204
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,470
By the way, why did our old tenant's grandma

205
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,040
have to show up then and confuse us?

206
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,800
I know.

207
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,920
Pil Sung must be so upset right now.

208
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,620
He had to care for that lady while he was in shock.

209
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,670
I'm worried, too.

210
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,630
Hey! Pil Sung!

211
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,000
Gosh, Pil Sung.

212
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,460
Where have you been all this time?

213
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,780
We were so worried that you left like that.

214
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm sorry. I had to take care of something.

215
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,110
Where's Mom?

216
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,090
Your mom...

217
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,890
She's in bed because she's in shock.

218
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,860
Pil Sung.

219
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,260
Honey, Pil Sung's here.

220
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,380
Pil Sung, are you okay?

221
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,460
Of course, I'm okay.

222
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,430
Pil Sung, you must've been so shocked earlier.

223
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,050
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,060
I didn't want you to see me like that, but you did in the end.

225
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,070
I'm so sorry.

226
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,990
Don't apologize. Why would you say that?

227
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,380
I'm worried about you.

228
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,370
No, no.

229
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm just sorry about everything.

230
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,810
I was foolish.

231
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,330
You had to see me like that because I'm a foolish mom.

232
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:20,830
Mom, Father, I'm really okay.

233
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,960
You're the only mom to me in this world.

234
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,920
You're the only one.

235
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,140
My Pil Sung,

236
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,090
my son.

237
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,860
Thank you for saying that.

238
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm so upset I could die.

239
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,450
It wasn't even a stranger. How...

240
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,390
How could Soo Yeon do that...

241
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,280
Honey, but still.

242
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,300
Don't say that in front of Pil Sung.

243
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,920
You're making him upset.

244
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,890
I'm sorry, Pil Sung.

245
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,690
Because you're such an important person to me,

246
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,520
I always wondered who gave birth to you,

247
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,920
and I was always so grateful to her.

248
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,780
If she ended up visiting you,

249
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,390
I was going to thank her sincerely.

250
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,510
But...

251
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,210
But I didn't think this would happen.

252
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,790
I can't be like this.

253
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,510
I really thought of her as my friend.

254
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:49,130
She approached me ever since you were young, deceived me and lied to me.

255
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,150
Thinking that...

256
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,470
I really...

257
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,080
I really can't forgive her.

258
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,610
I... I really wish I could...

259
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,990
I really...

260
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,290
I'm sorry, Pil Sung.

261
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,920
Mom,

262
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,950
I can't forgive her for hurting you so much, either.

263
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,780
So, you do whatever you want to do.

264
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,840
Pil Sung...

265
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,950
My son...

266
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,860
Pil Sung.

267
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,320
My Pil Sung...

268
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,170
My son.

269
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,220
I'm sorry I upset you last time.

270
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,290
I'm sorry I said hurtful things, too.

271
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,990
You can't do that from now on, okay?

272
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,600
Let's eat this and make up.

273
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,050
It's crispy and tasty.

274
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,060
You should try some, too.

275
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,730
Thank you.

276
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,310
It's well-fried.

277
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,280
I feel better now.

278
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,300
Me, too. I feel better now, too.

279
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,610
Why? Did something happen?

280
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,200
Things are crazy back home right now.

281
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,050
You know about Pil Sung's birth secret, too, right?

282
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,000
I do. When I was this big and living in your house,

283
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,440
Pil Sung learned he was adopted and ran away from home.

284
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,110
That's why my family ended up finding out, too.

285
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,620
But we found out who Pil Sung's biological mother is.

286
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,320
Really?

287
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,220
How? Who is it?

288
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,400
What kind of person abandons her child?

289
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
The thing is...

290
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,790
So...

291
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,860
My sister-in-law's... So...

292
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,420
It was Pil Sung's mom's best friend.

293
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,010
Daebak, really?

294
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,720
Yes, isn't it crazy?

295
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,040
I know she's her actor, but... how could she live with her in that crappy place?

296
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,030
Did she move there because she had nowhere to go

297
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,110
after getting kicked out of Go Pil Sung's house?

298
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,070
Why am I thinking of that country bumpkin right now?

299
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
What did you say?

300
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
The Director had a biological mother?

301
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,570
Oh, right. You don't remember.

302
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,020
You don't remember, but when we used to live in that rental unit, Pil sung found out he was adopted.

303
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,710
It was a disaster.

304
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,500
- Really? 
 - But...

305
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,210
his mom and biological mom are best friends.

306
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,180
So, she's been frequenting their house all this time.

307
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,100
So, Pil Sung's mom screamed at her friend, and it was crazy.

308
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,690
But it got even more chaotic since Grandma went there.

309
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,620
I see.

310
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,940
Hold on. Park Do Sik, how do you know all that?

311
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,580
Are you still seeing that girl, by chance?

312
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,520
No!

313
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,640
I just ran into her on the streets.

314
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,100
Stop lying!

315
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,990
You've been seeing her behind my back. I saw you texting at night.

316
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,890
I saw it all. You think I don't know?

317
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:18,350
How could you date the enemy's daughter right now?

318
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,460
Geum Dong, are you cheating?

319
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,080
Pardon?

320
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,500
You married this old woman after Ji Yeong's mom died.

321
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,590
And are you cheating now?

322
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,560
If you want to be with her so badly, you might as well get divorced.

323
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,720
Just kick out your mean wife.

324
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,640
My gosh.

325
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,990
I know she has dementia,

326
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,050
but how could she think Do Sik is her son and I'm your stepmother?

327
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,040
How could she think we're married? What nonsense.

328
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,050
We can't live with her in this tiny apartment.

329
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,300
I'll give up on everything and move back home.

330
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,180
I'll give up on acting, but I'll never give up on Grandma.

331
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,040
- What? 
 - Mom, you just need to put up with it.

332
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,050
So what if she calls you a mean wife?

333
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,780
And she saved Ji Yeong's life.

334
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,180
You little. How could you always...

335
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,030
I'll take good care of her.

336
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,030
So, she doesn't give you a hard time, Ahjumma.

337
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,950
Please let me live with her.

338
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,300
I can't let her go anywhere.

339
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,880
I didn't want to ever see you again, but I thought we should discuss work.

340
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,910
Yes, yes.

341
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,420
I want to quit immediately because of you, but we already started shooting.

342
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,240
So many people participated in it while trusting me.

343
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,170
I thought a director shouldn't quit his job because of personal feelings.

344
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,920
That's why I'm planning to finish this project.

345
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,410
Yes, thank you.

346
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,570
I don't want to hear you thank me, either.

347
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,770
I want you to cancel the contract once the project ends.

348
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,990
Okay, I will.

349
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,200
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

350
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,950
I understand we agree. I'll leave now.

351
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,380
Pil Sung, hold on.

352
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,182
You...

353
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:25,012
once visited me asking me about... your biological parents.

354
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,662
once visited me asking me about... your biological parents.

355
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:34,152
You asked me if I knew anything.

356
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:37,732
You said you wanted to know where you came from.

357
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,582
Back then,

358
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:43,652
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

359
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:48,102
I'm sorry.

360
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:53,762
After letting you go like that that day,

361
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:59,472
it broke my heart, too.

362
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:05,612
Why are you telling me this?

363
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:09,162
You said you didn't know when I visited you then.

364
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:15,502
But now that you got caught, you want to make an excuse for abandoning me?

365
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:19,552
You kept it a secret since you wanted to secure what you had.

366
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:23,162
What are you trying to cover up now?

367
00:27:23,162 --> 00:27:28,572
Since that day, I've moved on from my biological parents.

368
00:27:28,572 --> 00:27:34,032
I've thought of my parents as my real parents.

369
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:38,752
I'm not even shocked to hear you gave birth to me.

370
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:45,822
You didn't leave a trace so I won't find you later.

371
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:52,772
Did you think I'd have any feelings for someone who did that?

372
00:27:56,672 --> 00:28:00,972
I've thought of you as a good CEO professionally.

373
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,042
And I thought of you as my mom's good friend.

374
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:07,572
But you've been deceiving us all this time.

375
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:11,992
You've been by our side, hiding behind a mask.

376
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:14,192
I'm so disappointed.

377
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:18,012
You don't feel human to me anymore.

378
00:28:20,672 --> 00:28:22,932
Because you abandoned me

379
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,572
for your life and benefit only.

380
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:32,312
Keep living for yourself.

381
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:44,112
That was good.

382
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:47,502
- Have some of this. 
 - Watermelon.

383
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:51,122
Let me try some.

384
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:54,842
Have some.

385
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:02,642
Having watermelon after eating dakgejang* is so refreshing. 
  (T/N: Spicy chicken soup) 

386
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:05,352
It's so cooling and nice.

387
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:10,182
Unni, the dakgejang was really amazing.

388
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,962
Was it?

389
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:18,792
Seon Yeong, everything is finally functioning properly since you got your energy back.

390
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,532
You should have some watermelon, too.

391
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:22,212
It's so nice and refreshing.

392
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:25,042
Yes. You enjoy.

393
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,942
Tasty.

394
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:31,432
 Is anyone home? This is Ma Ri. 

395
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:36,242
What? W-Why is Ma Ri here?

396
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:39,402
Hello.

397
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,142
How dare you come here again?

398
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:44,882
I told you to never come back here!

399
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:48,822
T-The thing is, I need to tell you something.

400
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:52,362
What's wrong with you? She needs to tell us something.

401
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:55,112
Ma Ri, you came.

402
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:57,362
Come here, Ma Ri.

403
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:01,732
Let's eat fruit and talk. Come here.

404
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:07,562
Ahjumma, could you forgive my mom?

405
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:13,622
Ma Ri, what are you doing right now?

406
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:16,192
It's true my mom did the wrong thing.

407
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:20,462
She abandoned Pil Sung as a baby and she lied to you.

408
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:24,002
That makes me hate her, too.

409
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:30,482
But I think my mom spent a hard time by Oppa's side, too.

410
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,702
She's hurting a lot right now.

411
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:36,812
Excuse me, you expect her to forgive?

412
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:39,132
How dare you tell her to forgive?

413
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:42,232
Get out of here if you'd keep talking nonsense like that.

414
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:44,712
No one's happy to see you here.

415
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:49,782
And she's no longer friends with your mom.

416
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:52,162
So, get out! How many times do I have to tell you?

417
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,442
Don't ever come back here!

418
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:57,242
I'm sorry.

419
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,562
Gosh, Ma Ri.

420
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:05,092
Why would you yell at her? She fell because she was shocked!

421
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:06,112
Gosh, seriously.

422
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:09,532
Ma Ri! Ma Ri!

423
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,022
 Ma Ri... 

424
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,462
Gosh, seriously.

425
00:31:15,592 --> 00:31:19,482
Ma Ri, Ma Ri. Gosh, Ma Ri.

426
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:23,442
Ma Ri! Gosh, Ma Ri! Aigoo, Ma Ri!

427
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:25,882
Ma Ri, are you okay?

428
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,302
Yes. I'm okay.

429
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:33,692
Ma Ri, I'm so sorry.

430
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,392
I said I'd keep it a secret,

431
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:40,462
but I didn't, and I'm giving you a hard time, too.

432
00:31:40,462 --> 00:31:45,292
No, you did nothing wrong. Don't feel bad.

433
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:50,302
By the way, Ma Ri, you can't come here anymore.

434
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,182
You know, right?

435
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:56,182
Yes, I do.

436
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:58,992
Take care.

437
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:03,512
Ma Ri... Ma Ri...

438
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:16,722
Ma Ri!

439
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,352
What's wrong?

440
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:25,852
Do Jun, I can't get up.

441
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:28,422
My legs feel weak.

442
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:34,252
Ma Ri, put your arm around my neck.

443
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:10,012
Why would you go there?

444
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:13,082
Everyone is angry because of me.

445
00:33:13,082 --> 00:33:14,812
Why would you go there?

446
00:33:16,052 --> 00:33:17,772
That's why I went.

447
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:21,782
I wanted to ask them to forgive you.

448
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:26,282
Ma Ri, I should ask them for forgiveness.

449
00:33:26,282 --> 00:33:29,462
Why would you go there? You're making me upset.

450
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:35,292
Ma Ri,

451
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:38,472
don't go there anymore.

452
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:41,272
No matter how much you miss Oppa,

453
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,182
you can't go there anymore.

454
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:47,352
If you do,

455
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:52,922
Oppa would feel uncomfortable, and so would his family.

456
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,272
We'd be hurting them.

457
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,182
Okay, Ma Ri?

458
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:05,152
Am I really not supposed to go there anymore?

459
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:08,562
No, you can never.

460
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:19,512
Mom, I really loved going to Oppa's house.

461
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:22,572
Because there's Oppa there,

462
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:27,142
and Grandma, whom I like, and Myeong Dong, too.

463
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:31,432
I loved watching TV there and...

464
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:36,352
I loved the cheonggukjang she made, too. 
  (T/N: Soybean paste stew) 

465
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,632
But

466
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:45,202
when I think I can't see Oppa anymore...

467
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:50,032
Thinking I can't see Grandma and everyone, I feel so sad.

468
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:54,722
I have no hope to go on.

469
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,492
Ma Ri's sick?

470
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:03,052
What's wrong?

471
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:07,482
I think she has the flu.

472
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,052
Flu? Wait...

473
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,782
Since when was she sick?

474
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:15,922
Should I call Dr. Kim?

475
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:17,582
No, Dad. I'm okay.

476
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,902
I took medicine.

477
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:21,412
By the way,

478
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,852
did you cry, Ma Ri?

479
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,592
The thing is...

480
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,032
I had a scary dream earlier.

481
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:34,132
It keeps making me cry.

482
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:48,532
Seon Yeong, Ma Ri is very sick right now.

483
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:55,142
She likes you, Grandma,

484
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:58,742
and Myeong Dong, too.

485
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,522
She misses Pil Sung, too.

486
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:06,402
She loved coming here, but she was told she couldn't.

487
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:09,662
She's sick in bed, and she can't even eat.

488
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:15,352
Why should we hear this from you?

489
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:17,532
I don't even want to get angry at you.

490
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:20,152
I hate to see you. Please leave.

491
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:24,692
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong, hold on.

492
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:26,412
Just curse me instead.

493
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:29,112
You can beat me up, too, but...

494
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:30,972
but could you please...

495
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:36,002
At least,... forgive Ma Ri?

496
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:41,122
Could you please do that?

497
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:45,912
Ma Ri is still...

498
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:49,972
Pil Sung's younger sister.

499
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:53,592
What? What did you say?

500
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:55,512
- What did you say? 
 - Honey.

501
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:59,282
You're such a shameless lady.

502
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:02,152
No wonder you abandoned your baby at your friend's house.

503
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:05,482
Yes, that's true.

504
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:08,592
I'm a shameless woman.

505
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:11,622
I'm a sinner who should be stoned to death.

506
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:14,872
But my Ma Ri...

507
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:17,822
She didn't do anything wrong.

508
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,052
Geez...

509
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,702
Get out right now. Right now!

510
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:27,592
Honey, we no longer need to listen to this shameless woman.

511
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:30,962
Don't you have any conscience?

512
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:33,972
I'm sorry.

513
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:37,492
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:44,562
I really can't forgive Seon Yeong's friend, President Jang,

515
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,982
but I feel bad for Ma Ri.

516
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:50,652
She's making me feel bad.

517
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:52,702
Right, Mom?

518
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:57,422
Well...

519
00:37:57,832 --> 00:38:03,252
She must've been so upset that she can't eat.

520
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:06,332
Gosh, seriously.

521
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:11,082
I'm so upset because of Ma Ri.

522
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:24,306
Who is it?

523
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:27,226
 I'd like to see how Ma Ri's doing. 

524
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:30,796
 I'm Go Pil Sung's grandma. 

525
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:34,006
Well, what should I do?

526
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:44,716
Ma Ri, I heard you were very sick.

527
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,610
I heard you can't even eat.

528
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:52,660
I remembered you liked corn. So I steamed some for you.

529
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,530
.

530
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:59,136
Grandma, thank you for coming.

531
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:03,916
I'm so happy to see you right now.

532
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,646
Ma Ri,

533
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:10,286
thank you so much for understanding.

534
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:15,936
But hearing that you're sick and you can't eat anything

535
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,396
upsets me so much.

536
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:23,710
You need to eat well and be healthy at times like this.

537
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,176
I'm sorry.

538
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:30,106
But I can't eat anything right now.

539
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:32,676
I can't bring myself to swallow food.

540
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:38,616
What do we do with poor Ma Ri?

541
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:42,726
Gosh, Ma Ri.

542
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:49,336
 The poor kid is suffering so much. 

543
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,986
Mom, what are you talking about?

544
00:39:54,986 --> 00:39:57,036
You want us to forgive Ma Ri?

545
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:59,876
I heard she can't even eat.

546
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:03,116
So, I steamed a few cobs of corn for her.

547
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:06,216
But she was so pitiful.

548
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:09,796
I couldn't bear to look at her.

549
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:15,436
She knows she can't see Oppa anymore and she knows she can't come to our house,

550
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:18,156
but that makes her so sad.

551
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:23,846
She was happy to have an older brother, but she was told she couldn't see him anymore.

552
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:26,536
She said, "I have no hope to go on."

553
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:30,676
She was crying a river saying that.

554
00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:35,556
I ended up crying with her, too, since I felt so bad.

555
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:40,176
Gosh, seriously. Why would you pity her, anyway?

556
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:47,030
The one who deserves the most pity is her,

557
00:40:53,276 --> 00:41:00,170
Seon Yeong,

558
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,096
I hate her, too.

559
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:04,586
She still gives me chills.

560
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:06,666
But not Ma Ri.

561
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,096
What did Ma Ri do, exactly?

562
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:13,616
She likes Pil Sung because she feels connected to him.

563
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:17,466
She says she just loves him so much.

564
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:23,586
Separating siblings like that doesn't seem right to me.

565
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:30,586
Seon Yeong, you might find this hurtful, but

566
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:32,666
I'm planning to tell...

567
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:35,756
Pil Sung that Ma Ri's very sick

568
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:41,716
and he should be in touch with her from now on.

569
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,986
Mother.

570
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:49,966
For Pil Sung, Ma Ri is his only sibling in this entire world.

571
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:56,106
But if you're unwilling to accept Ma Ri, how is that fair to Pil Sung?

572
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,146
She's his only sibling in this world.

573
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,436
And she's even sick right now.

574
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:10,306
How hurt and tormented must he feel if he can't see her?

575
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:11,986
Don't you think?

576
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:20,406
Unni, I think we should forgive Ma Ri after hearing Mom.

577
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:23,146
For Pil Sung's sake, too.

578
00:42:34,146 --> 00:42:37,576
Ma Ri's sick?

579
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,916
Did you meet Ma Ri, Grandma?

580
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:46,346
Yes, her mom came by and said she was extremely sick.

581
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:51,026
She cried and begged us to forgive just Ma Ri.

582
00:42:51,926 --> 00:42:54,616
How could I not visit her?

583
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:59,926
So, I went to see how she was doing.

584
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:02,960
As her mom said, she can't eat anything.

585
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,010
She's barely hanging in there.

586
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:13,806
She was so happy to have an older brother, but she's sad because she can't see him anymore.

587
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:16,896
She said she had no hope to go on.

588
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:20,576
Did she...

589
00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:22,586
Did she say that?

590
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,550
   

591
00:43:38,856 --> 00:43:40,516
Ma Ri!

592
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:45,246
Ma Ri, are you okay?

593
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:46,786
Yes.

594
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:55,266
I'm sorry, Oppa. I'm sorry I was peeping at you.

595
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,966
What?

596
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:59,326
I'm sorry. I came because I missed you so much.

597
00:43:59,326 --> 00:44:01,516
I won't come back again.

598
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:04,156
Ma Ri, hold on.

599
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,006
Should we talk for a moment?

600
00:44:12,306 --> 00:44:16,046
Gong Ma Ri, I heard you were very sick.

601
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:19,146
No. No, I wasn't.

602
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:27,476
- Ma Ri. 
 - I will never visit you ever again.

603
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:29,526
I promise.

604
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:36,226
Ma Ri, I thought about you a lot, too.

605
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:40,826
You thought about me?

606
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:44,946
What do you mean?

607
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:50,486
You felt familiar when I first saw you

608
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:56,106
and even when you were chasing me, I felt like you were a cute younger sister.

609
00:44:56,106 --> 00:44:58,046
Really?

610
00:45:05,026 --> 00:45:08,596
I hate the fact that your mom is my biological mother,

611
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:12,676
and I can't forgive her.

612
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,746
You know why, right?

613
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:19,296
Yes, I do. That makes sense completely.

614
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:23,606
I still can't forgive her, either.

615
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:27,936
But you're my younger sister.

616
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:32,616
I'm happy that you're my sister.

617
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:35,886
Really?

618
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,956
So, I'd like to see you sometimes.

619
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:42,996
Because you're my younger sister.

620
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:45,986
What do you think?

621
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:49,716
I'd love to. I'd really, really love to.

622
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:53,296
Thank you, Oppa.

623
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:56,976
Thank you. Thank you so much.

624
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:06,196
W-What did you say?

625
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,706
You'd keep in touch with Ma Ri?

626
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:11,456
Pil Sung, how could you say that in front of Mom?

627
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:13,276
Hold on.

628
00:46:13,276 --> 00:46:15,876
He's not done talking yet.

629
00:46:17,126 --> 00:46:19,546
Yes, go on, Pil Sung.

630
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:24,390
I'm not willing to forgive President Jang, either.

631
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:30,396
But the fact that Ma Ri is my sister is undeniable.

632
00:46:31,176 --> 00:46:34,926
She came by to peep at me earlier, too.

633
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:39,136
I don't want to ignore her heartfelt feelings.

634
00:46:39,136 --> 00:46:45,226
Gosh, she was following you around, saying, "Oppa, Oppa."

635
00:46:45,226 --> 00:46:49,496
She visited you in that condition?

636
00:46:49,496 --> 00:46:55,536
Gosh, I feel so bad for Ma Ri. Seriously.

637
00:46:55,536 --> 00:47:00,246
Mom, be quiet at times like this. You're making it worse.

638
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:04,576
Mom, Father,

639
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:09,916
I'd like your permission to see Ma Ri.

640
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:13,936
I don't want to see her secretly if you don't want me to.

641
00:47:17,496 --> 00:47:19,566
Yes.

642
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:21,446
Go ahead.

643
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:25,696
Honey, w-would you be okay?

644
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:34,866
If I told Pil Sung to ignore his sister, Ma Ri,

645
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:36,956
I'd be no different from Jang Soo Yeon.

646
00:47:36,956 --> 00:47:39,436
Ma Ri didn't do anything wrong.

647
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,706
Mom.

648
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:48,896
Do what you want to do, Pil Sung.

649
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,586
Thank you.

650
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:04,686
   

651
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:06,126
Yes, I'm heading over, too.

652
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:08,596
Yes, see you on set.

653
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:15,346
Yes.

654
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,996
I know you have a shoot.

655
00:48:22,996 --> 00:48:25,436
Can we talk for a moment?

656
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:28,986
Yes, talk to me.

657
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:34,956
I heard from Ma Ri.

658
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:40,436
You said you'd accept Ma Ri as your sister.

659
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:44,576
Pil Sung, thank you so much.

660
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:51,356
My opinion of you hasn't changed because of Ma Ri.

661
00:48:51,356 --> 00:48:56,666
My feelings for Ma Ri have nothing to do with you.

662
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:58,126
Well, then.

663
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:09,006
Still. Thank you, Pil Sung.

664
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:16,816
Our elders were also good friends.

665
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:22,326
And now Jin Dan and Tae Hee ended up connecting

666
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:26,006
and our families are going to become one family.

667
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:29,646
You have no idea how happy that makes me.

668
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:35,686
Chairman Kim, please take care of Jin Dan, even though he still has room to grow.

669
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:38,076
Tae Hee has room to grow, too.

670
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:40,656
Please see her in a positive light.

671
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,846
Shall we drink some wine, then?

672
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:45,646
Yes.

673
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:48,676
Here. Cheers.

674
00:49:48,676 --> 00:49:50,106
Here.

675
00:49:50,106 --> 00:49:52,036
They make such a nice couple.

676
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:54,796
Don't you think they're meant to be?

677
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:08,556
Honey, how about you ask Dr. Kim to check on you?

678
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:13,586
Get hospitalized, get IV treatments, and recover.

679
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:19,996
I'm a bit tired today. I'll be okay after some rest.

680
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:26,596
You've been doing poorly because of Seon Yeong, right?

681
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:32,786
Is she still mad at you?

682
00:50:33,816 --> 00:50:37,626
It's not like that. You don't have to worry.

683
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:46,560
Honey...

684
00:50:47,306 --> 00:50:49,976
I'm your husband.

685
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:56,336
I don't know exactly what you did to Seon Yeong,

686
00:50:56,336 --> 00:51:01,596
but I can at least comfort you.

687
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:04,376
I should be doing that for you.

688
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:11,526
Can't you just get it off your chest with me?

689
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:21,136
Honey,

690
00:51:22,356 --> 00:51:24,796
don't ask anything...

691
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:30,396
and please give me some time just for a little bit.

692
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:35,016
I already feel so bad for you.

693
00:51:35,016 --> 00:51:37,576
You can't keep doing this to me.

694
00:51:50,176 --> 00:51:52,556
Gosh, Director!

695
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,146
How have you been?

696
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:56,866
You came, Grandma.

697
00:51:56,866 --> 00:52:01,256
Aigoo, you look even more handsome here.

698
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:04,076
Really? Thank you.

699
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:10,016
Grandma, I told you.

700
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:12,706
You need to stay put while I'm working.

701
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:16,176
I can keep you around that way. You know, right?

702
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:18,056
I know, I said!

703
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:25,236
I'll stay put quietly next to this Oppa right here.

704
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:27,956
O-Oppa?

705
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:32,186
Her dementia got even worse.

706
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:36,066
She'll be living with me in Seoul for now.

707
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:42,026
I'm sorry, but would it be okay if she came to the set?

708
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:46,066
Of course. I know she wouldn't interfere. It's okay.

709
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:48,236
You don't have to worry about that at all.

710
00:52:48,236 --> 00:52:50,996
I'll be careful so it doesn't affect the shoot.

711
00:52:50,996 --> 00:52:54,006
Okay. Get ready for the shoot, then.

712
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:56,136
Director.

713
00:52:57,726 --> 00:53:00,276
Thank you so much.

714
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:03,916
You must've been shocked by my grandma's dementia.

715
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:07,756
You took good care of her and dropped her off.

716
00:53:07,756 --> 00:53:09,466
Of course, I should've done that.

717
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:11,416
Don't worry about it.

718
00:53:18,036 --> 00:53:22,346
He must feel hurt after learning who his birth mother is.

719
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:24,896
But he doesn't even let it show.

720
00:53:24,896 --> 00:53:28,056
He even took care of my grandma in that situation.

721
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:33,216
I really don't think he's a bad person.

722
00:53:35,186 --> 00:53:38,216
But my mom keeps saying he is.

723
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,856
I don't know what to believe.

724
00:53:42,336 --> 00:53:46,566
I need to get my memory back to figure things out.

725
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:51,436
Why won't my memory come back?

726
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,326
Try to focus on the emotions in that scene.

727
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:10,786
I think the director likes Ji Yeong.

728
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:15,206
Pardon? Yes, yes, Grandma.

729
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:24,736
Ji Yeong, do you want me to tell you a secret?

730
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:28,636
What secret?

731
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:34,986
You know the handsome director? He likes you.

732
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,046
Gosh, no. Not at all.

733
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,256
What do you mean, no?

734
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:44,286
You can fool a ghost, but not me.

735
00:54:44,286 --> 00:54:47,446
You like the director, too, right?

736
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:53,626
What... W-What are you talking about?

737
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,816
I don't like him at all!

738
00:54:55,816 --> 00:54:57,996
That's not true! Not at all!

739
00:54:57,996 --> 00:54:59,826
What are you talking about?

740
00:54:59,826 --> 00:55:02,736
No? No?

741
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:07,886
That girl...

742
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:19,056
Where did Grandma go?

743
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:21,076
Grandma.

744
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,236
Grandma!

745
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:29,256
Ma'am, so... you don't have any phone numbers memorized?

746
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:32,506
I left my phone. I don't know.

747
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:36,106
All the numbers are on the phone.

748
00:55:36,106 --> 00:55:39,156
I forget what happened an hour ago.

749
00:55:39,156 --> 00:55:42,306
How could I memorize a phone number?

750
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:45,636
Is this your house, then?

751
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:48,966
No. I live by the ocean.

752
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:52,286
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

753
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:56,646
Why did we come here, then, ma'am?

754
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,956
Ma'am, do you have dementia?

755
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:03,206
Dementia? How dare you say I have dementia?

756
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:04,906
I'm totally fine.

757
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:09,356
- Ma'am, let's just go to the police station with me. 
 - No, no.

758
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:11,256
- I'm sorry. Don't— 
 - Grandma.

759
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:13,586
Gosh, Director! Director!

760
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:14,736
Do you know this lady?

761
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:16,616
- Yes. 
 - Director.

762
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:22,116
He wants to take me to the police station because I didn't pay him the fare.

763
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:24,396
Director, please loan me the taxi fare.

764
00:56:24,396 --> 00:56:28,186
I'll sell kalguksu and pay you back.

765
00:56:29,326 --> 00:56:31,266
- I'm sorry. 
 - Okay.

766
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,936
- Done, right? 
 - All right.

767
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:34,996
Go now.

768
00:56:39,216 --> 00:56:41,416
I'm sorry!

769
00:56:41,896 --> 00:56:44,126
Grandma, where's Ji Yeong?

770
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:48,306
My Ji Yeong? She's at home.

771
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:51,946
Did you come here alone, then? Why?

772
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:59,756
I came to see you because I have something to tell you.

773
00:56:59,756 --> 00:57:02,776
Me? About what?

774
00:57:02,776 --> 00:57:08,970
Director, this is a secret.

775
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:15,286
My Ji Yeong likes you.

776
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:17,726
Pardon?

777
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:21,646
Grandma! Grandma!

778
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,576
Grandma! Grandma!

779
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:26,456
Ji Yeong! What are you doing outside?

780
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:31,676
Ahjumma, my grandma disappeared while I was in the bathroom briefly.

781
00:57:31,676 --> 00:57:33,866
Gosh, really?

782
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:38,196
I'll go this way. Please look for her that way.

783
00:57:38,196 --> 00:57:39,896
Okay. Get going. Hurry.

784
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:43,286
Gosh, where did that old lady go?

785
00:57:46,566 --> 00:57:49,186
Yes, Director.

786
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:53,826
Pardon? You're with my grandma?

787
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:58,036
Grandma!

788
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,736
Ji Yeong, you came.

789
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:04,256
Grandma, you can't just disappear without a word like that.

790
00:58:04,256 --> 00:58:06,916
I panicked because I thought I lost you.

791
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,726
Do you want me to die from a heart attack?

792
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:11,286
Sorry.

793
00:58:11,286 --> 00:58:16,036
But I came here because I needed to talk to the Director.

794
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:21,906
I was going to take a short trip while you were taking a shower, but here we are.

795
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,686
What did you have to tell Director, exactly?

796
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:36,826
Director, what did she say? What is it?

797
00:58:40,026 --> 00:58:42,686
What? What's going on here?

798
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,316
Why won't either of you speak?

799
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:52,206
Ji Yeong, this is a secret between the Director and me.

800
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:54,936
Grandma, what secret?

801
00:58:54,936 --> 00:59:03,476
Director, you can't tell Ji Yeong what I told you.

802
00:59:03,476 --> 00:59:06,806
That'd embarrass her.

803
00:59:06,806 --> 00:59:09,386
Please keep it a secret, okay?

804
00:59:09,386 --> 00:59:11,366
Okay, I promise you.

805
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:13,106
Okay.

806
00:59:15,146 --> 00:59:19,266
What did she say? Why would it embarrass me?

807
00:59:19,266 --> 00:59:22,296
Just eat tteobokki. You don't want to feel embarrassed.

808
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:23,736
What?

809
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:26,506
What is it?

810
00:59:26,506 --> 00:59:28,316
Tell it to me, too.

811
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,836
What's it about?

812
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:39,506
 The Director must be hurting right now. 

813
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:43,616
 I shouldn't keep bothering him like this. 

814
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:46,746
 But I can't ask him if he's okay. 

815
00:59:46,746 --> 00:59:50,286
 I can't tell him I know about his situation. 

816
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:53,606
 I can't say a word to comfort him. 

817
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:56,276
 What am I supposed to do? 

818
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,040
   

819
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:07,416
- Aigoo. 
 - This.

820
01:00:09,946 --> 01:00:11,856
Hello.

821
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:15,626
Gosh, you came, Chairman Gong.

822
01:00:15,626 --> 01:00:18,446
What brings you all the way here?

823
01:00:18,446 --> 01:00:22,626
I couldn't come to your opening because of a seminar.

824
01:00:22,626 --> 01:00:26,916
So, I came by even though I know you're busy

825
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,606
since I wanted to talk to Seon Yeong, too.

826
01:00:34,746 --> 01:00:37,606
My wife is having a hard time...

827
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:41,636
because of what happened between you two.

828
01:00:41,636 --> 01:00:43,586
She's sick, too.

829
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:48,926
I asked her what had happened with you,

830
01:00:49,406 --> 01:00:53,696
but she won't tell me. She just keeps saying it's her fault.

831
01:00:55,206 --> 01:00:58,316
My wife and you...

832
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:05,156
have been so close that you made others jealous.

833
01:01:05,156 --> 01:01:07,946
I've witnessed it myself.

834
01:01:07,946 --> 01:01:13,516
I'm curious how you two ended up this way.

835
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:15,186
You should...

836
01:01:16,276 --> 01:01:18,716
ask Soo Yeon instead.

837
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,306
I don't want to tell you about it.

838
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:27,206
And Soo Yeon and I are no longer friends.

839
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:34,214
I can tell it's a serious matter,

840
01:01:34,884 --> 01:01:37,404
seeing your reaction.

841
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,904
My wife won't talk about it, either.

842
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:48,834
By chance, am I not supposed to know about it?

843
01:02:10,024 --> 01:02:11,564
Honey.

844
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:17,434
Here.

845
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:26,964
What's this?

846
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:33,874
I bought it for our wedding anniversary, but I'm giving it to you earlier.

847
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:35,574
Open it.

848
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:45,904
What do you think? Do you like the watch?

849
01:02:45,904 --> 01:02:47,604
Try it on.

850
01:02:48,504 --> 01:02:52,404
It took me a long time to pick that.

851
01:02:54,314 --> 01:02:56,444
I like it.

852
01:02:56,444 --> 01:02:58,344
Thank you.

853
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:03,554
By the way, why are you suddenly doing this?

854
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:08,914
I wanted to cheer you up since you're feeling down.

855
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:13,354
Honey,

856
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,614
to be honest,

857
01:03:18,684 --> 01:03:21,744
I met Seon Yeong just now.

858
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:26,034
What did you say?

859
01:03:26,914 --> 01:03:29,644
Why would you meet her?

860
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:32,744
You're having such a hard time.

861
01:03:32,744 --> 01:03:35,864
I had to know something to help you.

862
01:03:36,494 --> 01:03:40,194
So, I wanted to find out what happened.

863
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:46,084
I wanted to apologize on your behalf if you made a mistake.

864
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:51,764
But Seon Yeong won't tell me.

865
01:03:51,764 --> 01:03:54,474
She just told me to ask you.

866
01:03:54,474 --> 01:03:57,724
Why are you doing what I didn't ask you to do?

867
01:03:57,724 --> 01:04:01,414
Why apologize on my behalf? You did nothing wrong.

868
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:03,314
I don't know what happened,

869
01:04:03,314 --> 01:04:08,404
but I thought she'd feel better if I apologized.

870
01:04:09,354 --> 01:04:12,084
I'm your husband.

871
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:16,284
There's nothing I can't do for you.

872
01:04:16,284 --> 01:04:17,934
But...

873
01:04:19,024 --> 01:04:24,514
Seon Yeong won't even let me talk to her. So, I was a little sad.

874
01:04:24,514 --> 01:04:28,414
Honey, why did you have to go there?

875
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:32,994
I know you better than anyone.

876
01:04:33,554 --> 01:04:38,334
What grave sin could you have possibly committed?

877
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:41,704
You're not that kind of a person.

878
01:04:41,704 --> 01:04:43,924
I'm that kind of a person.

879
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:45,994
I'm that kind of a woman.

880
01:04:45,994 --> 01:04:48,264
Do you know what kind of woman I am?

881
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:50,714
Do you know how terrible I am?

882
01:04:50,714 --> 01:04:53,494
Do you know what I've done to you?

883
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:56,198
I deceived you!

884
01:04:56,198 --> 01:05:06,658


885
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:11,064
   

886
01:05:11,064 --> 01:05:14,714
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

887
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:20,144
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

888
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:26,004
♫  I've already fallen for you  ♫

889
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:31,724
♫  I'm not able to free myself anymore  ♫

890
01:05:31,724 --> 01:05:36,754
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

891
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:47,644
 I can never be with Director. 

892
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:50,134
 I'm not supposed to like him. 

893
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:52,784
 You never showed Grandma around Seoul. You can't do that. 

894
01:05:52,784 --> 01:05:55,804
 So, I agreed to show her around Seoul as her friend. 

895
01:05:55,804 --> 01:06:00,654
 I need to see Kim Ji Yeong, but she won't pick up her phone. 

896
01:06:00,654 --> 01:06:03,834
 President Baek, please call Ji Yeong for me. 

897
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:07,904
 Looks like something bad happened to you recently. 

898
01:06:07,904 --> 01:06:11,114
 No pain is meaningless. 

899
01:06:11,114 --> 01:06:14,234
 They say love grows through pain. 

900
01:06:14,234 --> 01:06:16,014
 I don't know what happened, 

901
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:19,274
 but I hope you overcome it and cheer up. 

902
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:23,414
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫
