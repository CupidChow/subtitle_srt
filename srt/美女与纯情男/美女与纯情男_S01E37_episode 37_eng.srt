1
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,790
Doesn't he look...

2
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,240
so much like my father when he was young? 
    

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,070
It gave me such a strange feeling.

4
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,310
W-What did you say?

5
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,110
Ae Gyo, we went on the last trip before we broke up way back.

6
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,550
So, I was wondering...

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,660
   

8
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,070
is he my son by chance?

9
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,730
Sang Gu, what are you talking about?

10
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,450
Mom.

11
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,510
J-Jin Dan.

12
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,860
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,700
What brings you here?

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,260
What's with him?

15
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,510
Why were you sitting next to each other like that?

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,210
Huh? He's my... I mean, he's your grandma's friend's son.

17
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,280
He asked me to sign up for an insurance plan.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,150
So he was telling me about it.

19
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,330
Why was he talking sitting so close to you?

20
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,190
I didn't like that.

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,750
He looks like a gold digger, too.

22
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,480
Just sign up for one and don't ever see him again.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,480
I really don't like how he looks.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,150
- Okay? 
 - Okay, got it.

25
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,160
- Looks like your party is waiting. Go join them. 
 - Okay.

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,780
Go.

27
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,700
Sang Gu, what did you mean just now?

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,620
What did you say? Is Jin Dan your son?

29
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,160
Are you kidding me?

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,890
I was just asking, just in case.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,810
- Just in case. 
 - What do you mean by "just in case"?

32
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,730
It makes no sense at all.

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,260
What if Jin Dan heard you saying that?

34
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,120
I suppose you would've told me first if that were the case.

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,460
Of course. Why would you question that?

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,680
Gosh, it scared me.

38
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,380
Ae Gyo, your son, Jin Dan, turned out well.

39
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,830
He's so handsome. Very handsome.

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,630
I suppose he's kind of handsome.

41
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,380
I think it's because he's your son.

42
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,000
He looks so handsome and cool to me.

43
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,940
Thank you.

44
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,570
Yes.

45
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,120
It's such a relief that he's not my son.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,320
It's a thousand times better to be Chairman Gong's son, not mine.

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,830
Sang Gu, why would you keep saying that?

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,640
- You're really upsetting me. 
 - Okay.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:42,507
 We went on the last trip before we broke up way back. 

51
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,677
 So, I was wondering... 

52
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,327
 isn't he my son by chance? 

53
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:54,010
Why would he say that?

54
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,670
How unsettling.

55
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,747
Jin Dan resembles the late chairman.

56
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:00,907
Why would he say that?

57
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:14,917
Why does he suddenly not look like him?

58
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:17,877
No.

59
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:19,650
Jin Dan is the chairman's son.

60
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,570
The chairman's son.

61
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,317
Gosh.

62
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,057
No.

63
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:36,067
There's no way.

64
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,907
No way.

65
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:43,217
My gosh. Could it be?

66
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:12,417
What if it says he's really Sang Gu's son?

67
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,580
Ignorance is bliss.

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,700
It's better not to.

69
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:22,577
No. I should still know for sure.

70
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,287
I can't live feeling anxious like this.

71
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:35,957
Yes, Sang Gu. It's me.

72
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:38,037
Let's meet up today briefly.

73
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,367
Let's have brunch together, too.

74
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:49,057
Why is everyone out here?

75
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,427
Today is CEO Go's first day at work.

76
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,207
We should all see you off.

77
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:55,857
Come on, Grandma.

78
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:58,687
President Go, please remember Writer Go Myeong Dong.

79
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:03,237
I'll write until my wrist breaks and show you my work.

80
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,567
Please sign a contract with me.

81
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,967
Don't do that, Auntie. It's cringey.

82
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,637
President Go, have a nice day today.

83
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,407
President Go. Fighting!

84
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,887
I need to leave. I can't stand to be here. See you later.

85
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:20,537
- See you later, Director Go. 
 - See you later, President Go.

86
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:24,837
It's "President," Mother. My gosh...

87
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,607
Good morning.

88
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,897
Good morning.

89
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,337
Is he acting proud because he's CEO now?

90
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:44,857
Seriously. I can't stand it.

91
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:47,787
What am I supposed to do with him?

92
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,987
He gets back up every time I step on him.

93
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:54,137
What is he, a weed? He's so persistent.

94
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:57,557
Fine. Enjoy it. Enjoy it.

95
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,777
You don't have much time left.

96
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:03,857
If I become adopted and take over APP Group,

97
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:08,087
I'll make sure to get rid of you first thing.

98
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:12,457
Welcome, President Go.

99
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:14,687
We're in your care!

100
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,517
President Go.

101
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,397
Why are you all doing this?

102
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,897
Please treat me casually as usual.

103
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,457
I'm in your care.

104
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:26,127
 Yes, President Go. 

105
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:29,057
Let's all get to work now.

106
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:32,007
 Yes, President. 

107
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,527
   

108
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,077
Do Jun brought this.

109
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,117
- Help yourself. Help yourself. 
 - Thanks! It's so sweet.

110
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:56,887
- Our sweet Do Joon... 
  - Ji Yeong! 

111
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,697
- My gosh, someone must be here. 
  - Ji Yeong! 

112
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,807
What's going on?

113
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:04,767
- I heard someone yelling... 
 - Do Jun. Do Jun.

114
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,190
Jae Dong, what are you doing here?

115
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,060
Ji Yeong is a huge hit.

116
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,607
What do you mean? Sit down. Sit down and catch your breath.

117
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:16,107
Hey, eat this. You must be thirsty. Eat it.

118
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:20,367
- What is it? 
 - Right now, the industry people are focusing on

119
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,897
Ji Yeong more than the lead, Na Bi. So...

120
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:27,547
it means she's a rising star right now.

121
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:31,077
Hey, you think we'll get some commercial deals, then?

122
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,357
Of course, she will soon.

123
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:36,737
When? Gosh, when, exactly?

124
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:39,387
But that's not what's important.

125
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,667
There's bigger news.

126
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,857
Aigoo, I can't stand it.

127
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,537
Why is the intro so long?

128
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:49,787
Gosh, we can't have that, Grandma.

129
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:55,797
Writer Kim is working on a tens of billions worth of mystery romance.

130
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:58,617
She picked Ji Yeong as the female lead.

131
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:00,567
Hey!

132
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,247
That makes no sense.

133
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:07,547
How could I be the lead of such a big drama?

134
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,567
It's true, Ji Yeong.

135
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,750
Hey, are you sure about that?

136
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,410
Where did you hear it from?

137
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,147
It's from a trustworthy source. I...

138
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:19,017
heard it directly from someone at Go Go Entertainment.

139
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:23,587
To be honest, I have a spy there.

140
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:26,937
- What? 
 - Who's that?

141
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,057
Hold on.

142
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,557
Grandma...

143
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,397
Excuse me, Grandma.

144
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,257
Yes, Chief. Yes.

145
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:42,227
Right now?

146
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:46,097
I'll take Ms. Kim with me right now. Thank you.

147
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,117
Ji Yeong, let's go to Go Go Entertainment right now.

148
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:54,977
The writer and director want to see you right now.

149
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:57,407
- What? 
 - My gosh!

150
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:02,117
Hey, let's change into nice clothes.

151
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:04,977
Get her ready right now. Hurry.

152
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:07,007
We don't have time! Where are your clothes?

153
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,257
Wear this. Hurry.

154
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:13,737
Am I... Am I really the lead?

155
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:19,790
When I first started writing the script, I had you in mind as the lead.

156
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,237
So I need you to be on the drama.

157
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,597
You will, right?

158
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:28,327
I'll work with you a hundred or a thousand times.

159
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,337
I'll even play Pedestrian No. 1.

160
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:37,337
But being the lead of such a big project...

161
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,677
I don't have much experience.

162
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:45,837
And I'm afraid I'd end up ruining your project.

163
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:48,297
You can do a good job, Ji Yeong.

164
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,717
I'm telling you to do it because you can.

165
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:57,177
I think you have the image of a sophisticated city woman.

166
00:10:57,177 --> 00:11:00,137
Unexplainably sophisticated and glamorous.

167
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:04,507
You must've been a glamorous woman in the city in your previous life.

168
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,457
Try to show that side of yourself.

169
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,917
M-Me?

170
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,147
I'm telling you.

171
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:17,817
So don't worry about anything and focus on preparing.

172
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:22,597
Director Go and I have faith in you.

173
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:25,297
Thank you.

174
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:28,177
I promise I'll work very hard.

175
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,827
Thank you.

176
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:34,247
Instead, you will need to drop your accent altogether from now on.

177
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,227
The title of the show is "Seoul Lady," you know.

178
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,077
You know what I mean, right?

179
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:40,907
Yes, of course!

180
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,677
Wait...

181
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,787
I'll fix it.

182
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:50,417
From... From now on, I'll only use the standard accent.

183
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:56,767
And I'll try to become a Seoul lady, no matter what.

184
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:01,677
President Lee, please give Ji Yeong a makeover after signing today.

185
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:04,377
- Take her glasses off, too. 
 - Okay, Writer Kim.

186
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:07,937
I'll turn her into a sophisticated Seoul lady.

187
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:11,117
Should we sign now?

188
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,567
Please sign here.

189
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,917
W-What's this?

190
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,537
How could this be? 
    

191
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:53,527
Is Jin Dan Sang Gu's son?

192
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:57,607
What do I do now?

193
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,837
What am I supposed to do about this?

194
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,737
Of course, I know what to do.

195
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,667
No one knows.

196
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:13,557
I just need to keep my mouth shut.

197
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:16,047
And Jin Dan isn't Sang Gu's son.

198
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:20,117
Jin Dan is Chairman Gong Dae Gil's son. The chairman's son.

199
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:36,877
Yes.

200
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:48,127
Ji Yeong, you haven't left yet?

201
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,417
Well...

202
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:55,617
I wanted to ask you about something.

203
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,187
Have a seat.

204
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,417
Ask me anything.

205
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:21,547
It's such an honor that I was cast for such a big project,

206
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:25,737
but I'm so afraid of whether I can do it or not.

207
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:29,377
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

208
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,707
Believe it now.

209
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:35,847
You even signed the contract to join the project.

210
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,607
By chance,

211
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:47,350
did you go out of your way to cast me?

212
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:51,137
It's not like that. You heard Writer Kim earlier.

213
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:55,747
She had you in mind as the lead from the beginning.

214
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:58,277
Since I believed you could do a good job,

215
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:00,967
I agreed with Writer Kim.

216
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,107
I see.

217
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,607
Ji Yeong.

218
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,557
Don't worry so much.

219
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:18,997
You may not remember, but when you were Do Ra, you were a top star.

220
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:24,177
That talent is showing through, and your acting instincts are coming back.

221
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:28,397
So believe in yourself and work hard.

222
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:32,700
I want you to become a good actor.

223
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,027
I'm rooting for you.

224
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,957
Thank you.

225
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:47,237
I'll do my best.

226
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:52,437
I'll get going now, then.

227
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,027
And...

228
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:09,567
congratulations on becoming the CEO.

229
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:30,237
♫  I try calling you  ♫

230
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:34,667
♫  I finally express...  ♫

231
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:38,377
 D-Director, you're holding me, right? 

232
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,367
 A-Aren't you? 

233
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,477
 Make sure to get the part since you're doing this. 

234
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,227
 Ji Yeong! 

235
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,407
 Fighting! Let's go! 

236
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:56,527
 I want you to become a good actor. 

237
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,257
 I'm rooting for you. 

238
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:07,057
Why did you? Why?

239
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,265
He's such a good person.

240
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:19,585
I like him, too.

241
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:25,065
♫  I wait for you  ♫

242
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:30,095
What do I do now?

243
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:36,355
What am I supposed to do now?

244
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:42,545
I can't be like this.

245
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,485
I really can't...

246
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:59,288
   

247
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:14,595
The more I think, the more ridiculous this is.

248
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:21,885
I've never been slapped... trying to kiss a woman.

249
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:27,465
And she's not even giving me a call after that?

250
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:32,675
Is this how President Baek manages her actor?

251
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:37,425
She took 500 million from me. Shouldn't she give me something in return?

252
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,455
President Baek, it's me.

253
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:54,445
Yes. I wanted to discuss something with you.

254
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,155
Ta-da.

255
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:13,335
What are you doing here, President Gong?

256
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,795
I had no choice because you weren't answering my call.

257
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:17,315
I had to come here.

258
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,715
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:22,615
I kept my phone off because I was doing something important.

260
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,415
It's okay. It can happen.

261
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:31,815
By the way, I do think we need a chance to get closer.

262
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,725
You agree with me on that, right?

263
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:35,845
Pardon?

264
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:41,105
Since we're on the topic, why don't we go to Jeju-do for two nights this weekend?

265
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:45,295
Let's get something tasty, go on a drive, and surf, too.

266
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,555
- Jeju-do? 
 - Yes.

267
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:51,315
I asked President Baek, and she said you're free this week.

268
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,465
So I told her about the plan, too.

269
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:58,435
But... But because of my grandma—

270
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:03,715
Grandma? President Baek agreed to take care of her. Don't worry.

271
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:08,335
I asked President Baek since I knew you'd say that.

272
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:13,655
I'll think about it.

273
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,835
What is there to think about?

274
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:19,105
Just think you're getting some fresh air.

275
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:20,885
I'll prepare everything.

276
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:25,105
All you need to do is to come along, okay?

277
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:50,495
 How dare you dilute the Gong family's blood? 

278
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:52,905
 You'll be punished by the heavens! 

279
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:56,945
 Chewing you up in pieces won't be enough! You bitch. 

280
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:59,735
 You bitch! 

281
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,825
W-What was that?

282
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,295
Was it a dream?

283
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,515
What do I do now?

284
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:21,365
When they find out Jin Dan isn't the chairman's son,

285
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,945
everything would be over.

286
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,025
No.

287
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:29,975
No one knows. No one.

288
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:41,101
   

289
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:44,631
Ms. Kim, what did you want to talk about urgently?

290
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:47,531
By chance, is there something wrong with the contract?

291
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:51,201
No, it's not like that.

292
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:55,091
What is it, then? Tell me.

293
00:21:56,681 --> 00:22:01,961
I'm not sure if I can tell you since it's such a big favor.

294
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,551
Ask me anything.

295
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,971
You're the leading actor in our drama.

296
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:09,251
I should satisfy you as much as I can.

297
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:14,341
I was...

298
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:22,301
wondering if I could get paid the contract fee partially in advance.

299
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,311
The contract fee?

300
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,411
That's not something I can decide on.

301
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:31,191
I'll talk to the President and get in touch with you.

302
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:34,891
I'm so sorry for bringing this up as soon as the contract is signed.

303
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:38,971
It's nothing. I'll ask him and call you.

304
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:40,521
Thank you.

305
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,391
Thank you. Take care.

306
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:44,481
Take care.

307
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:51,291
What brought Ms. Kim here?

308
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,381
I was actually just about to go to your office.

309
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:59,841
Ms. Kim asked if she could get paid the contract fee partially in advance.

310
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:03,941
The contract says she'll be paid 50% after the first shoot.

311
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:06,001
What should we do?

312
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:10,101
Looks like there's a situation since she was so hesitant to ask.

313
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:11,901
Pay her right away.

314
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:14,711
Got it, President.

315
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:33,741
Yes, Chief.

316
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:38,161
 Ms. Kim, I sent 50% of the contract fee to President Lee's account. 

317
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:39,801
Really?

318
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:44,171
Thank you! Thank you!

319
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,481
Yes, PresidentidentLee.

320
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:54,951
 Go Go Entertainment sent 50% of the contract fee. 

321
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:57,571
 I heard you requested it. Is that true? 

322
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,311
Yes, it's true.

323
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:03,141
 I'll keep the Popcorn Entertainment's portion and send the rest to President Baek. 

324
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,721
Okay. Thank you, President Lee!

325
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,371
What's...

326
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,021
Hey, Jae Dong.

327
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,171
What's the money you just sent?

328
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,841
What?

329
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:35,321
They paid 50% of the contract fee already?

330
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:36,891
Yes.

331
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,471
What's going on?

332
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:41,051
Okay, okay.

333
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:42,551
What's going on?

334
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,511
Ahjumma, I'm home.

335
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:48,041
Hey, Ji Yeong. Have a seat.

336
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:52,761
Jae Dong told you we received 50% of the contract fee, right?

337
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:57,631
Go Go Entertainment is so financially strong since it's a corporate subsidiary company.

338
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:01,231
The shooting hasn't even started, but they sent 50% already.

339
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,711
I can't believe this.

340
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:06,491
By the way, I heard you asked them to.

341
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:08,261
Yes.

342
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:12,361
First of all, please pay Presiident Gong back the 200 million.

343
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:16,531
And tell him I'll pay the rest, too.

344
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:21,171
What? W-Why would you pay him back?

345
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:23,971
Ahjumma,

346
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:28,201
to be honest, it's too hard.

347
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:31,561
You said President Gong used to be engaged with me

348
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:36,691
and I'm so grateful to him for saving you and my brothers' lives.

349
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:40,961
So, I did my best to make things work with him,

350
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:44,911
but no matter how much I try, I have no feelings for him.

351
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,031
It's too hard.

352
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:49,421
So what are you saying?

353
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:53,241
Are you saying you'd stop seeing President Gong now?

354
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:55,101
It's not that.

355
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:58,011
I want to take it slowly.

356
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:02,721
You say he and I were engaged because we were in love,

357
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:05,381
but I have no memory right now.

358
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:07,081
So I'll pay him back first...

359
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:10,971
and once I get my memory back, I'll start seeing him again—

360
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:14,901
Hey, what kind of nonsense is that?

361
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:17,751
President Gong doesn't know you're Do Ra.

362
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:22,381
He invested in me just because he likes you without knowing anything.

363
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,151
But you want to pay him back and cut him off?

364
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:28,041
Hey, that's so ungrateful.

365
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,240
He saved your mom and brothers.

366
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,560
How could you do that?

367
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:36,951
And because he likes you so sincerely,

368
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:40,681
he gave me 500 million so I could take good care of you.

369
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,451
Not anyone can do that.

370
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,241
Do you think 500 million is a joke?

371
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,521
He gave me that much money as if it were nothing.

372
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,671
I know. I know I should be grateful to him.

373
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:54,481
But I can't help myself, no matter how much I try.

374
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,611
And we need to pay him back eventually.

375
00:26:57,611 --> 00:26:59,411
That's why I want to pay him back.

376
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:04,031
I need to pay him back so I can date him comfortably.

377
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:05,461
That's why.

378
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:08,181
Gosh, okay, okay!

379
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:09,661
What's going on?

380
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,721
- Hey, you bitch! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

381
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:14,261
You bitch!

382
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:15,891
What are you doing, Grandma?

383
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:18,291
You think Ji Yeong is Sim Cheong*? 
  (Korean folktale character) 

384
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,951
How dare you sell her for money?

385
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:24,201
- Hey! You! 
 - Gosh, Grandma.

386
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,951
Let go! Let go!

387
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:30,021
It's not like that, Grandma.

388
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,581
What's gotten into you?

389
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:37,561
I can't believe you called me to see me.

390
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:46,851
Because I'm so grateful to you for everything, I wanted to treat you to a meal

391
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,271
and I needed to tell you something, too.

392
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:51,631
Tell me what?

393
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:56,041
And what do you mean, you're grateful for everything? What does that mean?

394
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:05,691
I know you invested in President Baek's company since you had a good impression of me.

395
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:08,791
Oh, that?

396
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:12,311
So, I tried to make things work,

397
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:15,821
but I think I still need some time.

398
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:20,441
I want to focus on work for now since I've been cast.

399
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:25,481
I don't think I can go to Jeju-do with you.

400
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:33,231
What did you say?

401
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,731
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:49,431
Ji Yeong, why do you think I invested in President Baek's company?

403
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:55,711
It's because you have potential as an actor and President Baek used to be good at her job.

404
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:58,581
So, I invested in her company with fond feelings for you.

405
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,471
Because I wanted to make things work with you.

406
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,421
They say money goes to where one's heart is.

407
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:07,491
Some say they're in love but do nothing.

408
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:10,961
That's not love. It's all a lie.

409
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:16,151
But because I love you, I invested 500 million in President Baek's company, so she takes good care of you.

410
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:20,571
And you're destroying my pure heart like this?

411
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,621
I really...

412
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:34,091
didn't want to say all this,

413
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:38,091
but do you think it's easy to get 500 million?

414
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:40,361
That's a lot of money.

415
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:44,051
I deliberate a lot whenever I invest 500 million in something.

416
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:48,571
I felt so bad about it, too.

417
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:54,531
I understand President Baek paid you 200 million back.

418
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,321
What are you talking about?

419
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,291
200 million?

420
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:07,301
President Baek should've sent you 200 million won.

421
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,141
- You didn't get it? 
 - What money?

422
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,141
President Baek never even paid me 10 won.

423
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:14,641
Pardon?

424
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:21,871
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

425
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:24,271
Hey, w-what's wrong? What is it?

426
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:27,871
Ahjumma, why didn't you send 200 million to President Gong?

427
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:31,531
I thought you sent him 200 million won.

428
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:35,871
Oh, i-it's because I was busy.

429
00:30:35,871 --> 00:30:41,311
But why would you send that money? He invested in our company.

430
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:46,041
Ahjumma... what are you talking about?

431
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:50,331
Ji Yeong, why don't we move with that money?

432
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,321
I'm looking for an apartment right now.

433
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:55,221
We can't live like this. Just look at this place.

434
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:58,021
We live with an old lady with dementia in this tiny place.

435
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:01,481
How much longer will we live crowded like this?

436
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,971
No. Give me that money right now.

437
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:07,811
I'll pay him back! Give me that money right now!

438
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:09,570
So why would you send him that money?

439
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,880
He's not even asking for it.

440
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:16,321
Seriously, I mean...

441
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:21,401
And... even though you don't like him, just keep seeing him. Why is that so hard?

442
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:24,311
It's not like he gives you a hard time.

443
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:28,371
I won't give you that money. I'll find an apartment and move.

444
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:31,091
Ahjumma...

445
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:37,401
are you sure you're my mom?

446
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:41,471
What?

447
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:45,380
How could you do this to me if you're my mom?

448
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:51,061
I told you countless times that it's hard to date President Gong.

449
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:54,551
It's not like I said I won't date him.

450
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:58,071
I said I'd take things slowly.

451
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:02,481
I said I felt uncomfortable because of the money.

452
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:08,751
That's why I brought myself to ask the company for money.

453
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:16,211
I... I brought that up even before the shooting began for a reason.

454
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:22,021
I wouldn't have dated President Gong if it wasn't for that money.

455
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:27,791
Because... Because you said you were my mom...

456
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:32,121
Because I thought you'd die because of that physical rights waiver...

457
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:36,431
Because they said, they'd hurt Do Sik and Do Jun...

458
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:41,441
I dated President Gong as you told me to.

459
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:45,951
But I want to pay him back because I feel so uncomfortable.

460
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,000
Why are you refusing to pay him right now?

461
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:53,621
Give me that money, Ahjumma.

462
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:56,181
- Give it to me right now. 
 - I mean, I...

463
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,971
- Hey! 
 - What are you talking about?

464
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:04,661
Did this meanie really sell you for money?

465
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:11,051
- Aigoo! Hey! You bitch! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

466
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,321
Mom! Mom!

467
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:16,471
- Grandma! Please! 
 - I won't let go!

468
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:19,701
- Oh, my! 
 - Let go of her!

469
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:21,901
Please stop!

470
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:24,281
Seriously!

471
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:28,211
Aigoo...

472
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:32,951
Ji Yeong, were you forced to see President Gong because of money?

473
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,481
Huh?

474
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:46,351
Mom, I know we're struggling, but how could you force her to do that for money?

475
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,371
And why won't you pay him back?

476
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:52,001
You made her dance at the nightclub because of me last time.

477
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:54,371
You promised you'd never do this again.

478
00:33:54,371 --> 00:34:00,071
Mom, why are you doing this to Ji Yeong? Why?

479
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,541
Oh, my God!

480
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,851
D-Do Jun...

481
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:11,101
How could you do this to her again? How?

482
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:14,921
Do Jun... Do Jun...

483
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:19,281
How could a mother do this? How?

484
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,441
Do Jun, calm down! Calm down!

485
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,461
Don't do that, Do Jun.

486
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,181
Why do you think she died?

487
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:28,541
How could you do this to her again? How?

488
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:31,691
Don't you feel sorry for her at all?

489
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:34,401
How could you do this? Of all people!

490
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:38,191
It's not like that, Do Jun! It's not like that!

491
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:46,191
The debt collectors said they'd kill you all if I didn't pay them back! Do Jun!

492
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,521
Do Jun!

493
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:53,340
Do Jun!

494
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,761
Do Jun!

495
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:02,301
Do Jun... Do Jun...

496
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:08,031
Do Jun...

497
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:24,071
Ji Yeong, why didn't you say anything?

498
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:27,341
You're making me and Do Jun look bad.

499
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,601
I know you have no memory, but we're a family.

500
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,830
We could've figured it out if we discussed together.

501
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,300
Why did you suffer alone?

502
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:41,061
The debt collector barged in while you were gone

503
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:47,381
and got Ahjumma to sign the physical rights waiver.

504
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:53,921
She borrowed a lot from them, and she still owed them.

505
00:35:54,921 --> 00:36:00,571
They said they'd hurt you guys if she doesn't pay back.

506
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:05,101
I suppose she went to President Gong and begged.

507
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:12,321
But he asked her to let him date me instead of paying her 500 million.

508
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:18,011
So, I said I will.

509
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:21,551
But you still should've told us. You should've...

510
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:24,821
It was too much money for us.

511
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:30,061
And even if I told you, it would've only upset you and made you worry.

512
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:34,471
And when I was Do Ra,

513
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:38,451
I apparently was engaged with President Gong since I loved him.

514
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:41,301
So, I tried to date him,

515
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:46,301
but no matter how hard I tried, I had no feelings for him.

516
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:48,871
It was so hard.

517
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:54,061
That's why I asked for the contract fee in advance

518
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,601
and tried to pay him 200 million back.

519
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:02,971
I was going to try dating him again once I get my memory back, but...

520
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:08,131
Ahjumma didn't pay him the money.

521
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:10,231
Damn it!

522
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,601
It's okay. It's okay.

523
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:16,411
No matter how much I try, I can't understand Mom.

524
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:20,771
You died for a reason.

525
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,451
But you came back alive.

526
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:28,721
Noona, there's no need to talk more.

527
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,591
Move out of that place immediately.

528
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:32,761
Live with me.

529
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:36,351
Do Jun, I'm really angry, too.

530
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:38,941
But it's also our fault for being clueless.

531
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:41,101
Mom even signed a physical rights waiver.

532
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:42,981
I would've done the same if I were Ji Yeong.

533
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:46,031
I would've forced myself to date him in your shoes.

534
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,241
I'll make money and pay him back somehow.

535
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:56,501
And Do Jun, she's still our mom.

536
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,401
Don't be so mad at her.

537
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,521
She must be very upset, too.

538
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,791
Do Jun! Do Jun!

539
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:16,221
Do Jun! Do Jun!

540
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:18,391
Don't be like this, Do Jun.

541
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:21,711
Do Jun, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

542
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:26,301
You did nothing wrong. I'm the one who's sorry. I am.

543
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,811
Do Jun.

544
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,411
Noona, I'm sorry.

545
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:39,831
I'm so sorry.

546
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,831
No.

547
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,201
No, I'm sorry.

548
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:51,061
So, please don't say that, Do Jun.

549
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:05,831
Noona, I have no idea what you went through

550
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:10,161
before you died because I was studying abroad.

551
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:14,011
So, I feel so bad that I couldn't help you at all.

552
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:17,351
The fact that I couldn't protect you then

553
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:20,331
upsets me so much, and I regret it.

554
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:24,041
You came back alive after all that,

555
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,551
but I couldn't protect you again. I'm sorry.

556
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,801
Don't say that.

557
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:36,851
I'm your big sister. Why would you protect me?

558
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:41,651
Do Jun, you should only focus on yourself from now on.

559
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:48,521
I have no memory, but we got to meet again like this.

560
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:53,521
So don't worry about me anymore. Okay?

561
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:01,151
Do Jun.

562
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,361
Please wait just a bit.

563
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:12,031
I'll make a lot of money and let you study abroad again.

564
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:16,531
Noona, stop saying stuff like that!

565
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,631
Do Jun!

566
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:24,491
Do Jun, thank you!

567
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,961
Do Jun!

568
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:33,541
I'm so happy that I have you!

569
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:48,755
What do I do? Do Jun and Do Sik found out, too.

570
00:40:50,635 --> 00:40:54,515
I've never met anyone like you in my life.

571
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:57,225
You mean stepmother.

572
00:40:58,445 --> 00:41:00,785
You can't do this just because you didn't give birth to her.

573
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,535
Give me her money right now.

574
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:05,955
Give me Ji Yeong's money right now!

575
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:08,775
Give me. Give me the money!

576
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:11,765
- Seriously...
 - Gosh, Geum Dong.

577
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:17,555
Geum Dong, how did you end up with a bitch like her?

578
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:19,855
Blind Shim did that because he was blind.

579
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:24,265
Why did you choose someone like her when you aren't blind?

580
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:28,315
She took Ji Yeong's money, but she wouldn't give it back.

581
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:33,735
I plucked all her hair, but she still won't. What do we do with her?

582
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:42,625
Mom, give Ji Yeong's contract fee back.

583
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:48,565
Why would you ask me that?

584
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:50,685
I don't have it right now.

585
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:52,615
Where is it, then?

586
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:55,725
Stop lying and give it to us right now.

587
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:58,635
I said I don't have it!

588
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:03,385
What's your passcode?

589
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:06,455
- Don't do it. Give it to me! 
 - Tell us! Tell us!

590
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:08,885
- If you don't tell us— 
 - What's the passcode?

591
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:11,715
I'll beat you up. Tell us.

592
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:15,515
Seriously!

593
00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:18,250
Why are you doing this to me?

594
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,440
Why?

595
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,855
What do I do?

596
00:42:27,855 --> 00:42:29,985
   

597
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:37,695
 President Baek should've sent you 200 million won. 

598
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,995
 You didn't get it? 

599
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:44,155
What's she trying to do?

600
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:54,095
President Baek, what's this money?

601
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:55,965
You used me when you needed money.

602
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:58,655
Are you saying you'd take off now?

603
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:02,985
No, no, no. It's not like that.

604
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:08,225
Ji Yeong found out that I took investment money from you.

605
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:13,315
So I guess she felt uncomfortable whenever she saw you.

606
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:17,485
You know how pure and innocent she is.

607
00:43:17,485 --> 00:43:20,575
But imagine she found out there's money involved.

608
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:23,255
She must've felt so uncomfortable.

609
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:28,885
She felt like she was sold and dating you for money.

610
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:31,865
That's why I sent you that money.

611
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:38,155
She said she needed to pay you back to see you comfortably.

612
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:41,875
- Is that true? 
  - I'm telling you! 

613
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:47,675
 Anyway, that's what happened. By the way, President Gong, please take things slowly. 

614
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:50,505
You understand what I mean, right?

615
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:51,925
Well, yes.

616
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:54,415
If that's the case...

617
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:56,245
Okay.

618
00:43:56,245 --> 00:43:58,705
Got it. Bye.

619
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,275
Is that really why?

620
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:12,190
I suppose

621
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:17,930
she would've felt bad knowing she owed money.

622
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:24,035
Wow, Ji Yeong is really different from other women.

623
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:28,755
Is this why I'm falling for her?

624
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:46,235
Chairman Gong! Are you okay?

625
00:44:58,035 --> 00:45:01,335
Chairman Gong, what's going on?

626
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:03,985
What happened to your arm? What happened?

627
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:08,455
I'm okay. I played tennis with Chairman Kim.

628
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,475
I fell because I hadn't played in a while.

629
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:15,385
You can't play tennis at your age. You should be careful.

630
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:16,915
How bad is it?

631
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:20,565
It fractured because I extended it when I fell.

632
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:23,105
They said it'd heal if I wore a cast for a few days.

633
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:27,065
You can't play intense sports at your age.

634
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:29,015
You should play golf gently.

635
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:32,915
Do you think you're still a young man?

636
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,105
Why did it have to be your right arm?

637
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:43,005
- Chairman. 
 - Thank you.

638
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:54,675
Yeojudaek, we still have the strawberry yogurt cake, right?

639
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:56,945
Yes, it's in the fridge. Let me get it for you.

640
00:45:56,945 --> 00:45:59,265
No, I'll get it. Don't let me interrupt.

641
00:45:59,265 --> 00:46:00,985
Okay.

642
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,595
- Yeojudaek. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

643
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:25,655
- Please take this to Ma Ri. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

644
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:45,035
It's okay.

645
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,075
Don't worry about me and leave.

646
00:46:49,865 --> 00:46:53,315
Have some. You like barley croaker.

647
00:47:52,975 --> 00:47:54,935
Give it to me.

648
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:07,995
Why did you do that?

649
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:18,695
If you had been honest with me from the start, I would have forgiven you.

650
00:48:20,205 --> 00:48:22,545
Pil Sung, that fellow...

651
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:27,155
I could've accepted him as my son.

652
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,085
Because I loved you.

653
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:35,675
I could've accepted everything about you.

654
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:42,135
Why did you lie to me?

655
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:46,975
Why did you deceive me?

656
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,435
Get out.

657
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:54,375
I hate to see your face. Leave.

658
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,635
It's okay. It's okay.

659
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:30,235
- Hello, you requested a driver, right? 
 - Yes, we did.

660
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:33,675
- Get home safely. 
 - Watch your head.

661
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:38,095
- Get home safely. 
 - Drive safe. Thank you.

662
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,655
- We'll get going now. 
 - Okay.

663
00:50:42,335 --> 00:50:45,105
- Sang Gu. 
 - Ae Gyo, what's going on?

664
00:50:45,105 --> 00:50:47,645
Why did you want to see me so early?

665
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:51,505
Sang Gu, I have a favor to ask you.

666
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:54,065
Me? What is it?

667
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:58,685
Sang Gu, can you be in the Philippines for a while? Just for a few months.

668
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:00,605
What are you talking about?

669
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:02,555
I've been in Korea for less than a month.

670
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:04,945
We finally met. You want to be apart again?

671
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:09,775
I know. I know, too, but... there's a bit of a situation.

672
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,200
Situation? What situation?

673
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,665
As you know, Jin Dan's brother...

674
00:51:15,665 --> 00:51:20,145
I mean, Chairman Gong only has one daughter.

675
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:23,355
The one who got injured.

676
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:28,335
So, Jin Dan is the only one who could inherit APP Group.

677
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,205
But because I was a mistress,

678
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:36,655
he's looked down on, no matter how well he does.

679
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:38,655
What? Look down on him? Really?

680
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:45,975
Yes. So we decided to get Jin Dan adopted by his brother.

681
00:51:45,975 --> 00:51:49,055
To make him look better.

682
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:53,255
So, Sang Gu, please be in the Philippines for a while.

683
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:58,325
It's crucial timing for Jin Dan, waiting to find out if he'd get adopted or not.

684
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:03,425
I don't want to get caught seeing you and cause trouble for him.

685
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:06,435
I'm not suggesting doing anything with you right now.

686
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:08,425
Can't we even have tea together briefly?

687
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,575
Of course not.

688
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:13,815
What if I got caught seeing my first love at my age?

689
00:52:13,815 --> 00:52:18,035
They'd say something funny, and it'd surely become an obstacle.

690
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,905
I'll call you when everything gets settled.

691
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:25,795
Let's have a fresh start then. Please, Sang Gu?

692
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,085
Are you sure?

693
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:30,015
Of course, I'm sure.

694
00:52:30,015 --> 00:52:35,225
I want to live with you as soon as things get settled for Jin Dan.

695
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:41,175
Jin Dan will understand us then. I'd have nothing to fear.

696
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:43,335
Okay.

697
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:47,795
I shouldn't get in the way of something so important. I understand.

698
00:52:47,795 --> 00:52:50,085
Thank you, Sang Gu.

699
00:52:54,545 --> 00:52:57,095
Use this in the Philippines for a while.

700
00:52:57,095 --> 00:53:02,385
I got you some clothes and shoes you'd need, too. Take them.

701
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:09,705
Okay. I'll accept this since this comes from your heart.

702
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:12,165
Right, Sang Gu,

703
00:53:12,165 --> 00:53:17,705
don't tell anyone that Jin Dan resembles your father.

704
00:53:17,705 --> 00:53:19,445
That doesn't sound good.

705
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:22,005
What if someone gets the wrong idea?

706
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:24,985
Is that so? I suppose.

707
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:27,995
Okay, I won't.

708
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:32,125
 Yes, Sang Gu. You can't be in Korea. 

709
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,175
 You can never. 

710
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:41,130
Yes, come in.

711
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,860
   

712
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,890
   

713
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:52,135
What brings you here?

714
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:59,155
I know you don't like eating out.

715
00:53:59,155 --> 00:54:02,545
This is finger food. It won't be hard to eat.

716
00:54:02,545 --> 00:54:04,565
Eat it later.

717
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,425
Hold on. Stop right there.

718
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:19,395
Thinking about what you did to me, I feel angry and hateful.

719
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:25,255
I should never see you again.

720
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:32,995
But I let you move back into my house, care for Ma Ri,

721
00:54:32,995 --> 00:54:35,785
and I'm being helped by you.

722
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:40,405
You must think I'm a fool, right?

723
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:43,525
No, not at all.

724
00:54:44,745 --> 00:54:49,505
I'm so grateful that you let me be with Ma Ri.

725
00:54:49,505 --> 00:54:57,065
I'm so grateful that you let me do this for you to make up

726
00:54:57,065 --> 00:54:59,905
for what I've done.

727
00:54:59,905 --> 00:55:07,685
So if you find it difficult to see me, let me know.

728
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:12,315
Ma Ri is well enough to go for walks with Mr. Park.

729
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:15,515
I'll move out now.

730
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:19,385
No, stay.

731
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:27,145
You can't move out like this.

732
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:35,445
I told Attorney Park...

733
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,665
to cancel the divorce.

734
00:55:42,975 --> 00:55:47,935
I'm mad at you and hate to see you sometimes,

735
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:50,775
but...

736
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:56,965
I... can't be without you.

737
00:55:58,175 --> 00:56:03,995
I hate myself for doing this, but I can't help myself.

738
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:11,565
So, be hated by me for the rest of your life, okay?

739
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:27,685
I'm so glad you changed your style.

740
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:29,575
- You really look like an actor now. 
 - Wow.

741
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:34,085
Ji Yeong, you really look like the Seoul Lady now. Seriously.

742
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:36,105
Really?

743
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:40,745
But I don't look like myself.

744
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:45,845
Do you think Director Go and Writer Kim would like it?

745
00:56:45,845 --> 00:56:48,925
Of course, they will. You look amazing. I'm telling you.

746
00:56:48,925 --> 00:56:51,105
It's really amazing.

747
00:56:58,635 --> 00:57:02,635
Oh, right. I'll meet you inside. I left something in the car.

748
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:04,565
Okay.

749
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:22,695
Hello, Director.

750
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:26,955
You changed your style.

751
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:29,560
- You took your glasses off, too. 
 - Yes,

752
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,090
Writer Kim told me to change my style.

753
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:37,255
I'm not sure if she'd like it.

754
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:41,165
Do I fit the Seoul Lady, Bun Hong's image?

755
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:43,665
I think Writer Kim would be happy, too.

756
00:57:48,985 --> 00:57:50,835
Ji Yeong?

757
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:55,355
- My gosh! You changed your style. 
 - Yes...

758
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:59,115
You're totally Bun Hong. I love it!

759
00:57:59,115 --> 00:58:01,435
You look great without the glasses.

760
00:58:01,995 --> 00:58:07,345
Ji Yeong and Gang Bin have great chemistry just sitting together.

761
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:09,775
I can just imagine the story.

762
00:58:09,775 --> 00:58:11,625
Right, Director Go?

763
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,555
I'm excited because you have great chemistry.

764
00:58:14,555 --> 00:58:18,455
A spy from North Korea disguised as a fashion designer.

765
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:20,265
You'll have a lot of action scenes.

766
00:58:20,265 --> 00:58:23,825
You need to get trained at stunt school before the shoot starts.

767
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:26,765
Okay, I will.

768
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,395
 What's that? 

769
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:50,515
Can't believe I loved that son of a bitch.

770
00:58:50,515 --> 00:58:55,175
Hey, Go Myeong Dong, you have the worst taste.

771
00:58:56,545 --> 00:58:59,025
What's with Park Do Shik, anyway?

772
00:58:59,025 --> 00:59:03,895
He got caught red-handed, but he hasn't called me once?

773
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:09,045
Yes, let's just move on.

774
00:59:12,695 --> 00:59:14,685
Grandma!

775
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:18,245
Ma Ri! Gosh, Ma Ri.

776
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:20,955
Gosh, my Ma Ri.

777
00:59:21,665 --> 00:59:24,595
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

778
00:59:29,235 --> 00:59:33,345
Gosh, you love beef.

779
00:59:33,345 --> 00:59:35,775
Here. Here you go.

780
00:59:35,775 --> 00:59:38,305
Take your time. Eat as much as you'd like.

781
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:41,835
You need to eat meat when you're feeling weak.

782
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:46,075
Yes, Grandma. This is really tasty.

783
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:50,245
Your parents didn't get divorced and you completely recovered.

784
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:53,495
- I can finally sleep comfortably. 
 - Yes.

785
00:59:53,495 --> 00:59:57,335
This is all thanks to Pil Sung Oppa.

786
00:59:57,985 --> 01:00:00,555
- It's thanks to Pil Sung? 
 - Yes,

787
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:04,205
I recovered, thanks to him.

788
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:06,775
I eat and go for walks because of him.

789
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:10,445
That's why I completely recovered.

790
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:17,195
Grandma, thank you so much for letting him visit me while I was sick.

791
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:21,005
I didn't tell him to go, but...

792
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:23,475
Anyway, I'm glad.

793
01:00:23,475 --> 01:00:26,885
- Is your mom okay? 
 - Yes, she's okay now.

794
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:28,985
Everything is okay now.

795
01:00:28,985 --> 01:00:31,240
Gosh, that's great.

796
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,230
What a relief.

797
01:00:33,235 --> 01:00:36,465
It's much better to stay together than get divorced.

798
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:40,135
Yes. That's why I'm so, so happy.

799
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:46,035
To be honest, I was so afraid of them getting divorced.

800
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:51,475
Yes, they'd never get divorced, for your sake.

801
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:52,855
Don't worry.

802
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:56,465
Ma Ri, eat as much as you'd like.

803
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:59,025
And cheer up even more.

804
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:00,745
Okay.

805
01:01:10,075 --> 01:01:11,745
No.

806
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:16,835
Ae Gyo does need to be careful.

807
01:01:17,565 --> 01:01:21,275
But why do I have to leave Korea?

808
01:01:21,275 --> 01:01:25,235
I like this place. The landlord is my senior, too.

809
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:27,970
 Right, Sang Gu, 

810
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:33,490
 don't tell anyone Jin Dan resembles your father. 

811
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:35,235
 That doesn't sound good. 

812
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:38,165
 What if someone gets the wrong idea? 

813
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,515
Why did she say that?

814
01:01:41,515 --> 01:01:44,025
Something's suspicious.

815
01:01:44,895 --> 01:01:50,670
By chance, is that why she wants me to go to the Philippines?

816
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,715
Yes.

817
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:17,715
President Go, thank you so much for what you did for me.

818
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:23,675
I made a difficult request, but you paid me in advance.

819
01:02:23,675 --> 01:02:27,235
I just paid you what we owe a little sooner.

820
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:29,220
Don't feel bad about it.

821
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:33,885
I'll work hard preparing for "Seoul Lady."

822
01:02:33,885 --> 01:02:39,435
I'll practice the North Korean accent and train hard at stunt school, too.

823
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:44,915
Okay. Feel free to ask me if you need anything.

824
01:02:44,915 --> 01:02:46,465
Okay.

825
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:49,455
Thank you.

826
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:54,045
Ji Yeong, hold on.

827
01:03:06,255 --> 01:03:08,265
Take this.

828
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,085
What's this?

829
01:03:15,085 --> 01:03:18,325
I bought it for you when I was in Paris last time.

830
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:20,145
I haven't had a chance to give it to you.

831
01:03:20,145 --> 01:03:24,735
I can't give it to someone else when I bought it for you.

832
01:03:24,735 --> 01:03:28,105
So don't feel pressured, and just take it.

833
01:03:32,715 --> 01:03:35,495
Thank you.

834
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,235
I'll get going now.

835
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:45,785
♫  On an exhausting day  ♫

836
01:03:45,785 --> 01:03:52,755
♫  You were such a strength to me  ♫

837
01:03:52,755 --> 01:04:01,015
♫  I was happy that I met you  ♫

838
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:08,705
♫  You mean everything to me  ♫

839
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:15,740
♫  You became my light  ♫

840
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,600
   

841
01:04:24,805 --> 01:04:27,885
You did great last time. Just keep doing what you're doing.

842
01:04:27,885 --> 01:04:29,615
Okay.

843
01:04:36,325 --> 01:04:38,635
Director Go, you came.

844
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:41,175
- Yes, thanks for your hard work. 
 - Not at all.

845
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:43,725
You shouldn't have brought all that.

846
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:47,435
She's practicing the scene where she escapes and falls.

847
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:49,155
I see.

848
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:50,755
- I'll let you watch. 
 - Okay.

849
01:04:50,755 --> 01:04:53,655
Hey, that's not it.

850
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,175
Ji Yeong!

851
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:21,015
 Don't go to the bathroom without me from now on. 

852
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:26,605
Ji Yeong.

853
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:28,525
Ji Yeong!

854
01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:34,495
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

855
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:44,250


856
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:48,530
   

857
01:05:49,555 --> 01:05:56,055
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

858
01:05:56,055 --> 01:06:06,805
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

859
01:06:10,785 --> 01:06:14,305
♫  One love  ♫

860
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,575
 W-What? Why would you say something so silly? 

861
01:06:23,575 --> 01:06:24,925
 I told you it's not like that. 

862
01:06:24,925 --> 01:06:27,415
 I'll meet with President Gong myself. 

863
01:06:27,415 --> 01:06:30,125
 Angel Investment is in the APP Group building, right? 

864
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:36,565
 If you'd like, let's eat where we used to eat and I also want to talk to you about Do Ra. 

865
01:06:36,565 --> 01:06:38,955
 Kim Ji Yeong, are you cheating on me with this bastard? 

866
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:40,375
 What do you think you're doing? 

867
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:44,715
 Why would you date someone like him? How long will you keep seeing him? 

868
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,445
 You just remembered something again, right? 

869
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,005
 What do you remember? 

870
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:52,195
 I went to see you on the day I died. 

871
01:06:52,195 --> 01:06:53,815
 Right?
