1
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:49,245
And how dare you call me "Do Ra"?

2
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,185
- Director Hong! 
 - Do Ra, I'm Dae Choong. 
    

3
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,969
Dae Chung.

4
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,509
Go Dae Chung.

5
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:02,559
W-What did you say?

6
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,579
Who?

7
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,269
- Dae Chung? 
 - Yes.

8
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,929
I'm Dae Chung, who used to give you bike rides.

9
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:15,189
So, Do Ra, please forgive me just once. Please?

10
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:17,429
No way.

11
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:20,109
You're stealing someone's identity now?

12
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,719
Stealing? I'm serious.

13
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,789
My face did change a lot since it's been a long time,

14
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,039
but I'm really Dae Chung.

15
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,119
We went to a theme park together,

16
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,099
I gave you bike rides, and what was it?

17
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,219
I did the "Sorry, Sorry" dance in front of you, too.

18
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,579
Whenever you were getting mugged by bullies, I saved you, even getting my hair pulled out.

19
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,299
And I bought you tteokbokki, too.

20
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,899
Don't you remember?

21
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,679
Look at me closely. I'm really that Dae Choong, Do Ra.

22
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,339
But your name is Go Pil Sung.

23
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:53,869
Why is your name Go Pil Sung?

24
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,039
I changed my name.

25
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,089
My mom talked to a fortuneteller, and they said the name "Dae Chung" wasn't good.

26
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:02,580
They said I'd live willy-nilly like my name, and I had to change it. So I was forced to.

27
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,689
How could this happen?

28
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,499
If that was the case...

29
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:15,249
you should've told me that sooner. Why did you keep pretending you didn't know me?

30
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:18,189
How could I let people know I knew you?

31
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,649
You're a superstar, and I'm the youngest assistant director.

32
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:23,029
And it wouldn't be good if people found out.

33
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,719
I was going to tell you after the shoot ended.

34
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,469
So, Do Ra, think of our old friendship and forgive me.

35
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,379
I didn't say that because I hated you.

36
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,569
Because you and Cha Bong Soo won't stop fighting on set,

37
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,629
I worried the shooting schedule might get screwy.

38
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,280
It happened while trying to make things work.

39
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,219
I mean it.

40
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,469
So, Do Ra...

41
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,339
Please?

42
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:50,370
- Do Ra— 
 - Hold on, hold on, hold on.

43
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:59,149


44
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:01,759
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

45
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,799
Why are you back here?

46
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,859
I told you not to come.

47
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,569
Do you want to see me pass out?

48
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,109
Go, go, go!

49
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,759
Ms. Park, don't worry.

50
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,289
I'll make sure to take care of him, so you don't have to worry.

51
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,259
No, Director.

52
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:24,879
I'll let this one slide for the sake of our project.

53
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,959
What did you say? Are you sure?

54
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,519
Yes.

55
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,809
Assistant Director Go promised not to act like a scoundrel anymore.

56
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,769
So I'll forgive him this once.

57
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,499
I could understand him a bit, thinking from his perspective.

58
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:45,609
Anyway, we've been working hard together. I thought he shouldn't leave halfway through.

59
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,659
Let's just keep working together.

60
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,199
Gosh, Ms. Park, your heart is as generous as the ocean.

61
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,059
Thank you so much for understanding.

62
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,399
You really are an A-list actor.

63
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:00,259
You're the best, Ms. Park!

64
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,479
I'll prepare for the next scene, then.

65
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,039
Oh, okay, okay.

66
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,979
Pil Sung, this is great. This is so great.

67
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,909
Gosh, what are you doing? Let go.

68
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,099
I finally learned what kind of person you are.

69
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,689
I feel so betrayed by people in general.

70
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:24,119
Pil Sung, try to understand where I'm coming from.

71
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:27,689
Bbakdora refused to shoot because of you. What could I do?

72
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,919
I'm sorry. I was sad about it, too.

73
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,809
It hurt as much as getting an arm cut off.

74
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,849
It hurt as much as getting an arm cut off?

75
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,559
Have an ounce of shame when you say that.

76
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,309
Hey, I'm serious.

77
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:44,129
By the way, how did you convince Park Do Ra?

78
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,759
She acted like she'd never forgive you.

79
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,369
Hyung,

80
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,409
I'm Go Pil Sung.

81
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,779
You can put that over there.

82
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,329
Single eyelids.

83
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,449
Curly hair.

84
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,929
He really is Dae Chung

85
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,529
I knew the world was small, but how could we meet like this?

86
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:13,340
I would've gone a lot easier on him if he said he was Dae Chung from the beginning.

87
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:17,649
Considering how he gave me bike rides to comfort me,

88
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,959
and bought me tteokbokki.

89
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,749
 Huh? Are you that little kid? 

90
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,259
 - What did you say? 
 - I like you, I said! 

91
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,030
Yes.

92
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,269
Good thing I told Do Ra I'm Dae Chung.

93
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:02,369
I felt guilty pretending I'm not.

94
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,659
I feel relieved after telling her.

95
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,299
 Curly-haired assistant director, 

96
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,249
 I'm near Dae Chung’s old house right now. 

97
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,919
 Let's talk for a second. 

98
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,509
We finished talking earlier.

99
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,359
What does she want to talk about now? I'm scared.

100
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,469
I haven't been to this neighborhood in 15 years since then.

101
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,529
Looks like nothing has changed at all.

102
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,199
The grocery in the alley and the laundromat haven't changed.

103
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,389
This tteokbokki shop hasn't changed, either.

104
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,269
It reminded me of the old days a lot.

105
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,710
Really?

106
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,169
By the way, you said you wanted to tell me something.

107
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,809
Why did you come all the way here? We could've talked on set tomorrow.

108
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,779
Well, it's not much.

109
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,089
We can't freely talk about the old days because of so many people on set.

110
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,799
Right, is your family doing well?

111
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,229
Is your grandfather healthy, too?

112
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,619
They're all well,

113
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:15,199
but my grandfather passed away.

114
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,099
What?

115
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,199
When?

116
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,489
Around when you moved out.

117
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:24,379
You didn't know he passed away, did you?

118
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,109
No, I didn't.

119
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:31,819
I suppose, considering his age...

120
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,979
He was really nice to us back then.

121
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,679
But I didn't even know he passed away.

122
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,709
I feel bad.

123
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:47,009
 Do Ra doesn't seem to know he passed away because of her mom. 

124
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,869
By the way, Oppa, did something bad happen

125
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:57,109
between our moms around the time we moved out?

126
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,459
Why are you suddenly asking that?

127
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:05,299
Mom suddenly told us to pack things to move out in the middle of the night.

128
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,329
So we moved out of your house in a hurry.

129
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:13,269
I couldn't say goodbye to you and your family properly, either.

130
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:16,019
When I passed an audition for a drama,

131
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,579
I went to your house to tell you that I passed,

132
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:26,059
but your mom yelled at me so scarily and told me never to return.

133
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:29,299
That's why I never came back to this neighborhood.

134
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,969
- My mom did? 
 - Yes.

135
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,920
I see.

136
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:45,079
So I speculated something bad had happened between our moms.

137
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,349
Or did my mom do something wrong then?

138
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,219
Huh? Well...

139
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:56,069
I don't know the details since it was just between the adults.

140
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,770
It was a long time ago, and I was young, too.

141
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:04,779
But it does seem something bad did happen.

142
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,159
I'm finally starting to understand.

143
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,469
I wanted to know why we moved out of your house in the middle of the night.

144
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,989
Something we don't know about definitely happened.

145
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,279
Let's not tell our family that we reunited like this, then.

146
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,009
I don't know what happened, but why remind them of bad memories?

147
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,219
Okay, sounds good.

148
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,659
The ttoekbokki is getting cold. Hurry up and eat.

149
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,089
You used to like the tteokbokki here.

150
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:42,609
Oppa, you remembered that I liked tteokbokki here.

151
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,839
Thank you.

152
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,349
Don't mention it. Let's eat.

153
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:52,059
Okay, let's eat.

154
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,709
What do you think?

155
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,489
It tastes exactly the same.

156
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,159
It reminds me of the old days.

157
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,899
How do I pay back all that money?

158
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,649
I need to take care of it before Do Ra finds out.

159
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,039
How did I end up in this mess?

160
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,649
Gosh, what to do? What to do?

161
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,919
My head. My head.

162
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,999
Gosh.

163
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,199
Yes, hello, President Gong.

164
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,389
 Hello, Mother. 

165
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,829
"Mother"? My gosh.

166
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:38,439
Hearing that from you makes me so happy.

167
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,219
Do Ra must've given you a hard time when she got drunk last time.

168
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:46,389
I wonder if she made any mistake from being so drunk.

169
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,959
I'm so embarrassed for her.

170
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,819
No, not at all.

171
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,729
She was actually so cute when she was drunk.

172
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:57,139
Anyway, we had a great time thanks to you.

173
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,089
Gosh, really?

174
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,039
It's such a relief to hear that.

175
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,739
By the way, what does Do Ra say about me?

176
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,569
She said you're very gentle, humorous,

177
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:18,539
 has a great style, and is very handsome. 

178
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,859
Really? Did she really say that?

179
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:25,999
Of course. I'm telling you the truth without adding anything this time.

180
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,529
Thank you. I owe it all to you.

181
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,079
That's why I'd like to invite you and Do Ra to a musical our company invested in.

182
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,189
 We'll have dinner together, too. 

183
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:38,049
 Would you be available today? 

184
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,199
I'm calling you before I call Do Ra.

185
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,889
Of course, I'm available, but...

186
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:47,049
you don't have to invite me.

187
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:51,039
An old person like me would be nothing but a nuisance.

188
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:57,769
I thought Do Ra might still feel uncomfortable seeing me alone.

189
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:02,859
Would you be responsible if I blindly pursued her and got rejected?

190
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,659
Come on, President Gong.

191
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes, I'll be responsible.

192
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:15,729
If so, try doing what I say, President Gong.

193
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,399
How?

194
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,209
This evening?

195
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,789
I don't have any shoots today, but...

196
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,389
Who are you talking to?

197
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:26,649
President Gong Jin Dan.

198
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:28,429
Oh, really?

199
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:29,989
Yes.

200
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,709
The three of us, including my mom?

201
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,209
Oh, sure. Well...

202
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,649
Just one moment.

203
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,779
Mom, he's inviting us to a musical tonight. What should I say?

204
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,559
He wants to get dinner afterward, too.

205
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,419
What do you mean? Say yes.

206
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:49,889
You don't have other plans today.

207
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:53,019
It'd be nice to see a musical, too.

208
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,279
What are you doing? Hurry.

209
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,789
Okay.

210
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,139
Yes, let's do that, then.

211
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:01,049
My mom would like to as well.

212
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,669
Thank you so much for inviting us to the musical.

213
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:06,319
Pardon? You'll pick us up?

214
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,999
No, no, no. You don't have to do that.

215
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:13,489
Oh, okay. Well...

216
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,099
Okay, then.

217
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:18,449
Okay, I'll see you later.

218
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:21,989
What? Is he picking us up?

219
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:24,169
Yes.

220
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,929
He said he needed to pick us up since he invited you, an elder.

221
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,289
I'd feel more comfortable if you and I drove by ourselves.

222
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,889
President Gong is respectful to elders, too.

223
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:40,019
This is how you can tell someone was educated properly in a wealthy family.

224
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:46,179
President Gong is so gentle, good-looking, tall, great style,

225
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,609
and he's very classy, too.

226
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,489
He's totally my type.

227
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:56,169
Mom, don't have any silly thoughts.

228
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,519
I'm grateful he cast me and helped me in a lot of ways recently.

229
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,869
So I thought I should treat him to a meal. That's why I said yes.

230
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:09,859
So, don't take it too far while we're out, okay?

231
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,599
All right.

232
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,109
I'll take a shower.

233
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:20,219
- Aigoo. 
 - Yes!

234
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,159
My friend Myeong Soo couldn't have done this.

235
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,279
Hyeon Cheol.

236
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,299
Yeong Hoon, this is Myeong Soo's office.

237
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,509
What happened to it? What happened to his office?

238
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,599
Hyeon Cheol, by chance... did you invest, too?

239
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,569
I invested 100 million.

240
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,439
How about you?

241
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,809
That's not important.

242
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:05,399
This isn't right.

243
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,349
There's no way our friend Myeong Soo scammed us.

244
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:10,549
Friend, my foot.

245
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:14,429
He scammed us and ran away to the Philippines!

246
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,799
What...

247
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,139
What are you talking about?

248
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:23,539
He even sent a dividend a few days ago.

249
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:30,039
That was just bait he gave us to buy time to disappear. A bait!

250
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,319
I didn't even know...

251
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:02,649
   

252
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,289
Hyeon Cheol! Hyeon Cheol!

253
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,909
Hyeon Cheol, no! Hyeon Cheol!

254
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,269
Hyeon Cheol, no! No, Hyeon Cheol!

255
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,889
No, no, no!

256
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,499
No, Hyeon Cheol. Hyeon Cheol.

257
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,829
W-What are you doing here right now?

258
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:30,859
Hyeon Cheol, were you trying to die...

259
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:34,039
behind my back or something?

260
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,829
No, Mom. No.

261
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,349
Yes, yes.

262
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:42,419
There's no way my Hyeon Cheol would do that.

263
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:48,059
You'd never die leaving me behind, right?

264
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,979
Mom.

265
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,049
I really wanted to die.

266
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:54,329
I don't want to live.

267
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,489
I wanted to do it properly this time,

268
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,759
but why am I like this?

269
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,329
That was such precious money.

270
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,239
By the way, Hyeon Cheol,

271
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:17,609
Seon Yeong doesn't know about this money.

272
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,329
No one knows.

273
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,009
There's no way they would find out about it.

274
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:26,189
Yes, that money never existed from the beginning.

275
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,939
So, you never got scammed, either.

276
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,899
So, Hyeon Cheol,

277
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:40,629
don't say you want to die or don't want to live.

278
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,989
Nothing happened. Why would you die, anyway?

279
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:49,179
Mom.

280
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:52,499
It's okay. It's okay.

281
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:56,439
You can do anything.

282
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,409
You can get back on your feet.

283
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,319
I can guarantee it. Okay, Hyeon Cheol?

284
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:06,549
- Hyeon Cheol. 
 - Mom.

285
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,299
Yes.

286
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,219
- Auntie. 
 - Yes.

287
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,199
Have a seat.

288
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,079
Okay.

289
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:37,199
- So, have you thought about it? 
 - About what...

290
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,269
Listen to you.

291
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,039
Will you play ignorant again?

292
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,829
I talked to you extensively already.

293
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,029
I know that it's a difficult thing to do.

294
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,569
But for our family and company's fate,

295
00:18:54,569 --> 00:19:00,669
you should try to have Jin Taek's son as his wife somehow.

296
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,299
I'll help you on your side.

297
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:08,449
Mother, Jin Taek is over 60 now.

298
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:11,909
How could he have a son? Don't be silly.

299
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:13,509
So what if he's 60?

300
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,799
He's still plenty young.

301
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,089
That's why I'm telling you to do something.

302
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:20,859
Get him a woman or a surrogate mother.

303
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,889
Gosh, Auntie. Please stop. I beg you.

304
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,609
Stop what?

305
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:29,259
Do you think this family is your enemy?

306
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:32,059
Are you trying to ruin this family or something?

307
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,849
How could you say that, Auntie?

308
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,109
Why would you be like this, then?

309
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,969
I'm not even telling you to have one yourself.

310
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:44,039
What have you done since you joined our family?

311
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,479
All you had was a daughter, and you turned her into that.

312
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,659
You have no right to not care at all like this.

313
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:58,349
Auntie, I can tolerate anything else,

314
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:03,579
but please don't speak of our Ma Ri that way. Please.

315
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,039
My gosh, are you crying right now?

316
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,249
I'm the one who should be crying right now.

317
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:14,089
Don't you have any conscience?

318
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,779
I would've left this family already to protect it if I were you.

319
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,089
Gosh, you scared me.

320
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:30,999
Why are you always silently eavesdropping?

321
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,359
Seriously, that girl. What a brat.

322
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,999
By the way, how could Auntie be like that?

323
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,429
This isn't the Joseon era, either.

324
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:46,509
And there's Jin Dan, too.

325
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:50,069
He can be the successor if there's no one else.

326
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:54,139
How could she expect a son at Jin Taek Oppa's age?

327
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:57,699
   

328
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,429
Ma Ri, what's going on?

329
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:10,249
Don't get too excited. Talk calmly.

330
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,229
What did you say?

331
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,169
Auntie did?

332
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,053
Goodness.

333
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:25,653
What are you doing here at this hour, Jin Taek?

334
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:28,553
Auntie, we need to talk.

335
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:30,743
Honey.

336
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:35,453
How quick. You already told Jin Taek all about it.

337
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:38,733
She didn't tell me. I'm here because Ma Ri called.

338
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,463
What's all this nonsense?

339
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:43,703
Surrogate mother? A son?

340
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,773
Did you really say all that to her?

341
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,843
Yes, I did.

342
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:50,523
Is there something wrong?

343
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:54,513
We need to protect the family and company if that's what it takes.

344
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,583
Auntie, why are you doing this?

345
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,203
I already told you what I wanted to do.

346
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:01,483
How could you still say all that?

347
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:06,573
That you'll get Ma Ri married and give the company to your son-in-law?

348
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,393
Is that it?

349
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,453
How could you say stuff like that?

350
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:13,073
How would you know if he's a thief or not?

351
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,793
Auntie.

352
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,463
Does APP Group only belong to you?

353
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:20,563
My father, brother, and I established it with blood and sweat.

354
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:23,053
Why are you doing this on your own?

355
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:28,133
Are my ideas really that wrong?

356
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:31,733
It'd be possible if you cared about this family.

357
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:36,893
Auntie, let me make this clear. Ma Ri is all I have.

358
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:40,403
And she's improving every day.

359
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:44,223
I'll make sure to find a way. So please don't say that again.

360
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:47,673
Wake up. What could you possibly do?

361
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:51,453
And Ma Ri's mental age is only 12.

362
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,393
No decent man would want to marry her.

363
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:58,053
It'd be someone with dark intentions who's only after money.

364
00:22:58,053 --> 00:22:59,013
Auntie!

365
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:02,383
- I said I'm not an idiot! 
 - What?

366
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:05,333
My dad said I'm not an idiot.

367
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,533
How dare you call me an idiot, Great Aunt?

368
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:11,253
Would you feel good if I called you an idiot?

369
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:13,503
You're an old fogy. A fogy.

370
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,153
A fogy who only cares about herself.

371
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:18,423
You interpret things the way you like, and you're unreasonable.

372
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:21,073
And you're not even a part of our family.

373
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:23,813
Why are you being nosy about our family business?

374
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:24,953
Ma Ri.

375
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,193
What, Dad?

376
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:29,463
I have the right to speak, too.

377
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:33,473
And Great Aunt, let me make this clear.

378
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:36,973
Having a surrogate mother is illegal in Korea.

379
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:40,733
Don't bring up stuff like that to my mom again.

380
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:44,803
I'll call the police, then.

381
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:49,503
- Auntie! Auntie! 
- Auntie!

382
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:53,863
Auntie, Auntie, get up. Auntie...

383
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:58,843
Gosh, my stomach. My stomach. My stomach.

384
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,993
Mom, what's wrong? Do you have a stomachache?

385
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,673
Yes, I think I'm having indigestion.

386
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:06,083
I threw up and had diarrhea.

387
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,963
What did you eat?

388
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:11,203
I don't know. I guess I couldn't digest lunch. I kept throwing up.

389
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:13,493
I went to the bathroom so many times.

390
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,103
My stomach...

391
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:18,073
Hey, hey. This is no good.

392
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:22,033
I don't think I could go. Go see the musical, just the two of you.

393
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,933
What? Y-You want me to go alone?

394
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,473
No, no, I don't want to. What would I do by myself?

395
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:29,593
My stomach!

396
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,753
Gosh, it hurts. It hurts so much.

397
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:34,193
My stomach...

398
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:35,653
What did you eat, exactly?

399
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:37,923
I don't know. My stomach...

400
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:58,963
 How could such a beautiful woman exist? 

401
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,733
 Should you be tearing up right now? 

402
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:05,642
 How could she be so sensitive and pure? 

403
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:09,213
 Is that why she's an actor? 

404
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,873
 - We go out for dinner and make breakfast. 
 - Make breakfast. 

405
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:16,033
 We can meet in the morning. 

406
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:19,823
 - We can meet up again. 
 - Yes, yes. Early in the morning. 

407
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:23,463
 In foreign films... 

408
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:26,083
Do Ra, you're back.

409
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,913
How was it? What did you do?

410
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,863
What do you mean? We saw the musical.

411
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:34,152
By the way, are you okay now?

412
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:39,713
Yes. I feel better since I got new medicine. I thought I was dying earlier.

413
00:25:39,713 --> 00:25:43,943
By the way, looks like you had a nice date with him.

414
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,683
Date, my foot. What are you talking about?

415
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:51,413
Since your stomach got upset, I was there alone and felt so uncomfortable.

416
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:54,713
We were sitting in the car alone and had nothing to say.

417
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:57,753
I was worried people might read into it.

418
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:02,143
And we went there too early, so we walked around a park, but it started pouring rain.

419
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,553
Rain? So?

420
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:09,773
I said I was okay, but he took off his jacket and put it on me.

421
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:12,023
It made me feel more uncomfortable.

422
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:14,573
Gosh, I don't know. I was worried so much that

423
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,512
I feel tired, and my shoulder feels stiff, too.

424
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:20,283
Whoa, President Gong is a true gentleman.

425
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:22,593
How could he be so romantic?

426
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:26,583
Maybe he has feelings for you.

427
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,443
You might as well try dating him.

428
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,823
Mom, don't force me to date anyone.

429
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:35,113
He's not just anyone. He's a son of a chaebol family.

430
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:36,913
When will you ever date someone like him?

431
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:39,733
Should I date anyone if they're from a chaebol family?

432
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,223
Why should I be so desperate?

433
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:46,043
And chaebol families' sons are out of fashion these days.

434
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:48,193
I hear he's a womanizer.

435
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:50,813
What? President Gong is a womanizer?

436
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:56,053
Yes, forget chaebol families. I wouldn't want 10 truck-full of tycoons if they're womanizers.

437
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,183
Hey, who said he's a womanizer?

438
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,403
How could such a gentleman be a womanizer?

439
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:05,463
I'll rip the mouths of the ones who spread ridiculous rumors like that.

440
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:09,573
Mom, what are you, his mom?

441
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:10,683
What's wrong with you?

442
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:14,423
He attracts so many women because he's so superior.

443
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:16,433
Is it his fault that he's superior? Huh?

444
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,103
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

445
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,903
Seriously.

446
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:25,603
Who's spreading a ridiculous rumor like that?

447
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:33,003
Yes, Mother.

448
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:36,603
 Did you and Do Ra enjoy the musical by yourselves? 

449
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:40,393
 Yes, I had another happy day thanks to you. 

450
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,233
What did Do Ra say?

451
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,843
She enjoyed the musical a lot and...

452
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:49,283
I heard rain suddenly started pouring in the park

453
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:52,413
that you took your jacket off and put it on Do Ra.

454
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:56,133
She said you're so romantic.

455
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,273
She told you that, too?

456
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:04,043
Yes, and she said you're so cute.

457
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,913
Really? She said I was cute?

458
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,973
Do Ra did?

459
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:14,303
Yes. In my experience,

460
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:19,543
women don't just call any men cute.

461
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:22,003
Gosh, what an honor.

462
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:24,333
Can't believe she called me cute.

463
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,443
Mother, thank you.

464
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,923
I owe you for everything that happened today.

465
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:34,443
Yes, I wish you a pleasant night, too. Yes.

466
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:49,903
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

467
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:59,263
If a woman finds a man cute,

468
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:01,713
isn't it game over?

469
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:22,343
Mr. Kim, organize the rebars here.

470
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,653
Okay.

471
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:35,512
What are you up to?

472
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:39,433
Pil Sung is doing an outdoor shoot somewhere far away.

473
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,013
I see.

474
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:45,103
You were too busy sleeping when your husband went to work.

475
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:47,503
But you're making kimbap for your son?

476
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:49,793
Did he go to work?

477
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,823
He was gone when I woke up in the morning.

478
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,873
I thought he went out to exercise.

479
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,793
He went to work at dawn, okay?

480
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,003
I'll be right back.

481
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:01,763
Yes, Pil Sung, hold on!

482
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:10,483
Take your lunch box. I made kimbap.

483
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:14,153
Mom, you shouldn't have done that.

484
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:16,233
- Here. 
 - I'll enjoy it.

485
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,253
Thank you.

486
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:23,243
You aren't holding back when Do Ra is flipping out, right?

487
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:26,883
No, Mom. I swear I'm fine.

488
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:33,433
Anyway, if that brat bothers you again, do as I said. Okay?

489
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:36,203
Don't just let her harass you, okay?

490
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,663
Okay, I'll be back.

491
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:41,493
Okay. Watch out for cars and women.

492
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,033
Hey!

493
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,953
Seon Yeong, how could you be like this?

494
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:51,913
You're so devoted to a stray kid you found,

495
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:55,023
but how could you not care if your husband is dying or not?

496
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:57,693
Mother, how could you...

497
00:30:57,693 --> 00:30:59,593
How could you say such a thing?

498
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:00,863
Stray kid I found?

499
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:04,463
What? What? Did I say something wrong?

500
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,063
If you were half as nice to Hyeon Cheol as you are to Pil Sung...

501
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:12,593
I mean, half of half of half as nice to him, I won't be saying this.

502
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:16,293
Mother, Pil Sung is my son.

503
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:19,533
Why do you do this every once in a while?

504
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:25,523
If you say something like that again, I won't live with you anymore.

505
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:27,793
Okay, fine!

506
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:30,263
Fine! I can't live with you, either!

507
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,313
I can't live with you, either! Fine!

508
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:36,443
Yes, kick me out! Kick me out!

509
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:43,053
Aigoo, my poor baby.

510
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:47,243
Aigoo, poor me! Poor me! Gosh.

511
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:51,323
Aigoo, aigoo...

512
00:31:52,022 --> 00:31:54,513
I want to get gifts for the staff members of a drama. 
    

513
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,383
Please recommend something people like these days.

514
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:01,883
How about this one?

515
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:05,713
This is the most popular item for young people.

516
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,713
How nice.

517
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:17,373
Wow, what a touching event.

518
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:19,303
President Gong, thank you so much.

519
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,973
I'll work even harder.

520
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,983
You've been working very hard on the drama.

521
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,043
I wanted to cheer everyone up with these gifts.

522
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:29,033
Fighting!

523
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:31,073
You're the best, President Gong.

524
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:32,533
The best.

525
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,333
Wow, the color is nice, too.

526
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,723
Try putting the jackets on.

527
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:41,543
- The color is so pretty. 
 - It's pretty.

528
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,273
Wow, I know it's for work, but it's nice to be on a deserted island.

529
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:48,223
I know. I can finally breathe.

530
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:50,883
Gosh, the air is nice.

531
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:59,073
- Dae Chung Oppa. 
 - You scared me.

532
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,593
What are you up to?

533
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:04,003
Hey, what if someone hears you?

534
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:06,433
We agreed to keep it a secret on set.

535
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,383
Why did you get so spooked?

536
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:11,313
I came because I saw there was no one around you.

537
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,633
We'll start shooting soon!

538
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,033
We need to do this in one go.

539
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,623
There's heavy winds and waves warning for later.

540
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,633
Let's shoot quickly and leave.

541
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,593
Get ready, Ms. Park!

542
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:24,853
Okay, Director!

543
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,673
See you later.

544
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:29,173
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

545
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,263
Oppa!

546
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:51,353
What are you doing here?

547
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:55,273
You lied to me, saying you like another woman.

548
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:58,383
You wanted to die alone on a deserted island?

549
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:00,093
Leave.

550
00:34:01,593 --> 00:34:04,003
Leave, I said!

551
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:07,613
Go back while I'm letting you go.

552
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,103
No.

553
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:12,983
I'll never leave you alone.

554
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:17,613
I'll never go back alone.

555
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:20,673
I want to just go straight toward you.

556
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,633
Cut, okay. Nice!

557
00:34:35,463 --> 00:34:37,373
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

558
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:39,913
Thank you!

559
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:43,393
I think we need to evacuate because of the warnings about heavy winds and waves!

560
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:46,803
Let's pack up and head to the wharf!

561
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:49,053
- Okay! 
 - We need to leave. Let's go.

562
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,313
Let's hurry up.

563
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:52,893
Gosh, it's so cold.

564
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:56,133
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Let's go!

565
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:58,753
Noona, take this and get on. I'll help them and join you.

566
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:00,883
Okay.

567
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:11,323
Huh? My bag.

568
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:15,913
Geez, I left it there earlier.

569
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,693
I left a bag at the shooting site. I'll be right back.

570
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:20,213
Okay.

571
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,853
My phone.

572
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:43,973
I must've dropped it while taking a photo earlier.

573
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:46,023
You've got to be kidding me.

574
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:52,523
Where was it?

575
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:54,513
It was near here.

576
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,933
Oh, there it is.

577
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,413
This is definitely where I took my last photo.

578
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,413
Where is it?

579
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,023
What?

580
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:25,123
Isn't that our boat?

581
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:28,423
Gosh. No, you can't leave!

582
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:31,353
Hello! Hello!

583
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:33,543
I'm not on board yet!

584
00:36:33,543 --> 00:36:35,263
Jae Dong!

585
00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:37,603
Lee Jae Dong!

586
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:39,823
- Don't leave! 
 - There's someone here!

587
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,203
- Hyung! Stop! 
 - Who's that?

588
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:44,853
Hyung! Hyung! Stop!

589
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:46,342
Oppa.

590
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:48,973
Park Do Ra, what are you doing here?

591
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,073
You didn't get on the boat, either?

592
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:53,318
I-I'll explain that later.

593
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:55,748
Just try calling someone.

594
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:02,443
Do Ra, I ran out of battery.

595
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,993
Call someone right now. Call Jae Dong. Hurry!

596
00:37:04,993 --> 00:37:07,053
I lost my phone, Oppa.

597
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:10,153
I got off the boat because I lost it.

598
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:12,783
What? You've got to be kidding me.

599
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:16,133
Where did you lose your phone? Huh?

600
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,634
- Where could it be— 
 - Think fast!

601
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:21,709
Are you sure it's here? Maybe it's not here.

602
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,589
I think it's here.

603
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,919
Is it not?

604
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,319
You don't even know if it's here or not?

605
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:28,839
Stop getting angry at me.

606
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,109
I can't think because you're angry at me.

607
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:35,049
I'm not angry at you.

608
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:38,579
I'm telling you to think carefully if this is the right place.

609
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:41,409
I think it's here.

610
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,639
Gosh, where's my phone?

611
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,009
Do Ra! It's here! It's here!

612
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:49,489
Do Ra!

613
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:53,599
Jae Dong!

614
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,799
Noona, why aren't you here?

615
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:59,669
Jae Dong, I didn't get on the boat.

616
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:02,569
I'm still on the deserted island.

617
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,809
You were on the boat earlier! Why are you there?

618
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,879
I lost my phone, so I was looking for it.

619
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:12,519
Hey, tell them to turn the boat around. Right now!

620
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,379
Gosh! Hold on, Noona.

621
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:20,119
Ms. Park, what happened?

622
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,229
Let me explain that later.

623
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:24,389
Turn the boat around. Right now.

624
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:27,769
We can't turn around because of the heavy winds and waves warning.

625
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,019
W-What did you say?

626
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,009
What will we do, then?

627
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,399
Ms. Park, calm down and...

628
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,739
What do you mean by "we"? Is someone else there?

629
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:42,819
I'm with Assistant Director Go Pil Sung.

630
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:45,949
Hold on, Director.

631
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:50,199
Hyung, why are you asking so many questions? Just turn around quickly.

632
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,329
Pil Sung, we can't turn around.

633
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,469
It's dangerous because of the heavy winds and waves warning.

634
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:56,859
 The waves are really strong! 

635
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:58,709
What are we supposed to do, then?

636
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:01,039
 We'll be back there tomorrow morning. 

637
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,699
 So hang in there until then. 

638
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:04,779
What did you say?

639
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:09,449
 Pil Sung, it's a relief that you're with Ms. Park. 

640
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:13,219
She would've been so scared on the deserted island alone.

641
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,519
Take good care of her, okay?

642
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,439
I'll hang up!

643
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,459
All right!

644
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,419
Oppa, what do we do?

645
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:31,649
Do Ra, we should avoid the rain. You'll catch a cold at this rate.

646
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:46,259
Why did you come home so early?

647
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,859
Didn't you go out on a date?

648
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,729
Mom, is something going on?

649
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:55,069
You've been on cloud nine for a while.

650
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:57,099
Nothing's going on.

651
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:01,119
It's because I'm old. That's why.

652
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,519
By the way, why did you come home so early?

653
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,949
Didn't you go on a date?

654
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,889
No, I was working at a cafe.

655
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,119
How are things going with that man?

656
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,579
Why haven't I heard about you going on dates lately?

657
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:22,049
Well, t-the thing is...

658
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:24,299
Aigoo, aigoo. Go out. Go out.

659
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,489
Go out and meet up with that man.

660
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:31,399
Stop saying you'd write a silly drama.

661
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:37,569
Right, Myeong Dong. That diamond ring...

662
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:42,529
He said he'll redesign it and give it to you. He hasn't given it to you yet?

663
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,209
Mom.

664
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:48,319
I’ll be honest, I broke up with him.

665
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,889
So, just keep that in mind.

666
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:54,349
W-What? Broke up? Why?

667
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:56,289
What do you mean, why?

668
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,189
He's short and ugly. His personality isn't great, either.

669
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,749
I didn't like him once I started dating him. So I broke up with him.

670
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,989
W-What did you say just now?

671
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,269
"So I broke up with him"?

672
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:10,019
You stupid idiot. Gosh, what's wrong with you?

673
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:12,379
Hey, does being tall bring food to the table?

674
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:14,129
Does a pretty face feed you?

675
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:18,749
Where do you think someone like you could find someone

676
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:21,409
who'd give you a diamond ring like that?

677
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:25,109
W-Why would you reject a jackpot like that?

678
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:28,169
What do you mean by someone like me? What's wrong with me?

679
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,829
Why are you doing this to me now?

680
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:38,899
Gosh.

681
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:45,259
Why are both Hyeon Cheol and Myeong Dong that girl...

682
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:49,429
What's wrong with both of my kids?

683
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:01,649
She scared me.

684
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:04,279
Why did I run into that Noonim again?

685
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:06,659
She scared the crap out of me.

686
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:18,029
Whatever.

687
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:34,109
Should I buy her a handbag, comfort her, and send her off instead?

688
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:38,329
No, we might get tangled up again.

689
00:42:50,962 --> 00:42:55,622
By the way, I don't even know her name or age.

690
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:58,692
Well...

691
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:03,792
she does seem to have a kind of a pretty face.

692
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:08,452
She feels like an aunt for some reason...

693
00:43:10,512 --> 00:43:13,352
I wonder how much older she is than me.

694
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:20,142
What'd be the point of knowing? Huh?

695
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:29,332
- Are you okay, Mr. Go? 
 - Oh, yes.

696
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:33,352
Yes, I'm okay...

697
00:43:45,502 --> 00:43:48,322
Mr. Go! Mr. Go! Mr. Go!

698
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,252
Mr. Go, are you okay?

699
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,322
Call the ambulance. What's going on?

700
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:54,612
Are you okay?

701
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:56,212
   

702
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:58,062
Gosh, Hyeon Cheol.

703
00:43:58,062 --> 00:43:59,842
Mother.

704
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,122
- What do I do? 
 - He's over there.

705
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:06,502
Hyeon Cheol! Aigoo, Hyeon Cheol! Aigoo...

706
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:10,122
Aigoo, Hyeon Cheol! My baby, what's going on?

707
00:44:10,122 --> 00:44:14,832
This is why I told you not to do day labor.

708
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:17,172
Look at your head.

709
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:20,912
Your leg... The bandages. What are we going to do?

710
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:25,242
Mom, I'm okay. I'm not seriously injured. Don't worry. It's okay.

711
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:28,072
How is this okay? How? How?

712
00:44:28,072 --> 00:44:30,712
Honey, what's going on?

713
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:35,702
You said you were working a part-time job. Did you mean construction work?

714
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:39,482
You're too old to be working demanding jobs like this.

715
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:43,862
I didn't even know, and I was happy you were making money.

716
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:47,672
Don't worry, Honey. It's nothing serious. It's okay.

717
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,822
What do you mean it's okay?

718
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:52,472
What do you mean you didn't get seriously injured?

719
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:56,592
You're covered in bandages right now!

720
00:44:56,592 --> 00:45:02,072
Gosh, you're killing me. You're killing me right now.

721
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:05,392
You're killing me.

722
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,522
Mom.

723
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:15,782
I'm already embarrassed to see her face right now.

724
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:17,372
Why are you doing this now?

725
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:20,852
I said I'm okay. Seriously...

726
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,712
Honey, what do you mean by that?

727
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:31,162
Have I ever nagged you to make money?

728
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:34,992
When did I tell you to work hard jobs like this to make money?

729
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:37,982
Seriously. I'm so upset.

730
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:40,022
Gosh, seriously...

731
00:45:40,022 --> 00:45:44,662
Hey, Go Myeong Dong, why are you crying right now?

732
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:47,712
I'm really okay.

733
00:45:55,842 --> 00:45:58,632
Gosh, seriously. Do I answer or not?

734
00:45:59,722 --> 00:46:01,312
   

735
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:12,102
 President Baek, if you don't answer right now, 

736
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,402
 I'll barge into Park Do Ra's shooting location. 

737
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:18,792
What did she say just now? Seriously.

738
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:30,842
Yes, Dong Ho's mom. I was taking a shower.

739
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:34,652
I was all naked. That's why I couldn't answer.

740
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:38,772
By the way, what do you mean you'd barge into Do Ra's shooting location?

741
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:40,522
How could you do this between us?

742
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:42,382
 I heard you paid Ms. Ma back. 

743
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,482
 Why aren't you paying me back my 500 million won? 

744
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:49,722
Just wait a few months. Honey, don't you trust me?

745
00:46:49,722 --> 00:46:51,542
Baek Mi Ja is known for her credibility.

746
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,322
You think I won't pay you back?

747
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:55,782
 Yes, I'm worried you would. 

748
00:46:55,782 --> 00:46:57,812
 I can't trust you anymore. 

749
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:02,522
 I'll talk to your daughter, Park Do Ra, from now on. I warned you. 

750
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:06,222
Well, I'll pay you. I'll pay you, I said.

751
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:08,992
I'll pay you.

752
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,742
Mother, what brings you all the way here?

753
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:14,782
I've got something weighing me down.

754
00:47:14,782 --> 00:47:19,102
I couldn't tell anyone about it, so I came here because I felt frustrated.

755
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:23,612
But I can't talk about it because I feel bad now that I'm seeing your face.

756
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:27,432
Feel free to tell me. I'm all ears.

757
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:32,142
This feels a bit premature,

758
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:36,162
but the moment I saw you, you felt like my family,

759
00:47:36,162 --> 00:47:42,912
and I thought I'd be so happy to have an impressive young man as my son-in-law.

760
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:45,882
I'm so grateful you had such a good impression of me.

761
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:50,882
As long as Do Ra lets me, I want to be your son-in-law even tomorrow.

762
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:54,452
- Do you mean it, President Gong? 
 - Yes.

763
00:47:55,362 --> 00:48:01,622
If so, it is a bit embarrassing, but I'll talk to you like you're my family.

764
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:03,252
Yes, tell me.

765
00:48:03,252 --> 00:48:07,932
I actually made a huge investment without Do Ra knowing.

766
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:10,792
It'd take a while to retrieve the investment money.

767
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:14,722
But the company needs money urgently.

768
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:19,302
I couldn't ask anyone for money because of Do Ra's image.

769
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:21,412
So—

770
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,452
How much do you need?

771
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:27,552
Five hundred million won.

772
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:33,952
Mother,

773
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:39,982
why are you having such a hard time asking me for a mere 500 million?

774
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:42,942
Secretary Jo!

775
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:52,032
   

776
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:55,487
   

777
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:57,737
Five hundred million got deposited immediately.

778
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:01,122
Maybe I should've asked for more had I known.

779
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:05,232
How could Do Ra play hard to get with a man like that?

780
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:13,662
President Gong, I'll make sure to make you my son-in-law.

781
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:27,582
My gosh. My gosh. Look at her.

782
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:31,862
She's going out without even greeting her aunt?

783
00:49:33,632 --> 00:49:37,992
Ma Ri was so rude to me yesterday, and yet she won't even apologize.

784
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:42,752
I lay down with my head wrapped, but she wouldn't check on me once.

785
00:49:42,752 --> 00:49:45,542
What a terrible woman.

786
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:51,022
I'll make sure to get her out of here while I'm here.

787
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:54,832
And I'll bring someone new to this family.

788
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:58,672
I'll make sure to do that before I die. I must.

789
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:00,452
That little...

790
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:03,092
Aigoo.

791
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:04,442
Goodness.

792
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:08,192
Gosh, Ms. Jo. It's been so long.

793
00:50:09,192 --> 00:50:11,552
We should meet up sometime.

794
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:15,160
There's so much I need to tell you about, Ms. Jo.

795
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:18,852
Your niece-in-law is so unbelievable.

796
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:23,442
She always seemed brash and thick-skinned.

797
00:50:23,442 --> 00:50:27,062
What is she so proud of? Seriously...

798
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:29,042
"Always seemed"?

799
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:33,182
Ms. Jo, what do you mean by that?

800
00:50:33,182 --> 00:50:35,992
Have you known my niece-in-law for a long time?

801
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,632
No, it's nothing.

802
00:50:38,632 --> 00:50:43,222
You just talked as if you knew her well.

803
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:46,132
You said she's always been brash and thick-skinned.

804
00:50:46,132 --> 00:50:51,662
My gosh. To be honest, it's not an easy thing to talk about.

805
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:54,582
I feel hesitant to tell you about it.

806
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:57,442
I made a mistake. A mistake.

807
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:02,712
Ms. Jo, if it's about her, you're talking about my family right now.

808
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,812
How could you be like this to me?

809
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,652
Tell me right now.

810
00:51:06,652 --> 00:51:10,382
I won't blame you for anything at all.

811
00:51:10,382 --> 00:51:12,512
Gosh, what do I do?

812
00:51:12,512 --> 00:51:15,172
Hurry, Ms. Jo.

813
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:20,112
You know I once lived in Boston, right?

814
00:51:20,112 --> 00:51:22,752
Boston? Yes, I know.

815
00:51:22,752 --> 00:51:26,062
I had a close friend named Jessica then.

816
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:30,072
We used to frequent each other's houses and stayed close.

817
00:51:30,072 --> 00:51:35,142
At the time, she rented out her annex to a student from Korea.

818
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:38,052
He was a very handsome young man.

819
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:41,572
A student from Korea? And?

820
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:47,992
One day, I visited that house and saw him moving out.

821
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:50,752
He said he'd be living with his girlfriend.

822
00:51:50,752 --> 00:51:54,002
The girlfriend was helping him move,

823
00:51:54,002 --> 00:51:58,692
but I kept looking at them because they were so good-looking.

824
00:51:58,692 --> 00:52:00,892
They were such a handsome couple.

825
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:06,202
My friend told me they'll be getting married soon.

826
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,002
Because the girlfriend got pregnant.

827
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:10,082
My gosh. And?

828
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:15,152
But later, when I returned to Korea,

829
00:52:15,152 --> 00:52:20,532
I almost fainted out of shock at Chairman Gong's wedding.

830
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:24,842
At Jin Taek's wedding?

831
00:52:25,802 --> 00:52:27,422
Why?

832
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:30,002
The bride next to Chairman Gong was

833
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:34,802
that girlfriend who got pregnant and was supposed to marry the student.

834
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:36,972
W-What did you say?

835
00:52:37,832 --> 00:52:39,162
That...

836
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,852
That was my niece-in-law?

837
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:44,412
Y-You mean Ma Ri's mom?

838
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,962
Well, yes.

839
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,282
My gosh. My gosh.

840
00:52:48,282 --> 00:52:52,062
- Gosh, Ms. Gong, are you okay? 
 - Oh, my God!

841
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:56,582
I'm okay. I'm okay.

842
00:52:57,922 --> 00:53:02,532
By the way, why are you telling me something so important only now?

843
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:05,062
How could I bring up something like that?

844
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:08,432
Your niece-in-law was an assemblyman's daughter

845
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:12,682
and Chairman Gong loved her so much and wanted to marry her.

846
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:16,462
And I heard they were living happily together.

847
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:18,112
I didn't want to destroy their marriage.

848
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:22,402
So I just kept it to myself.

849
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:24,822
Hearing your story...

850
00:53:24,822 --> 00:53:27,792
made me so angry. That's why I'm telling you.

851
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,032
- Aigoo, aigoo. My goodness. 
 - Oh, my.

852
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:33,182
- Ms. Gong. 
 - My goodness...

853
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:38,792
- Do Ra. 
 - Huh?

854
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,152
Block the wind.

855
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:41,822
Okay, okay.

856
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:59,482
Do it right, Oppa. There are only two left.

857
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,892
O-Okay, okay.

858
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,332
Hey, Park Do Ra!

859
00:54:15,822 --> 00:54:17,582
I'm sorry. Sorry.

860
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:20,882
- Go away. Stay over there. 
 - Okay.

861
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,902
Take this and block the wind properly.

862
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:26,782
- Hey. 
 - What?

863
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:28,462
This is our last one.

864
00:54:28,462 --> 00:54:31,062
If this fails, too, we're really...

865
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:33,302
Try it. Try it. Do it well. Fighting.

866
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,772
- Please, please. 
 - Fighting.

867
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,832
Fighting! You can do it!

868
00:54:47,592 --> 00:54:51,412
Wow, I feel alive because of the fire.

869
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:54,812
I realized today how precious fire is.

870
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:56,422
I know.

871
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:06,402
By the way, it feels like we're on a camping trip. Don't you think?

872
00:55:12,912 --> 00:55:14,822
Are you hungry?

873
00:55:14,822 --> 00:55:19,802
Yes. I didn't get any food because I was shooting.

874
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:22,042
Hold on a second.

875
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:25,652
I should've left some kimbap.

876
00:55:27,552 --> 00:55:29,002
Thank goodness.

877
00:55:29,002 --> 00:55:30,592
I have some snacks left over from earlier.

878
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:32,752
Eat this, Do Ra.

879
00:55:35,482 --> 00:55:37,412
I'd gain weight if I ate that.

880
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:40,322
It sounds like you aren't hungry enough yet.

881
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:45,702
Let's split this in half, then. You're hungry, too.

882
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:00,302
Here.

883
00:56:08,342 --> 00:56:09,932
Wow.

884
00:56:10,652 --> 00:56:13,442
Wow, this is amazing.

885
00:56:13,442 --> 00:56:16,332
I didn't know how delicious the red bean bun was.

886
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,982
Whenever my mom gave me this as a kid,

887
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:23,382
I always gave it to Do Jun because I didn't like it. It tastes so amazing.

888
00:56:28,062 --> 00:56:30,242
Do Ra, eat this.

889
00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:33,812
Why? You're hungry, too.

890
00:56:33,812 --> 00:56:35,282
I don't like red bean buns.

891
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:39,132
I had indigestion while eating one as a kid. So you eat it.

892
00:56:39,732 --> 00:56:40,912
Really?

893
00:56:40,912 --> 00:56:42,952
Yes, really.

894
00:56:57,822 --> 00:56:59,612
It's so good.

895
00:57:00,202 --> 00:57:02,292
Where is it from?

896
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,942
Hey, hey, Park Do Ra. How could you?

897
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:10,642
How could you not even offer me a bite? How selfish.

898
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:15,952
I'm sorry.

899
00:57:15,952 --> 00:57:18,232
I thought you really didn't like it.

900
00:57:18,232 --> 00:57:19,742
I was kidding.

901
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:22,282
I'm full just watching you enjoy it.

902
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:25,722
Come on.

903
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,332
Here.

904
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,992
W-What's wrong, Do Ra? Are you in pain?

905
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:40,102
What? Is there a bug?

906
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:44,652
It's not that...

907
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,972
Oppa, I need to use the bathroom.

908
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:56,492
Are you in a hurry?

909
00:57:57,802 --> 00:58:00,612
To be honest, I've been holding it since earlier.

910
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:05,842
Just one second. I'll look around a bit.

911
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:22,052
Do Ra, I looked around everywhere.

912
00:58:22,052 --> 00:58:25,282
I think you should go behind the rocks here.

913
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:27,212
I'll be waiting inside.

914
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,890
Take your time using the bathroom, okay?

915
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:33,462
N-No, Oppa. Don't go.

916
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,012
I'm scared.

917
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:40,362
Oh, okay. I'll stay here, then.

918
00:58:55,842 --> 00:58:58,982
Oppa, go a little further.

919
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:01,812
Okay, got it. Got it.

920
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:07,152
Oppa, that's too far away!

921
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:09,902
Okay, got it.

922
00:59:09,902 --> 00:59:12,582
That's too close!

923
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,602
What am I supposed to do—

924
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:20,282
Do Ra, I'll turn around and sing loudly.

925
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:24,310
So don't worry and feel comfortable, okay?

926
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,582
Okay.

Oh, okay. Let's go.

938
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:12,942
You heard everything, didn't you?

939
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:17,662
How could I hear anything because of the wind and the waves? And...

940
01:00:17,662 --> 01:00:20,462
I didn't hear anything else because I was focused on singing.

941
01:00:20,462 --> 01:00:22,972
So don't you worry about a thing.

942
01:00:22,972 --> 01:00:24,502
Let's go.

943
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,572
Oppa.

944
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,152
Oppa!

945
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,382
Oppa!

946
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:52,642
Oppa...

947
01:01:53,662 --> 01:01:55,822
Oppa!

948
01:01:57,222 --> 01:01:59,762
Oppa!

949
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,512
Do Ra! I'm here! Do Ra!

950
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:07,742
Oppa!

951
01:02:07,742 --> 01:02:09,122
Do Ra.

952
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:14,202
Do Ra, what's wrong? What happened? What is it?

953
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:17,752
Where have you been?

954
01:02:17,752 --> 01:02:21,372
Where did you go?

955
01:02:21,372 --> 01:02:25,112
The bathroom. I went to the bathroom, too.

956
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:33,192
I thought you went somewhere, leaving me alone in the haunted house.

957
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:38,432
Don't go to the bathroom without me from now on.

958
01:02:39,892 --> 01:02:42,572
Okay, I won't.

959
01:02:43,442 --> 01:02:47,972
Gosh, you acted tough, but you were a scaredy-cat.

960
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,242
Did you only get older and taller?

961
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:53,032
You're still acting like the 12-year-old from 15 years ago.

962
01:02:53,032 --> 01:02:55,982
I don't know.

963
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,922
The fire went out, too.

964
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:01,782
I was really scared.

965
01:03:05,122 --> 01:03:08,252
I thought a ghost would come out.

966
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:12,212
Seriously. There are no ghosts.

967
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:28,042
Hey, there are no ghosts.

968
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:32,062
Hey, ghost! Come out if you're there!

969
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:35,442
Ghost! See? There's none.

970
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:40,472
Oppa, wait for me.

971
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:19,610


972
01:04:33,032 --> 01:04:40,322
♫  I turn my head and try to deny it  ♫

973
01:04:40,322 --> 01:04:45,992
♫  But it's you in the end  ♫

974
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:53,252
♫  Even if I close my eyes and cover my mouth  ♫

975
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:58,882
♫  It's impossible to fool you  ♫

976
01:04:58,882 --> 01:05:02,472
♫  Even if the world stops me  ♫

977
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:04,312
What's with you?

978
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:10,632
Why are you staring at my face like that?

979
01:05:10,632 --> 01:05:18,402
♫  Just like the waves drawn to the moonlight  ♫

980
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,752
   

981
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:32,992
♫  No matter how much I try to run away  ♫

982
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:38,362
♫  Even at night when there's no light  ♫

983
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:44,282
♫  You always find me like this  ♫

984
01:05:44,282 --> 01:05:51,162
♫  Even if I denied a thousand times  ♫

985
01:05:51,162 --> 01:05:54,772
♫  In the end, I'll choose you  ♫

986
01:05:54,772 --> 01:05:56,852
 Might as well try dating President Gong. 

987
01:05:56,852 --> 01:06:00,322
 It's not because he sent the necklace. He really is a good person. 

988
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:02,862
 We have money. Why accept this? Send it back immediately. 

989
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:05,202
 You know Park Do Ra, right? Park Do Ra. 

990
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:07,792
 This is Ms. Park Do Ra's phone, right? I'm... 

991
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:10,782
 Oppa, do you have a girlfriend, by the way? 

992
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:14,472
 Why do I keep thinking of Pil Sung? Why? 

993
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:17,082
 He seems like a nice fellow. 

994
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:18,702
 The more I see him, the more I like him. 

995
01:06:18,702 --> 01:06:21,532
 If she gave birth, then what did she do with the baby? 

996
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:23,852
 Talk to me first if you're having a hard time, Dad. 

997
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:27,052
 Don't forget you have your son, Go Pil Sung, behind your back. 

998
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:29,002
 Don't die, Oppa! 

999
01:06:29,002 --> 01:06:32,052
 Wake up, Oppa!
