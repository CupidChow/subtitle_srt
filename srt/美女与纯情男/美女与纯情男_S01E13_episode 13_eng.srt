1
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,910
My gosh, is that the assistant director?

2
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,820
Oh, my.

3
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,420
That's...

4
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,240
Isn't that Go Dae Chung?

5
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,570
Hey!

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,910
You're that bastard, aren't you?

7
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,910
You're the Go Dae Chung from back then, right?

8
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,870
Hello.

9
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,300
- Well— 
 - Hey, why are you with him?

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,890
Why are you with a bastard like him?

11
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,370
Mom, Mom, l-let me explain. Let's go in.

12
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,780
Let go, let go!

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,570
Hey, you tell me.

14
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,690
Why are you with my Do Ra? What are you plotting?

15
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,480
How did you trick her that she's with you?

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,580
You approached her on purpose, didn't you?

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,800
Wow, I won't let this one slide. You're dead today!

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,380
Mom, why are you doing this to Pil Sung?

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,210
We're outside. People can see us.

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,590
Let go, let go. Let's go, let's go!

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,450
- Hey, you— 
 - Talk to me! Talk to me!

22
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,690
- You bastard! Hey! You're dead! 
 - Mom, talk to me inside!

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,180
- Let go! 
 - Come inside!

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
I won't forgive that bastard. 
    

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,560
- Let go! Let go! 
 - Please, Mom!

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,550
Hey! Hey!

27
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,990
Do you know who that bastard is?

28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,690
He's not Go Pil Sung but Dae Chung. That family's adopted kid.

29
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,840
Why are you kissing him? Out on the streets?

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,460
Do you want to destroy your career?

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,120
Mom, I know Pil Sung is Dae Chung.

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,750
And I'm dating him.

33
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,790
So, you'd better not be rude to him.

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,710
Pil Sung Oppa is my boyfriend.

35
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,520
What did you say just now? Boyfriend?

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,030
Wow, she's out of her mind. You're crazy!

37
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,860
What are you lacking that you'd date someone like him?

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,810
How could you get seduced by someone like him?

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,910
Hey, break up right now. Break up. Go, go, go!

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,670
Mom, that's enough!

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,450
I'm not a child. Don't tell me what to do.

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,010
Do I still look like a kid who listens to everything you say?

43
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,470
What did you say?

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,270
We're dating because I liked him first.

45
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,000
It's none of your business whom I decide to date!

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,910
It's my life!

47
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,490
Wow, how could she look at her mom like that?

48
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,970
Wow, she's out of her mind! She's really crazy.

49
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,600
What do I do? What to do? What will I do?

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,120
What do I do with her?

51
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,400
She's driving me crazy.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,480
What's wrong with her?

53
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:34,000


54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,450
Hey, Do Ra.

55
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,400
Oppa, my mom must've surprised you earlier.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,330
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,340
I'm okay. Are you okay?

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
She looked very angry.

59
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,580
I guess she's shocked because she suddenly found out about us.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,060
But don't worry. I'll make sure you don't have to worry about her.

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,890
Okay. No problem.

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,840
Oppa, forget everything she said earlier.

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,820
Okay?

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,010
Okay. Don't worry about me.

65
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,560
You must be tired. Get some rest.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,050
Oppa, I'll call you as soon as I'm off work tomorrow.

67
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,640
Okay.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,970
It's time to sleep. What's going on?

69
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,940
Auntie, I'm so curious I could die.

70
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:57,450
If we find Soo Yeon's ex, will the fate of our family change?

71
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,920
What will you do by finding her ex?

72
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,010
Can't you just get everything off your chest?

73
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,940
Are you worried she still might be seeing him secretly, by chance?

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,690
No, it's not like that.

75
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,810
What else is it, then?

76
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,080
I need to know to help you better.

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,910
And I need to know if our family's fate depends on it.

78
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,460
Please, Auntie?

79
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,080
You'd better take this to your grave, then.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,660
Of course. I promised to live for you.

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,900
So Yeon had a child with that man

82
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,670
and she tried to marry him, too.

83
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,670
Pardon?

84
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,470
They had a child?

85
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,160
I-Is that true?

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
Ms. Jo, who told me about it, it died. So, there was no evidence.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,710
But since you found the man she used to date,

88
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,760
it seems like it's true.

89
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,200
If we find that Kim Seong Soo, we'll know if she really had that baby,

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,210
and what they did with that child.

91
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,600
And if they're still in touch, Jin Taek won't tolerate it. Will he?

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,120
Of course not. He'd probably kick her out.

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,040
That's why I'm looking for him.

94
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,840
He needs to find someone new and continue the family's bloodline somehow.

95
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,180
My gosh, what's with all this?

96
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,910
 If what she said is true, Soo Yeon is such a cunning thing. 

97
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,260
 How could she be so shameless in hiding a past like that? 

98
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,130
 She acts superior with an innocent face of hers. 

99
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,910
 Gosh, what a sly little thing. 

100
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:06,330
Go get Seon Yeong's favorite doughnuts and humor her or something.

101
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,170
She's probably hungry now.

102
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,960
I got her some yesterday, but she didn't even look at them.

103
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,830
She doesn't even want to look at the doughnuts I got her.

104
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,420
Gosh, when will she stop being angry?

105
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm on pins and needles these days.

106
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,250
Hey, why are you so slow?

107
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,590
How will we finish this today?

108
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,340
Were you always fast?

109
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,700
Hey! You can't do it like that.

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,170
You need to put it where it belongs.

111
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,430
They'll say it's defective. Seriously.

112
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,450
It's your fault. You told me to do it fast.

113
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,740
Fighting again?

114
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,470
Hey, come and sew these, too.

115
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,590
- I don't want to. You do it. 
  - Go Dae Chung! Go Dae Chung! 

116
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,260
You son of a bitch! Where is he?

117
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,170
Where is that son of a bitch?

118
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,020
- What's going on? 
 - Come out!

119
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,270
- Where's Go Dae Chung? 
 - Look at this woman!

120
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,200
- Where's Go Dae Chung? 
 - Are you out of your mind?

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,710
How dare you barge into our house at night and scream like this?

122
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,540
- What are you doing right now? 
 - Don't you know why?

123
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,650
At least, I found out now.

124
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,980
What are you trying to pull using your son?

125
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,540
Is this why you gave me 50 million back?

126
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,920
How dare he go after my Do Ra?

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,320
I know you made him seduce her. You're all in on this!

128
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,520
Do you... Do you think I don't know?

129
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,660
You must not have an ounce of conscience.

130
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,750
How dare you barge in and cause a scene at night?

131
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,580
Did you tell him to do that? Or did his grandma?

132
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,710
Did you tell him to seduce my Do Ra?

133
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,650
Wow, seriously. How could you possibly be this shameless?

134
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,530
Do you think I'd just let this slide?

135
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,360
How dare you talk nonsense here?

136
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,530
Why would my son date the daughter of someone like you?

137
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,280
- Huh? 
 - Get out right now!

138
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,150
- Get out right now! 
 - Okay, let go!

139
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,890
- Go Dae Chung! 
 - Gosh, Pil Sung.

140
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,540
- You! 
 - Yes, I'm glad you're here.

141
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,620
This woman is saying you're dating her daughter, Park Do Ra.

142
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,820
Pil Sung, that's not true, right?

143
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,710
Hey, Go Dae Chung! You'd better be honest.

144
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,530
Why did you approach my daughter?

145
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,090
Who told you to? You did that on purpose, right?

146
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:22,230
Hey! I saw you with my own eye. Will you really deny it?

147
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,890
Pil Sung, t-that's not true, right?

148
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,730
She's talking nonsense right now.

149
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,630
Why... Why can't you say it's not true?

150
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,810
I'm sorry, Mom.

151
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,650
It's true that I'm dating Do Ra.

152
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,940
What?

153
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,960
What did you say?

154
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,840
Y-You're dating whom?

155
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,410
Pil Sung,

156
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,020
Park Do Ra is that woman's daughter.

157
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,780
You know what kind of woman she is.

158
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,750
But you're dating her daughter?

159
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,890
Yes.

160
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,840
My goodness...

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,810
Go Dae Chung, listen carefully.

162
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:24,130
If you see Do Ra one more time, I won't forgive you, okay?

163
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,030
I'll flip this house upside down, okay?

164
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,860
Okay, please leave. Leave.

165
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,050
Do you think we like your daughter?

166
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,410
You'd better watch your son carefully, okay?

167
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,330
You people...

168
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,420
My gosh, w-what's going on here...

169
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,000
- Mom. 
 - Gosh.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,700
Pil Sung.

171
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Pil Sung, why her...

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,180
Why that woman's daughter?

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,530
Of all people, it had to be her daughter?

174
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,630
You know what she did. How could you date her daughter?

175
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,380
How... How could you?

176
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm sorry, Mom.

177
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,980
Pil Sung...

178
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,980
Honey. Honey, are you okay? Honey.

179
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
Unni, drink some water.

180
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,130
Yes, drink this.

181
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,280
My Pil Sung...

182
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,270
How could he...

183
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,050
There's no way he'd do this.

184
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,050
How...

185
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,100
They say no good deed goes unpunished.

186
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,130
It can't be more relevant.

187
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,450
He wouldn't have liked Do Ra if he were your biological son.

188
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,350
Because he's not blood-related, he's dating the daughter of that enemy,

189
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,420
gold digger who killed his grandfather. That's why he's doing this.

190
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,630
No wonder. It's because we raised an abandoned baby.

191
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,440
What are you saying? Are you crazy?

192
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,840
Mother, I begged you to stop saying that.

193
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,770
Why do you keep bringing that up?

194
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,300
Mother, I can't live in the same house with you if you say that again.

195
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,850
W-What did you say?

196
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,640
How could you be so harsh?

197
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,310
You can't live with her just because she said the wrong thing?

198
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,090
Who's being harsh right now?

199
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,070
Pil Sung is my son.

200
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,960
He's my son I gave birth to.

201
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,110
Why does she always say he's not mine?

202
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,850
How could I live with her when she keeps saying stuff like that?

203
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,260
Seriously, you're going way too far.

204
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,440
You always tell her to move out and say you can't live with her.

205
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,300
Do you have to show off that you own this house?

206
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,900
Yes, let me make this clear.

207
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,830
If anyone says stuff like that about Pil Sung again,

208
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,260
everything will be over. I'm done!

209
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,400
- Unni. 
 - Seriously!

210
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,030
Yes, let's end it. Let's.

211
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,420
Let's break up. Break up!

212
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,240
No, no. I'll move out.

213
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,890
I'll move out, okay? I'll move out.

214
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,060
Seriously. Why are you all doing this?

215
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,240
Don't you care about Unni at all?

216
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,310
She's already upset about Pil Sung right now.

217
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,950
 You're my son. 

218
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,350
 You come from my heart. Right here. 

219
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,540
 No, my dad didn't die! 

220
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,490
 He didn't die! 

221
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,110
 Bring him back to life! Bring him back! 

222
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,270
Oppa, this place is so nice. And there's no one around.

223
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,110
Did you find this place while location hunting, too?

224
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,680
I love it here.

225
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,110
Oppa, what's our date course today?

226
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,080
Walking in the forest?

227
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,660
Do Ra.

228
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,360
What?

229
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,810
Why are you calling my name so seriously?

230
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,950
What will you tell me now?

231
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,640
Is it because of my mom?

232
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,730
I told you not to worry.

233
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,270
I've been so happy being with you.

234
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,790
But I think this is it for us.

235
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,190
I think we should...

236
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,590
break up now.

237
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,880
Oppa.

238
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,770
What do you mean by that?

239
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,120
Break up?

240
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,490
We just started dating, but you want to break up?

241
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,770
How could you say that so easily?

242
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,720
Oppa, you didn't mean it like that, right?

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm not saying this easily.

244
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,290
I thought about it a lot.

245
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,430
Yes, it's true my mom was too rude to you.

246
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,200
But you can't suggest we break up for that.

247
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,700
Oppa, I'll make sure that doesn't happen again. Okay?

248
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,040
Did you run into my mom again, by chance?

249
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,750
Did she say something to you again?

250
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,980
I had a wake-up call after I saw your mom.

251
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,700
We aren't supposed to be together.

252
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,230
And I haven't been showing it all this time.

253
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,180
Honestly, the way people stare at us has been bothering me.

254
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,960
I found it stressful and uncomfortable.

255
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,750
I don't want to sustain such a stressful and uncomfortable relationship.

256
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,090
Oppa.

257
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,260
I should've been more firm and not dated you.

258
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,490
I made a rash decision.

259
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,820
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

260
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,240
But we still like each other.

261
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,620
That's true, so we can overcome it with our feelings for each other.

262
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,100
No.

263
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,390
I want to stop now.

264
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,580
Thank you for everything.

265
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,550
I'll get going now.

266
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,680
Oppa. Oppa!

267
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,860
Oppa. Oppa!

268
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,770
Oppa, hold on.

269
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,760
Oppa, talk to me for a second.

270
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,450
Oppa!

271
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,650
But still.

272
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,950
What's wrong with him?

273
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,740
Mom, I'm back.

274
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,740
Where did you sleep last night?

275
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,120
You didn't come home.

276
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,450
I slept in the broadcasting station's night duty room.

277
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,820
How about breakfast? Have you eaten?

278
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,660
Mom...

279
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,610
I broke up with Do Ra.

280
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,370
Pil Sung, but...

281
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,220
why did you do that?

282
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,650
I still...

283
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,820
can't believe you were with her.

284
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,680
I tried not to at first,

285
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,000
but I started liking her without realizing it.

286
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,670
I know I shouldn't have.

287
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,570
I shouldn't have liked her out of all people,

288
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,170
but I made a mistake. I did the wrong thing.

289
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,550
Mom.

290
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,360
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,040
I really didn't want to break your heart,

292
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,690
but I ended up doing that.

293
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,440
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,510
I'm sorry, Mom.

295
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,350
Yes, thank you for saying that to me.

296
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,590
Mom, I need to tend to something.

297
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,680
I'll be back.

298
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,370
Geez, seriously.

299
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,350
He should've gotten the message since I made it clear, right? That jerk.

300
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,760
He'd better not cling to her again. I won't forgive him.

301
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,380
Mom.

302
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,190
Mom, did you see Pil Sung, by chance?

303
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,000
Gosh, what are you talking about? Why would I see him? Why?

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,560
Did he say he did?

305
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,290
You've got to be kidding me.

306
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,970
Mom, be honest with me.

307
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,210
Why would he break up with me if you did nothing?

308
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,000
Did he break up with you?

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,410
He finally understands his place.

310
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,430
That's good. Might as well end things cleanly.

311
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,800
Did you... Did you really not see him?

312
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,380
I said I didn't!

313
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,870
Seriously. It's a relief that he understood his place and broke up with you.

314
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,780
What if people find out you're with someone like him?

315
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,070
How would that be good for you?

316
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,980
Just be glad it ended now.

317
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,930
And you have to strike while the iron is hot.

318
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,160
Only focus on work for now. Don't think about him. Okay?

319
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,560
I'm glad. I'm really glad.

320
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,110
How did you end up with someone like him? My gosh!

321
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,550
If it wasn't her, why would he suddenly...

322
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,750
There must be another reason.

323
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,300
 The customer is not available at the moment. 

324
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,350
 Please try calling again later. 

325
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,370
He's blocking my calls, too.

326
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,680
Is he really trying to break up with me?

327
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,640
She was in shock because of the 50 million won, and now it's Pil Sung.

328
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,890
Seon Yeong is the pillar of our family.

329
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,400
I should give her this to cheer her up.

330
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,010
She really loves melons.

331
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,360
Aigoo, it smells good.

332
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,450
Who's that? Isn't...

333
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,910
Isn't that the gold digger's daughter?

334
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,570
Hey.

335
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,260
Hello.

336
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,350
Why are the mother and daughter coming here back to back?

337
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,280
Hey, I'm not well because of you and your mom.

338
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,320
And why did you think you could come here?

339
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,860
Flipping out last night wasn't good enough?

340
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,690
My mom came over here?

341
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,320
Yes, she barged into our house with her shoes on

342
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,850
and flipped out about Pil Sung dating you.

343
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,980
So, how could you come here?

344
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,090
Did you both throw a sense of shame out the window?

345
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,060
Hey, get out of here. Leave, leave.

346
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,260
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,750
Is Pil Sung Oppa inside, by chance?

348
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,210
I can't reach him.

349
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,420
Why would you look for him here?

350
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,590
Will you make your mom barge in with her shoes on again?

351
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,780
And you and Pil Sung can never be together, no matter what.

352
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,810
His grandfather passed away because of your mom.

353
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,330
Do you think you could be with him?

354
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,150
Dream on!

355
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,720
How could we see the enemy's daughter?

356
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,240
We could never see you. We won't!

357
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,690
What...

358
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,010
What are you talking about?

359
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,550
His grandfather passed away because of my mom?

360
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,240
Mom!

361
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,730
Gosh, you scared me!

362
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,080
Why are you yelling? What's wrong?

363
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,800
Is it true Pil Sung Oppa's grandfather passed away because of you?

364
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,830
I heard he passed out and died because of you.

365
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,740
What did you say?

366
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,960
Mom, I've actually been curious about why we ran away at night, then.

367
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,740
Is it because he passed away because of you, then?

368
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,990
Mom, did you...

369
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,180
Did you really become a gold digger with him?

370
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,230
Who said that? Who?

371
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,010
That's all a lie. It's a lie.

372
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,030
Mom, I heard everything! Everything!

373
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,680
Did you do that or not?

374
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,950
How dare you do this to me after hearing what someone else said?

375
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,560
Did you do that or not? Answer me!

376
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,670
Fine.

377
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,990
Yes. I did.

378
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,600
I was trying to survive.

379
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,250
Should I have jumped into the Han River with the three of you?

380
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,740
The debt collectors were chasing me after your father died.

381
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,330
You would've all been dead if I didn't do that. We would've all been dead.

382
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,270
You couldn't have come this far, either.

383
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,040
But how could you do this to me?

384
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,170
Everyone else can criticize me, but not you.

385
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,250
Don't you know how I lived with you?

386
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,090
How could you do this to me after everything I've gone through?

387
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,510
But still.

388
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,030
How could you toy with someone's heart like that?

389
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,740
Did I kill him on purpose?

390
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,850
He just dropped dead on his own.

391
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,290
I didn't think that'd happen, but... I've done enough, too.

392
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,980
I paid them back, including the interest.

393
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,050
But they say they don't want it. What am I supposed to do?

394
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,510
Mom, how could you...

395
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,540
Do you still not understand what you've done to him?

396
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,480
You little bitch! Seriously!

397
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,870
How dare you do this to me? How dare you?

398
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,470
Who do you think I did that for? Huh?

399
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,520
 Do Ra, wake up! Wake up! 

400
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,940
 What's wrong? 

401
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,650
 Pack your stuff. Pack your stuff right now. 

402
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,300
 We need to get out of this house. 

403
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,390
 What are you doing, Do Ra? Pack your stuff! 

404
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,330
 How dare you come here? 

405
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,020
 I don't want to see you and your family. I hate to even hear your voice. 

406
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,520
 Don't ever come back here. 

407
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,530
 I'm so sick of you and your family. 

408
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,700
 Go now. Never come back again. 

409
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,070
 Hello? 

410
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,990
 Is anyone home? 

411
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,860
Hello.

412
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,020
What are you doing here?

413
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,400
I heard you and Pil Sung split.

414
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,330
You don't have to see each other anymore.

415
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,020
Go now. And don't ever come back here again.

416
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,190
Hey, what are you... What are you trying to pull here?

417
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,130
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,830
I just found out that your father passed because of my mom.

419
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm so sorry.

420
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,400
I would've come sooner if I had known, but I had no idea.

421
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,580
I'm so sorry.

422
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,920
I apologize on behalf of my mother.

423
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,730
I'm so sorry.

424
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,540
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

425
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,830
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,860
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

428
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,890
Do Ra...

429
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,670
w-what are you doing here...

430
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,500
Oppa, I just found out everything.

431
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,260
The reason you rejected me at first,

432
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,290
and the reason you broke up with me.

433
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,890
Why didn't you tell me?

434
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,470
Why...

435
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,930
Why did you suffer alone?

436
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,060
No, you did nothing wrong. It's all my mom's fault.

437
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,690
I'm so sorry, Oppa.

438
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,720
My mom hurt your family too much.

439
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:28,560
Me apologizing won't heal that wound,

440
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,010
but I'm so sorry.

441
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,210
I'm so sorry that...

442
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,350
"sorry" is all I can say.

443
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,510
Didn't we finish talking last time?

444
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,570
We agreed not to meet again.

445
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,070
I'm not here for coffee this time.

446
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,870
I'll keep my promise not to see you.

447
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,830
What is it, then...

448
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,960
This purse. I bought it for you.

449
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,430
I can't either throw it away, keep it, or give it to another woman.

450
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,710
So what I'm saying is... it was always yours. Do whatever you want.

451
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,950
Throw it away, grill it, or steam it. Here.

452
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,310
Well, Noonim,

453
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,560
be happy.

454
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,090
Yes.

455
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,700
I'll enjoy this purse.

456
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,820
Bye, you piece of trash.

457
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,310
Let's not see each other ever again.

458
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,820
   

459
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,700
Let's switch the device this time.

460
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,020
President Gong, we have no choice this time because

461
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,450
we signed the contract with her during "Straightforward Romance,"

462
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,650
but don't renew the contract after it expires, okay?

463
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,620
Mom, this is business.

464
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,830
How could you say that when the sales skyrocketed after working with her?

465
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,600
You run a store yourself.

466
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,650
That's true, but...

467
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,320
Yes, I admit that.

468
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,650
But I don't like her. So get someone else.

469
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,240
Someone more refreshing than her.

470
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,810
Mom, I'll manage the business as the CEO.

471
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,540
Who made you the CEO?

472
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,870
Hello.

473
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,620
I'm a huge fan.

474
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,250
Thank you.

475
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,120
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

476
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,340
Unni. 
    

477
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,810
- I'll read it. 
 - Thank you.

478
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,980
- Thank you. 
 - See you next time. Bye.

479
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,350
Noona, I'm back. Hak Shin is here.

480
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,570
- See you. 
 - Yes, see you.

481
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,120
You worked hard today.

482
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,220
Thanks to you, we promoted our products a lot.

483
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,880
Thank you.

484
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,660
I'll get going now.

485
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,170
I'm so sorry about the afterparty.

486
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,300
I unintentionally put you in a difficult position.

487
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,180
Let me finally apologize properly.

488
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,460
It's all in the past.

489
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,440
Take care.

490
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:32,660
 Change her mind and put her in front of me in a month. 

491
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,030
 Otherwise, I'll make sure your daughter, Park Do Ra 

492
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,960
 loses her career, so she disappears from the industry forever. 

493
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,860
What do I do?

494
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,020
The deadline President Gong gave me is approaching.

495
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,770
   

496
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,050
Why is he calling now? He's scaring me.

497
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,830
Hello, President Gong.

498
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,660
You weren't at Ms. Park's signing event today.

499
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,520
It was an important event.

500
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,550
Oh, did it go well?

501
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,650
I didn't mean to miss it on purpose.

502
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,550
I had a very important plan today.

503
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,300
The event ended successfully.

504
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,540
By the way, how are things going?

505
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,890
There isn't much time left.

506
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:24,890
Park Do Ra was way too impersonal to me today.

507
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,290
There seems to be no progress.

508
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,460
Please wait a bit.

509
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,710
Do Ra's too busy with commercials and casting requests these days.

510
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,830
I'll plan a meeting with you soon.

511
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,460
I'll change her mind, no matter what. Don't worry.

512
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,100
 I'll count on you one more time. 

513
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,300
Of course, of course.

514
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,920
But I think I need to tell you this.

515
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,010
I don't say things lightly.

516
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,770
Keep that in mind.

517
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,670
 I'll hang up, then. 

518
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,610
He's basically the Grim Reaper.

519
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,760
Why is he so good at torturing me?

520
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,430
By the way, how do I persuade Do Ra?

521
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,950
Will she open up since she's no longer with him?

522
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,750
Why aren't you eating?

523
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,850
Would you like it to go?

524
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,740
No.

525
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,900
   

526
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,180
Did you come here alone?

527
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,890
Huh?

528
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,490
Yes.

529
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,210
I suddenly craved tteokbokki.

530
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,720
I'll get going.

531
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,710
No, Oppa, that was a lie.

532
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:59,590
♫  I turn my head and try to deny it  ♫

533
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,890
I came here because I missed you.

534
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,770
I thought I might see you passing by or something.

535
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,830
That's why I came here.

536
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:27,140
♫  Just like the waves drawn to the moonlight  ♫

537
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,350
♫  But it's you in the end  ♫

538
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,860
I'm sorry.

539
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,170
I can't be like this.

540
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,760
I'll get going.

541
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,120
♫  At night, when there's no light  ♫

542
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,980
♫  You always find me like this  ♫

543
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:59,910
♫  Even if I denied a thousand times  ♫

544
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:07,280
♫  In the end, I'll choose you  ♫

545
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,510
 Oppa, should we get soju? 

546
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:19,688
♫  I can't hide my feelings  ♫

547
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:27,048
♫  I choose you  ♫

548
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:46,999
Son. Gosh.

549
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:51,119
Why did you come home so late?

550
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,719
Mom, did you stay up waiting for me?

551
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:59,229
I was worried because you weren't home even though it was late.

552
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:01,559
Mom, why wait for me when I'm this old?

553
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:04,419
Of course, I can come home safely.

554
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:08,639
You drank a lot.

555
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,859
Why did you drink so much?

556
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,089
We had a team dinner.

557
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,049
We congratulated everyone since "Straightforward Romance" was a hit.

558
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,579
The director gave us his card, too.

559
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,339
I was in a good mood, so I drank.

560
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:28,779
Mom, I'm so happy today.

561
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:31,969
I'll go to bed now.

562
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:34,239
Good night, Mom.

563
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,639
Hey, hey, Pil Sung.

564
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,330
Pil Sung, drink this...

565
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,550
Pil Sung.

566
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,400
Are you crying?

567
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,580
No, why would I cry? Come on, Mom.

568
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,370
Pil Sung...

569
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,660
Mom.

570
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,060
This is sweat. Sweat.

571
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,220
They're not tears.

572
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,830
Mom, my eyes get sweaty when I'm drunk.

573
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,970
Why would you say I'm crying?

574
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,670
Can't you tell sweat apart from tears?

575
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,870
Mom, I'll sleep now.

576
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,990
So you should go to bed, too.

577
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,090
 You came, my Seon Yeong. 

578
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,280
Long time no see, Dad.

579
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,840
It's been too long, hasn't it?

580
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,520
So what if you can't come?

581
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,570
I'm always by your side.

582
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,910
You already know...

583
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,720
why I came today, right?

584
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,210
Dad.

585
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,710
I still hate that woman enough to want to kill her.

586
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,550
I can't forgive her.

587
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:26,550
Seon Yeong, why are you still like this? Let it go.

588
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,420
I said I'm okay.

589
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,200
My daughter...

590
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,960
Don't hold anger in your heart.

591
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,320
But Dad...

592
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,560
what do we do with Pil Sung?

593
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,410
I don't want to see him hurting.

594
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,830
It's hard for me to see that, Dad.

595
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,040
I felt the same way.

596
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,000
Whenever you were hurting, I hurt more.

597
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,300
I'm sorry, Dad.

598
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,260
I'm sorry, Dad.

599
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,860
I'm sorry.

600
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,630
You said you've seen our Ma Ri?

601
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,360
Yes.

602
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,740
I attended your company's anniversary event with my father last year.

603
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,100
That's when I saw her.

604
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,720
Is that right?

605
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,260
Yes.

606
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,640
And although it was very brief, I got to talk to her, too.

607
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,860
Gosh, with Ma Ri?

608
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,990
Yes. We happened to talk about the weather.

609
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,100
It was very fun. I liked it.

610
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,160
But I'm not sure if she'd remember.

611
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,780
But our Ma Ri...

612
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,170
You know she's different than other young ladies, right?

613
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:15,000
But you still remember her fondly, and you want to see her.

614
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,880
- Thank you. 
 - Not at all.

615
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,880
I found her way more pure,

616
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,470
honest, and pretty than any other woman.

617
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,970
And both my father and I have...

618
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:37,120
always respected you, Chairman Gong.

619
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,800
It'd be a huge honor if I joined your family.

620
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,350
Blind date? Sounds good. What's he like?

621
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,830
There's a CEO I'm close with. It's his son.

622
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,770
Sounds good. I'll go. I've wanted to have a boyfriend, too.

623
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,410
By the way, Ma Ri, he's a lot older than you.

624
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,960
How old is he?

625
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,230
He's slightly old, but it's okay.

626
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:16,470
Wouldn't someone like an older brother be better since you're an only child?

627
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,840
I suppose.

628
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,490
I'd like someone like an older brother, too.

629
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,660
Pil Sung, over here.

630
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,520
What brings you to the broadcasting station?

631
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,820
What is it? Did you want to have a date with me?

632
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,170
But unfortunately, I have a meeting later.

633
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,120
What is it? Is something going on?

634
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,480
No, not at all.

635
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:49,660
I'm on my way back from Grandfather's grave.

636
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,320
Grandfather's grave? By yourself?

637
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,900
Pil Sung.

638
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,830
Go ahead and date Do Ra.

639
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,830
I approve of the two of you.

640
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,760
Your dad will approve once I do.

641
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,990
What's wrong, Mom?

642
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,630
I said I broke up with her.

643
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,100
I was wrong.

644
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,110
I didn't think about your pain and only thought about myself.

645
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:33,400
I don't want you to feel hurt from breaking up with someone you like.

646
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,300
I don't want to see you hurting.

647
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,210
No, Mom.

648
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,040
I'm okay. I'm really okay.

649
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,380
I know you like Do Ra a lot.

650
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,600
She likes you a lot, too.

651
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:56,990
Pil Sung, Do Ra did nothing wrong to us.

652
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,070
She didn't do anything wrong.

653
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,530
I told Grandpa, too.

654
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,850
I'm sure he'd be happy, too.

655
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,930
Mom.

656
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,430
Do Ra and I are over already.

657
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,390
Don't bring that up anymore.

658
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,480
And Mom, I'm really okay.

659
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,860
I've already forgotten about her.

660
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,980
I need to go to the meeting now, Mom.

661
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,750
See you at home.

662
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,740
 I apologize on behalf of my mother. 

663
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,660
 I'll get going. 

664
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,330
 No, why would I cry? Come on, Mom. 

665
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,710
   

666
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,580
Ahjumma, I'm here.

667
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,690
 Do Ra, Pil Sung will be there soon. 

668
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,190
Pardon?

669
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,540
What do you mean?

670
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,790
I approve of the two of you seeing each other.

671
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,340
So get back together.

672
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,040
Ahjumma.

673
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:02,210
So, you two enjoy your date. Okay?

674
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,550
Yes, where are you, Mom? I'm here.

675
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,550
 Pil Sung, Do Ra will be there. 

676
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,340
What do you mean...

677
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,770
 Eat something tasty, and have a fun date. 

678
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,880
 Fighting, my son. 

679
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,680
Do Ra.

680
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,820
Gosh, my head...

681
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,620
 I'll count on you one more time. 

682
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,020
 But I think I need to tell you this. 

683
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,380
 I don't say things lightly. Keep that in mind. 

684
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,160
I need to change Do Ra's mind somehow.

685
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,460
I can't even swallow pills anymore.

686
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,600
My goodness.

687
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,820
Gosh, my head...

688
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:50,590
- Mom, I'm home. 
 - Do Ra, Do Ra, let's talk.

689
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,970
Later, Mom. Let's talk about work tomorrow.

690
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,790
Do Ra, please meet President Gong one more time.

691
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,550
I'm begging you. Please.

692
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,270
Mom, are you talking about him again?

693
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:07,480
Well, I know he has a short temper.

694
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,400
But he was like that because he likes you. So, Do Ra—

695
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,200
Mom, I'm getting back together with Pil Sung Oppa.

696
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,200
So, please don't do this.

697
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,250
What? What did you just say?

698
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:24,600
So, don't ever bring up President Gong again.

699
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,900
I really hate him. I seriously hate him.

700
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,390
Wow, you really are out of your mind.

701
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,100
You seriously lost your mind!

702
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,770
You broke up with that bastard.

703
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,920
What kind of bull crap is this?

704
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,720
You hate someone like President Gong, but why does it have to be him?

705
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,120
Why that family... Seriously! I won't forgive those people.

706
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,930
I won't forgive that bastard! Seriously!

707
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,720
Yes, go ahead. Do whatever you want.

708
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,780
Instead, I'll retire if you act like this.

709
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,280
I'll give up on acting and move to the US with Pil Sung.

710
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,800
You'll never see me again, then. Okay?

711
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,140
What did you say just now? Retire?

712
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,170
Whoa, that little. She's not bluffing.

713
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,550
She might retire and move to the US if she flips out.

714
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,540
She's more than capable of that.

715
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,120
Do Ra, Do Ra...

716
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,310
Do Ra?

717
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,300
Do Ra, do whatever you want. It's okay.

718
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,500
Whether it's Go Pil Sung or Go Dae Chung,

719
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,310
don't let people find out you're seeing him.

720
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:42,050
You'll become dirt cheap if people find out about it, okay?

721
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,060
What do I tell President Gong? What do I do?

722
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,550
What do I do?

723
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,390
Whoa, what a life I have. Gosh... What do I do?

724
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,700
What do I do?

725
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,400
   

726
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,200
Well, here.

727
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,780
   

728
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,550
What's this?

729
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:10,850
It's the 500 million won I borrowed last time.

730
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:17,150
President Gong, I'm so sorry.

731
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,240
You're...

732
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,610
sorry?

733
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:26,600
President Gong, you know I liked you a lot, right?

734
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,200
That's why I wanted you so badly.

735
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,920
I still feel the same way.

736
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,550
But they say you can't control your children.

737
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,130
She really won't listen to me.

738
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,340
President Gong, find a better woman.

739
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,040
I'd hate to let you go, but what can I do?

740
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,420
Do Ra wants to only focus on work instead of dating right now.

741
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,110
Oh, I see.

742
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,280
That's how it is.

743
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,820
I understand.

744
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,480
President Gong, I feel so terrible.

745
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,440
No. 6245! No. 6245!

746
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,290
Yes, over here!

747
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:15,540
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

748
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,750
Knock, knock. The fried chicken is here.

749
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,750
It's really here.

750
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,720
I can't believe I'm finally eating fried chicken by Han River.

751
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,210
My heart is fluttering.

752
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,080
Your heart flutters about weird stuff.

753
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,500
Your heart fluttered for the eel at the snack bar last time.

754
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,380
Now it flutters for fried chicken?

755
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,610
I've only done this in dramas. I've never eaten fried chicken somewhere like this.

756
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,180
Let's eat quickly.

757
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,880
We have tons of things to do. We're so busy.

758
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,420
What are we doing?

759
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:59,060
Oppa, don't ask any questions and just follow me.

760
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,990
You always do whatever you want, don't you?

761
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,050
You're forgiven because you're pretty.

762
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,290
What will you do if you don't forgive me?

763
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,900
Eat quickly. Hurry.

764
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,600
What? Why is it so good?

765
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,440
It's so tasty I'm tearing up.

766
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,560
It's so freaking crispy.

767
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,730
- Crispy? 
  - Yes.

768
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,530
   

769
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,630
How does it feel?

770
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,350
Doesn't it actually feel so nice?

771
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:41,940
Yes, my feet feel soft with treatment. It's nice.

772
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,060
I've never done this.

773
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,590
Oppa, let's do this often from now on.

774
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,380
You're tired from running around on set.

775
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,780
So, I should care for you.

776
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,670
I'm getting pampered, thanks to you. Doing all sorts of things.

777
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,460
This isn't the end, okay?

778
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,970
- A special event is awaiting you. 
 -  Is there something else?

779
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,650
Oppa, I told you to let me be in charge of today's event.

780
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,080
- Don't ask any— 
 - Okay, okay.

781
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,900
Do whatever you want, okay?

782
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,220
Where are we going?

783
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,750
We're almost there.

784
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,850
Hang in there a bit longer.

785
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,450
Where are we going?

786
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,370
Hold on.

787
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,920
Oppa, there's something I want to ask you.

788
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,510
What is it?

789
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,240
Oppa, I really love you.

790
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,110
How about you?

791
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,680
Why would you ask that? It's obvious.

792
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,590
By the way, everything changes, apparently.

793
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,930
Love changes, too.

794
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:13,780
But I don't want our love to change.

795
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,450
I won't change.

796
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,020
You mean it, right?

797
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,500
Yes.

798
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,010
If so, let's...

799
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,280
leave the evidence of our love.

800
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,540
Even if difficulty faces us, we'll overcome it by looking at it

801
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,770
and we'll make up because of it even if we fight.

802
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,300
Deal?

803
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,310
Evidence of love?

804
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,420
What's that?

805
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,020
   

806
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,810
Y-You want to get a tattoo?

807
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,120
They're so pretty.

808
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,270
They turned out so nicely, didn't they?

809
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,650
Yes.

810
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,260
You're my star, and I'm your moon.

811
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,140
Don't say stuff like that.

812
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,460
Someone might lose it because it's so cringe.

813
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,500
Come on. What's the big deal?

814
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,460
They're so pretty.

815
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,330
Oppa, we're now inseparable like a star and the moon.

816
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:23,410
So don't try to run away from me.

817
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,520
I think I was tricked by the event organizer today.

818
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,570
What? Are you regretting it already?

819
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,760
No, no. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

820
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:43,380
Oppa, we'll face a lot of hardships going forward.

821
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,150
It would've been fine if you dated someone ordinary,

822
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:54,150
but you'd be inconvenienced and suffer because of me.

823
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,860
We overcame the hardest part.

824
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,880
What could possibly be harder than that?

825
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:10,200
But still. You never know.

826
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,550
Even if we face hardship again,

827
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,690
we'll have faith and depend on each other.

828
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:21,290
We'll protect each other like the moon and the star.

829
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:24,200
Don't ever let go of my hand, okay?

830
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,260
Okay. Never.

831
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:05,170
We're supposed to sign the contract with the cosmetics brand today.

832
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,580
Why aren't they contacting me yet?

833
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,600
President Baek, we're in trouble.

834
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,490
What? What's going on?

835
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:22,010
The thing is, everyone is suddenly canceling the ad contract.

836
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:25,570
The cosmetics brand that was supposed to sign the contract today canceled

837
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:29,640
and the furniture brand is suddenly going with a different model, too.

838
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:34,230
The beverage company was to renew the contract is going with Bi Bi.

839
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,760
How does that make sense, Ms. Song? Do they think a contract is a joke?

840
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,730
How does that make sense, Ms. Song? Do they think a contract is a joke?

841
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:42,880
President Baek, it must've been true.

842
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,510
What do you mean? What's true?

843
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:49,250
My friend who works at an ad agency told me this morning.

844
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,840
Angel Investment's President Gong said if they hired Ms. Park,

845
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:58,420
they'll no longer invest in advertisers or ad agencies.

846
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:03,530
What did you just say? Angel Investment's President Gong said that?

847
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:07,580
Yes. I don't know why he did,

848
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,810
but what if all of this is true?

849
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,260
   

850
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,240
Okay, Ms. Song. You can leave.

851
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,770
Okay.

852
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,990
Yes. This is Baek Mi Ja.

853
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,840
 President Baek, you keep saying you'll pay tomorrow or the day after. 

854
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,300
 When will you pay me? When? 

855
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:36,050
 I'll sue you for fraud if you don't pay back this week. I warned you. 

856
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,900
Gosh, what do I do?

857
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,320
Mr. Choi, what brings you here?

858
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,290
Noonim, why did you make me come here, then?

859
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:52,090
What are you trying to do?

860
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,900
Why aren't you paying us?

861
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,950
Mr. Choi, you still shouldn't have come here!

862
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,930
We didn't receive the interest payment. Should we be quiet?

863
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:03,800
I can't afford to do that now. Call Park Do Ra.

864
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,690
She's doing well these days. We'll make her pay instead of you!

865
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,400
Hey! Where's Park Do Ra? Where is she?

866
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,960
Where is she?

867
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,180
I'll pay you! I'll pay the interest, okay?

868
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,920
 Let go! Let go, I said! 

869
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,930
Wait, President. You can't come in here.

870
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,200
Let go! Let go, I said!

871
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,430
President Gong, I'm sorry. It's me. It's me.

872
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,090
Secretary Jo,

873
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,070
you can leave.

874
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:44,340


875
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:51,090
President Gong, did you do that?

876
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:57,980
Did you make everyone cancel the contracts with Do Ra?

877
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,410
I told you.

878
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:05,700
That I'll destroy Park Do Ra's... career in this field.

879
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,560
That I'll make her disappear forever.

880
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,270
How could you...

881
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:16,350
How could you do this? What did I do?

882
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,870
What did Do Ra do?

883
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:19,570
You can't do this. This isn't right.

884
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:22,980
How could you do such a thing?

885
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,940
You made a fool out of me!

886
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,430
You played with me, Gong Jin Dan!

887
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:35,840
Weren't you ready to pay for it when you did all that?

888
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:49,530
P-President Gong... spare us.

889
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,380
S-Spare us just once.

890
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,810
If you spare me, I'll do anything.

891
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,620
I'll do whatever it takes.

892
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,510
Spare me. Just once.

893
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,740
President Gong.

894
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,980
   

895
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:14,830
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

896
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,960
♫  It's so tough  ♫

897
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:24,040
♫  I'd feel better if I could see you the way you are  ♫

898
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:28,960
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

899
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,260
♫  The pain is unbearable  ♫

900
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:41,320
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

901
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,780
 I finally met the love of my life. 

902
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,420
 My heart is racing so much. 

903
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,040
 What if I can't even make eye contact with him? 

904
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,740
 I'm on my way to Ganghwa-do to shoot a campaign with Mom. 

905
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,070
 Didn't you say you don't have work today? 

906
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,940
 What are you doing here, President Gong... 

907
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,930
 Haven't you seen the news? The debt collectors are going after Park Do Ra. 

908
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,150
 I'm granting you a chance today. 

909
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:06,090
 Do Ra, just tonight. Please let all of us live. 

910
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:10,410
 You'll be by my side no matter what happens to me, right? 

911
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:14,170
 Of course, I'll be right by your side. 

912
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,380
 I'm not going anywhere.
