A kids' talent show or something?

10
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:22,827
Why are you using a kid for your business?

What are you doing? Get the owner.

00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,837
Get the owner. Get the owner out here!

00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:33,607

No, no, no.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,327
You were supposed to pay us 500,000 won  (~$372) . Why only pay us 300,000 won  (~$223) ?

24
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:06,317
Wow, this lady has no sense of guilt.

25
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,227
300,000 won is too much already.

26
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:11,467
You totally ruined the mood in there. How could you demand 500,000?

27
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,277
I almost had a bottle thrown at me.

28
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:17,407
She should've twisted and shaken a bit like this.

29
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,287
What are you doing after half-assing it?

30
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,017
What is this, an elementary school talent show?

31
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,607
Excuse me!

32
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:25,947
She might not look like it but Do Ra is an actor. A child actor.

33
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:28,667
You can't just slap us with this!

34
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,297
Everyone's an actor these days.

35
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,857
Are you an actor if you were on TV once?

36
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:38,367
And you should demand money after doing the work properly, Ahjumma.

37
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,807
Right now, I...

38
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,647
I'm giving you that much because I pity the child.

39
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,397
Don't ever come back here.

40
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:49,197
Don't you ever!

41
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:55,517
Hey, I got this as a tip earlier. Take it.

42
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,887
Ahjussi! Talk to me for a second.

43
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,657
Seriously.

44
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:05,737
You should've done it properly. Properly.

45
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:08,507
We only made 300,000 won because of you.

46
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,050
Mom...

47
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,627
This is why I said I didn't want to do this.

48
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,177
How can you say that right now?

49
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:19,097
The debt collectors are after me right now, and I'm about to die. Gosh, seriously!

50
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,517
Here.

51
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:26,637
Take this with you and wait at home.

52
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:28,177
Until I pick you up, okay?

53
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:30,667
Where are you going, Mom? Aren't you coming with me?

54
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,457
I can't go home because of the debt collectors right now.

55
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:35,367
That's why you should've done it properly.

56
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,447
We should've made at least 500,000 won, girl!

57
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:41,027
I'm sorry, Mom.

58
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:45,257
Okay. Go now. It's cold. Go now. Go.

59
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,847
Mom, you'll come, right?

60
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:49,777
I will. Just wait a few days.

61
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:54,137
Take good care of Do Jun and Do Sik, okay?

62
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:57,637
It's cold. It's so cold. Get going now. Go.

63
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:06,627
Hurry up and go! Go, go!

64
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:21,047
   

65
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,327
Attention. Say goodbye to the teacher.

66
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,977
Thank you.

67
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:26,867
Bye, everyone.

68
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,367
- Park Do Ra. 
 - Yes?

69
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,287
Come here, Do Ra.

70
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:40,117
This is an exchange coupon.

71
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:44,067
A philanthropist is giving them to families in need of help.

72
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:49,127
If you take this to the borough office, you can get rice and food.

73
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,137
And there are gift certificates in here, too. Here.

74
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:04,377
Miss, my family doesn't need help.

75
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:08,387
I have both Mom and Dad, and we're rich.

76
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,647
So, I don't need stuff like this.

77
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:19,507
Tteokbokki. I paid for the tteokbokki yesterday, so...

78
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:29,167
   

79
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,207
Hey, Do Ra.

80
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:38,457
I'm sorry, Miss.

81
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:41,767
It's true I don't have a father since he passed away.

82
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,827
I'll take the coupons from earlier.

83
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,377
My goodness.

84
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,867
I'm afraid these were ruined.

85
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,327
Where do you live?

86
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:40,217
I'll carry them for you. Is it far from here?

87
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,697
No.

88
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,397
It's that way over there.

89
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,777
Give me that.

90
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:50,117
Oh, okay.

91
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,797
You can carry that, right?

92
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:57,177
Yes.

93
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:07,637
Hey, Go Dae Choong! Where are you going?

94
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,627
Noona, eat the popsicle and wait.

95
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:13,297
I'll help her carry these quickly and come back.

96
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,547
Let's go. That way?

97
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,067
Yes.

98
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,067
Is this your place?

99
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:31,157
Yes, you can go now. I'm on the first floor here.

100
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:39,997
Do you live in the neighborhood, too?

101
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,937
I don't think we've met.

102
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:44,337
No, I live in Seoul.

103
00:07:44,337 --> 00:07:46,747
Seoul?

104
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,037
Really?

105
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:52,157
Yes. I'm just here to get some fresh air today.

106
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,747
Bye, then.

107
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,717
Hold on.

108
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,977
What's your phone number?

109
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:04,717
I don't have a cell phone.

110
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,317
Why? What do you want my number for?

111
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:10,797
Because I'm grateful. I'll return the favor later.

112
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:12,507
Favor?

113
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:14,877
It's okay. It's nothing.

114
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:18,057
Bye, kid.

115
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,097
He's such a cool oppa.

116
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:27,997
I haven't met someone that cool, even at the broadcasting station.

117
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,717
What was his name again?

118
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:37,397
Go Dae...

119
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:41,017
I should've asked his name, at least. What a dummy.

120
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:47,637
So you brought all this, Do Ra?

121
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:48,887
Yes.

122
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,857
Hey! What are we, beggars?

123
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,777
Why did you accept stuff like this?

124
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:56,137
What's wrong with it? Don't eat it, then.

125
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:58,597
Do Jun and I will eat it.

126
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:02,287
Noona, I'm hungry.

127
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,177
Can I eat this ramen?

128
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,567
Of course. You can have two if you want.

129
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,817
Wow, I'm so excited.

130
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,557
Here.

131
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:29,447
Noona, Hyung, it's so tasty. Super tasty.

132
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,167
Yes, it's really tasty.

133
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:41,800
Hyung, Noona, when is Mom coming home?

134
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:45,447
I like this uncooked ramen,

135
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:50,027
but I want her beef potato stew, too.

136
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:59,027
I told you. You have to wait for her for 10 days.

137
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:02,787
It's already been 10 days, though.

138
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:11,107
Baek Mi Ja.

139
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:13,327
Where's Baek Mi Ja hiding?

140
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,997
Come out right now, Baek Mi Ja!

141
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:18,367
Where's that little rat hiding?

142
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,317
Where did your mom go?

143
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,197
Tell us right now.

144
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:24,877
M-Mom isn't here.

145
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:26,567
Are you serious right now?

146
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:30,597
You bought a boxful of ramen after stealing my money.

147
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:36,717
Where's your mom? Huh?

148
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:38,087
Where's that scamming thief?

149
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,567
Hyung! Noona!

150
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:43,387
We don't know. We don't know. We don't know, either.

151
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,477
Get out of our house right now!

152
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:48,397
You can't just barge into someone's house with shoes on!

153
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,987
How dare you yell at us!

154
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:58,087
- Let go! Let go. 
 - No! Let go...

155
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:59,767
Let go.

156
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:04,947
Tell your mom exactly this.

157
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,817
To pay back the money she borrowed.

158
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:10,147
Bring me the money and get this kid back.

159
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:11,907
Let's go.

160
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:14,117
- No! 
 - No!

161
00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:15,427
Let go!

162
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,557
- What are you doing? 
 - Let go of me!

163
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:20,157
- Let go! 
 - No, no!

164
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,967
Let go. Let go.

165
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:25,627
- No, no! 
 - Let go. Let go!

166
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,367
Noona!

167
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,337
- No, let go of me! 
 - Stay put.

168
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:34,667
- Do Jun! 
 - No!

169
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,087
- Do Jun! 
 - Noona!

170
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,117
You can't take him. Give him back to us.

171
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,837
- Move it. 
 - Mom said she'll pay you back.

172
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,657
- Get out of the way. 
 - Give us Do Jun back, please.

173
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,997
Don't do this. You can't.

174
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:51,397
Tell your mom to come immediately. Immediately.

175
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,777
We have no idea where she is, either.

176
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:56,497
We can't even reach her. It's true.

177
00:11:56,497 --> 00:12:01,837
So, please give us Do Jun back. Please.

178
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,817
Seriously, come on. Let go of me!

179
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:10,177
- Hyung. Noona. 
 - I'll call the police and tell them you kidnapped him!

180
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:26,857
Tell your mom to pay me back immediately.

181
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:29,257
Otherwise, I'll sue her.

182
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,177
Let go of him.

183
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:36,627
- Noona. 
 - Do Jun.

184
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:39,717
- Let's go. 
 - Are you okay?

185
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,217
I'm sorry. Let's go in.

186
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:12,867
Guys, Do Ra, wake up. Pack your things.

187
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,237
Get dressed. Get dressed.

188
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:16,227
Do Shik, Do Shik?

189
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,517
Do Shik. Wake up, wake up.

190
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:20,907
- Wake up, Do Shik. Get dressed. 
 - Where are we going?

191
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:22,957
Be quiet and get dressed.

192
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:26,167
Get up. Get dressed and pack your things.

193
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,067
Mom, where are we going?

194
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,807
We're moving.

195
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:36,797
Mom, did you pay off the debt, then?

196
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:39,297
We're moving because we did.

197
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,137
You're serious, right?

198
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:05,097
Gosh, Ma'am. You can't bring in a family with three children.

199
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,037
Wait, what's going on?

200
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:10,827
Didn't you say you had one daughter? That's why we signed the contract.

201
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:16,287
Well, I thought so, too. But this is what I saw today.

202
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:21,757
You had three kids, but you lied, saying you only had one daughter to sign the contract?

203
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:25,177
I'm sorry. Please forgive me just once.

204
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:27,027
They're nice and quiet kids.

205
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:30,427
We'll live cleanly and quietly.

206
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:33,197
No other places had a security deposit in the price range.

207
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,377
What's going on here?

208
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:38,017
In-law, listen to this.

209
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:40,367
She had three children,

210
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:45,067
but she lied to the realtor, saying she had one daughter to sign the contract with us.

211
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:49,307
The place is already tiny. This isn't right.

212
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:51,307
- Seon Yeong. 
 - Yes.

213
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,367
So what if she has one kid or three?

214
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,427
The kids can hear you.

215
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:58,697
- In-law... 
 - Yes?

216
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,537
the house will feel rejuvenated and bright with many children.

217
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:05,157
- O-Oh, yes. 
 - Yes.

218
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,877
Welcome to our house.

219
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,807
Let me know if you feel uncomfortable with anything.

220
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,987
Thank you.

221
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:12,087
I'll be out for dinner, then.

222
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:14,567
See you later. Be careful.

223
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:20,267
Seriously, In-law is way too kind. Too kind.

224
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,167
They already moved in. What can we do?

225
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,687
Go inside, then.

226
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,577
Yes, thank you.

227
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:27,977
Our kids are really well-behaved.

228
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,717
I'll make sure we're quiet.

229
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:32,917
Thank you. Thank you.

230
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:36,207
- I'm home. 
 - Welcome home, Son.

231
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:37,487
Why are you all out here?

232
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:39,627
They just moved in. Say hello.

233
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:40,767
Hello.

234
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,077
This is my son.

235
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:47,147
Huh? Are you that little kid?

236
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,177
Oppa from Seoul?

237
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:59,607
 Something that makes no sense at all happened. 

238
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,137
 I can't believe I ran into him here again. 

239
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:05,227
 Is this that oppa's house? 

240
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:12,777
Go, go. Go in. Go inside.

241
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:23,467
Wow. Mom, the bathroom is so clean. I love it.

242
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:28,507
Wow. Wow, it's nice.

243
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:32,127
Wow. It's small, but it has everything.

244
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,307
Wow, how nice.

245
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:35,837
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

246
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:40,027
- I'm so glad we moved in here. I mean it. 
 - Right?

247
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:44,427
By the way, Mom, aren't you supposed to eat jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk the day you move?

248
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:48,087
Jjajangmyeon. Jjajangmyeon. Mom, I want jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.

249
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:52,157
Yes, let's have tangsuyuk and jjajangmyeon today.

250
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:56,337
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

251
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:58,217
Are you happy?

252
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,067
Wow, it's so nice.

253
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:12,667
Seriously, I don't like that woman.

254
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:17,937
How could she lie that she has only one daughter?

255
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,527
She couldn't pay more security deposit. What can we do?

256
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:24,807
It's hard to find a clean place with a cheap security deposit in the neighborhood.

257
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:28,367
What does her husband do, exactly?

258
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:31,017
- Did his business fail? 
 - I heard he's dead.

259
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,557
My gosh, he's dead?

260
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:38,797
Yes. I saw the youngest boy in the yard, so I asked him when his dad was coming home.

261
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:42,447
But he said he's dead, and he's in heaven.

262
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,437
I asked him without much thought.

263
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:48,447
I felt so guilty. I felt sorry for him, too.

264
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:51,077
Is she a w-widow, then?

265
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:56,237
She's a widow with three kids. Why was she dressed like that earlier?

266
00:17:56,237 --> 00:18:00,767
Gosh, I don't think she's just a typical widow.

267
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,377
Why did she have to be a widow? How unsettling.

268
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:06,087
You're a widow, too. Why are you mean to other widows?

269
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,557
Hey!

270
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:11,027
Mom, I need 50,000 won to buy a workbook.

271
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:14,567
- Okay. What kind of workbook? 
 - Huh?

272
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,907
A math workbook.

273
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:19,787
Okay, got it.

274
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,857
Let's see.

275
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,557
Here. 60,000 won.

276
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:29,327
I gave you an extra 10,000 won. Get something to eat if you get hungry while studying.

277
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:31,457
Thank you, Mother.

278
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,707
Gosh, you little.

279
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:40,097
How come your wallet opens for Dae Choong so easily?

280
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:43,457
Why do you buy workbooks all the time?

281
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,927
Are you sure you aren't just taking money?

282
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,547
Auntie, how could you say that?

283
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:50,567
What do you think of me exactly?

284
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:53,057
You buy workbooks all the time,

285
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,717
but why aren't your grades improving?

286
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,747
You're poking a sensitive spot again.

287
00:18:57,747 --> 00:19:00,317
Do you want to fight me today, Auntie?

288
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:04,817
Don't be like that. I'm sure they will improve soon.

289
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:09,577
Dae Chung, I'll always pay for academy tuition and workbooks.

290
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:12,167
Just focus on your studies, okay?

291
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,027
Yes, Sir.

292
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,587
- I'll be back. 
 - Okay.

293
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,777
See you later.

294
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,127
He's your boyfriend, not your son.

295
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:28,607
By the way, I know she's your best friend,

296
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:32,767
but isn't it too much to help with your friend's late father-in-law's memorial service?

297
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:36,037
And even without your help, they're a chaebol family after all.

298
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:39,607
They must have plenty of chefs to cook for the memorial service.

299
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:43,457
Soo Yeon's daughter and her husband, Chairman Gong, like my shikhye  (traditional sweet Korean rice beverage) .

300
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:45,297
So, I just thought I should.

301
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:49,157
I put some shikhye in the fridge, Mother. Make sure to have some.

302
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:51,407
I'll be right back. See you.

303
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,127
See you later.

304
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:58,537
She works so hard to make shikhye for her friend's late father-in-law's memorial service.

305
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:03,447
But she treats her mother-in-law, who is alive and well, like a neighborhood stray dog.

306
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:06,247
What did she say? Get it from the fridge?

307
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:11,017
Gosh, Mom. It's not hard to get it from the fridge. I'll get it for you.

308
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:13,287
Forget it.

309
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:17,807
What a bitch. I won't drink her shikhye out of spite.

310
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,377
Gosh, this is great shikhye. Isn't it, Mom?

311
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:24,977
Yes. Gosh.

312
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:29,807
Hey, your sister-in-law is good at making shikhye.

313
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,817
She's good at making other stuff, too.

314
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:39,627
By the way, doesn't she have any self-respect?

315
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:44,747
Does she really want to go to her friend's father-in-law's memorial service all the time?

316
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:47,727
Gosh, I'm upset for her.

317
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:51,397
Her friend treats her like they're sisters.

318
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,147
That's why she's doing this.

319
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:56,107
Think about how much her friend cares for Dae Chung.

320
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:59,247
It's not easy to care for your friend's son.

321
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:02,137
I suppose. By the way,

322
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:09,167
why is a madam of a chaebol family friends with your unimpressive sister-in-law?

323
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,047
They're obsessed with each other.

324
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:14,127
Isn't that such a mystery?

325
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,907
You're right.

326
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:21,787
Maybe Seon Yeong is going for a big-picture goal.

327
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,487
Big-picture goal?

328
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:25,767
Like what?

329
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:30,347
Her friend apparently has a very cute and pretty daughter.

330
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:33,277
Is she trying to make Dae Chung their son-in-law...

331
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:37,327
Is she laying the ground to become in-laws with her, by chance?

332
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:42,027
Aigoo, come on. What chaebol family would have an adopted child as a son-in-law—

333
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:46,047
Geez, what's the big deal? It's just between us.

334
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,037
Mom, you'll get kicked out of the house if Seon Yeong hears that.

335
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:50,997
You'll get me kicked out, too.

336
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:52,874
- I'm home. 
 - You scared me.

337
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:56,694
Gosh, what's wrong? Why are you so scared?

338
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,474
It's nothing, Oppa.

339
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:03,164
W-Where's Seon Yeong?

340
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:05,244
Well, she...

341
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:10,554
She went to her friend's father-in-law's memorial service. That's where she went.

342
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:12,864
I see. At Soo Yeon's?

343
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,514
Yes.

344
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,044
Okay.

345
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:25,674
That was a close one.

346
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:27,484
Come on.

347
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,504
It's me. I'm on my way now.

348
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:50,194
Okay.

349
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,034
I won't let it slide today.

350
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,264
I'll destroy them.

351
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:17,544
Ma Ri, you can take a deep bow for Grandpa, right?

352
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:19,384
Of course.

353
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:21,984
Two and a half bow.

354
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,374
You're impressive. Yes.

355
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:27,234
- You should join her, Honey. 
 - Okay.

356
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:36,474
Hold on! Stop!

357
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:39,004
I'll take a bow, too. I will.

358
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:42,314
It's my honey's memorial service. Why only leave me out?

359
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:45,294
Are you crazy? How dare you show up here drunk?

360
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:47,984
Let go of me!

361
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,854
Am I not allowed to be here?

362
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:53,004
I'll take a bow just like the granddaughter and daughter-in-law here.

363
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,924
I have the right to take a bow, too.

364
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:01,814
Chairman, I'm here.

365
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:07,700
Hong Ae Gyo, whom you used to love and cherish so much, is here.

366
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:10,884
You're crazy. You're crazy. I'm sorry.

367
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,504
- Get up. Get up right now. 
 - Mom.

368
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:16,214
Get out of the way, Mom.

369
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:22,384
I want to take a bow to my darling chairman. Why are you stopping me, Mom?

370
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:26,434
Everyone! Don't move!

371
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:28,204
Don't try to drag me out of here.

372
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:31,834
If you do, I'll bite my tongue and die here.

373
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:35,274
Ma Ri, you should go upstairs.

374
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,134
Seon Yeong.

375
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:39,674
Oh, okay.

376
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:42,144
Let's go upstairs, Ma Ri.

377
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,414
 Jin Dan is my son. 

378
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:54,264
 That's an unchangeable fact, and I'm proving it. 

379
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:59,024
 So, add Jin Dan as Gong Jin Dan to my family registry. 

380
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:02,844
 Give him one of the subsidiary companies. 

381
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:05,874
 Hong Ae Gyo is the mother of my son. 

382
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:09,034
 She's been hiding her whole life because of me. 

383
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:13,994
 So, treat her politely even when I'm dead and gone. 

384
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:16,734
 I'll be watching from heaven. 

385
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:22,264
 Why don't you answer, Gong Jin Taek? Answer me. 

386
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:25,824
 Yes. I will, Father. 

387
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:32,564
Jin Taek Oppa, you said yes to him.

388
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:38,254
Why won't you let me take a bow at his memorial service, then?

389
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:41,934
He told you to treat me politely.

390
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:44,154
Why are you looking down on me, then?

391
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,784
Why are you ignoring his last words?

392
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:50,704
He's looking at you from heaven right now!

393
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,604
Jin Dan.

394
00:25:54,924 --> 00:25:57,064
My baby.

395
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,784
My baby.

396
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:07,664
Gosh, Jin Dan. When did you get here, my son?

397
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:10,794
Did you get a vacation for Father's memorial service?

398
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:15,594
Jin Dan, I'm so glad you're here today.

399
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:18,954
I no longer want to live as his hidden woman anymore.

400
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,954
I can no longer live in hiding anymore.

401
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:27,764
My Jin Dan is your brother since you share a father, Jin Taek Oppa.

402
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:30,404
What am I to you, then?

403
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:35,404
Jin Dan calls me "Mom."

404
00:26:35,404 --> 00:26:39,844
Oppa, you should start calling me "Mother" from now on, too.

405
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:42,204
And you, Jang Soo Yeon.

406
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:46,174
You should start calling me "Mother" from now on, too, okay?

407
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:50,954
And instead of living in the annex outside,

408
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:53,484
I'll live in the main house here.

409
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:57,784
I'll use the room Chairman Gong Dae Gil, my honey, used to use.

410
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,974
No one can stop me!

411
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,114
Ae Gyo, no, no.

412
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:04,834
Grandmother!

413
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,964
Don't stop my mother.

414
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,374
Hyungnim.

415
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:49,434
I apologize on behalf of Mother.

416
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:56,294
I'm sorry for causing a disturbance at Father's memorial service.

417
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:01,934
You didn't do anything wrong.

418
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:05,834
I want to be alone. Please leave now.

419
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,554
Hyungnim.

420
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:24,864
I know what you think of my mother and me.

421
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:29,400
Despite that, you accepted me as your brother.

422
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,490
I've always been grateful for that.

423
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:37,464
I know it's...

424
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:41,754
hard for you to forgive my mother, yet,

425
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:49,574
but she had it tough for a long time, too.

426
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:54,234
There's Father's will, too.

427
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:58,834
Could you please accept my mother now?

428
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:10,724
She's been living in the annex... and I've been living in the main house.

429
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,810
It made me very uncomfortable.

430
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:16,564
I don't think we can continue doing this.

431
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:22,354
Once I get married or get my own place later,

432
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,664
I'll take Mother with me.

433
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,784
Please let my mother...

434
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:35,614
be a part of this family for once, at least for a few years.

435
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:40,064
So that she'd finally stop being resentful.

436
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:46,874
I beg you.

437
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:49,504
Hyungnim.

438
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:13,664
Gosh, Honey. That's unthinkable.

439
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:17,384
I can't live in the same house as Ae Gyo.

440
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,404
Do you think I want to?

441
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:25,364
It's impossible when I consider my late mother.

442
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:28,274
But what else can we do?

443
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:30,654
We can't ignore Father's will, either.

444
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:33,474
She even played the audio recording.

445
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:38,644
Are you sure about this? Can you handle it?

446
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:42,374
There are no other options.

447
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,150
It's not like we can kick her out, either.

448
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:50,104
Jin Dan said he'll get a place for them later. Until then...

449
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:53,014
Let's just do it until then.

450
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:56,824
This isn't such a simple matter.

451
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:59,874
Ae Gyo moving into Mother and Father's old bedroom

452
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:04,134
means we'll accept her as an elder of our house.

453
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:07,330
Are you sure you can call her "Mother"?

454
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,144
I can't.

455
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:13,234
I can't call my high school classmate "Mother."

456
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:15,604
Just keep that in mind.

457
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:25,904
You little. You wench!

458
00:31:25,904 --> 00:31:28,804
Get out. Get out. Get out.

459
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,724
No! Over my dead body.

460
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,154
I'll become a ghost in this room.

461
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:38,414
My goodness. Can you call yourself a human?

462
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:40,434
Are you human?

463
00:31:41,514 --> 00:31:44,094
You're less than an animal.

464
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:49,724
My goodness. When we were about to go out on the streets, Madam took us in.

465
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:53,044
That's how we were able to live like humans.

466
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,744
But instead of being grateful to the Madam, you seduced her husband.

467
00:31:56,744 --> 00:32:00,394
She cried bloody tears before she passed because of you, wench.

468
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:04,414
How dare you come in here after that? How dare you?

469
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:11,114
Gosh, Madam. How could I see her face when I die?

470
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:13,684
- Get out. Get out, you brat. 
 - I don't want to.

471
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:17,514
You're unforgivable. Get out.

472
00:32:17,514 --> 00:32:20,594
Grandmother, that's enough.

473
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:25,084
Grandmother, don't do that to Mom anymore.

474
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:30,294
Doing that to her is the same thing as insulting me.

475
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:32,194
What?

476
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:36,484
And Hyungnim approved...

477
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:38,754
Mom living here.

478
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:43,124
W-W-What did you say?

479
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:46,934
Are you sure? Did he really approve it?

480
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,590


481
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:06,654
Soo Yeon, why are you giving me so much?

482
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:10,424
It's not that much. It's nice to share.

483
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:13,294
I know Dae Chung likes meat. Grill some for him.

484
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,794
- Thanks. 
 - He should eat a lot at that age.

485
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,104
What's this?

486
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:21,044
Oh, Seon Yeong, it's because I'm so thankful. I am.

487
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:24,624
Come on. You don't do this between friends. Then, I can't come over again.

488
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,684
I won't come next year, then.

489
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:31,344
Come on, girl. Can't you just accept my gratitude, Seon Yeong?

490
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,884
Okay. Think of it as pocket money for Dae Chung, then.

491
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,644
Pocket money from his aunt.

492
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:38,934
Please? Seon Yeong.

493
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,484
Gosh, seriously.

494
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:44,754
Okay. Thank you.

495
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:46,814
No, I should be thanking you.

496
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:49,454
No one else cares for me like this.

497
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:54,074
By the way, is Ae Gyo out of her mind?

498
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,704
How could she tell you to call her "Mother"?

499
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:03,984
I already knew she was thick-skinned, but...

500
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,754
What will you do now?

501
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,974
You'll see her every time you wake up.

502
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:10,024
I don't know.

503
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:13,544
I don't even want to imagine what would happen.

504
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:27,654
That oppa must study really hard.

505
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:30,314
He still hasn't come home.

506
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:37,624
♫  I want nobody, nobody but you  ♫

507
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:41,044
♫  I want nobody, nobody but you  ♫

508
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:44,384
My gosh! You scared me.

509
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:47,684
♫  Nobody, nobody  ♫

510
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:51,344
Geez. My heart skipped a beat.

511
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:55,884
What are you doing here instead of sleeping at this hour, little kid?

512
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,304
The thing is...

513
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:04,754
I was waiting for you, Oppa.

514
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:06,874
You were waiting for me?

515
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:08,844
Why?

516
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:12,714
You helped me carry heavy stuff last time.

517
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:15,064
I'm so grateful for that.

518
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,764
This is to express my gratitude.

519
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:22,274
Make sure to hang it on your backpack.

520
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,284
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

521
00:35:25,284 --> 00:35:27,394
That wasn't a big deal at all.

522
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:30,874
But that's not how I feel about it, okay?

523
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:33,924
Okay, then. Thank you.

524
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:38,134
Wow. Anyway, you're so well-mannered.

525
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:39,584
Thank you so much.

526
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:44,514
By the way, wasn't the Noona you were with that time your sister?

527
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:47,984
I saw your whole family earlier, but I didn't see her.

528
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,404
I want to say hello to her, too.

529
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:52,694
What?

530
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,254
Oh, right...

531
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:59,944
Well, she's not my biological sister. She's just a Noona I know.

532
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:02,454
Oh, I see.

533
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:06,824
But it's so fascinating that I ran into you here again.

534
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:09,444
Thinking about it, it's totally crazy.

535
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:12,524
How could this be? What are the odds that this happened?

536
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:14,984
Right? Isn't it crazy?

537
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:22,354
 Who put the bridge of connection between us? 

538
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:28,174
 Oppa and I. Are we meant to be, by chance? 

539
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:32,934
Hey, you should go inside and get to sleep.

540
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:36,224
Hey, your eyes look sleepy.

541
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,914
You look out of it.

542
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:39,324
Pardon?

543
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:44,694
Oh, okay. You sleep tight, too.

544
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:10,514
Hey, you almost fell and broke your nose if it wasn't for me just now.

545
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:14,044
Be sure to stay focused from now on, okay?

546
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,804
Good night.

547
00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:30,194
He and I are meant to be now.

548
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:32,544
He's my prince.

549
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:36,634
I'll say goodbye to Heechul of Super Junior now.

550
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:41,414
That oppa is mine now.

551
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:49,224
- Thank you. 
 - So expensive. It's so expensive.

552
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:53,574
That woman is renting a room from your house,

553
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:56,234
but she's pretending as if she's from Gangnam.

554
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,054
- Who? 
 - Who else is there?

555
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:02,404
Oh, that's Do Ra and her mom, our tenants.

556
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:04,664
She needs to know her place.

557
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:07,354
She wants to make her daughter an actor. Look at her now.

558
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,954
She's dragging her around instead of sending her to school.

559
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,974
How money-obsessed do you have to be to do that to your kid?

560
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:16,974
Aigoo. She doesn't make her skip school every day.

561
00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:21,034
I suppose she has an audition or something today.

562
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:26,064
She's not just a normal woman. Be careful.

563
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:28,584
What do you mean, be careful?

564
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:30,994
Didn't you hear the rumor about her?

565
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:33,675
Rumor? What rumor?

566
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,081
Seon Yeong.

567
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:42,271
Hey, Seon Yeong. Seon Yeong, listen.

568
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:47,061
I think we should evict Do Ra's mom from the guest house.

569
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:48,801
What are you talking about?

570
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,781
They just moved in. How could we kick them out already?

571
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:54,411
Say the room Myeong Dong and I use is too tight

572
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:56,751
and Myeong Dong has to use that room.

573
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,421
Try to get her out somehow.

574
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,081
Why, Mother? Did something happen?

575
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:04,251
Gosh, the thing is...

576
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:10,691
Well, there are very bad rumors about Do Ra's mom.

577
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:15,601
It's weird that she puts on a lot of makeup to go out every night, right?

578
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:21,181
What else does a woman do with that much makeup on at night?

579
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:24,521
I suppose...

580
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:27,951
- I did find that a bit strange. 
 - She's strange.

581
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:32,561
Gosh, I wonder if people would think badly of us because of her.

582
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:34,011
Right on. That's it.

583
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:35,631
Seon Yeong.

584
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:42,241
How could you say stuff like that?

585
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:43,811
Dad.

586
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:49,711
Do Ra's mom is trying to make ends meet while raising three children by herself.

587
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,381
Instead of helping her living in the same house,

588
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,541
how could you say something so mean?

589
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:58,521
I'm sorry, Dad.

590
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,591
I'll be out.

591
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:04,771
Dad, you should wear a scarf, at least.

592
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:06,921
It will be cold tonight.

593
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:09,901
You don't want to catch a cold.

594
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,481
Hold on.

595
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,930
He was talking to me just now, wasn't he?

596
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,231
Gosh, I get it. You used to be a school principal.

597
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:24,601
How dare he lecture and yell at me?

598
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,251
Hello, I'm... 
    

599
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:28,951
Park Do Ra's mom.

600
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,801
Yes...

601
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:35,451
Hello, hello. I'm Park Do Ra's mom.

602
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,391
Do Ra worked very hard for this.

603
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:40,701
I hope you like her.

604
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,591
Yes.

605
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:09,961
You think we can meet today?

606
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:11,661
Oppa.

607
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:14,531
I'll be there as soon as I'm out of school.

608
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,471
 Dae Chung must've gotten a girlfriend. 

609
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:25,461
I wonder who.

610
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:28,581
He can't have a girlfriend.

611
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:35,911
Dad, my friends have been mean to me.

612
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,771
I've been bullied.

613
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:40,381
My school uniform skirt was covered with dirt...

614
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:48,801
Covered with dirt and... so...

615
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,281
It was covered with dirt and torn up,

616
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,611
but no one in the family has noticed it.

617
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,131
But the teacher noticed it and saved me.

618
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,151
Say that.

619
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,691
Gosh, you little. Seriously.

620
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:08,411
How could you ruin this important audition after what I told you?

621
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:11,181
How could you get beaten by Bibi, not just anyone? Bibi?

622
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:16,371
Aigoo, seriously. How could you forget all the lines you memorized?

623
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:19,191
I said acting is all about focusing.

624
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:20,631
It's about getting into it.

625
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:23,071
Do you know how much money I spent today because of you?

626
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:25,651
For the transportation, pastries, and drinks when I'm already broke.

627
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:29,021
What will you do now? What will you do? What will you do?

628
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:31,171
I never said I wanted to become an actor.

629
00:42:31,171 --> 00:42:33,391
Why don't you become one if you want it so badly?

630
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,561
Why are you forcing me? Why?

631
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,261
That little brat!

632
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:39,701
Go home and care for Do Sik and Do Jun.

633
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:41,331
- I need to go to work, okay? 
 - Whatever.

634
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,261
Gosh, that little. Gosh...

635
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:57,591
Dae Chung goes to a hair salon to straighten his curly hair every day.

636
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:59,971
He comes home late every day.

637
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:02,961
And he always giggles while texting.

638
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:06,361
He doesn't come home late because he studies.

639
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:08,611
I'm sure there's something going on.

640
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:11,451
I'll make sure to find out today.

641
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:17,741
- Yeah. I know. It's so good. 
 - Where?

642
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:23,811
- So cold. Let's go. Let's hurry. 
 - Freezing.

643
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,761
See you later.

644
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:29,321
See you.

645
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:05,261
What?

646
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:08,571
What's with that motorcycle?

647
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,871
Dae Chung!

648
00:44:10,871 --> 00:44:12,511
Noona.

649
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:15,411
You're right on time.

650
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:17,341
That unni is...

651
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:19,831
That's Jeong Mi from Sol Hair Salon.

652
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,931
Where are we going today?

653
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:25,671
We'll go anywhere you want to go.

654
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:28,801
Really? Will you travel to the ends of the earth, then?

655
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:30,511
Of course, I will.

656
00:44:30,511 --> 00:44:35,161
Just tell me where. I'll drive to the ends of the earth if that's what you want.

657
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:37,081
Dae Chung.

658
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:39,431
Noona, look.

659
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:41,201
Yay.

660
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:46,281
- Hang tight, Noona. 
 - Go, go!

661
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:58,011
What did I...

662
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:02,061
see just now?

663
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:05,971
No.

664
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:08,951
I'm sure they're just good friends.

665
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:11,781
There's no way they're a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

666
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:15,611
Dae Chung is a high school student.

667
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,781
There's no way he'd date an older unni like her.

668
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,301
There's no way.

669
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:30,301
   

670
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:42,191
Dae Chung, it was so exciting and fun today.

671
00:45:42,191 --> 00:45:44,601
Me, too, Noona.

672
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:46,371
You should go now.

673
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,311
Good night, Noona.

674
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:49,831
Good night.

675
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,891
Bye!

676
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:56,731
Excuse me.

677
00:45:57,551 --> 00:45:59,611
Huh? Do Ra.

678
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,201
Did you call me just now?

679
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:05,771
Yes.

680
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:07,971
Huh? What is it?

681
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:10,461
Are you here to get your hair done at this hour?

682
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:14,491
Hey, why are you glaring at me?

683
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:17,721
Unni, what's your relationship with Dae Chung Oppa?

684
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:20,751
I saw everything. Be honest with me.

685
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,671
Well, why do I have to tell you?

686
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:31,031
You can't be dating a high school student, right?

687
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:33,371
There's no way, right?

688
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:35,431
This is unbelievable.

689
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:38,221
Do Ra, little kids like you don't have to know.

690
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm not a little kid, okay?

691
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:45,301
- I know you're really old. 
 - What?

692
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:48,261
Why were you on the back of Dae Chung Oppa's motorcycle, then?

693
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:49,641
How does that make sense?

694
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,631
You can't do that with a high school student.

695
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:58,941
Do Ra, age is not important when it comes to romance.

696
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:03,051
I suppose a little kid like you won't understand.

697
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:07,941
Do Ra, go home, eat a lot, and grow up quickly.

698
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:11,381
You'll understand then, okay?

699
00:47:11,381 --> 00:47:12,661
You're so cute.

700
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,921
You're so cute, Do Ra.

701
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:16,441
Bye.

702
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:20,371
Auntie.

703
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,991
I'm not a little kid, I said.

704
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:35,201
Park Do Ra.

705
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:37,081
What are you doing here this time?

706
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:41,491
Oppa, does your mom know what you're doing?

707
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,831
What...

708
00:47:42,831 --> 00:47:45,681
What? What did I do?

709
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:48,381
I was studying at the library, okay?

710
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:52,121
Whoa, you're lying now?

711
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:55,811
You've been riding the motorcycle with old Jeong Mi everywhere.

712
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:57,731
And you say a library?

713
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:03,641
Ahjumma! Dae Chung is...

714
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,811
You said you aren't dating Jeong Mi, okay?

715
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,721
That's what I'm telling you.

716
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:26,421
We're just good friends, okay?

717
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,591
So, you can never tell my mom, okay?

718
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:34,771
Fine.

719
00:48:41,491 --> 00:48:44,921
You promised you won't see Jeong Mi again, okay?

720
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,171
Okay.

721
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:49,301
You promised not to let her on the motorcycle, too, okay?

722
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,681
Okay.

723
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:54,111
Be a man and keep your promise, okay?

724
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:57,651
Okay. I will, I said.

725
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,651
By the way, Oppa...

726
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:06,281
- What? 
 - You'll be in 12th grade next year.

727
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:09,081
You can't just have fun without studying like that.

728
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:11,351
Don't you worry about your future?

729
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:13,661
How will you make a living?

730
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:16,131
I'm saying all this for your future.

731
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:21,241
Study hard and come home early from now on, okay?

732
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:27,651
Okay, I said. So, just stuff yourself with this tteokbokki.

733
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:29,211
Okay.

734
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:47,081
Oppa, I think the secret is too serious for me to keep.

735
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:50,111
So, tteokbokki won't be quite enough.

736
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,721
- What did you say? 
 - You're a good dancer.

737
00:49:53,721 --> 00:49:56,251
Do Super Junior's "Sorry, Sorry" dance just once.

738
00:49:56,251 --> 00:49:58,891
I'll make sure to keep your promise, then.

739
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:00,261
Will you keep this up?

740
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:03,241
You don't want to? Fine.

741
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,451
Ahjumma is probably still awake.

742
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:07,151
Hey.

743
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:12,601
♫  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry  ♫

744
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:18,401
♫  I, I, I fell for you, you, you first  ♫

745
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:22,761
Again, again.

746
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:26,631
♫  I'm going crazy, crazy, baby  ♫

747
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:38,441
- Here you go. Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

748
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:42,051
It's good.

749
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:43,321
Yes.

750
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:46,161
- This place really is good. 
 - Yes, it is.

751
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:53,531
Sir, this is on the house. Enjoy.

752
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:55,021
- Yes, thank you. 
 - Sure.

753
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:58,111
Ahjumma! Get us another soju.

754
00:50:58,111 --> 00:51:00,021
Okay.

755
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:02,861
Just go ahead. Cheers.

756
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:04,951
- Here's soju. 
 - Since you're cool,

757
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:06,571
- Ahjumma. 
 - we're being treated, too.

758
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:09,061
Pour me a glass.

759
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:12,151
- Pardon? 
 - Pour me a glass.

760
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:16,331
Oh, okay.

761
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:24,001
Ahjumma.

762
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,321
You look young.

763
00:51:26,321 --> 00:51:28,111
What are you doing? Let go!

764
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:31,531
Don't play hard to get working at a place like this.

765
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:33,171
I am hard to get.

766
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:35,051
So, pay me first if you want to touch me.

767
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,601
Do you think I'm a joke because I work at a place like this? Let go!

768
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:40,061
What? Give me your hand.

769
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,811
- Let go of her. 
 - Who are you?

770
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,831
What are you doing right now?

771
00:51:44,831 --> 00:51:47,761
Let go of her before I call the police.

772
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:50,061
Everyone here is watching.

773
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:57,361
Seriously, how annoying.

774
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,641
It's done. Let's eat now.

775
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,821
Wow, I'm excited.

776
00:52:39,881 --> 00:52:41,941
Hot, hot, hot!

777
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:43,961
Hot! It's hot!

778
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:46,861
- Do Jun! 
 - It hurts here.

779
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:50,021
Does it hurt a lot? What do we do?

780
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:52,771
Let me look. Let me.

781
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:56,611
Gosh, what do we do?

782
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,231
Are you okay?

783
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:00,801
- It's hot. 
 - What do we do?

784
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:03,261
- D-Does it hurt a lot? 
 - Yeah.

785
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:05,671
- Gosh, what do we do? 
 - What's this?

786
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:07,351
What's this mess?

787
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:12,061
Mom, I made ramen but spilled it on Do Jun's foot.

788
00:53:12,061 --> 00:53:14,481
It wasn't a lot, but a little...

789
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:18,541
- What do we do? 
 - It hurts, Mom!

790
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,821
Gosh, give me a break!

791
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:23,161
Gosh, seriously!

792
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:28,761
Gosh, what do we do? You've got to be kidding me.

793
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:30,591
- Let me look, Do Jun. 
 - Are you okay?

794
00:53:30,591 --> 00:53:32,771
- Let me look. Let me look. 
 - Mom.

795
00:53:32,771 --> 00:53:34,621
Let me look. Let me look.

796
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:38,941
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me! Seriously...

797
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:41,691
Gosh, seriously...

798
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:44,111
- Mom... 
 - Seriously...

799
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:47,531
- What's going on? 
 - Don't you know what time it is?

800
00:53:47,531 --> 00:53:51,611
I told you to come home early and care for your brothers, didn't I?

801
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:53,831
Seriously! Geez!

802
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:56,921
Let's all go out and die instead of living like this!

803
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:59,971
What's the point of living like this? What's the point?

804
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:03,371
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll never do it again.

805
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:05,461
I won't come home late from now on.

806
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:08,271
I'll take good care of them, too. I'm sorry.

807
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:11,641
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll never make ramen again.

808
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:13,401
It's my fault.

809
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:18,001
It's my fault. I won't say I'm hungry anymore.

810
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:22,391
I said I wanted to eat ramen.

811
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:26,541
 Your dad is the worst man in this world. 

812
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:29,781
 How could he leave us behind? 

813
00:54:29,781 --> 00:54:33,201
 How am I supposed to live? How? 

814
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:36,821
 I'm sorry, Mom. I'll never do it again. 

815
00:54:36,821 --> 00:54:39,941
 While you're at work, 

816
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:42,951
 I'll cook and do the laundry, too. 

817
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:46,951
 Don't cry, Mom. I'll grow up quickly... 

818
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,541
Park Do Ra.

819
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:09,931
Oppa.

820
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:13,341
I'll give you a ride to the school.

821
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:16,091
Hop on.

822
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:23,651
Do Ra, hold my waist tightly.

823
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:26,081
You won't fall that way, okay?

824
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:27,691
Okay.

825
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:37,081
 What's this? 

826
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:39,891
 He really is my prince. 

827
00:55:39,891 --> 00:55:42,121
 Being on his bike... 

828
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:47,111
 turned my sad and depressing mood into a fluffy and pink one. 

829
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:51,471
 Yes, he likes me, too. 

830
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:56,141
 That's why he waited for me to give me a bike ride. 

831
00:55:56,141 --> 00:56:00,561
 I'll forever remember our first date today. 

832
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:03,821
 This is how our love is bubbling up. 

833
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:19,271
Sir.

834
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:23,191
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

835
00:56:23,191 --> 00:56:25,801
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

836
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:30,961
Please don't tell anyone that I work there.

837
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:34,201
I know. Don't worry.

838
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:36,511
Well, then.

839
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:47,321
- Dad. 
 - Hey.

840
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,251
What did you talk about with Ms. Baek?

841
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:50,851
We just said hello.

842
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:53,231
- Is it coffee? 
 - Yes.

843
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:56,251
I only added a half spoonful of sugar today.

844
00:56:56,251 --> 00:56:59,281
You can't drink it too sweet. It's bad for you.

845
00:56:59,281 --> 00:57:01,291
Why do you keep reducing it?

846
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:04,881
A full spoon and a half spoon aren't that different.

847
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:09,111
It's still good, right?

848
00:57:09,111 --> 00:57:12,011
My coffee is the best in the world, right?

849
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,131
It's the best.

850
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:58,001
My gosh, Dae Chung.

851
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,881
I knew it was your car.

852
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:04,981
Are you here to see Mom?

853
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,631
Why are you out here instead of going in?

854
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:09,801
Well, it's something else today.

855
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:11,901
I was running an errand in the area, and...

856
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:14,751
I... I got a call. So I was on the phone for a moment.

857
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:16,581
I see.

858
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:22,311
Did you do well on your exam? You look happy.

859
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:25,701
I think I just did okay.

860
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:28,701
How did you know I had an exam, by the way?

861
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:34,801
Huh? Well, everyone's been freaking out about the exam lately.

862
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:37,561
Excuse me.

863
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:40,861
Dae Chung.

864
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,271
Do you want this?

865
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:45,531
I think it will fit you.

866
00:58:45,531 --> 00:58:47,351
What's this?

867
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:51,161
I got it as a sample but thought it would fit you.

868
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:54,541
Ahjumma, this brand is really popular these days.

869
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:57,781
I really wanted one, but it was so expensive.

870
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:00,211
So, I couldn't even ask my mom.

871
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,471
Are you sure I can wear this, Ahjumma?

872
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,781
Yes.

873
00:59:03,781 --> 00:59:06,571
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

874
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:17,011
Gosh, it's a large size, and you're big enough already.

875
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,071
You grew a lot, Dae Chung.

876
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:22,711
Do You think I look okay?

877
00:59:22,711 --> 00:59:26,091
Yes, it suits you well. Very cool.

878
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:28,501
Ahjumma, I really appreciate it.

879
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:32,181
I'll become successful and return the favor.

880
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:36,071
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

881
00:59:39,601 --> 00:59:42,191
I'll get going now. Get home safely.

882
00:59:42,191 --> 00:59:45,401
- Thank you. Take care. 
 - Bye.

883
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:16,391
Son.

884
01:00:17,621 --> 01:00:19,481
Oh, my.

885
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:23,371
What's that, Go Dae Chung? Where did you get that jacket?

886
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:26,031
What do you think, Mom?

887
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,221
Don't you think your son looks cool?

888
01:00:29,221 --> 01:00:31,841
This is an expensive brand.

889
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:35,551
This must cost a pretty penny.

890
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:39,251
My gosh, this is brand new.

891
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:42,511
Where... Where did you get this expensive jacket?

892
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:44,631
You'd better be honest with me, okay?

893
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,451
By chance...

894
01:00:46,451 --> 01:00:48,701
By chance... By chance, what?

895
01:00:48,701 --> 01:00:51,581
What kind of negative thoughts are you having right now?

896
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:56,581
Do you think I, Go Dae Chung, stole money from you?

897
01:00:56,581 --> 01:00:59,651
Soo Yeon Ahjumma got it for me, okay?

898
01:00:59,651 --> 01:01:02,981
What? Soo Yeon?

899
01:01:10,951 --> 01:01:12,831
Hey, it's me, Seon Yeong.

900
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:17,781
Soo Yeon, Dae Chung told me you were in front of our house today.

901
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:20,131
Why didn't you call me, then?

902
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:24,251
Well, I was running an errand around there

903
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:26,631
and I got a call while passing by, so I pulled over.

904
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:29,151
But Dae Chung recognized my car and said hello.

905
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,371
Oh, I see.

906
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:33,981
Hey, but still.

907
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:38,421
You can't just leave without stopping by if you were all the way here.

908
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:42,021
Jin Taek said he was coming home early today.

909
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:43,981
I'll make sure to call next time.

910
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:50,701
Okay. By the way, why did you give Dae Chung such an expensive jacket? You'd spoil him.

911
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:52,471
Gosh, not at all.

912
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:56,381
He won't get spoiled for something like that.

913
01:01:56,381 --> 01:02:00,841
I got it as a sample, but no one in my family could wear it.

914
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:02,571
I don't have a son, either.

915
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:06,781
I let him try it on since I ran into him, and it fit him perfectly.

916
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:12,871
Did he like it, by the way?

917
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:14,281
Isn't it obvious?

918
01:02:14,281 --> 01:02:17,801
He got all excited and did a fashion show before he left.

919
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:21,281
He said he'll study better because of the jacket today.

920
01:02:22,091 --> 01:02:27,301
Really? I'm so happy that he likes it.

921
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:30,411
Okay, Seon Yeong. Let's talk later.

922
01:02:30,411 --> 01:02:32,271
Bye.

923
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:51,691
Mom.

924
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:57,151
Princess, please knock.

925
01:02:57,151 --> 01:02:59,561
Sorry. What are you doing, Mom?

926
01:02:59,561 --> 01:03:01,261
Huh?

927
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,251
What photo were you looking at?

928
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:04,881
Was it a photo of me?

929
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,411
Yes, it was one of you.

930
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:11,861
Because I'm so pretty and cute?

931
01:03:11,861 --> 01:03:18,141
Yes. Because you're so pretty, Ma Ri.

932
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:23,540
My Ma Ri is so pretty. The prettiest in the world.

933
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:26,741
   

934
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:30,191
- See you. 
 - Bye.

935
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:46,081
He actually danced because I told him to.

936
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:48,041
He's so cute.

937
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,881
What a dummy.

938
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:08,401
What's that? That's...

939
01:04:15,191 --> 01:04:18,621
Sir. Sir, please follow that motorcycle!

940
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,151
Hurry, Sir!

941
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:22,961
Are you crazy? Did you rent this bus?

942
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:26,651
- Pardon? 
 - Go sit down. You'll get hurt.

943
01:04:26,651 --> 01:04:28,621
I'm sorry.

944
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:39,261
He promised that he'd never see her again.

945
01:04:40,271 --> 01:04:42,481
How could he do this?

946
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:45,471
How could he lie to me?

947
01:04:47,861 --> 01:04:49,851
Just wait and see.

948
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:52,251
I'll never forgive you.

949
01:04:56,051 --> 01:05:01,211
Gosh, Do Ra. What are you talking about right now?

950
01:05:01,211 --> 01:05:05,381
Dae Chung was riding a motorcycle with a woman?

951
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:09,631
Yes, she's much older than him, too.

952
01:05:10,671 --> 01:05:14,141
What kind of nonsense is that?

953
01:05:14,841 --> 01:05:18,681
Do Ra, he doesn't have a motorcycle.

954
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:22,011
He doesn't even know how to ride one.

955
01:05:22,011 --> 01:05:26,281
 This is how clueless moms are about their children. 

956
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:31,921
 Well, my mom has no idea I like Dae Chung, either. 

957
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:36,471
Hey, Do Ra. What's wrong?

958
01:05:36,471 --> 01:05:38,131
What's going on?

959
01:05:38,131 --> 01:05:43,551
Ahjumma, what would you do if everything I said were true?

960
01:05:43,551 --> 01:05:47,041
Are you kidding? What are you saying?

961
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:54,580
   

962
01:06:09,471 --> 01:06:11,861
Good night, Noona.

963
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:14,541
Good night, Dae Chung.

964
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,801
Hold on.

965
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:35,021
To celebrate the first snow this year...

966
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,341
Hey!

967
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:58,001
What are you... What are you doing to my son right now?

968
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:02,591
- Well... 
 - You crazy bitch! Crazy bitch!

969
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:09,371
What are you doing? What are you doing?

970
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:11,921
My son is a high school student.

971
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:14,731
Do you know what your niece did to my son?

972
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,961
- Help! 
 - Stop, Mom. Stop.

973
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:20,301
How dare you, you brat.

974
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:22,681
What have you been doing?

975
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:26,851
Gosh, I won't let this slide. Hey!

976
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:31,671
Wow, Ahjumma is freaking scary.

977
01:07:31,671 --> 01:07:33,811
She totally lost it.

978
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:56,360


979
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:18,261
   

980
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,501
   

981
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:29,091
♫  You showed up, made my heart flutter, and got me excited over and over again  ♫

982
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:32,651
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

983
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:35,881
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

984
01:08:35,881 --> 01:08:40,801
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

985
01:08:48,281 --> 01:08:53,361
♫  The sky is clearer than usual, and my feet feel light  ♫

986
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:55,411
 What are you doing in here, Ms. Baek? 

987
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:57,261
 Did you steal from our house just now? 

988
01:08:57,261 --> 01:08:59,521
 Do you think I want to live like this? 

989
01:08:59,521 --> 01:09:04,231
 Do you think I want to live like this? 

990
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:06,061
 He seems very capable. 

991
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:11,141
 He must have savings from being a principal, and he gets a pension regularly, too. 

992
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:12,431
 Where could all that money go? 

993
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:16,281
 How dare you tear us apart? Why? 

994
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:20,671
 How dare an adopted child cause a scene like this? 

995
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:23,521
 Who am I if I'm not your son? 

996
01:09:23,521 --> 01:09:25,821
 Where did I come from?
