1
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:51,735
I have no interest in breaking up with Ms. Kim.

2
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,075
   

3
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:57,995
And we're even considering getting married.

4
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:02,545
What? Marry?

5
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:06,105
Who says you can marry her?

6
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:12,185
President Go, you'd marry her?

7
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:13,505
Is that true?

8
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,685
Yes, it is.

9
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:20,585
We promised to get married after the drama is off the air.

10
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:26,515
Kim Ji Yeong and I aren't done yet!

11
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,305
But...

12
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,735
how dare you try to marry my woman?

13
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:34,385
Hyung, this is how he is.

14
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,185
But you want someone like him as your adoptive son?

15
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:41,265
A scoundrel who steals someone else's woman?

16
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,945
Gong Jin Dan, watch what you say.

17
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,135
Hyung, why won't you listen to me?

18
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:50,500
Why do you only do this to me?

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,260


20
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,005
President Go,

21
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:02,805
is everything you said true?

22
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:07,235
Will you really marry that lady?

23
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:10,145
Yes, that's correct.

24
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,215
I mean...

25
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:17,665
how could this be?

26
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:26,035
Kim Ji Yeong.

27
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,535
Are you getting married, by chance?

28
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:32,945
Did you really decide to marry that Go Pil Sung bastard?

29
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,535
Yes, I did.

30
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,465
Why do you ask?

31
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:40,575
"Why do you ask?"

32
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:43,905
Hey, how could you get married?

33
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,775
Who says you can get married? To someone else?

34
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,115
I'm marrying whomever I want to marry.

35
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,885
Why would you ask something so obvious?

36
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:52,885
How does that concern you?

37
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,955
It concerns me!

38
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,795
Hey, you and I aren't done yet.

39
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:59,835
I'm not done.

40
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:02,545
But what do you mean, you're getting married?

41
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:06,580
You're seriously delusional, aren't you?

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,970
W-What...

43
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,265
What did you say?

44
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,885
You aren't Kim Ji Yeong, are you?

45
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:20,635
I don't think you're the same Kim Ji Yeong anymore.

46
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:24,685
Yes, I'm Kang Ji Yeong, not Kim Ji Yeong.

47
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,185
Happy now?

48
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:29,365
Wow, what am I supposed to do with you?

49
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:32,645
I'll sue you for emotional and physical damage.

50
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,365
- You'd better be ready, okay? 
 - Do as you'd like.

51
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:38,625
Hey,

52
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,345
what's with this ring?

53
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,215
Did Go Pil Sung give you this ring?

54
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:47,625
- Let go! 
 - You returned the necklace I sent, but what's with the ring?

55
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,725
Did my gift have shit on it or something?

56
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:51,485
Come here. Take it off.

57
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:53,595
Take it off.

58
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:01,185
If you don't move now, I'll report you.

59
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:09,425
Okay, fine.

60
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:15,285
I'll keep an eye on you and see if you could marry him.

61
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:46,915
Jin Dan, what are you doing here?

62
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,765
I have something to do.

63
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:52,275
You do what you need to do, Mom.

64
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,955
Hyung!

65
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,415
Jin Dan, what's wrong with you?

66
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:04,185
I'm really disappointed in you, Hyung.

67
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:09,275
You're so smiley and soft with Go Pil Sung, who isn't related to you at all.

68
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,565
And how could you do this to me, your brother?

69
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:17,455
Our late father, Chairman Gong Dae Gil, must be crying bloody tears.

70
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:23,645
If you meet Father later, I'm sure you'll get slapped in the face by him.

71
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:27,425
Hyung, just keep that in mind, okay?

72
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:32,105
What's going on? What's wrong, Jin Dan?

73
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:36,045
He says Go Pil Sung and I will be a family,

74
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,290
but how does that make sense?

75
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:41,915
Let me make it clear one more time.

76
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,385
If you want to adopt Go Pil Sung,

77
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,765
Kim Ji Yeong and Go Pil Sung had better not get married or cancel the adoption.

78
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,615
Just do one or the other, okay?

79
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:57,205
W-What's he talking about?

80
00:05:57,205 --> 00:06:00,975
Did Pil Sung really say he'd marry that lady?

81
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:04,595
I thought he broke up with her.

82
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,875
And Jin Dan is freaking out so much.

83
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:11,195
He can't marry that lady. It makes no sense.

84
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:14,345
I didn't understand the situation, either.

85
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:17,245
So, I just said "okay" and left.

86
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,265
You can't say that. What's wrong with you?

87
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:23,995
You should've said no immediately.

88
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:25,895
What right do I have to do that?

89
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:29,515
He's not even my son officially yet.

90
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,875
But President Go is determined.

91
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,775
Once "Seoul Lady" gets off the air, he says they'll get married.

92
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:41,095
Gosh, did he really?

93
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:42,785
What?

94
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,735
It's true that you said all that?

95
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,975
You'll marry Kim Ji Yeong?

96
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:51,765
Yes.

97
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,185
Wait...

98
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,915
how could you...

99
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:01,105
How could you do this without discussing it with us?

100
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:07,205
I was going to tell you, Father, Grandma, and Aunt today officially,

101
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:09,475
but I met the Chairman unexpectedly.

102
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,925
So, I told him first.

103
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:15,745
I...

104
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:19,505
decided to marry Ji Yeong.

105
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:24,865
If so, you already discussed this with her?

106
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:28,315
Did she say she'd marry you?

107
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,385
Yes.

108
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:35,040
We decided to get married once this drama is off the air.

109
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:42,255
Wasn't there an article about her and President Gong's engagement recently?

110
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,575
How could she try to marry you now?

111
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:49,695
Gosh, she's unbelievably shameless.

112
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:52,675
Grandma, those articles were wrong.

113
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:55,425
So, please don't get the wrong idea.

114
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,135
I believe Ji Yeong.

115
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,405
What do you mean, believe her?

116
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:04,385
President Gong came when she lived in the rental unit and threw a tantrum while drunk because of her.

117
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:06,505
We all saw that.

118
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,895
Pil Sung, you can't marry her.

119
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:12,695
If you become their adoptive son,

120
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,635
President Gong will be your uncle.

121
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:18,365
That can never happen.

122
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:22,385
Nothing is going on between Ji Yeong and President Gong anymore.

123
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:26,255
There was a bit of misunderstanding, but it's all sorted out now.

124
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,075
So you don't have to worry about that anymore.

125
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,135
Did you two get yourselves in trouble?

126
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:34,905
Is she pregnant?

127
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:37,975
Is that why you're being so desperate?

128
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,475
Grandma,

129
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,175
don't imagine something so silly.

130
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:51,475
Mom, Father, Grandma, and Aunt.

131
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,155
You've always trusted and supported me.

132
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:58,985
Please trust and support me this time, too.

133
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:04,175
I'll believe you will and go upstairs.

134
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:11,265
Hey, hey!

135
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:15,035
Seon Yeong, Hyeon Cheol, why won't you say anything?

136
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,955
Will you just let him do that?

137
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:22,745
Gosh, this is just so unbelievable.

138
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,215
I'm speechless because I'm shocked.

139
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:29,495
Aigoo, he's out of his mind, isn't he?

140
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:36,325
Seon Yeong, Hyeon Cheol, what if... his adoption gets canceled at this rate?

141
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:41,595
For Chairman Gong, the woman his brother dated will become his daughter-in-law.

142
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,935
He won't be so happy about that.

143
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,435
What on earth is going on, anyway?

144
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:50,185
How could he ruin this at the end?

145
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:53,905
I can never allow this marriage. I can never!

146
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,465
Never.

147
00:09:55,465 --> 00:10:00,295
 Pil Sung must be doing this because he knows she's Do Ra. 

148
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:04,095
 Should I reveal the fact she's Park Do Ra or not? 

149
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:07,045
 Gosh, what do I do? 

150
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,125
 What are you up to? 

151
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,445
I was reading the script.

152
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:17,125
I can't believe it's the last shoot already. I'm so nervous.

153
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,325
How about you? What are you up to?

154
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:22,285
I took a shower at home after tending to something.

155
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,535
I called because I was curious what my baby chick was up to.

156
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:29,305
Oppa, please stop calling me a baby chick.

157
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,615
It gives me the chills.

158
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:35,745
You're like a small, cute, fluffy, and pretty baby chick to me.

159
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,685
What's wrong with that?

160
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:43,345
I wish I could carry you around in my pocket like a baby chick.

161
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,965
I'm afraid someone might overhear us.

162
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:50,535
If they did, they'd call you a hopeless fool.

163
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,145
Let them say whatever.

164
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:56,365
I'm calling my baby chick a baby chick. What will they do about it?

165
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:01,395
And you're as small, cute, and pretty like a baby chick.

166
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,105
So, stop resisting.

167
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,265
 Just accept it and get used to it. 

168
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,415
What did you say?

169
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,875
Ji Yeong,

170
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:18,465
you know it won't be easy for us to get married, right?

171
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:23,525
 No matter what people say, and no matter what happens, 

172
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:26,350
we won't let that shake us up, okay?

173
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,595
You know, right?

174
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,455
Yes.

175
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:52,285
- Have you been well? 
 - Whatever. Just sit down.

176
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:54,815
We aren't well.

177
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:07,285
I heard you and Pil Sung are getting married.

178
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:09,075
Is that true?

179
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,985
Yes.

180
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:19,555
Excuse me, lady, how could you shamelessly say "yes" in front of us?

181
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,275
You aren't supposed to be with Pil Sung.

182
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,935
You aren't just dating him, but you're marrying him?

183
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,785
Do you have no conscience at all?

184
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:32,135
You and President Gong's engagement articles came out just a few days ago.

185
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:35,145
How could you marry Pil Sung now?

186
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,305
What kind of person are you, exactly?

187
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:40,845
Ma'am, those articles are wrong.

188
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,085
President Gong released those articles on his own.

189
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:47,585
Those articles would still be up if they were true.

190
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,150
You'll see if you search for it.

191
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,780
They've all been taken down.

192
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:55,535
Please don't be mistaken about that.

193
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:59,415
Gosh, look how you're lying shamelessly.

194
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:03,525
We witnessed you and President Gong together many times.

195
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,835
Mother, please be quiet.

196
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,240
So?

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,880
Are you saying you'll actually marry Pil Sung?

198
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,395
Yes.

199
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,085
Look, lady!

200
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:19,095
If you want to get married so much, marry President Gong.

201
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:21,675
You released the engagement article with him.

202
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,125
Why are you trying to marry Pil Sung?

203
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,325
I heard you're a successful actor now.

204
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:33,175
You're trying to make things work with him because you're successful now.

205
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:35,755
Listen to me carefully.

206
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:39,535
We don't want you to even if you were more successful.

207
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,145
We'll never allow it.

208
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:46,805
It's not because you're from the countryside and lost your parents early.

209
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:51,835
We're against it because we don't like how you've been behaving.

210
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,065
So, don't ever dream of marrying him.

211
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,755
Understand?

212
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:58,655
Let's go, Seon Yeong.

213
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,665
Seriously.

214
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:05,085
Why do you make me say this to you?

215
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,335
Mom.

216
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,540
And President Jang, too?

217
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,790
What's going on?

218
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:35,825
Don't you know why we're here?

219
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,345
We even came together for a reason.

220
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:44,765
I dislike Kim Ji Yeong even more after I saw her today.

221
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:47,355
Doesn't she have any conscience?

222
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:50,825
I asked if she'd marry you, and she said "yes" immediately.

223
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,515
How could she say "yes" to me so quickly?

224
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,205
Did you meet with Ji Yeong, Mom?

225
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,755
Yes, I did.

226
00:14:57,755 --> 00:15:01,285
You announced the wedding out of nowhere. How could I not?

227
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:04,095
Yes, President Go.

228
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:07,235
Anyone would disagree with this wedding.

229
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:11,785
Jin Dan still hasn't moved on from her yet.

230
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,515
And I heard it's not ever yet.

231
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,475
How could you marry her?

232
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,965
I told you so many times it's not true.

233
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:22,675
Why do you only believe President Gong?

234
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:26,835
I hate to say this, but I will.

235
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,485
She rejected him, but President Gong sent a coffee truck.

236
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:33,005
He released the engagement article on his own, and he harasses her all the time.

237
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:37,705
Ji Yeong is a victim of dating abuse.

238
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,435
You should empathize and defend her. But instead,

239
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:43,935
why do you criticize her?

240
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:49,165
So, are you saying you'll really marry her?

241
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,595
Yes.

242
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,375
I told you I will.

243
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,115
Really?

244
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,915
We're all against it.

245
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,735
But you'll do it, anyway?

246
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,795
Okay, fine.

247
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:08,765
Marry her and live happily in the mountains together.

248
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:14,905
Let's see how happy you'd be after abandoning your family.

249
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:18,585
I won't go to your wedding!

250
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,495
I won't go to your wedding, either.

251
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:24,485
I also can't approve of this wedding.

252
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,115
Mom,

253
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,315
President Jang,

254
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:37,905
please try to be fond of Ji Yeong.

255
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:40,515
She's someone I like.

256
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:41,845
I don't want to.

257
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,715
I don't want to!

258
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,515
I just can't bring myself to like her.

259
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:52,825
So, Pil Sung, please try to reconsider it.

260
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,915
I decided to marry Ji Yeong.

261
00:16:57,915 --> 00:16:59,785
I won't change my mind.

262
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,445
So, please don't say this to me anymore.

263
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:07,815
I would've treated you to a tasty meal if it wasn't for this.

264
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:10,405
I no longer feel like doing that anymore.

265
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,985
Please enjoy your meal together.

266
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:16,035
Gosh.

267
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,175
My goodness.

268
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:19,685
That...

269
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,965
That crazy bastard.

270
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:29,885
He must've lost his mind by meeting the wrong woman.

271
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:33,885
What's wrong with Pil Sung?

272
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,765
He didn't used to be like this.

273
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:43,315
I heard you met my mom.

274
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,215
Why didn't you tell me?

275
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:51,155
I didn't want you to worry about it.

276
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,445
Tell me if that happens again.

277
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,865
Don't torture yourself alone.

278
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,825
I don't want you to struggle alone. Okay?

279
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:06,255
Don't forget we promised not to waver.

280
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,155
Oppa,

281
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,625
you know...

282
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:17,425
I don't want to waver,

283
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:21,165
but I feel bad for you again.

284
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:26,245
We should get married with blessings,

285
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,265
but because of me...

286
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,035
Kim Ji Yeong,

287
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:33,985
you promised not to say stuff like that.

288
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:39,695
And I feel guilty marrying you without telling your family I'm Park Do Ra.

289
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:44,195
If they find out I'm Park Do Ra, what would they say?

290
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,095
I explained everything.

291
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:48,725
That's why we need to get married.

292
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:52,885
You can't reveal you're Park Do Ra now,

293
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:57,505
but if that happens someday, I'll protect you by your side.

294
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,515
That's why I'm marrying you.

295
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,235
I'll never...

296
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,125
leave you alone again.

297
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,425
Oppa.

298
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:13,925
So, don't forget we promised to... never waver,

299
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,605
okay?

300
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:19,675
Even if it's just for me, okay?

301
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,545
Okay.

302
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:25,445
I won't.

303
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,155
I won't waver.

304
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:40,735
If we weren't on set,

305
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,825
I would've given my baby chick a hug.

306
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:51,505
Why don't you say you want to carry me in your pocket again?

307
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:22,985
Do Joon, I think of you every day.

308
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,875
Don't you miss me?

309
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,895
How could you not call me once?

310
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:35,315
Honey, I told you to move out of that place. Why won't you?

311
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:37,275
When will you move out?

312
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,195
I want to just keep living there.

313
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,935
What are you talking about?

314
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,025
I said they're our enemies.

315
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:47,175
I know, but I thought we needed to find a flaw in their son to cancel the adoption.

316
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,975
It'd be better if I stayed there, then.

317
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:52,055
Gosh, you're right.

318
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:55,745
- But I heard you fought with Hyeon Cheol. 
 - I can just apologize.

319
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:58,555
I can do that for Jin Dan.

320
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:01,825
And isn't that house better for you to stay out of Jin Dan's radar?

321
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:04,045
Not at all. It's more uncomfortable there.

322
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:06,165
They don't think we're cousins.

323
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,695
They seemed to be suspicious of us.

324
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,055
We still need to insist we're cousins.

325
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,515
We can come clean if we get caught.

326
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,945
Don't you think? What are we, criminals?

327
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:17,645
Is that so? I suppose.

328
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:28,055
Who the hell are you? Drive properly!

329
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,125
Oh, no!

330
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:38,345
Hey, you.

331
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,715
I warned you not to see my mom, didn't I?

332
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,715
I said if you see her again, I won't just sit still.

333
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:47,605
Jin Dan, what are you doing right now?

334
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:57,455
Mom.

335
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,695
Did you hit me just now?

336
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,175
I told you.

337
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:04,015
You can't treat him like this.

338
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:05,665
He's my first love.

339
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:08,565
He'd become your stepfather.

340
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,885
How could you do this to me, Mom?

341
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:16,635
Fine, live however you want with this gold digger!

342
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:24,032
Jin Dan!

343
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:27,504
Jin Dan! Jin Dan!

344
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:29,634
    
  Thank you. 

345
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:32,305
Take care.

346
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:51,812
 Father, would you like to meet me for soju today? 

347
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,842
Pil Sung.

348
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:09,752
I wish I could be on your side,

349
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:13,302
but no matter how much I think, this marriage feels wrong.

350
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:21,562
Father, there's a reason I need to marry her.

351
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:23,682
What reason?

352
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:26,762
Father...

353
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,412
don't be shocked.

354
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,662
To be honest,

355
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:37,772
Ji Yeong is... Do Ra.

356
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,582
Park Do Ra.

357
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:46,072
Hey, what are you talking about?

358
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:50,922
Yes, you suffered a lot since Park Do Ra died.

359
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:53,412
I'm well aware of that.

360
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,372
But Kim Ji Yeong is Kim Ji Yeong.

361
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:57,132
She's not Park Do Ra.

362
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,432
Get it together, Pil Sung.

363
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:01,842
Father, I know it's hard to believe.

364
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:03,340
It sounds ridiculous.

365
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,570
But it's true.

366
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:09,752
It's true that Do Ra went to the seaside to die.

367
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,862
But she miraculously survived.

368
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,382
She was washed up to the shore, and an old lady rescued her.

369
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:20,552
She cared for Ji Yeong, thinking she was her lost granddaughter.

370
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:24,082
How does that make sense?

371
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:26,932
She looks different, though.

372
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:31,712
Because she was tossed around in the ocean, her face and body were wounded and damaged.

373
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,552
She went through many reconstruction surgeries.

374
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,012
That's why her face changed.

375
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:39,902
I-Is that true?

376
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:41,532
Yes.

377
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:44,062
But she lost her memory in that accident.

378
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:47,662
She didn't know she was Park Do Ra until recently.

379
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:50,662
She really believed she was the old lady's granddaughter, Kim Ji Yeong.

380
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:53,132
That's why she became an actor, too.

381
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:59,562
But she recently got her memory back and finally found out she was Park Do Ra.

382
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:05,142
How could that be?

383
00:25:09,752 --> 00:25:11,432
Father,

384
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:15,262
I finally reunited with Do Ra.

385
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:18,942
You know, too.

386
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:24,202
I've been living in pain ever since Do Ra died.

387
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:29,422
I thought if I could see Do Ra once,

388
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:32,192
I could die happily at the time.

389
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:34,962
But Do Ra came back alive.

390
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,802
I can't be apart from her anymore.

391
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,522
I can never let go of her hand.

392
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:45,922
When she was suffering the most, I couldn't protect her.

393
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:49,862
I finally want to protect her now.

394
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:56,434
People would criticize her if they found out she's Park Do Ra.

395
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:01,484
I want to protect her by her side, then.

396
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:06,954
I don't want her to face all of that alone again.

397
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,444
Yes.

398
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:25,044
Yes, Pil Sung.

399
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:30,904
I understand what you mean.

400
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:34,974
I think I would've done the same.

401
00:26:35,624 --> 00:26:41,244
I understand your position completely, okay?

402
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:48,864
It's important for our family to approve this marriage,

403
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:52,524
but Chairman Gong should also know all of this.

404
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:56,934
You agreed to become his adoptive son.

405
00:26:56,934 --> 00:27:03,424
But if the world finds out your Kim Ji Yeong is Park Do Ra,

406
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:05,944
Chairman Gong would be in such shock

407
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:11,834
and APP Group might suffer damage because of you.

408
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,324
I understand what you mean.

409
00:27:21,314 --> 00:27:25,654
Who else knows Kim Ji Yeong is Park Do Ra?

410
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:29,564
Myself, Do Ra's family, and you.

411
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,724
But only I know she got her memory back.

412
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:36,624
So, she decided to live as Kim Ji Yeong before she cleared her name.

413
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:40,814
Okay... No one... better not know about this.

414
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:46,294
Let's not tell Mom, Grandma, and Myeong Dong for now.

415
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:51,454
And once she clears her name

416
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:53,664
and when the time is right,

417
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:56,754
let's tell them then.

418
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:58,874
Okay, Father.

419
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:04,974
I'd like you to support us, even if it's only you.

420
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,634
   

421
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:41,532
   

422
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:48,592
   

423
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:57,904
Everything you just told me...

424
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:00,734
Is it all true?

425
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,694
Yes.

426
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:11,674
My goodness.

427
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:14,674
How could that be?

428
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,822
I personally hope...

429
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:25,802
she continues to live as Kim Ji Yeong without anyone knowing.

430
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:29,122
But if the fact that she's Park Do Ra gets revealed,

431
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:33,742
I'm worried it might cause damage to APP Group and you.

432
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:36,762
That's why I'm telling you in advance.

433
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:42,832
To be honest, both your parents and my wife are against it.

434
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:49,132
And I also wasn't happy about you marrying her for many reasons.

435
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:52,102
Hearing you now,

436
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:56,952
I really think you shouldn't marry her.

437
00:29:56,952 --> 00:30:01,072
I was going to adopt you

438
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:06,382
regardless of any risk for Ma Ri's sake.

439
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:11,092
But I can't accept this situation.

440
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:16,132
And her mother, with a gambling addiction, bothers me, too.

441
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:19,332
If you become my adoptive son,

442
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:22,512
Kim Ji Yeong will become my daughter-in-law.

443
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:26,232
I cannot accept that.

444
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:33,682
What if people find out she's Park Do Ra?

445
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:37,682
They won't leave you alone, either.

446
00:30:38,412 --> 00:30:42,742
As you said, if she was framed for prostitution,

447
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:45,360
no one would understand

448
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,190
why she was an actor under the name Kim Ji Yeong.

449
00:30:50,972 --> 00:30:54,202
The whole world would criticize her.

450
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,682
And you'd be criticized, too.

451
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:02,142
I think you should...

452
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:07,852
break up with her now.

453
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,392
Chairman,

454
00:31:18,232 --> 00:31:23,262
I... couldn't protect Do Ra before she died.

455
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,452
But the moment she came back,

456
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:33,392
I promised myself not to let go of her again.

457
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:37,502
If this is an issue,

458
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:41,392
you can cancel the adoption.

459
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:46,982
I don't ever want you to suffer damage from this.

460
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:49,292
That's why I'm telling you now.

461
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:57,122
Then,

462
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,342
do you mean...

463
00:32:01,182 --> 00:32:05,922
you won't give up on her even if you don't get adopted?

464
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:10,812
Yes, that's correct.

465
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:19,372
Then, we have no choice.

466
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:24,722
Because I sincerely care for you, trust you, and like you,

467
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:28,522
I wanted to adopt you as my son,

468
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:34,432
but I'm responsible for thousands of employees

469
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:38,052
and their families, too.

470
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:42,632
If you become my son,

471
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:47,032
my daughter-in-law would become the face of the company.

472
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,262
I can't take a risk like this.

473
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:53,002
I cannot allow...

474
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:58,182
a woman like that to become our daughter-in-law.

475
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:03,122
Whether you become my adoptive son or not,

476
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:09,082
you can't keep her by your side for your sake.

477
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:14,282
I'll pretend...

478
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:18,052
I didn't hear any of this.

479
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:23,422
You can leave.

480
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:28,222
I'm sorry, Chairman.

481
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:16,092
Okay, what's the important thing you need to tell us?

482
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:20,322
To be honest,

483
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,242
I got my memory back.

484
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:29,932
Oppa, aren't you happy to see me?

485
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:32,782
Yes, I'm really happy to see you.

486
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:35,272
Was it fun fooling me together?

487
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,632
What? What's with your reaction?

488
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:39,752
He knows, too, Noona.

489
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:41,612
I told him because he noticed before.

490
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,652
- Really? 
 - Yes.

491
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:44,412
Why did you pretend you didn't know, then?

492
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:47,202
It seemed like you weren't telling me because of Mom.

493
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:49,282
And you have to live as Ji Yeong.

494
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:51,852
What's the point of acknowledging it?

495
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:53,772
I'm sorry, Oppa.

496
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:56,032
You lived with Mom.

497
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,532
I didn't want you to tell her by mistake.

498
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:00,872
I know. I know.

499
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:03,682
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

500
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:05,292
No.

501
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,772
- There's something else. 
 - What is it?

502
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,542
What is it? Come on and tell us.

503
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,582
I'm...

504
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:16,632
getting married.

505
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:17,922
- Married? 
 - What?

506
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:20,582
- Marry who? 
 - All of a sudden?

507
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:22,782
Pil Sung Oppa.

508
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:28,662
Since I got my memory back, I realized I never liked anyone else.

509
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:31,732
Pil Sung was the only person I ever liked.

510
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:36,142
But I thought I liked President Gong because of Mom.

511
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:38,972
I see.

512
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,152
I must've been mistaken, then.

513
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:46,132
Does Pil Sung know you got your memory back?

514
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,812
Yes.

515
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:51,562
You two must be meant to be.

516
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:56,312
He liked you when you were Do Ra and Ji Yeong.

517
00:35:56,312 --> 00:35:59,802
Does his family know you're Do Ra?

518
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,402
They don't.

519
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:06,942
Only Pil Sung and you two know I'm Do Ra.

520
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:12,892
Yes, you need to keep living as Ji Yeong.

521
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:20,632
I can get married, then, right?

522
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Of course, you can.

523
00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:27,182
Pil Sung made a difficult decision.

524
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:30,432
It'd be difficult for him if people find out you're Do Ra.

525
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:32,002
I know.

526
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:34,732
Pil Sung is the real deal.

527
00:36:34,732 --> 00:36:36,572
He's cool.

528
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:39,742
And...

529
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:42,142
I'm so thankful to him.

530
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,172
Why are they together?

531
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,972
Why is Ji Yeong locking arms with Mr. Park?

532
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:10,272
He's not Go Pil Sung.

533
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:15,192
Ji Yeong and President Baek lived together,

534
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:18,502
but Mr. Park cares for her grandma, too.

535
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:21,072
What's going on?

536
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,642
President Baek isn't even there.

537
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:30,132
Wasn't this 200 won?

538
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:33,562
- 200 won? 200 won? 
 - What year do you think it is?

539
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:36,422
I'm serious.

540
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:43,442
President Baek isn't even there.

541
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:46,862
Why are her sons going into their place?

542
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:50,022
Only Ji Yeong and her grandma live there.

543
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:52,562
Hold on.

544
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:57,192
Is there something going on with Ji Yeong and those two sons?

545
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:01,262
How strange.

546
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:05,623
Something... is very strange.

547
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:08,060
Gosh, seriously.

548
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,500
Why are you coming over so late, President Gong?

549
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,270
I'm not feeling well right now.

550
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,160
Just get to the point and leave.

551
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,470
Unless you'd give me money.

552
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,700
There's something I want to ask you, President Baek.

553
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,880
You live here,

554
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,950
but why do your sons live with Kim Ji Yeong?

555
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,460
Why do you need to know that?

556
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,080
Do I have to tell you that now?

557
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,490
Are you here to ask me that?

558
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,310
Well...

559
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,600
that's one of the reasons.

560
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,600
By the way, I'm so disappointed in you.

561
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,890
You owe me so much. How could you do this to me?

562
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,160
What did I do?

563
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,970
How could you let Ji Yeong and Go Pil Sung marry?

564
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,210
Is that why you paid me 500 million back?

565
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,050
You agreed to let me have Ji Yeong when I loaned you 500 million.

566
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,800
How could you do this to me now?

567
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,920
I won't bring up the money again.

568
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,850
Stop them from getting married, no matter what. Got that?

569
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,440
Otherwise, I won't just sit still.

570
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,660
Hold on.

571
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,750
Who did you say is marrying whom?

572
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,410
President Baek, aren't you the President of Kim Ji Yeong's agency?

573
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,050
How could you not know?

574
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,040
Ji Yeong said she was marrying Go Pil Sung.

575
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,940
Is that true?

576
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,150
 Kim Ji Yeong! 

577
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,570
 Open the door! 

578
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,260
 Hey, Kim Ji Yeong! Open the door! 

579
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,020
 Hey, open the door! 

580
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,920
 Kim Ji Yeong! 

581
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,180
- You've got to be kidding me. 
  - Open the door right now! 

582
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,190
Gosh, Mom...

583
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,480
- What are you doing here? 
 - Move, you bastard.

584
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong.

585
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,110
I heard you're marrying Go Pil Sung, that bastard. Is that true?

586
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,810
No, right? It's not true, right?

587
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,280
Yes, it's true.

588
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,750
I'm marrying Director Go Pil Sung.

589
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,450
Wow, you're crazy. You're out of your mind.

590
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,740
You finally stopped being a newcomer who made no money and you're starting to become successful.

591
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,860
Why would you get married now? Who says you could?

592
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,120
- What did you say? 
 - And... why Go Pil Sung?

593
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,140
How could you choose him?

594
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,620
No, Ji Yeong.

595
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,850
You can never marry him!

596
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,410
I told you.

597
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,130
He's like an enemy to us.

598
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,390
Go Pil Sung, that bastard drove you to die!

599
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,150
Stop telling lies like that!

600
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,660
You're the one who drove me to die.

601
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,920
It was you! It was your fault!

602
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,600
Why do you blame Pil Sung Oppa?

603
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,480
How is he the one to blame?

604
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,090
Ji Yeong, you...

605
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,690
You got your memory back, didn't you?

606
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,810
R-Right?

607
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,500
Hey, Park Do Sik... and Park Do Jun, did you two know?

608
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,710
How could you... How could you do this to your mom? Huh?

609
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,400
Yes, I got it back.

610
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,830
I got all of it back.

611
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,910
You left me in the villa to sell me to President Gong.

612
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,170
You even made me do a nude photoshoot to pay off your private loan.

613
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,740
I went to the hotel because you said I got a commercial deal, but they wanted to sleep with me.

614
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,100
That's why I died!

615
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,510
No, no, no! That's not true, Ji Yeong!

616
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,870
- That's... That's— 
 - Do you know what you...

617
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,660
did to me both times as Do Ra and Ji Yeong?

618
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,530
All you ever talked about was money, money, money.

619
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,080
I was nothing but money to you.

620
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,580
Everything you say is a lie!

621
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,010
Everything has been a lie.

622
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,910
That's why...

623
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:15,170
I hated, blamed, and hurt Pil Sung Oppa.

624
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,510
You're the one who drove me to die.

625
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,110
How could you blame Pil Sung Oppa for everything?

626
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,910
And...

627
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,510
how could you still deceive me like this?

628
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,130
How could you say, "I'm your mom?"

629
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,050
Mom!

630
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,330
Mom, did you really leave her in the villa?

631
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,040
Is everything she's saying true?

632
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,670
No, Do Jun!

633
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,660
- Let me explain everything! Let me— 
 - Geez!

634
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,300
Mom, get out. Get out right now!

635
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,920
Hold on, you bastard!

636
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,560
Do Ra, Do Jun, and Do Sik.

637
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,570
I... I gave her a hard time because of the debt.

638
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,550
But the thing is...

639
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,480
President Gong is a good person.

640
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,470
I did that because President Gong is a good person!

641
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,200
Mom, do you know what President Gong did to me?

642
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,450
But you still say he's a good person?

643
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,110
You think everyone with money is good?

644
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,270
Is money everything to you?

645
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,240
Is that why...

646
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,380
you lied to me that he and I used to love each other

647
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,070
when I had no memory at all?

648
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,870
Hey, you meanie! Hey!

649
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:32,040
Gosh! Stop, Grandma!

650
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,110
What? Stop!

651
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,700
Leave, Mom! Leave!

652
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,660
Gosh, seriously!

653
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,040
What are you doing?

654
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,340
Aigoo, my poor Ji Yeong.

655
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,580
Those bastards!

656
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,210
I became a widow when I was young,

657
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,170
but I didn't abandon them.

658
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,760
I raised them without even...

659
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,500
eating or buying myself clothes.

660
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,350
How could you do this to me? Bastards.

661
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm your mom! Your mom!

662
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,970
How could you do this to me? How could you do this to me?

663
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,610
How? You bastards.

664
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,710
How...

665
00:44:55,147 --> 00:44:59,727
How could you do this to me? You bastards.

666
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,690
Jin Dan! Jin Dan! Jin Dan!

667
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,160
What?

668
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,650
What is it?

669
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:10,930
Kim Ji Yeong and Go Pil Sung are having an in-laws' gathering.

670
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,100
What?

671
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,010
- In-laws' gathering? 
 - Yes.

672
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,090
I'm so thankful to Pil Sung for marrying her.

673
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,000
If they get married, you'd move on, too.

674
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,930
It feels like I removed a rotten tooth.

675
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,330
Jin Dan, if you're feeling upset, go on a vacation abroad for a month or two.

676
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,370
Forget that country bumpkin completely,

677
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,120
okay?

678
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,650
In-laws' gathering?

679
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,100
What am I supposed to do with them?

680
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,780
Who's that?

681
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,620
Who is it?

682
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,570
Ji Yeong!

683
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,820
Mom, Mom... It's Mom.

684
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:17,600
My Ji Yeong. You're dressed so nicely.

685
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,560
Right, right, right.

686
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,950
You're going to the in-laws' gathering, right?

687
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,210
Let me come with you.

688
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,390
You're not an orphan. I need to come with you, right?

689
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,220
What are you doing right now?

690
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,910
You're drunk, too.

691
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,850
You promised not to come here again.

692
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,200
I know, I know, I know.

693
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,540
But thinking about it,

694
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,830
I tried my best,

695
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,420
but I gave you guys a hard time because I wasn't a good mom.

696
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,600
But...

697
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,440
have I always been bad?

698
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,610
One bad thing I did was get addicted to gambling.

699
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,790
That's it.

700
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,000
But I quit. I quit.

701
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,830
Even a Go-Stop card ends up...

702
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:13,220
on my face like this, I swear I won't play! I won't!

703
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,210
So, Do Ra,

704
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,760
could you forgive me?

705
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,950
I swear... I swear I'll be good from now on.

706
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,210
And why would you get married already?

707
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,090
You're just about to get famous.

708
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,640
You should make some money first.

709
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,350
If you get married, will you give all of your money to Go Pil Sung?

710
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,740
Hey, I'm the one who raised you.

711
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,500
Why would you give it to Go Pil Sung?

712
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,740
Ahjumma,

713
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,630
I don't want to have this talk with you.

714
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,870
So, please leave.

715
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,770
"Ahjumma"?

716
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,700
I'm your mom! Your mom!

717
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,280
Hey, did you fall from the sky?

718
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,140
I gave birth to you and raised you!

719
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,060
- And what did you say? 
 - I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

720
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,280
You got all of your memory back.

721
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,710
Hey, Park Do Ra!

722
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,870
You're my daughter, and I'm your mom forever.

723
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,430
So, it's your responsibility to support me.

724
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,500
If you want to get married, make one billion for me first.

725
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:38,440
If you get married like this, how am I supposed to live? How?

726
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,260
Please...

727
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,900
Please... Please stop...

728
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,970
Stop... Stop now!

729
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,990
Why should I give you a billion won?

730
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,550
Do I owe you money?

731
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,230
Why are you sucking my blood like a leech?

732
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,830
Leech?

733
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,670
Wow, you bitch.

734
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,230
What did you say just now? Leech?

735
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,510
You bitch! Why should you pay me?

736
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,310
I suffered so much to raise you guys. But you try to abandon me?

737
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,880
I'll tell everyone if you do this!

738
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,650
I'll tell them you're Park Do Ra, you bitch!

739
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,770
You bitch. How dare you do this to me?

740
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,950
How dare you do this to me, you bitch?

741
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,600
Mom!

742
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,740
- How could you do this to me? 
 - What are you doing? Are you crazy?

743
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,240
Let go! Let go!

744
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,390
How could you do this to me?

745
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,060
Hey, hey, you bitch!

746
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,690
How dare you pull out my Ji Yeong's hair?

747
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,840
You bitch.

748
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,200
Grandma.

749
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,840
Come out. Come out!

750
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,930
- Come out. 
 - You bastard!

751
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,260
You bastard!

752
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,840
You bastard!

753
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,110
Aigoo...

754
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,530
My Ji Yeong.

755
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,110
Look at your hair!

756
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:07,190
Gosh, you need to go to the in-laws' gathering today.

757
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,280
What are we supposed to do with her?

758
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,030
Gosh, Ji Yeong. Aigoo...

759
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,560
Aigoo...

760
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,820
Come out!

761
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,890
Let's die together today.

762
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,430
Do Jun and Do Ra can't live like this. They'll die because of you.

763
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,590
- Come on now! 
 - Let go, you bastard.

764
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,020
You son of a bitch.

765
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,410
You've always talked about jumping into the Han River.

766
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,800
So, let's go die together now. Let's die!

767
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,220
Let go, you bastard.

768
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,440
You think you would've existed without me?

769
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,340
But you're insisting on behaving like this?

770
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,800
If she became Park Do Ra, she should've said, "Mom, I'm back," and treated me well.

771
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,240
How could you all fool me like this?

772
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,660
Fine. Do whatever you want.

773
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,740
If you act like this, I'll tell everyone she's Do Ra.

774
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,800
Kim Ji Yeong is Park Do Ra!

775
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,480
Mom, are you crazy? Be quiet.

776
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,460
Leave now!

777
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,240
Let go, you bastard!

778
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,070
I'll go by myself, you bastard.

779
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,600
You'd better not follow me.

780
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,020
Move! Get out of the way.

781
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,590
Shit!

782
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,110
What was all that?

783
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,870
Kim Ji Yeong is... Park Do Ra?

784
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,330
That Park Do Ra?

785
00:51:47,213 --> 00:51:49,963
 You talk to me casually. Am I not supposed to do the same? 

786
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:51,503
 Gong Jin Dan! 

787
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:54,003
 You'd better stop while I'm being nice, okay? 

788
00:51:54,003 --> 00:51:55,993
 Kim Ji Yeong is Park Do Ra! 

789
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:58,463
 Mom, are you crazy? Be quiet. 

790
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:00,793
 Leave now! 

791
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:14,143
Gosh, that jerk.

792
00:52:14,993 --> 00:52:16,593
Geez.

793
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:19,973
I can't get a taxi, either.

794
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:22,333
- President Baek. 
 - You scared me!

795
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:26,293
Is Kim Ji Yeong... Park Do Ra?

796
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:29,353
What are you talking about?

797
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:33,943
I knew something was strange.

798
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:38,053
But Kim Ji Yeong was Park Do Ra inside.

799
00:52:38,053 --> 00:52:39,883
Right?

800
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:42,113
No.

801
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:44,273
Who said Ji Yeong is Do Ra?

802
00:52:44,273 --> 00:52:47,613
What did you hear, exactly?

803
00:52:47,613 --> 00:52:50,003
I heard everything just now.

804
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,853
Your conversation with your son.

805
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,753
Am I right?

806
00:52:55,663 --> 00:52:58,293
What are you talking about?

807
00:52:58,293 --> 00:53:01,373
My Do Ra isn't Ji Yeong.

808
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:06,253
I know I'm a lousy mother, but you think I'd tell you that?

809
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:08,303
No, okay?

810
00:53:08,303 --> 00:53:10,453
Move. I need to get a taxi.

811
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:13,043
Taxi!

812
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:28,333
It's true.

813
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,353
Kim Ji Yeong...

814
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:32,913
was Park Do Ra.

815
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,413
Park Do Ra.

816
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:37,883
 Do Ra! 

817
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:44,583
Go Pil Sung, that bastard, knew.

818
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:47,093
I was the only one who didn't know.

819
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:50,823
I was a fool and an idiot all this time!

820
00:53:55,573 --> 00:53:59,223
You accepted my naive granddaughter Ji Yeong.

821
00:53:59,223 --> 00:54:02,743
I'm so grateful.

822
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:05,123
I don't know about anything else,

823
00:54:05,123 --> 00:54:08,863
but I raised her to be sweet and polite.

824
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:14,143
She's more respectful toward elders than anyone.

825
00:54:14,143 --> 00:54:18,923
Please teach her if she doesn't know about something.

826
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:29,633
By the way, why does everyone have a sour face?

827
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,943
Are you displeased with Ji Yeong by chance?

828
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:36,393
No, no. Of course, we like her.

829
00:54:36,393 --> 00:54:39,453
She became a star in Pil Sung's drama.

830
00:54:39,453 --> 00:54:42,963
We'll have a famous and beautiful actor in our family.

831
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:45,653
It's an honor. An honor.

832
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:48,513
 What did he say? "An honor"? 

833
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:51,653
 Is he out of his mind? 

834
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:54,143
What's wrong?

835
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:56,373
Did someone pinch you?

836
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:02,953
Seriously. Pil Sung, what will you do about your starter home?

837
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:06,793
You'll live in your room for now, right?

838
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:10,613
No, I'll live at Ji Yeong's place.

839
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:12,423
What did you say?

840
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,503
We need to care for her grandmother.

841
00:55:18,263 --> 00:55:20,323
My gosh.

842
00:55:20,323 --> 00:55:24,463
♫  Until the East Sea's waves are dry,  ♫

843
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:28,953
♫  - Mt. Baekdu worn away  ♫ 
 - Grandma. Grandma?

844
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:33,483
♫  God watches over our land forever  ♫

845
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:36,563
♫  Until it's dry...  ♫

846
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:40,123
Grandma, what are you doing?

847
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:42,873
It's okay.

848
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:46,413
♫  Rose of Sharon, thousand miles...  ♫

849
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:50,483
We worked hard to raise him well, but only for her to take him.

850
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:53,173
Gosh, what are we supposed to do?

851
00:55:53,173 --> 00:55:56,743
   

852
00:55:56,743 --> 00:55:58,923
It's nice.

853
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:13,533
♫  The reason I love you is because you're you  ♫

854
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,403
Come on.

855
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,063
They have lights, too.

856
00:56:19,863 --> 00:56:21,833
Do you like them?

857
00:56:23,993 --> 00:56:27,303
They'd look nice in our walk-in closet.

858
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:30,013
♫  The reason I love you  ♫

859
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:32,273
"Our walk-in closet"?

860
00:56:32,873 --> 00:56:36,763
It really feels like we're getting married now.

861
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:41,583
I'm in a good mood. Get everything you want.

862
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,243
What?

863
00:56:44,053 --> 00:56:45,943
It's too expensive.

864
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:49,963
♫  I love you  ♫

865
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:52,903
I wanted to see the inside, too.

866
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:55,263
♫  Even though we change with time  ♫

867
00:56:55,263 --> 00:57:01,393
♫  My love always feels new  ♫

868
00:57:01,393 --> 00:57:06,643
♫  I opened my eyes in your arms  ♫

869
00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:12,923
♫  I want to close my eyes in your arms, too  ♫

870
00:57:25,283 --> 00:57:27,253
Park Do Ra.

871
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:30,943
You really were Park Do Ra.

872
00:57:34,353 --> 00:57:36,083
Is that why...

873
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:40,223
Is that why my heart ached and...

874
00:57:41,643 --> 00:57:47,143
felt dizzy whenever I saw the country bumpkin, Kim Ji Yeong?

875
00:57:58,563 --> 00:58:00,683
Park Do Ra.

876
00:58:00,683 --> 00:58:03,203
I spent so many days...

877
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,333
in tears after you died.

878
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:09,273
But why are you by his side now?

879
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:15,423
Park Do Ra, if I can't have you, Go Pil Sung can't, either.

880
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:25,103
No.

881
00:58:25,103 --> 00:58:27,033
No.

882
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:31,093
I can't end things so easily.

883
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:35,563
You need to feel...

884
00:58:36,383 --> 00:58:39,113
as much pain as I did.

885
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,433
You need to.

886
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,470
   

887
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:16,413
What in the world!

888
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:19,843
- Congratulations. 
 - You're like a goddess.

889
00:59:19,843 --> 00:59:22,333
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you for coming.

890
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,253
What? Since when were you together?

891
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:26,883
You didn't show it on set, but you're suddenly getting married?

892
00:59:26,883 --> 00:59:29,253
They're scammers, I'm telling you.

893
00:59:29,253 --> 00:59:31,673
I sort of knew, okay?

894
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:34,733
What? You should've given us a hint.

895
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:37,193
We need to record this historic moment.

896
00:59:37,193 --> 00:59:38,933
Let's take a group photo.

897
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:40,273
- Shall we?
- No, I don't want to.

898
00:59:40,273 --> 00:59:42,093
Please, just one photo.

899
00:59:42,093 --> 00:59:43,983
Go inside. Come on in.

900
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:46,043
- Let's take a photo. 
 - Sit here.

901
00:59:46,043 --> 00:59:48,263
Shouldn't we get the cinematographer?

902
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:51,043
The camera is over there.

903
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:52,873
He's here, Sunbaenim.

904
00:59:52,873 --> 00:59:55,503
I got everything ready.

905
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:57,113
Are we in the frame?

906
00:59:57,113 --> 01:00:00,873
- I'll take it now. One, two... 
 - Our Do Ra is so pretty.

907
01:00:00,873 --> 01:00:03,703
- Don't you think? 
 - She is.

908
01:00:03,703 --> 01:00:07,033
My sister is the prettiest.

909
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:18,593
Mom, what are you doing here?

910
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:20,113
Am I not allowed to be here?

911
01:00:20,113 --> 01:00:22,723
You aren't supposed to be here.

912
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:26,013
Why are you allowed to do it, and I'm not? That makes no sense.

913
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,373
You'd better not cause trouble.

914
01:00:28,373 --> 01:00:30,403
Mom, just leave.

915
01:00:30,403 --> 01:00:32,383
I don't want to. I'll watch her wedding.

916
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,733
- I hate to see Go Pil Sung, but it's Do Ra's wedding— 
 - Gosh, please...

917
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,133
Don't call her "Do Ra."

918
01:00:39,133 --> 01:00:41,483
I will watch Ji Yeong's wedding.

919
01:00:41,483 --> 01:00:44,153
I'm the CEO of Ji Yeong's agency, okay?

920
01:00:44,153 --> 01:00:46,483
Seriously.

921
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:53,853
Gosh, Oppa!

922
01:00:53,853 --> 01:00:56,423
Oppa, you look so handsome today.

923
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:58,363
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

924
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,853
Yes, Pil Sung, You look great.

925
01:01:03,153 --> 01:01:07,303
By the way, where's Chairman Gong?

926
01:01:07,303 --> 01:01:10,143
I guess he's not happy about this marriage.

927
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:13,953
Because he said he wouldn't go, he and Mom had a fight this morning.

928
01:01:13,953 --> 01:01:15,563
Ma Ri.

929
01:01:15,563 --> 01:01:18,640
I totally understand how he feels.

930
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:23,803
It's not that. He needed to tend to something urgently today.

931
01:01:28,123 --> 01:01:31,483
The chairman is so strange.

932
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:35,083
He's basically Pil Sung's father if he adopts him.

933
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,983
How could he not come on a day like this?

934
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:41,243
What if he cancels the adoption?

935
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:44,873
Come on, Mom. Don't say that on this happy day.

936
01:01:44,873 --> 01:01:47,903
Saying only nice things won't be enough.

937
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,313
Aigoo, "Happy day," my foot.

938
01:01:51,313 --> 01:01:54,943
I'm basically in hell right now.

939
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:58,893
Pil Sung! Wow, looking great.

940
01:01:58,893 --> 01:02:00,643
Victory, victory, Go Pil Sung!

941
01:02:00,643 --> 01:02:05,873
Wow, Ms. Kim has taken great care of you ever since she was a staff member.

942
01:02:05,873 --> 01:02:08,073
I'm happy you're getting married, Go Pil Sung.

943
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:09,733
Live happily, okay?

944
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,383
Thank you. Thank you.

945
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:13,113
You must be jealous, Station Director.

946
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:15,813
Gosh, he's so happy.

947
01:02:15,813 --> 01:02:17,593
Geez.

948
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:20,093
- You're doing your filial duty. 
 - I know.

949
01:02:20,093 --> 01:02:23,643
He's so happy. Seriously.

950
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,233
Do Jun.

951
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:35,883
What are you doing here...

952
01:02:35,883 --> 01:02:38,033
Long time no see.

953
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,003
I can't say the same.

954
01:02:42,003 --> 01:02:47,663
I went in front of your house... and saw you recently.

955
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:50,083
You came in front of my house? Why?

956
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,843
Don't you know? It's because I missed you.

957
01:02:54,903 --> 01:02:58,233
Didn't you miss me at all?

958
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,763
We agreed not to see each other.

959
01:03:02,373 --> 01:03:04,583
So, don't do that anymore.

960
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,613
I'll go.

961
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:14,163
You're a jerk, Do Jun.

962
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:17,293
 Thank you for waiting, everyone. 

963
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:22,513
Only the bride and groom's families and close friends are here today

964
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:26,643
to celebrate their sincere feelings for each other.

965
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:31,163
Please fill up the room with your applause

966
01:03:31,163 --> 01:03:36,753
and welcome and congratulate the bride and groom.

967
01:03:36,753 --> 01:03:40,713
The groom will walk down the aisle now.

968
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:46,653
Please applaud loudly when the groom walks in.

969
01:03:47,773 --> 01:03:50,840
Here comes the groom!

970
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:59,100


971
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,933
♫  Are you happy?  ♫

972
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:04,693
Did somebody die?

973
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:06,843
They're getting married.

974
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,353
Stop crying. It's a happy day.

975
01:04:09,353 --> 01:04:10,913
Is it a happy day?

976
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:14,253
I'll divorce you after this wedding.

977
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:16,273
Get ready to go to court.

978
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:28,933
♫  Being together today is a miracle  ♫

979
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:32,823
Here comes the highlight of the wedding.

980
01:04:32,823 --> 01:04:34,573

01:04:36,613 --> 01:04:42,403
Please applaud loudly when the bride enters.

984

♫  I'll give you everything  ♫

♫  I'll give you all the love I have left  ♫

987
01:05:02,863 --> 01:05:05,903
♫  I'll give you everything  ♫

♫  We'll only have happy days ahead  ♫

990
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:19,323
- Kim Ji Yeong!
- Kim Ji Yeong!

991
01:05:19,323 --> 01:05:21,393
Kim Ji Yeong!

992
01:05:21,393 --> 01:05:23,583
Kim Ji Yeong, are you really Park Do Ra?

993
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:26,263
Is it true you got plastic surgery to live as Kim Ji Yeong?

994
01:05:26,263 --> 01:05:27,743
Did you lie to Director Go Pil Sung, too?

995
01:05:27,743 --> 01:05:29,633
Does he know you're Park Do Ra, too?

996
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:33,033
Did he know from the beginning and deceive everyone with you?

997
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:35,723
- Did Go Pil Sung know? 
 - Why did you lie to everyone?

998
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,473
Please say something!

999
01:05:43,053 --> 01:05:46,753
   

1000
01:05:46,753 --> 01:05:50,773
♫  Even if the fate tears us apart  ♫

1001
01:05:50,773 --> 01:05:57,253
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

1002
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:09,323
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

1003
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:15,363
♫  One love  ♫

1004
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:21,343
 The whole world is criticizing Pil Sung. 

1005
01:06:21,343 --> 01:06:24,573
 How could you allow the wedding knowing that? 

1006
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:26,263
 Are you out of your mind? 

1007
01:06:26,263 --> 01:06:29,333
 You told the reporters Ji Yeong is Do Ra, didn't you? 

1008
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,753
 I'm okay. 

1009
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,303
 But what will you do now? 

1010
01:06:32,303 --> 01:06:34,893
 Why do you have to be criticized because of me? 

1011
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:37,503
 Where's my Ji Yeong? 

1012
01:06:37,503 --> 01:06:40,323
 Find Ji Yeong right now! Hurry! 

1013
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:42,253
 Park Do Ra, where are you? 

1014
01:06:42,253 --> 01:06:43,753
 You promised not to do this. 

1015
01:06:43,753 --> 01:06:46,733
 You promised not to let go of my hand, no matter what! 

1016
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:49,733
 I thought I should take care of this myself. 

1017
01:06:49,733 --> 01:06:54,133
 I'm sorry I made the decision without telling you.
