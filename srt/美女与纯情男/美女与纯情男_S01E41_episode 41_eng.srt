1
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:50,200
No, Ma Ri!

2
00:00:50,200 --> 00:01:00,140


3
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,727
   

4
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:18,207
This can't be.

5
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:22,907
This isn't right. It's not right.

6
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:27,837
Please let him live.

7
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:33,530
Let him live. Let him live.

8
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,340
Oh, my God!

9
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,857
Ji Yeong, what happened to Pil Sung?

10
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:42,677
How badly was he hurt? How bad was it?

11
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:47,327
I don't know. He's in surgery right now.

12
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:49,347
Surgery?

13
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:54,537
Wait... How much was he hurt that he needed surgery?

14
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:57,397
Ji Yeong, please tell me!

15
00:01:57,397 --> 00:02:01,547
Honey, I'm sure he'll be fine. Don't worry.

16
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,637
Excuse me, lady.

17
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,207
Stop crying and talk properly.

18
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:09,597
Since you're the one who called us,

19
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:13,147
it means he got injured while with you.

20
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:18,647
You look totally fine. Why did this only happen to him?

21
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:23,947
I... I was leaving a shoot and...

22
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:28,517
heard a loud thud, so I turned around.

23
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:32,657
He was hit by a car that was rushing in.

24
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:39,057
No! No! Honey...

25
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:45,577
Soo Yeon, Pil Sung... What happened to Pil Sung?

26
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:49,067
How badly was he hurt that they need to perform surgery?

27
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:54,167
I don't know. I don't know what's going on.

28
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:58,687
I heard he was with Ma Ri and got into the accident.

29
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:01,747
Ma Ri said a car suddenly rushed in.

30
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:03,747
She's just crying because she's in shock.

31
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:07,857
Ma Ri wasn't injured. Why is only Pil Sung...

32
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,877
My gosh...

33
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:16,097
If so, was he injured while he was with Ma Ri?

34
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:20,877
N-Not while he was with our tenant lady?

35
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:27,527
Today, I planned...

36
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:33,737
to have pasta with Oppa at a pasta place near his office, so I went there.

37
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:38,167
Oppa was across the street.

38
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:45,117
So, I was crossing the street calling for him.

39
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,047
But suddenly,

40
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:54,567
a car started rushing toward me.

41
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,807
So...

42
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:02,537
I wondered why that car was rushing toward me while staring at it.

43
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:11,677
Oppa called my name "Ma Ri," and he pushed me away.

44
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,307
So, he got hit by a car...

45
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:21,317
and his body went up in the air.

46
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:27,867
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong...

47
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,657
Dad.

48
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,707
Dad, what do we do with Pil Sung?

49
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,657
He got injured because of me.

50
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:39,047
I shouldn't have suggested having pasta. I shouldn't have.

51
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:44,117
Dad, he was injured because of me. It's my fault, Dad.

52
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:52,187
Ma Ri, you mean he got injured trying to save you?

53
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:57,187
Dad, what do we do with him?

54
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,987
What do we do if he dies, Dad?

55
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:02,037
Oh, no...

56
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:05,157
Our poor Pil Sung... My gosh...

57
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:08,327
Honey. H-Honey, it's okay.

58
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:11,017
Pil Sung will be okay.

59
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:13,147
Our Pil Sung is okay.

60
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,867
My son, Pil Sung, will not die. So...

61
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,587
stop saying weird things.

62
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:23,437
Oh, no, my Pil Sung...

63
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:30,817
Ji Yeong, have you had dinner?

64
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:32,987
You have?

65
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,937
You'll be home late?

66
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,827
Okay. Don't worry about me.

67
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:42,437
I have Dong Dong and Geum Dong here.

68
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:45,557
Okay, bye.

69
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,137
Ji Yeong can't come home?

70
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:51,627
Yes, she'll be late because there's something important going on.

71
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,917
She told us to eat and go to bed.

72
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:58,627
Go ahead and eat. The noodles are getting bloated.

73
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:05,167
Gosh, my sweet babies. Aigoo...

74
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,027
Your kalguksu is really amazing.

75
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:11,517
And especially the geotjeori. It's the best.

76
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:12,837
Really?

77
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:16,527
My Geum Dong. Help yourself.

78
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:24,417
By the way, Dong Dong, why do you not look as good as you did?

79
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,937
You aren't even 30 years old. What happened to your face?

80
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:32,157
Would you be able to get married at that rate?

81
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:39,757
Mom, I won't get married. I'm so sick of men.

82
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,177
I'll live here with you forever.

83
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:46,117
I need no one else but you.

84
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,367
Why? Is it because you're ugly?

85
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:55,317
Don't worry. You can get married even if you're ugly.

86
00:06:55,317 --> 00:07:00,227
You should have kids and live like others, too.

87
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,807
Gosh, Mom. Don't even hope for that.

88
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,417
She's too old to have a baby.

89
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:12,607
You little... What's wrong with Dong Dong? Come on.

90
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:18,907
Mom, I'll date men and have kids, too.

91
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,837
So, don't worry and just eat.

92
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:26,107
Okay, my Dong Dong. Let's eat.

93
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,977
Yes.

94
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:37,187
Yes, got it.

95
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:40,567
Please call me as soon as you catch the culprit.

96
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,707
What did they say? Did they catch the hit-and-run culprit?

97
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:56,517
Not yet. They're still collecting witnesses' testimonies.

98
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,337
We need to catch them. We need to catch them, no matter what.

99
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:03,257
We need to catch the bastard who did that to Pil Sung.

100
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:06,197
Yes, we will.

101
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,177
What happened to our son?

102
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,017
Thankfully, the head injury isn't serious.

103
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,447
The cauterization was enough.

104
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,177
But organs were ruptured seriously.

105
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:22,057
That's why the surgery took so long.

106
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:24,887
We'll have to see how he recovers first.

107
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,307
Surviving tonight will be critical.

108
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:33,327
You said the surgery went well. But tonight is critical?

109
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:37,447
Do you mean something might go wrong?

110
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:38,807
No, right, Doctor?

111
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:41,837
Let's keep an eye on him a little longer.

112
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,587
- My gosh! 
 - Honey, Honey.

113
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,647
My gosh...

114
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,197
What? Really?

115
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:11,967
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

116
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,347
How long will you keep drinking?

117
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:17,037
You'd better keep it moderate.

118
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:19,797
Mom, tell me more details.

119
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:23,157
What? Go Pil Sung might die?

120
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:27,457
Yes. He had surgery because his organs were seriously ruptured.

121
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:33,777
The surgery went well, but it must be serious because they say he needs to survive tonight.

122
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,287
The organ rupture might kill you.

123
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,307
Someone I knew died that way, too.

124
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,207
That means he might actually die, then.

125
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:45,797
Yes. They could've just said the surgery went well.

126
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:48,747
They won't say tonight is critical for no reason.

127
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:51,807
Seon Yeong must be so worried.

128
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:25,227
   

129
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:52,637
Doctor. Doctor!

130
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:56,047
How is Patient Go Pil Sung doing?

131
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:59,477
Thankfully, he survived the worst of it.

132
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:01,207
Really?

133
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,437
Pil Sung will live, then, right?

134
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:05,637
He'll be fine, right?

135
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,287
Yes, that's correct.

136
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:09,157
You don't have to worry anymore.

137
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:14,437
Gosh, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you.

138
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,667
Thank goodness.

139
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:31,297
- Oppa, thank you. 
 - Because the patient is young and has the will to live,

140
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:34,017
he's recovering better than I thought.

141
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,577
But he can't accept visitors yet.

142
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:39,047
You can go home without worrying now.

143
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,327
Yes, Doctor. Thank you.

144
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:44,917
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you...

145
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:50,637
Thank you. Thank you.

146
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:52,927
Thank you.

147
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:55,017
Honey...

148
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:59,777
Thank you. Thank you.

149
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:02,407
Thank you.

150
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:07,007
Thank you.

151
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,817
Gosh, so funny.

152
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:30,067
How much money does that old lady have?

153
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:34,447
She got Ji Yeong this apartment and gave her 300 million won.

154
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,807
She must have a lot.

155
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:40,437
Gosh, my babies.

156
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:44,607
My pretty babies.

157
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:47,817
Mom, Mom, Mom.

158
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:51,107
I got your favorite instant coffee, Mom.

159
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:52,857
- Okay, okay. 
 - What are you doing, Mom?

160
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,707
It's nothing.

161
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,317
Mom, let me see. What is it?

162
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,277
Gosh, what are you doing? My gosh.

163
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,987
Gosh, what's this? It's gold.

164
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:04,487
Mom, what's this? Is this real gold?

165
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,557
Of course, it's real gold.

166
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:09,277
Why would it be fake?

167
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:15,037
I'll sell these for Ji Yeong when she gets married later. Give me.

168
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:18,017
- Give it to me. 
 - Mom, you should give me one, too.

169
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:22,197
No, this is all for Ji Yeong!

170
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,657
I gave you even more.

171
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:28,787
Poor Ji Yeong lost her parents when she was a kid.

172
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:34,537
You're her aunt, but you aren't interested in giving her anything.

173
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:37,987
You can't try to take hers instead.

174
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:40,767
Seriously, what's in your stomach?

175
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:44,297
Are you filled with nothing but greed?

176
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:55,837
Honey.

177
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,567
Our Ma Ri...

178
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:04,217
What would've happened to her if it weren't for Pil Sung?

179
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:09,657
Thinking about that scares me.

180
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,737
I feel the same.

181
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:17,277
That's why I'm so thankful for...

182
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:22,717
Pil Sung and I feel bad for him.

183
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:31,557
If it weren't for him, Ma Ri would've died.

184
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:35,017
If something terrible happened to her,

185
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:38,397
we couldn't have gone on in life, either.

186
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,177
Living would've felt like death.

187
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,957
Pil Sung...

188
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,797
saved all three of us.

189
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:54,657
Yes.

190
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:59,577
We owe Pil Sung a great deal.

191
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:04,217
Our debt is immeasurable.

192
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:07,937
Honey,

193
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,937
in my heart, Pil Sung is...

194
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:17,077
already my son now.

195
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,647
Honey.

196
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:36,117
Honey...

197
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,047
thank you so much for

198
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:45,017
giving Ma Ri such a great brother.

199
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:52,297
Thank you so much for giving me such a dependable son.

200
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,957
Don't say that.

201
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:01,217
Honey, I'm thankful to you.

202
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:04,967
And I'm sorry.

203
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:10,997
Sang Gu, why have you been unreachable in the past few days? I was worried.

204
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:14,627
Well, I had the flu, so I was in bed.

205
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:15,877
Why? Did something happen?

206
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:18,747
You have no idea. Our house was turned upside down.

207
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,987
Ma Ri almost died.

208
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:25,067
The chairman's daughter almost died?

209
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,127
Why? Was there an accident?

210
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:30,267
I'm not sure if it was drunk driving or a hit-and-run.

211
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,977
She almost got run over in front of the office.

212
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:36,677
But her half-brother saved her and got injured instead.

213
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,757
So, our house was in chaos.

214
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,647
Oh, really?

215
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:44,907
What happened to her half-brother? Is he dead?

216
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:49,747
No, he almost died because of a serious organ rupture, but I guess the surgery went well.

217
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:51,507
He'll be sent to a regular ward.

218
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,297
I see.

219
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:55,947
Ma Ri, that girl must be so lucky.

220
00:16:55,947 --> 00:17:00,027
She survived a serious accident as a kid and she survived this accident, too.

221
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:03,877
She almost died several times. Gosh.

222
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,937
So, did they catch the hit-and-run culprit?

223
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:10,577
They're investigating, but I guess they haven't.

224
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:13,367
CCTV is everywhere in this country, but they haven't caught them yet.

225
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,297
It must've been a terrible hit-and-run for real.

226
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:19,697
What a shameless bastard, right? Gosh, seriously.

227
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,647
Yes, President Gu. Did you look into it?

228
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,387
 Yes, I looked into it at the police station. 

229
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:30,347
 It was apparently a burner car. 

230
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:32,297
What?

231
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:37,597
I thought it was a simple hit-and-run or drunk driving. But it was a burner car?

232
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:40,417
 So, I'm not sure if I can say this, 

233
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:44,597
 but I think it was intentional, not just an accident. 

234
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,557
Intentional?

235
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:52,617
President Gu, please look into it quietly. Yes.

236
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:06,287
Does it mean someone intended to kill Ma Ri?

237
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:11,527
Who would do that? Why my Ma Ri?

238
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:32,647
 Oppa, don't die. Oppa! 

239
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:38,067
 Oppa, it's me, Do Ra! I'm Do Ra, Oppa! 

240
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,337
 Please help! 

241
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:43,097
 What am I supposed to do? 

242
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:47,067
 Oppa! Oppa, it's me, Do Ra! 

243
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:52,607
What's this memory?

244
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,697
I heard Ji Yeong was with me when I got into the accident.

245
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,547
Is that why?

246
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:02,117
Or is it because I hurt my head?

247
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,077
Yes.

248
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,017
The miraculous man.

249
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,697
Incredibly lucky man, Go Pil Sung.

250
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,377
Lucky PD!

251
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:15,127
What are you doing?

252
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,417
I heard your body went up in the air like this.

253
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,867
It's a miracle you're alive.

254
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,987
He was blessed because he's been good.

255
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:23,327
His ancestors helped him.

256
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:26,687
Right. It's a miracle you're being discharged so quickly.

257
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:30,087
Everyone at the scene thought you were dead.

258
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,047
I'm so glad you're okay.

259
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,437
I'm sorry we're behind the shooting schedule. I'm sorry.

260
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:39,577
Director, are you worried about our schedule in the midst of this?

261
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:43,477
We'll start shooting as soon as I get discharged. Reschedule everything.

262
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,397
Okay, I will.

263
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:47,827
Director Go, you're a workaholic.

264
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,187
Look how he's reading the script in the hospital.

265
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:51,747
Brace yourselves.

266
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:55,797
His eyes are saying, "I'm dying to get to work."

267
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,477
So tired of this.

268
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:19,857
 Ji Yeong, you're still nearby, right? 

269
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:22,417
 Can I see you briefly right now? 

270
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,277
No pictures...

271
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,827
Yes.

272
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,727
Why did you want to see me?

273
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:54,517
I need to tell you something, and I have a favor to ask, too.

274
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:57,477
Okay, go ahead.

275
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:03,487
I heard you were at the accident scene, too.

276
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:07,297
Yes.

277
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,207
I happened to be passing by.

278
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,907
You must've been very shocked.

279
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:25,397
I'm sorry for making you see that.

280
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:27,907
It's okay.

281
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:31,637
I'm glad you're back in good health.

282
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:39,007
Did you cry and tell me not to die then, by chance?

283
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:44,017
I think you told me you were Do Ra, too.

284
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:47,427
I can't tell if that was a dream or not.

285
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:48,947
Pardon?

286
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:59,297
I don't remember what I said because I was so shocked then.

287
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:06,287
Yes, I would've been like that, too. It was a serious accident.

288
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:11,607
Anyway, I heard you called my family.

289
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,217
Thank you.

290
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:16,977
Don't mention it. Anyone would've.

291
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:21,447
Since I've recovered, I want to buy you a coffee, at least.

292
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:25,167
There's a coffee shop, bakery, and restaurant in the basement here.

293
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:28,117
- I'll treat you to anything. 
 - No, it's okay.

294
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:32,567
You aren't feeling well yet. Don't worry about me.

295
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:37,117
I'll get going now.

296
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,567
Ji Yeong, hold on.

297
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,377
Director, Director, are you okay?

298
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:49,497
Are you okay?

299
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:51,037
I think the stitches burst.

300
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,567
What? Oh, no...

301
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,017
You shouldn't have gotten up so quickly!

302
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:00,357
Why are you so careless, Oppa?

303
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,977
Did you call me...

304
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,937
"Oppa" just now?

305
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:23,527
D-Did I?

306
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:27,100
Did I say that?

307
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,257
Yes,

308
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:34,230
you just called me "Oppa" and talked to me casually, too.

309
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:37,067
W-Well, the thing is...

310
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:44,097
Y-You said your stitches burst. So, I said that in shock...

311
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:51,487
Since you kept telling me you'd be my oppa,

312
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:54,577
I said that without realizing it.

313
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:56,627
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:56,627 --> 00:24:00,507
No, you don't have to apologize at all.

315
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:07,107
Since you called me "Oppa," the stitched area almost burst, but it's healed now.

316
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,287
Pardon?

317
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:16,757
W-Were you teasing me just now?

318
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,627
Did you just lie?

319
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:23,757
It's not like that. That's how much it hurt.

320
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:27,917
I don't think it burst, but it felt like it did.

321
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:34,217
- I'll go now. 
 - Let me ask you a favor since you're already here.

322
00:24:34,217 --> 00:24:37,137
You're the only person I could ask.

323
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:40,437
What is it?

324
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:49,138
I didn't think the outside air was so precious and sweet.

325
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:55,528
Ji Yeong, I want to walk a bit.

326
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,758
Could you support me?

327
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,118
Would you be able to?

328
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:01,088
I need to practice.

329
00:25:16,818 --> 00:25:18,268
My gosh!

330
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:22,218
Director, are you okay?

331
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:40,438
I think we need to go back in now.

332
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,688
I don't think you're ready to walk yet.

333
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:45,348
No.

334
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:49,458
I need to keep practicing so I can walk freely on set.

335
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,428
Please hold me.

336
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,378
Okay.

337
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:14,278
 Why are you so careless, Oppa? 

338
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,878
 Oppa, it's me, Do Ra! 

339
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:20,658
She definitely called me "Oppa."

340
00:26:22,298 --> 00:26:27,518
Did she get all of her memory back by chance?

341
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,391
No.

342
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:35,888
If it did, she would've told me first.

343
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:55,528
 My gosh! 

344
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:58,418
 Director. 

345
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:07,558
Should I just tell him I got my memory back?

346
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,868
No.

347
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,678
I can't.

348
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:25,228
People can find out I'm Park Do Ra at any given moment.

349
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:32,618
I'll leave with Grandma as soon as I finish this project.

350
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:36,178
To somewhere no one knows about.

351
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:41,448
 Welcome back! 

352
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,438
Thank you.

353
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:49,361
And I'm sorry for making you worry.

354
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:54,678
The shoot suddenly got canceled, and the schedule was ruined,

355
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:57,698
but you understood without a complaint.

356
00:27:57,698 --> 00:27:59,728
Thank you.

357
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:04,478
I'm fine now. Let's work hard starting today!

358
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:08,658
 Go Pil Seung! Go Pil Seung! Go Pil Seung! 

359
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:10,028
Let's start shooting now.

360
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:12,098
Okay!

361
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:16,538
Excuse me.

362
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:23,008
Director, here's jujube and ginger tea.

363
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:25,168
You should have some.

364
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:31,138
I haven't had this in a long time.

365
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:38,488
You used to give me this when you were Do Ra, too.

366
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:43,758
Really?

367
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,608
Thank you.

368
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:48,728
By the way, Ji Yeong,

369
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:53,798
why are you suddenly so nice to me?

370
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:00,638
You're the director of our drama.

371
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:06,338
You need to recover quickly so we shoot without issues.

372
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:10,298
Drink that and get your energy back.

373
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:20,498
She must've felt sorry for me when I got injured.

374
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:24,918
This is still better than her being cold.

375
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:32,488
Yes, Chairman.

376
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:36,238
Yes, I'm back at work.

377
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:39,748
Me?

378
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:45,018
I'll visit you after the shoot. Okay.

379
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,608
What's the important thing he needs to talk about?

380
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:58,738
Ma Ri, are you really okay now?

381
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:00,508
Yes, I said I am.

382
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,748
See? I'm totally fine.

383
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:05,418
So, let's go play games today.

384
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:07,738
Okay. The winner gets shaved ice this time. How's that?

385
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,398
Sounds good. But I'm sure I'll win again.

386
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:12,468
I'm not sure. We'll have to see.

387
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:14,108
I went easy on you last time.

388
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:16,838
What are you saying? You didn't go easy on me.

389
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:21,918
Just wait and see. I'll defeat you, so you can't say that today.

390
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,658
Do Jun!

391
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:27,008
Oh, wow!

392
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:28,658
Who's this lady?

393
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:31,448
Is she your girlfriend, Do Jun?

394
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,848
No, she's a friend. A friend.

395
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:41,918
Hey, are you his friend or a girlfriend?

396
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,088
I was his girlfriend until just now.

397
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:49,878
But I guess I'm his friend because he said so.

398
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:51,398
I'll get going now.

399
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:53,428
M-Ma Ri...

400
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,278
Couldn't you just ignore me and walk by? I'll go.

401
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:00,728
Gosh, Do...

402
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,308
Ma Ri!

403
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:06,238
She has a pretty face, but she's kind of weird.

404
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,648
She's rude, too.

405
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:11,658
Why would Do Jun date someone like that?

406
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:22,998
Yes.

407
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,088
Hey, President Go.

408
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:27,898
Welcome.

409
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,198
Here. Have a seat.

410
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:32,648
Okay.

411
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,318
How are you feeling?

412
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,628
You should've stayed at the hospital longer.

413
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:44,978
Is it okay to start the shoot so soon?

414
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:48,308
Staying at the hospital was tougher for me.

415
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,838
I prefer working.

416
00:31:53,318 --> 00:31:58,238
You remind me of myself when I was young.

417
00:31:58,238 --> 00:32:02,118
I used to be all about work, too.

418
00:32:02,118 --> 00:32:04,668
Oh, I see.

419
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:11,478
As soon as you got discharged and started working, I wanted to see you.

420
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:14,438
You must be curious about it.

421
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:20,108
Actually, this is about me, my family,

422
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:27,828
your family, and... your destiny, too.

423
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,288
What is it...

424
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:37,488
Let me be straightforward.

425
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:44,518
I want you to... become Ma Ri's...

426
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,878
brother officially.

427
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:55,758
I already think I'm her brother.

428
00:32:56,758 --> 00:33:00,948
That makes you my son, too, right?

429
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,628
Pardon?

430
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:08,118
I...

431
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:12,778
want you to become my son.

432
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:23,788
Because Ma Ri is my sister, I consider you as my father, too.

433
00:33:25,288 --> 00:33:26,868
If so...

434
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:30,718
If you really mean that,

435
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:34,778
please be my adoptive son.

436
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:45,508
Chairman, what do you mean by that?

437
00:33:47,718 --> 00:33:54,348
It means I want you to become my son.

438
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:56,698
My legal son.

439
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,198
Did you say Pil Sung said no?

440
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,968
He must've been surprised because it was so sudden.

441
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:17,418
Of course.

442
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,288
You said something unimaginable.

443
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:26,848
You should meet with him and persuade him this time.

444
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:31,268
Regarding this matter, Pil Seung should want this

445
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:36,948
so I can meet with Mr. Go and Seon Yeong to discuss it and move forward.

446
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:38,768
Chairman Gong!

447
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:42,858
I didn't think you would, but how could you do this? How?

448
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:47,178
Chairman Gong. I mean, Jin Taek Oppa, if Pil Sung, who's not even a Gong, is okay,

449
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:50,288
but why can't my Jin Dan be the adoptive son? Why?

450
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:54,498
If he says he'll be adopted, instead of saying no,

451
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:59,068
would you give him the entire APP Group? Is that it?

452
00:35:00,318 --> 00:35:03,048
Give what to whom?

453
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:04,538
What are you talking about right now?

454
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:07,288
Auntie, the last time we talked,

455
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:10,798
I thought he was saying that out of anger

456
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:13,488
because Jin Dan's engagement was called off.

457
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,798
But he apparently met Pil Sung and

458
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:20,258
asked him to be his adoptive son.

459
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:24,558
Chairman Gong, did you really do that?

460
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:27,428
Yes, I did.

461
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:31,471
I'll make sure Pil Sung becomes my adoptive son.

462
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,498
That makes no sense at all.

463
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:38,108
You don't share blood or anything with that Pil Sung.

464
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:41,618
And do you think you own this whole family?

465
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:44,158
Do you think APP Group is entirely yours?

466
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:46,308
How dare you do whatever you want?

467
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:52,308
Yes, the family and APP Group are my responsibilities and my business.

468
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:58,038
- So, if you disagree with my decision, you should go back to the US immediately. 
 - What?

469
00:35:58,038 --> 00:36:00,868
Hong Ae Gyo, the same goes for you.

470
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:05,388
If you keep interfering with my family business, you should move out, too.

471
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:13,868
   

472
00:36:16,698 --> 00:36:19,798
Hey, Kim Seon Yeong! We need to talk. Kim Seon Yeong!

473
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,138
My gosh. I'm sorry.

474
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,658
Hey! Hey.

475
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:27,838
Hong Ae Gyo, what are you doing right now?

476
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:29,878
Why are you yelling at my restaurant?

477
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:31,598
How could I?

478
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:33,358
Be honest with me.

479
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,968
You talked Soo Yeon into it, didn't you?

480
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:39,828
You planned to use Pil Seung to take over our family and the company with Soo Yeon, didn't you?

481
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:42,178
What are you talking about?

482
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:45,468
Hey, Hong Ae Gyo! You aren't making any sense right now!

483
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:48,388
Gosh, look how she's denying it.

484
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:52,368
I know you told Soo Yeon to adopt Pil Sung.

485
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:54,198
W-What did you say?

486
00:36:54,198 --> 00:36:56,188
What do you mean, adopt who?

487
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,878
Why would you bring up Pil Sung suddenly?

488
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:02,848
Didn't you and Soo Yeon devise a scheme together to get him adopted by Chairman Gong?

489
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,838
Look here.

490
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,218
No one's adopting our Pil Sung. He's my son.

491
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:12,358
Seon Yeong, so, it's not true?

492
00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:18,518
Jang Soo Yeon,

493
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:21,548
what's going on here?

494
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:28,238
I heard you'll adopt my Pil Sung as your son. What does that mean?

495
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,648
Did Pil Sung tell you that?

496
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:35,938
What?

497
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,398
You mean...

498
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:47,028
Pil Sung knows about this, too?

499
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:48,578
What?

500
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,058
Yes.

501
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:57,078
Did you say "Yes" just now?

502
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:03,721
Ae Gyo told me all this earlier,

503
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:07,671
but I didn't believe her.

504
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:10,308
How could you do this to us?

505
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:14,071
How could you do this without saying anything to us?

506
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,038
Is this what you wanted?

507
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:19,218
Did you want Pil Sung in the end?

508
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:21,938
No, Seon Yeong. It's not like that at all.

509
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:25,348
So, please calm down and listen to me for a moment.

510
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,708
I beg you.

511
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:29,098
Listen to what?

512
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,488
How could you do this?

513
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,608
To be honest,

514
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:43,511
Jin Taek and I were in a car accident recently.

515
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:47,568
Thankfully, neither of us were hurt,

516
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:51,228
but at that moment, Jin Taek had this thought.

517
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,108
"What if we die at the same time,

518
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,428
what would our Ma Ri do?

519
00:38:57,428 --> 00:39:00,278
She'd be all alone in this world.

520
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:03,788
Who would take care of her then?"

521
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:10,578
Because of those worries, he couldn't even sleep after the accident.

522
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:16,708
But Pil Sung saved Ma Ri recently.

523
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:22,658
So, Jin Taek said the only person who'd care for our ill Ma Ri

524
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:28,598
and protect our company is Ma Ri's brother, Pil Sung.

525
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,228
So?

526
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:34,808
Is that why he wanted Pil Sung? To make him Ma Ri's guardian?

527
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:36,448
I mean...

528
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:43,568
I mean, Pil Sung saved Ma Ri.

529
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,758
You should thank us for it.

530
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,588
How could you try to adopt him as your son?

531
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,278
I was against it at first, too.

532
00:39:54,278 --> 00:39:58,978
Because Pil Sung is your son.

533
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,978
But Seon Yeong,

534
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:05,818
we're trying to adopt him only on paper.

535
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:10,808
He'll just be given the right to protect the company and Ma Ri.

536
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,228
Nothing else would change.

537
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:17,308
He'll always be your son, and he'll keep living with you.

538
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:22,328
So, please don't think we'll take him away from you.

539
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:24,638
And Seon Yeong,

540
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:30,588
we can't do this without your and Hyeon Cheol's legal consent.

541
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:32,738
It won't be possible.

542
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:35,968
I don't want to hear nonsense like that.

543
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:38,688
Let me make this clear.

544
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:41,068
Don't try to take my son.

545
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:45,428
Pil Sung is my son.

546
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,188
Goodness!

547
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:57,198
Is Seon Yeong out of her mind?

548
00:40:57,198 --> 00:40:59,578
A huge opportunity was given to us.

549
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,788
Why would she say refuse?

550
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:10,078
Gosh, I was struck by a gold shitstorm in my dream last night.

551
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:11,758
My gosh.

552
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:15,238
Was that dream about this?

553
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:17,808
Oh, my!

554
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:27,185
S-So, to let Pil Sung be in charge of APP Group and Ma Ri,

555
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,665
he wants to adopt him?

556
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:31,065
Yes.

557
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:32,875
That means...

558
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:36,875
they'll make him their legal son and give their assets

559
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:40,985
and everything they own to Pil Sung.

560
00:41:40,985 --> 00:41:42,265
But why?

561
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:45,715
What do you mean, why? It's because of Ma Ri.

562
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:52,335
They believe Pil Sung is the only one who would care for Ma Ri until the end.

563
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:54,725
So, basically, they're saying,

564
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:59,935
"We want you to be our son legally and protect Ma Ri and the company until the end.

565
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,005
Then, I'll give you everything we have. Everything."

566
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:04,565
That's ultimately what they mean.

567
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:09,665
Did she... really say that?

568
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:15,805
I was so shocked and angry that I didn't fully understand.

569
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:18,285
I think that's what she was saying.

570
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:22,015
Gosh. She definitely said that.

571
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:25,725
I heard it clearly with my own ears.

572
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:30,595
Mom, you mean you followed her and eavesdropped on the conversation?

573
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:34,025
Wow, you're really unbelievable.

574
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:36,845
Come on. That's not important right now.

575
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,585
Geez, can't you be quiet?

576
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,935
Hyeon Cheol, Seon Yeong,

577
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:45,735
if Ma Ri hadn't hurt her head and ended up that way,

578
00:42:45,735 --> 00:42:49,305
this never would've happened in a million years.

579
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:52,995
Even if they take Pil Sung away from us,

580
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:55,735
we should let them adopt him.

581
00:42:55,735 --> 00:43:00,795
I suppose. If you only think of Pil Sung's future,

582
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:04,105
getting him adopted would be the way to go.

583
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:05,975
That's what I'm saying.

584
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:11,255
And even if he got adopted by them, there's no way he'd ignore you.

585
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,105
You think he's that type of a person?

586
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:19,335
So, if you really care about him, you need to let him go.

587
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:20,745
 I'm home. 

588
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:22,545
- Hey, you're home. 
 - Pil Sung.

589
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,855
Come have a seat over here.

590
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:29,085
Pardon? Why? Is something going on?

591
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:37,524
Pil Sung, is it true that Chairman Gong wants to adopt you?

592
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:40,175
Well, yes.

593
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:44,695
He suggested we meet earlier today and told me that.

594
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:47,895
Wait. So what did you tell him?

595
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,055
You said you'd do it, right?

596
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,625
No.

597
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:56,155
I have my mom and dad right here.

598
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,285
That would make no sense.

599
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:01,895
So, I made it clear I don't want it.

600
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:04,395
So, don't worry about that. I'll go upstairs.

601
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:07,735
My gosh. My gosh. Geez.

602
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:12,655
How could he reject an incredible chance like this?

603
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:15,155
Seon Yeong, Hyeon Cheol, what are you doing?

604
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:18,215
Go ahead and persuade him right now.

605
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:22,225
Why... Why would he refuse such a thing?

606
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:40,565
Honey.

607
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,484
I...

608
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:48,154
I was losing my mind with anger when I was talking to Soo Yeon earlier.

609
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:52,605
I thought they wanted to take Pil Sung away because they have power.

610
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:56,295
But thinking about it,

611
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,695
as Mother said,

612
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:03,945
we should send him away even if we lose him.

613
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:11,075
Pil Sung became successful because of his abilities.

614
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,655
We did nothing for him.

615
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:16,555
If he wanted to get married now,

616
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:21,165
we can't even get him an apartment.

617
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:30,065
But if he gets adopted by them, he will be

618
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:34,245
living as the son of APP Group.

619
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:37,065
His future will change.

620
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:55,995
You...

621
00:45:57,825 --> 00:46:01,415
should just join that family.

622
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,995
Come on, Father.

623
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:09,345
What are you talking about? I'm not going anywhere.

624
00:46:09,345 --> 00:46:15,734
W-We believe you can help Chairman Gong lead APP Group well

625
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:19,795
and really think you could be Ma Ri's actual brother and...

626
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:23,705
take really good care of Mar Ri as her oppa.

627
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:26,105
So...

628
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:31,965
you should... become their adoptive son.

629
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:36,375
Mom, Father,

630
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:42,135
even if I don't become their son, I'm already Ma Ri's brother, and she's my sister.

631
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:47,035
Pil Sung, think carefully one more time.

632
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:49,975
Your future depends on this.

633
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:52,525
Mom,

634
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:55,775
becoming their adoptive son and

635
00:46:55,775 --> 00:47:00,135
being responsible for that family and company is a separate issue.

636
00:47:00,135 --> 00:47:03,635
And APP Group is a huge company. How could I?

637
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:10,725
And I'm satisfied with producing and directing TV dramas as I do now.

638
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:22,255
What did you say?

639
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:28,104
Hong Ae Gyo went to Mr. Go's restaurant and brought up the adoption?

640
00:47:28,785 --> 00:47:30,545
Yes.

641
00:47:30,545 --> 00:47:33,215
I guess Seon Yeong was shocked.

642
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:35,905
Of course.

643
00:47:35,905 --> 00:47:40,524
She might think we want to take his son away from them.

644
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,185
I'll meet with Mr. Go and Seon Yeong and explain everything tomorrow.

645
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:47,004
Don't worry so much.

646
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:48,934
Just trust me.

647
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,275
Okay.

648
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,845
What?

649
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:54,715
Hyung met with whom?

650
00:47:54,715 --> 00:47:59,575
He met with Go Pil Sung and begged him to be his adoptive son.

651
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:02,055
Wow, is he serious?

652
00:48:02,055 --> 00:48:05,215
So? So, did he agree to do it?

653
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,725
Of course, he did, right?

654
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:10,235
No, he apparently said no.

655
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:13,365
What? He said no?

656
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:15,725
He turned it down?

657
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:18,975
- Really, Mom? 
 - Come on, don't be naive.

658
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:22,035
Who would turn down APP Group?

659
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:25,405
This is all part of their plan, I'm sure.

660
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,075
Right? They're putting on a show, right?

661
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,245
Wasn't the accident a show, too?

662
00:48:30,245 --> 00:48:33,775
I know. What will you do now, Gong Jin Dan?

663
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:38,195
You couldn't even eat the meal set in front of you. Why did you flip it over, huh?

664
00:48:39,235 --> 00:48:43,615
Mom, if Hyung is actually doing this,

665
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:46,425
you think I'd just sit back and watch?

666
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:50,495
I'll put together a board meeting immediately.

667
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:52,915
What? Board meeting?

668
00:48:52,915 --> 00:48:54,725
Yes.

669
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:59,575
If he wants to adopt the son Soo Yeon's been hiding,

670
00:48:59,575 --> 00:49:01,555
you think the board of directors would sit still?

671
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:05,345
And what does Go Pil Sung know about running a company?

672
00:49:05,345 --> 00:49:09,385
We are letting someone like that run the company?

673
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:14,325
Mom, you think the board of directors would let that happen?

674
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:17,885
Hyung might have to down from the chairman position.

675
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:19,775
Gosh, you're right.

676
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:23,085
Yes. So tell him to go ahead.

677
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,765
Go Pil Sung is a Go...

678
00:49:24,765 --> 00:49:28,515
and I'm the second son of the founding chairman, Gong Dae Gil.

679
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:34,025
But he wants to give APP Group to a stranger with the last name Go?

680
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:37,295
Mom, that makes no sense at all.

681
00:49:37,295 --> 00:49:39,365
So, don't even worry about it.

682
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:41,115
O-Of course.

683
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:44,085
You're the younger son of Chairman Gong Dae Gil.

684
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:46,585
How dare he?

685
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,985
 Welcome, Ms. Park. 

686
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:08,815
 It's not true. I didn't get paid for sex. 

687
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:11,795
 - Excuse me, Ms. Park! 
 - It's not true! 

688
00:50:26,665 --> 00:50:28,305
I didn't do it...

689
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:31,875
No, no.

690
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,665
No, no, no.

691
00:50:33,665 --> 00:50:37,295
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

692
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:47,505
W-Who...

693
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:54,095
Who did that to me?

694
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:57,905
Who was it?

695
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:35,275
 I know we're desperate, but how could you try to get me a sugar daddy? 

696
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:38,935
 You tried to sell me to an old man now? 

697
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:40,694
 How could you do this as a mom? 

698
00:51:40,694 --> 00:51:43,004
 How could you? 

699
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:47,715
 Hey, what are you talking about? 

700
00:51:49,435 --> 00:51:51,505
 No... 

701
00:51:51,505 --> 00:51:54,065
 It wasn't Mom. 

702
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:57,255
 She never does things that don't get her money. 

703
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,035
 Who was it, then? 

704
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:04,635
 Could it have been the debt collectors? 

705
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:07,395
 No. 

706
00:52:07,395 --> 00:52:11,505
 They'd also lose out if they ruined my career. 

707
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,615
 It wasn't them, either. 

708
00:52:15,545 --> 00:52:19,315
Gosh, you scared me! You scared me. Gosh, you scared me.

709
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:21,915
Why won't you make any noise?

710
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:26,325
Ji Yeong, I made kimchi stew, your favorite.

711
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:32,875
Ji Yeong! You don't have a shoot today. Where are you going?

712
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:38,695
Why is she acting so cold?

713
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:40,795
She treats me like a stranger.

714
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:43,545
How long will she keep this up?

715
00:52:43,545 --> 00:52:46,005
When will she get her memory back?

716
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:50,755
How upsetting.

717
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:56,515
   

718
00:52:56,515 --> 00:52:59,495
   

719
00:53:05,355 --> 00:53:06,715
   

720
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:08,245
   

721
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:09,795
   

722
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:25,205
   

723
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:29,045
 Park Do Ra. 

724
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:31,875
 You came to me and asked for mercy yourself. 

725
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,595
 That's why... 

726
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:39,185
 I accepted you unconditionally despite your many flaws. 

727
00:53:39,185 --> 00:53:44,975
 But you're completely humiliating me right now. 

728
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:49,515
 You think you'd be okay after all this? 

729
00:53:50,515 --> 00:53:52,955
 You could go down for real. 

730
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:55,505
 Are you sure you won't regret it? 

731
00:53:57,515 --> 00:54:00,775
Could it have been President Gong Jin Dan?

732
00:54:06,055 --> 00:54:07,775
Yes.

733
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:13,295
He's the only one who would've done that to me.

734
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:17,965
He's the only one.

735
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:48,615
 No. 

736
00:54:49,175 --> 00:54:54,135
 He'll deny it if I asked him without evidence. 

737
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:59,305
 I won't get anything out of it and he'd only find out I'm Park Do Ra. 

738
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:14,295
I need to find evidence first.

739
00:55:15,465 --> 00:55:17,495
Evidence.

740
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:31,315
I thought Pil Sung's opinion was important because it directly involved him.

741
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:34,085
That's why I met him first and...

742
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:38,265
I was planning to discuss it with you afterward.

743
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:43,425
But I'm very sorry I upset you yesterday unintentionally.

744
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:47,375
No, not at all. Don't mention it.

745
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:53,335
You probably heard through my wife yesterday,

746
00:55:53,335 --> 00:55:55,294
but...

747
00:55:55,765 --> 00:55:59,075
the fact that I like Pil Sung

748
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:03,575
and want to adopt him as my son

749
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:07,755
doesn't mean I'll take him away from you.

750
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:14,715
I want our families to become one through Pil Sung.

751
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:19,575
They say life is unpredictable.

752
00:56:19,575 --> 00:56:25,335
My wife and I might die together someday.

753
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:27,184
If...

754
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:30,485
Pil Sung was to be my adoptive son,

755
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,775
he'd protect Ma Ri...

756
00:56:34,785 --> 00:56:39,184
and he'd care for my company, too.

757
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:41,775
That is...

758
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:45,375
truly the only thing I hope for.

759
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:51,165
Yes, I was mistaken about certain things yesterday.

760
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:55,985
I got angry, saying, "What does this all mean?"

761
00:56:55,985 --> 00:56:59,785
But now, I understand what you mean.

762
00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:03,325
I can tell you're sincere, too.

763
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,995
But the thing is...

764
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:11,185
regardless of what we think,

765
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:14,595
Pil Sung doesn't want it.

766
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:22,665
Did he tell both of you that, too?

767
00:57:22,665 --> 00:57:28,865
But I'm sure he's very thankful of the gesture.

768
00:57:28,865 --> 00:57:35,045
We're so grateful you think so highly of him, too.

769
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:40,945
Since he'd be in charge of my company, too,

770
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:45,535
I thought he might feel too much pressure from it.

771
00:57:45,535 --> 00:57:47,224
But...

772
00:57:47,774 --> 00:57:50,915
if he starts preparing now,

773
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:54,425
I believe he can definitely do a good job.

774
00:57:54,425 --> 00:57:58,875
He's capable of doing that.

775
00:58:00,155 --> 00:58:01,714
So...

776
00:58:02,235 --> 00:58:09,475
I'd like you to try persuading him one more time.

777
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:22,124


778
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,635
That's my mom.

779
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:34,565
Why is she locking arms with that bastard?

780
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:36,895
By chance...

781
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:47,715
Wow, is she out of her mind?

782
00:58:47,715 --> 00:58:51,915
How could she date a scammer like him?

783
00:58:54,725 --> 00:58:56,775
Ae Gyo, thank you.

784
00:58:56,775 --> 00:58:58,795
By the way, Sang Gu,

785
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:04,145
I gave you money when I told you to go to the Philippines.

786
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:07,575
It was quite a lot of money. Did you spend it all already?

787
00:59:07,575 --> 00:59:11,375
I used it because I needed it for something.

788
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:15,115
Is that so? What was it for, exactly?

789
00:59:15,115 --> 00:59:17,075
Are you cheating on me by chance?

790
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:18,785
What are you talking about?

791
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:21,915
You're the only one for me. The only one.

792
00:59:21,915 --> 00:59:24,285
Never mind, then.

793
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:26,615
I'm sorry for asking you for money, Ae Gyo.

794
00:59:26,615 --> 00:59:28,545
Gosh, it's okay.

795
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:31,615
Nothing I give you feels like a waste.

796
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:34,595
But as you know,

797
00:59:34,595 --> 00:59:39,015
I'm stressed out about Jin Dan and stuff these days.

798
00:59:39,015 --> 00:59:41,515
So, Sang Gu,

799
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:45,035
I think we should stop seeing each other for now.

800
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:49,915
I can't let them find out about our relationship, too.

801
00:59:52,085 --> 00:59:56,285
Okay. I'll do whatever you want me to do.

802
00:59:56,285 --> 00:59:58,015
Put the money away.

803
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:05,155
Hey, you scamming bastard!

804
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,025
Hey, you scammer.

805
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,645
How dare you take money from my mom?

806
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:13,515
I'll kill you today.

807
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:15,075
You son of a bitch!

808
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:17,445
No, Jin Dan! No!

809
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:21,935
You're not supposed to hurt him. You can't do that!

810
01:00:25,315 --> 01:00:28,245
I'm not supposed to hurt him?

811
01:00:28,245 --> 01:00:30,805
Who is he, exactly?

812
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:37,725
Chairman, I'll arrive in 10 minutes.

813
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:40,765
Yes. I'll wait in the lobby.

814
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:48,425
Can I have a guest list from two years ago?

815
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:52,355
I'm sorry, but we only keep the guest list for a year.

816
01:00:52,355 --> 01:00:56,385
And even if we had it, we can't release personal information.

817
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:58,895
This is very important to me.

818
01:00:58,895 --> 01:01:01,255
Is there a way to find out somehow?

819
01:01:01,255 --> 01:01:03,665
I'm sorry. It's the hotel policy.

820
01:01:03,665 --> 01:01:05,725
Manager, I beg you.

821
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:07,355
Ji Yeong.

822
01:01:10,195 --> 01:01:12,705
What are you doing here, Ji Yeong?

823
01:01:15,435 --> 01:01:17,065
Ji Yeong!

824
01:01:19,685 --> 01:01:21,565
Ji Yeong, hold on.

825
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,195
What's going on?

826
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:27,305
It's nothing.

827
01:01:27,305 --> 01:01:29,464
Why did you come here?

828
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,665
You're scared of this hotel.

829
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:37,475
You said you never come back here because it reminds you of bad memories.

830
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:45,215
You're right.

831
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:48,145
But when I was Park Do Ra,

832
01:01:48,145 --> 01:01:52,255
I was accused of having sex for money here and died because of that.

833
01:01:53,205 --> 01:01:56,605
I have no memory now, but I'm sure.

834
01:01:56,605 --> 01:01:59,685
Park Do Ra never would've had sex for money.

835
01:02:00,405 --> 01:02:02,905
I want to clear her name for that, at least.

836
01:02:03,705 --> 01:02:05,485
That's why I'm here.

837
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:12,155
But they won't share the guest list with me.

838
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:18,795
The hotel guest who framed you for prostitution.

839
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:22,005
I know who that is.

840
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:25,015
Pardon?

841
01:02:25,015 --> 01:02:28,045
Did you say you know who did it?

842
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:31,965
You had nightmares about it, and it tormented you.

843
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:35,835
I was going to tell you when you get your memory back,

844
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,765
but I'll tell you since you want to know why.

845
01:02:39,765 --> 01:02:42,115
That man was...

846
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:45,075
a reenactment actor named Hwang Jeong Shik.

847
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:47,145
Reenactment actor?

848
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:49,945
He was an actor?

849
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:54,545
Yes. I even visited him at his house.

850
01:02:54,545 --> 01:02:58,685
But he said he was hired to do it, too.

851
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:00,435
Really?

852
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:03,955
Where is he right now?

853
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:07,165
He promised to reveal all the truths,

854
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,955
but he ran away to the Philippines.

855
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,195
We don't know where he is anymore,

856
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:17,935
but I'm still looking for him with a reporter friend.

857
01:03:17,935 --> 01:03:20,485
I'm sure he'll get caught someday.

858
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:22,425
So, Ji Yeong,

859
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:25,565
have peace about it.

860
01:03:26,745 --> 01:03:28,725
You have been...

861
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:34,855
looking for him all this time?

862
01:03:38,275 --> 01:03:39,725
Yes.

863
01:03:41,935 --> 01:03:44,324
Do Ra was framed.

864
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:47,775
She would've never done such a thing.

865
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:50,625
I believe Do Ra.

866
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:58,865
You should've believed me, then, too.

867
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:03,865
Ji Yeong.

868
01:04:03,865 --> 01:04:06,715
You should've believed me, Oppa.

869
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:13,225
I begged you to believe me so desperately!

870
01:04:17,624 --> 01:04:19,404
♫  In your arms  ♫

871
01:04:19,404 --> 01:04:21,474
You're Do Ra, right?

872
01:04:21,474 --> 01:04:24,124
♫  With both my eyes closed  ♫

873
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:25,515
You're Do Ra, right?

874
01:04:25,515 --> 01:04:29,025
I didn't do such a thing, Oppa.

875
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:35,265
I told you I didn't do it.

876
01:04:35,995 --> 01:04:38,875
So, why did you do that to me?

877
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,855
Forget others. You should've believed me!

878
01:04:42,855 --> 01:04:45,715
Of all people, you should've believed me.

879
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,665
Why didn't you believe me? Why?

880
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,275
- Oppa. 
 - Do Ra...

881
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:58,035
I didn't do such a thing, Oppa.

882
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:01,085
I didn't do it.

883
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:07,805
- Do Ra, I'm sorry. 
 - I didn't do it, Oppa.

884
01:05:07,805 --> 01:05:10,495
- Oppa, I didn't do it. 
 - I'm sorry.

885
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:14,615
- Why did you let go of me like that? 
 - Do Ra.

886
01:05:14,615 --> 01:05:16,745
It was my fault.

887
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,305
I'm sorry.

888
01:05:20,985 --> 01:05:22,565
I'm sorry.

889
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:27,155
I'm sorry.

890
01:05:29,095 --> 01:05:32,025
   

891
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:35,735
♫  Tear us apart  ♫

892
01:05:35,735 --> 01:05:42,175
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

893
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:53,155
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

894
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:58,925
♫  One love  ♫

895
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:04,355
♫  Even if I fell apart like this  ♫

896
01:06:04,355 --> 01:06:06,345
 Hwang Jeong Shik? 

897
01:06:06,345 --> 01:06:08,065
 Why are you looking for this actor? 

898
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,565
 Ms. Kim went to the actors' association? 

899
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,515
 Why is Ms. Kim looking into him? 

900
01:06:11,515 --> 01:06:13,285
 Don't you know how small this world is? 

901
01:06:13,285 --> 01:06:16,505
 I'm looking into it. I'll help you. So, don't do anything. 

902
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,815
 It's my business. I'll do it. 

903
01:06:18,815 --> 01:06:20,915
 What's wrong? Is something going on? 

904
01:06:20,915 --> 01:06:22,145
 Haven't you seen this article? 

905
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,245
 How could something like this happen? 

906
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:27,575
 You'll suffer if you stay by my side. 

907
01:06:27,575 --> 01:06:29,265
 I'm not Park Do Ra. 

908
01:06:29,265 --> 01:06:31,325
 I'm Kim Ji Yeong. 

909
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:33,665
 Park Do Ra died back then. 

910
01:06:33,665 --> 01:06:36,325
 And we broke up back then, too.
