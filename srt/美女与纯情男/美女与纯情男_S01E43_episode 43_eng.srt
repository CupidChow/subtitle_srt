1
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:52,734
Hey, Go Pil Sung!

2
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:57,944
Oppa!

3
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:02,814
Who do you think you are?

4
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,414
How dare you take everything from me?

5
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:07,894
What are you doing? What do you think you're doing?

6
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:10,004
Get out of the way.

7
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,520
Do Ra!

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:21,570


9
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:26,224
What's with you, you bastard?

10
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,994
   

11
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:44,494
Jin Dan, what are you doing here?

12
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:46,844
Gosh, look at your face.

13
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:49,444
Pil Sung, did you do this to Jin Dan?

14
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,914
How dare you hit my Jin Dan? How dare you?

15
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:54,514
Please be quiet.

16
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,374
What happened?

17
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:00,634
Mr. Gong Jin Dan assaulted Mr. Go Pil Sung.

18
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:03,064
W-What did you say?

19
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:06,794
I'm not the only one who did that. Look at my face.

20
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,244
You used violence on him first.

21
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:12,264
The witnesses testified already.

22
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,994
Pil Sung! Pil Sung!

23
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:20,984
Pil Sung, you...

24
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,374
Are you okay? Huh?

25
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:24,404
- Gosh, your face. 
 - I'm okay.

26
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,784
Hello, Chairman.

27
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:29,704
But what's going on here?

28
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:34,214
Why did Ma Ri's uncle and Pil Sung fight?

29
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:39,444
I'm sorry. My brother did a terrible thing.

30
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,824
Can't believe you punched someone.

31
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,814
What are you, a thug?

32
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:52,804
Jin Dan, you're a Gong who'll lead this family.

33
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:56,124
How dare you act like an ignorant fool?

34
00:02:56,124 --> 00:02:58,204
Was I supposed to sit still, then?

35
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:00,894
He's about to become adopted and take everything from me.

36
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,004
Just look at how Hyung was acting. He didn't care about me at all.

37
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:08,254
Aunt, Jin Dan must've had a reason. He must've.

38
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,834
I'm so upset.

39
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:13,444
Jin Dan, listen to me carefully.

40
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,494
It's not over yet.

41
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,584
Pardon? Aunt, what do you mean by that?

42
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,954
Everyone has a flaw if you look for it.

43
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:24,714
Find Go Pil Sung's flaws, no matter what.

44
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:27,554
I'll use that and cancel the adoption.

45
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:31,464
I'll never let a Go take over my family.

46
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:39,014
Yes, is Pil Sung doing okay?

47
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:41,774
He's resting in his room now.

48
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:47,854
I never would've thought Ma Ri's uncle would be violent with Pil Sung again.

49
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:53,214
I knew he's got a temper, but...how could he do this?

50
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:57,254
Jin Taek scolded him a lot.

51
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:58,724
That won't happen again.

52
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:02,574
So, don't worry so much, okay?

53
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:07,734
Okay, let's talk in person. Bye.

54
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,984
You're having fun, aren't you?

55
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,964
Why did you hang up? Finish badmouthing my son.

56
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:16,814
I didn't badmouth him.

57
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:18,514
And he didn't behave well, either.

58
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,374
You think he did that for no reason?

59
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:23,354
He's about to lose everything. Is he supposed to sit still?

60
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:26,064
Are you saying it was a good thing he punched him?

61
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:30,294
Violence can't be justified in any situation.

62
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:36,004
Jang Soo Yeon, you're so superior.

63
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:38,084
You're a superior bitch.

64
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:40,034
What did you say?

65
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:42,784
Yes, you must be happy now.

66
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,120
That your son is getting adopted.

67
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,314
I never met a cunning bitch like you in my life.

68
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:51,044
Let me ask you one thing.

69
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:54,694
You've always been planning to...

70
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,494
get your son adopted, haven't you?

71
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,184
- Hong Ae Gyo! 
 - Hey!

72
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,134
The heavens are watching.

73
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,864
This isn't how you lead your life.

74
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:08,344
If you let me cry bloody tears, you'll end up crying bloody tears, too.

75
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:10,744
Have you thought about how Jin Dan must feel?

76
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,234
You should've stopped Chairman Gong from adopting Pil Sung.

77
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:17,184
How could you do this as if you've waited for it?

78
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:21,224
Jin Dan has been treating you well as his sister-in-law.

79
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,744
Just wait and see.

80
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,364
You'll be punished for this.

81
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,494
Oppa, are you okay?

82
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:34,294
Yes, I'm okay.

83
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:35,864
 You must've been scared. 

84
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:38,604
I'm okay.

85
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,724
But President Gong keeps doing this to you.

86
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:43,714
I really don't know what to do.

87
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:49,544
I left the police station because you told me to, but...

88
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,474
Was everything okay without me?

89
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:55,754
Everything was okay.

90
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,294
And you're an actor.

91
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,454
You can't get involved in things like this.

92
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:04,544
So, no matter what happens between President Gong and me, you'd better ignore it.

93
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,614
How could I do that? He's doing this because of me.

94
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,624
It's not because of you.

95
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:12,134
There's something else going on between President Gong and me.

96
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:14,594
I'll explain later.

97
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:19,534
And...I'll fix things one by one now.

98
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:23,524
So, don't worry about anything, okay?

99
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,134
Okay, I won't.

100
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,634
Thank you, Oppa.

101
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:34,394
Don't thank me.

102
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:38,794
I told you to just count on me. Just me.

103
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,614
Oppa,

104
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:49,424
since I got my memory back,

105
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:54,444
I'm scared that they'd find out that I'm Park Do Ra

106
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:58,644
and people would recognize me,

107
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:01,214
but on the other hand,

108
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:06,184
I'm happy that I can talk to you openly like this.

109
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,054
Do Ra,

110
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:13,274
I mean, Ji Yeong.

111
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:17,824
I'm by your side now.

112
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:21,924
 So, don't be scared, okay? 

113
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,914
Okay.

114
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:28,254
This is no good.

115
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:33,014
I won't call you "Do Ra" even when we're alone anymore.

116
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,764
Ji Yeong,

117
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:38,514
you aren't Do Ra but Ji Yeong.

118
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:41,534
Everything will be fine because you're Ji Yeong.

119
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:43,234
 Okay? 

120
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:46,274
Okay, Oppa.

121
00:07:57,964 --> 00:07:59,924
Yes.

122
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:02,244
Aunt was right.

123
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:05,734
He can't defeat me. I'm a Gong.

124
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,374
Yes.

125
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:17,124
Everyone has a flaw if you look for it.

126
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:20,754
I'll find that flaw, no matter what.

127
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:23,784
It's not over until it's over.

128
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:32,124
Geez, what's the deal?

129
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:35,554
How many times am I getting beaten up by him?

130
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,754
How should I destroy that bastard?

131
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,784
 Do Ra! 

132
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:50,574
Hold on.

133
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:57,904
I think Go Pil Sung said "Do Ra" to Ji Yeong earlier.

134
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:02,984
What am I thinking right now?

135
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:05,514
What does Do Ra have to do with this?

136
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:11,724
By the way, Ji Yeong never called me "Oppa" once.

137
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,914
But she called Go Pil Sung "Oppa"?

138
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:19,164
This is getting more infuriating.

139
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:21,864
Shit.

140
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:28,064
How was I cast for a beverage commercial?

141
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:31,224
I know, isn't it crazy?

142
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,714
They're paying you a fortune for it, too.

143
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,974
- Really? 
 - Yes!

144
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,974
They said they will pay a lot.

145
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:42,514
What's taking them so long?

146
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,414
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

147
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,504
Hello.

148
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:05,104
P-President Gong, what are you doing here?

149
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,164
This is my company.

150
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:10,704
I suggested hiring Ji Yeong as the model.

151
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:11,994
That's correct.

152
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:16,354
Our advertiser, President Gong, insisted on casting Ms. Kim.

153
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:18,954
That's why we contacted you.

154
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:21,174
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:25,274
I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I can.

156
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,374
I'll leave now.

157
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:34,874
We didn't know this was President Gong's company.

158
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:37,984
Things are awkward because of his one-sided engagement announcement.

159
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,414
We can't get involved with him again through this commercial.

160
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:45,304
I have no choice but to be on my client's side.

161
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,654
Well, then...

162
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,064
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong!

163
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:00,614
- Let me ask you one thing. 
 - President Gong.

164
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,734
What are you doing right now?

165
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,904
Hey, you stay out of this.

166
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:09,804
What?

167
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:12,254
President Lee, wait for me in the car.

168
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,284
I'll be right there.

169
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:17,094
Would you really be okay?

170
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:20,404
I'll be watching you.

171
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:23,734
Okay, go ahead. Watch me carefully.

172
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,754
Keep watching, okay?

173
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,694
Geez.

174
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,224
Do you have something else to say to me?

175
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:40,824
I have a lot to say. A lot.

176
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,194
You're the one who wanted to work things out with me.

177
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:47,924
You decided to be with me, but then you decided not to.

178
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,624
You think you can do everything the way you want?

179
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,534
Ask any psychiatrist.

180
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:58,674
When you break up with someone, you need to give them time to move on.

181
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:02,224
Even if we have to break up,

182
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:06,264
you need to give me time to move on, right?

183
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:10,404
So, I need to see you while I try to give up on you.

184
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:11,784
That's not going to happen.

185
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:13,124
Why not?

186
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:16,084
I'm dating Director Go Pil Sung.

187
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:23,554
Look how shameless you are.

188
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:24,904
Why?

189
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:28,074
Because Go Pil Sung is becoming APP Group's adoptive son,

190
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:30,964
you've moved on to him now?

191
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:33,354
Do you think Go Pil Sung will become APP Group's crown prince?

192
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:37,124
Dream on, Kim Ji Yeong. You chose the wrong side.

193
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:40,754
Go Pil Sung is a Go. I'm a Gong.

194
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:45,714
As long as I exist, Go Pil Sung will never take over APP Group.

195
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,674
I'm the owner of APP Group.

196
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:51,434
Come back to me while I'm giving you a chance.

197
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,434
I'll take you back.

198
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:57,834
I can't believe all this nonsense you're saying.

199
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:01,504
W-What? "Nonsense"?

200
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:03,874
- Did you just talk to me casually? 
 - Why?

201
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:07,214
You talk to me casually. Am I not supposed to do the same?

202
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:11,244
Hey, why...Why are you doing this to me?

203
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:16,084
Put your hand on your heart and think about why I'm doing this to you.

204
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:18,184
Think carefully.

205
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:30,634
What am I supposed to think?

206
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,824
What did I do so wrong, exactly?

207
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:39,844
By the way,

208
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:44,324
is she really Kim Ji Yeong?

209
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,124
I know she changed the way she speaks and dresses,

210
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:53,524
but she doesn't seem to be Kim Ji Yeong I know.

211
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,124
She's like a totally different person.

212
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,824
What's with this creepy feeling?

213
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:05,284
Why did you want to meet outside?

214
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,814
What if Jin Dan finds out we're seeing each other?

215
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,784
He doesn't have time for that right now.

216
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:13,894
He can't afford to care about us because he's upset.

217
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,654
Anyway, Sang Gu, move out of that house immediately.

218
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:18,894
Why?

219
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:22,554
The lady makes me tasty food, and I drink soju with Hyung sometimes.

220
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,414
I feel comfortable living there.

221
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,554
Food isn't the issue right now.

222
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,344
Do you know what they are?

223
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:30,664
They're our sworn enemies.

224
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:34,204
Their son got himself adopted instead of Jin Dan.

225
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:38,064
Their son is the slow Ma Ri's older brother.

226
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:41,164
What? Hyeon Cheol's son is?

227
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,844
How could he be Ma Ri's brother?

228
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:49,644
If so, did Seon Yeong have a relationship with Chairman Gong?

229
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:51,034
It's not that.

230
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:54,984
Ma Ri's mom gave birth to him and abandoned him there.

231
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,714
What?

232
00:14:56,714 --> 00:15:01,424
So, is the illegitimate son of Chairman Gong's wife Hyeon Cheol's son?

233
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:04,554
Yes, that's why you should move out.

234
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:09,214
And when we got caught, I said you were my cousin.

235
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:12,884
But it didn't seem like they believed we were cousins.

236
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:16,194
If they find out we're dating, it'd be a problem.

237
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,744
Anyway, move out quickly.

238
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,634
Geez.

239
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:34,700
 Sang Gu! 

240
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:38,754
 Sang Gu! Are you home? 

241
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,624
Hey.

242
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,934
You were home.

243
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:50,014
Sang Gu, Seon Yeong made an amazing seafood stew.

244
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:53,454
- Let's have some soju. Let's go. 
 - No, Hyung.

245
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:57,114
I'm not in the mood to eat fish stew with you right now.

246
00:15:57,114 --> 00:16:00,084
Why? Is something going on?

247
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,734
Hyung, I didn't know you were like this.

248
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:07,880
I know you like money, but how could you sell your son?

249
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,824
What are you talking about right now?

250
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,524
I heard everything.

251
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:16,564
I heard you're letting APP Group adopt your son.

252
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:20,404
How can you let a woman who abandoned him and lied to you for 30 years adopt him?

253
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,834
Don't you have any self-respect? Do you like money that much?

254
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:26,304
So, how much are they paying you for the adoption?

255
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:28,024
What are you talking about, you bastard?

256
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:30,074
You think you could just say anything?

257
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,734
Do you want to die?

258
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:34,074
Let go of me.

259
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,894
You bastard.

260
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:44,254
What did you say?

261
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,164
Sang Gu said that? That we sold our son?

262
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:48,204
Yes.

263
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:51,764
That we let the woman who abandoned our son adopt him like chumps.

264
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:53,694
He said we sold our son for money.

265
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,014
I can't believe this. Did he really say that?

266
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,574
Gosh, he must be out of his mind!

267
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,044
I hate that Ahjussi.

268
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:01,994
- Didn't you get a bad feeling from him? 
 - Right on.

269
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:05,634
But CEO Gong isn't even his son.

270
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:06,934
Why is he flipping out?

271
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,594
He said CEO Gong's mom was his cousin. Is he taking her side?

272
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:14,094
People might think CEO Gong is his son.

273
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,444
Huh? Cousin?

274
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:19,034
Did he say CEO Gong's mom is his cousin?

275
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:23,234
Yes, they said they're cousins. But I think that's so fishy.

276
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:27,574
Seon Yeong and I caught them eating ramen together.

277
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:30,154
So, I asked if she was his first love.

278
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,714
But they freaked out and said she wasn't.

279
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:34,354
You heard that, right?

280
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:40,474
CEO Gong's mom was stuttering and called him, "Honey," and then she said, "Cousin."

281
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:43,264
Who calls their cousin "Honey"?

282
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:46,334
They're definitely dating. I'm telling you.

283
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:49,094
I think so, too. Cousins, my foot.

284
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,694
Who cares?

285
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:56,174
I see why Sang Gu flipped out on you.

286
00:17:56,174 --> 00:18:00,044
If he marries CEO Gong's mom,

287
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:03,114
CEO Gong might become his son.

288
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,974
Is that why he did that?

289
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,464
Mom, that makes sense.

290
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,964
That's it! That's it!

291
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,324
My gosh.

292
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:14,144
If that were true... I really can't believe this.

293
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:16,804
I need to kick out Sang Gu, that bastard.

294
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:21,814
He said I sold my son with his dirty mouth.

295
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:25,974
Geez. When is his lease ending?

296
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,364
Two years from now on.

297
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:29,664
What? Two years?

298
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:31,424
If he doesn't move out on his own,

299
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:35,234
I have to stand seeing him for two years?

300
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:37,264
Seriously!

301
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:41,774
Aigoo, aigoo.

302
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:43,694
What's going on?

303
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:46,384
I definitely put them here.

304
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,634
I can't believe this.

305
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:52,234
Where did they all go?

306
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,114
Aigoo.

307
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:57,704
I was going to use them to get Ji Yeong

308
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:03,334
a ring, necklace, and bracelet when she gets married.

309
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:08,334
A fridge and TV, too.

310
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,524
I've been saving them one by one.

311
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:15,014
Do they have feet or wheels on them?

312
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:17,034
Aigoo...

313
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,584
Are you sure she had gold blocks?

314
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,164
Wasn't she just imagining them?

315
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:24,084
Gosh, I know.

316
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:27,424
No, I had them. I really had them.

317
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:29,194
Yes, she did.

318
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:32,570
She used to polish them sometimes.

319
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,214
Here.

320
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:38,444
I took a photo of them just in case.

321
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,174
Are these real?

322
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:46,464
This much gold must be worth a lot.

323
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:50,194
 Why did she have to take photos of them? 

324
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,504
 They won't be suspicious of me, right? 

325
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:57,144
 If I get caught, I'd get kicked out for real. 

326
00:19:57,144 --> 00:20:01,144
Where are these, anyway? We searched the whole house.

327
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:07,304
I know. I... was worried a thief would take them at night,

328
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:11,564
so I securely put them in a black plastic bag.

329
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,134
I'm serious.

330
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,774
 - Black plastic bag?  
 - Yes.

331
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:16,554
Black plastic bag?

332
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:22,974
Maybe you thought it was trash and threw it away.

333
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:26,034
I did take out the trash yesterday.

334
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,994
My gosh! My gosh!

335
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:32,414
I think I threw the black bag away, too.

336
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:35,224
- Move, move! What's going on? 
 - Are you serious?

337
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:36,844
- Seriously! 
 - Grandma!

338
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:40,334
 My gosh! What do I do? What in the world! 

339
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:42,854
They aren't in here.

340
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:49,504
They aren't. They aren't here.

341
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:52,554
These are our trash bags.

342
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:54,754
Ji Yeong, leave them. I'll put them away. Leave them.

343
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,224
Gosh, it stinks. My goodness.

344
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,074
Geez, it stinks.

345
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:01,704
Oh, my.

346
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:05,064
You!

347
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,914
It was you, wasn't it? Dong Dong, you did it.

348
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:10,384
Mom, what are you doing?

349
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:13,624
You saw me when I was looking at the gold blocks.

350
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:16,804
You said, "Are these all gold? Are they real?"

351
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:21,384
You bit it and asked me for one block.

352
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:23,244
Mom, when did I? When?

353
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:27,054
I've never seen that stuff here. I'm telling you.

354
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,304
You haven't? You didn't take them?

355
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:34,564
No, I've never seen them. How could I throw them away?

356
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:39,594
And why would I throw away gold blocks?

357
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:45,414
I must've thrown them away, then.

358
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:48,994
What do I do? What do I do?

359
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:56,534
Fighting!

360
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:58,224
Here I go.

361
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:03,404
- Are you okay, Do Jun? 
 - Yes.

362
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:11,614
You're the best. How will you come down?

363
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:17,814
- What do you think? 
 - You're good.

364
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:21,054
- Right? Aren't I cool? 
 - Yes, you're amazing.

365
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:22,444
- What? 
 - Are you crying?

366
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:27,454
What do you mean? I'm sweating. I wasn't scared.

367
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:33,424
Do Jun, I had so much fun today.

368
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:35,804
I had a lot of fun, too.

369
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,734
You must be tired. Let's go inside.

370
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:40,664
Huh?

371
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:43,874
You want me to just go in?

372
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:45,294
What?

373
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:47,264
Aren't you tired?

374
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:50,704
Don't you know what today is?

375
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:57,354
- What day is it? 
 - You really don't know?

376
00:22:57,354 --> 00:23:01,554
Today is our 30th day as a couple.

377
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:06,594
Why would you keep track of that?

378
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,334
I want to.

379
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:12,834
Because my days with you are so miraculous and precious.

380
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,724
Ma Ri.

381
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:25,654
That's to celebrate our 30 days together!

382
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:37,134
Really?

383
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:43,544
Ma Ri, why did you suddenly invite me?

384
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:48,464
I have a major announcement to make.

385
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,024
What? You have a major announcement?

386
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:55,964
Yes, Pil Sung agreed to be my actual brother now.

387
00:23:55,964 --> 00:24:00,424
Of course, he was my brother before, too, but he's becoming you and Dad's son now.

388
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:03,884
I feel like he's my brother completely, and we're a family now.

389
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,184
I'm so happy about that. I wanted to celebrate that, too.

390
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:10,504
And I wanted to treat you to a meal for my announcement.

391
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:13,624
Why isn't Dad coming to this special meeting? What a bummer.

392
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:16,534
He suddenly had a guest from abroad to entertain.

393
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,694
But what major announcement?

394
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:22,280
Do you have a boyfriend, by chance?

395
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:25,084
Oppa, how did you know?

396
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:28,594
What do you mean, how? You're under my thumb, Ma Ri.

397
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,944
So, you'd better tell me everything now.

398
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:35,374
Okay. That's why I wanted to see you.

399
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,694
Ma Ri, is that true?

400
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:43,044
Yes, it's been over 30 days since I had a boyfriend.

401
00:24:43,044 --> 00:24:45,904
What? It's been 30 days?

402
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:49,194
Why haven't you told me all this time?

403
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:51,964
I really wanted to tell you, but I held back.

404
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:55,680
They say you aren't supposed to open the champagne too soon.

405
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:58,934
Where did you hear that?

406
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:00,874
What's he like anyway?

407
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:05,574
You don't know any men besides Mr. Park.

408
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:09,894
He said you aren't seeing anyone, either.

409
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:14,544
To be honest, it's Mr. Park. Do Jun.

410
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:18,184
W-What?

411
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,154
Mr. Park?

412
00:25:20,904 --> 00:25:25,280
Is Mr. Park your driver and security guard?

413
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:28,464
It looks like you like him more.

414
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:30,814
It's true. I like him more.

415
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:34,134
- Can you tell? 
 - Yes, it's so obvious.

416
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:38,414
- You're acting shy, Ma Ri. 
 - No.

417
00:25:53,024 --> 00:25:57,704
W-Why is Ma Ri holding hands with Mr. Park?

418
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:03,734
W-What?

419
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:06,954
Did you know about it, too, then?

420
00:26:06,954 --> 00:26:09,184
I learned about it today, too.

421
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:11,564
It's been 30 days, apparently.

422
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:14,194
What have you been doing?

423
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:18,364
You didn't notice when they've been dating for 30 days.

424
00:26:18,364 --> 00:26:20,784
I like Mr. Park as a driver.

425
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:24,724
He's a nice fellow, but I never thought of him as Ma Ri's partner.

426
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:26,584
I was shocked at first, too.

427
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:31,554
But Honey, we should think positively for Ma Ri.

428
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,964
I was wondering why she looked so happy lately.

429
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:37,124
I think it's because she's been dating Do Jun.

430
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:40,974
He actually takes very good care of Ma Ri.

431
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:45,410
He apparently said he'd protect her for the rest of his life.

432
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:49,604
Men say all sorts of things to seduce women.

433
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:51,674
Come on, Honey.

434
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:53,824
Don't you remember?

435
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,544
Do Jun saved Ma Ri when they first met, too.

436
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:04,334
And most importantly, Ma Ri is happy about it.

437
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm so happy Ma Ri has a boyfriend. Aren't you?

438
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:13,574
I'm happy Ma Ri has a boyfriend.

439
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:17,404
But why does it have to be Mr. Park?

440
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:20,464
I could've found her someone nice.

441
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:27,860
Honey, we tried finding someone for Ma Ri, but it wasn't easy.

442
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,404
Mr. Park works for us because of a situation at home.

443
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:36,964
He studied abroad. He's polite, smart, and nice.

444
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:41,804
I think Do Jun is a good fellow with potential.

445
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:44,634
Okay, then.

446
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:46,644
Let's keep an eye on them.

447
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:50,484
And make it clear to Ma Ri.

448
00:27:50,484 --> 00:27:54,174
Tell her not to move fast. Tell her to just hold hands.

449
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,424
And... No, no, no.

450
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:01,124
I need to talk to Mr. Park in person.

451
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:06,114
I know you're a fool for your daughter, but that doesn't sound right.

452
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:08,580
That sounds silly.

453
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:13,304
Geez, why does it have to be Mr. Park?

454
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:32,164
Gosh, what kind of dream was that? Why did poop fall on me?

455
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:34,614
On my face, even...

456
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:39,404
Hold on. Isn't that a jackpot dream?

457
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:43,254
Yellow poop. That means I'll strike gold.

458
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:49,004
So what if I had a poop dream? Look at the state I'm in.

459
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:52,044
I need to play on a day like this.

460
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:55,834
But I have no money. No money.

461
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:07,114
Right.

462
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,814
There's that girl.

463
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:15,404
Do you mean it?

464
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:18,274
You'd no longer oppose me?

465
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:21,934
No, I wasn't thinking clearly.

466
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:26,564
You and Do Jun like each other. I didn't think I should be against it.

467
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:30,254
That's why I'm approving you and wishing you good luck.

468
00:29:30,254 --> 00:29:32,934
I wanted to see you to tell me that.

469
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:34,504
Really?

470
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:38,234
Thank you. I'm not good enough, but you accepted me.

471
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,024
Mother, I'll work hard from now on.

472
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:44,374
I'll do my best to like Do Jun.

473
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:47,704
 Do her best to like him? What does that mean? 

474
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,904
 Gosh, my head hurts. 

475
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:55,774
By the way,

476
00:29:55,774 --> 00:30:02,154
I... I approve of your relationship, but to be honest,

477
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:08,944
my family is struggling so much. I...feel so bad for you, Ma Ri.

478
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:11,394
Why? Why do you feel bad?

479
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,234
I'm okay.

480
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:16,714
 Huh? She needs to understand so I can move on with my plan. 

481
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,174
 I'm going crazy. Seriously. 

482
00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:26,284
The thing is... we used to be well off, too.

483
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,634
But we went bankrupt.

484
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:33,604
That's why I'm trying to get back on my feet, but that's not so easy.

485
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:37,164
I need money to let Do Jun finish his study abroad,

486
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:41,164
get him married, and stuff like that.

487
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:46,544
I see. Mother, don't worry about stuff like that.

488
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,244
I can let Do Jun study abroad

489
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:52,674
and don't worry about the wedding if Do Jun wants to marry me.

490
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:58,294
So, I was wondering, could I borrow some money?

491
00:30:58,294 --> 00:31:04,324
I'm thinking of running a side dish shop, but I have no money.

492
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:05,884
Pardon?

493
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:08,894
You have no money?

494
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:16,194
Gosh, seriously.

495
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,474
The money actually came through.

496
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:31,524
I was going to ask for 100 million, but I went for 200 million.

497
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:34,134
And I just got 200 million. 200 million. Oh, my gosh.

498
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:36,234
I could've gotten 300 million if I asked for 300 million.

499
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,164
Gosh, gosh.

500
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:39,554
No, no, no.

501
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:42,644
I can't get greedy. I can't get greedy.

502
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:46,984
150 million is enough to run a business.

503
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:51,424
But I'd have 50 million left.

504
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:55,764
Gosh.

505
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,844
What did you say?

506
00:31:58,844 --> 00:32:01,444
200 million was withdrawn from Ma Ri's account?

507
00:32:01,444 --> 00:32:04,254
Yes, this has never happened before.

508
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:07,754
I'm worried if it was a voice phishing.

509
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:11,184
Okay, you can leave.

510
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:27,714
Ma Ri, 200 million was withdrawn from your account.

511
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,584
What did you use it on?

512
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,010
Why do you ask?

513
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:34,654
There are a lot of scams these days.

514
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:39,274
I know it wasn't that, but I was a bit worried.

515
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:42,774
Dad, I'm not a fool. I won't fall for that stuff.

516
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,444
I just...

517
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:50,284
invested in someone who's... important and precious to me.

518
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:52,384
Invest?

519
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,314
W-What kind of investment?

520
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:55,844
You don't have to know.

521
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:58,374
Don't worry, Dad.

522
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,744
Yes, Secretary Kim. It's me.

523
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:09,894
Find out who Ma Ri sent money to and look into them.

524
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,264
Okay.

525
00:33:13,654 --> 00:33:15,324
Yes.

526
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:26,894
Because I go first.

527
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:29,744
Nice.

528
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:32,814
I'll go all in.

529
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:36,174
I'm out. I'm out.

530
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:37,554
What's wrong, Ms. Baek?

531
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:39,644
Fine.

532
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:43,054
Here.

533
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,864
Honey,

534
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,614
should I join you?

535
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:22,364
I should've followed you when you left.

536
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:29,214
Or... should I cut my wrist off?

537
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:35,094
Could you cut my wrist off for me?

538
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:39,804
I don't think I'm a human.

539
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:43,144
How could I lose all that money?

540
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,564
No.

541
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,394
My wrist won't be enough.

542
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:52,034
I might as well die.

543
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:55,214
Yes, I'll die.

544
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:57,784
Die! Die.

545
00:34:57,784 --> 00:34:59,554
I need to die!

546
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,384
Die!

547
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:05,334
Die! What's the point of living? Die! Die!

548
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:07,830
Honey, take me with you.

549
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,320
Take me...

550
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,814
Take me with you! Take me with you!

551
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:17,914
Take me with you!

552
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:22,074
Honey, take me with you.

553
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,154
You can go in.

554
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:36,654
Okay.

555
00:35:45,124 --> 00:35:47,174
Why is Do Jun going into Dad's study?

556
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:51,454
Ma Ri, you should be upstairs.

557
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:53,634
Why? Is something going on?

558
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,854
 Is this why you came to our house? 

559
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:59,024
 Was your goal taking money from Ma Ri? 

560
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:02,384
Mom, is he yelling at Do Jun right now?

561
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:03,774
What's wrong with him?

562
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,624
You didn't know anything?

563
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,744
Are you serious right now?

564
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:11,964
Chairman, I really don't know what you mean.

565
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,904
I-I swear it's not true.

566
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,974
- Dad, why are you yelling at Do Jun? 
 - Ma Ri, let's go.

567
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:24,024
Dad, why are you yelling at Do Jun?

568
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:27,294
Park Do Jun, this bastard's mom took 200 million from you.

569
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:29,134
She plotted it with him.

570
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:31,934
He approached you for money.

571
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:34,704
This bastard is a scam artist!

572
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:36,350
Dad, it's not true.

573
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,870
Do Jun isn't like that.

574
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,334
I just gave the money to Do Jun's mom.

575
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,824
She said she wanted to start a side dish shop.

576
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:47,854
Ma Ri,

577
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:52,094
did you really give money to my mom?

578
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,414
Yes, I did.

579
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,654
She said she had no money.

580
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:02,754
Mr. Park, you're fired.

581
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,430
Move out of my house immediately.

582
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,060
Immediately!

583
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,324
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:11,044
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:14,864
- Do Jun! 
 - Ma Ri, no!

586
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:31,488
 Park Do Jun, this bastard's mom took 200 million from you. 

587
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:33,798
 She plotted it with him. 

588
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,648
 He approached you for money. 

589
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:39,168
 This bastard is a scam artist! 

590
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:52,068
Park Do Jun.

591
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:54,248
Is that true?

592
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:57,968
Did you really plan that with your mom?

593
00:37:57,968 --> 00:38:01,138
You dated me... and said you'd protect me.

594
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:05,848
Was it all... because of money?

595
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,328
It's not true, right?

596
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:12,648
It's not true, right, Do Jun?

597
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,658
- Ma Ri— 
 - Do Jun, I really don't think you're like that.

598
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:19,838
So, please just say no.

599
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,648
You aren't a bad person like that.

600
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:26,748
That's right.

601
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:28,548
I didn't do that.

602
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:30,738
I didn't deceive you.

603
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:33,298
I didn't date you for money.

604
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:35,168
But...

605
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:38,998
because my mom indeed took money from you,

606
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:42,618
I can no longer be with you.

607
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:46,350
You didn't do it.

608
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,140
Why can't you be with me?

609
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:52,968
Hey, Park Do Jun. What are you talking about right now?

610
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:55,658
- Hyung. 
 - Answer me!

611
00:39:00,748 --> 00:39:02,888
N-No...

612
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:05,928
Take? Scam?

613
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:10,068
No, no. I borrowed it from her, Do Jun.

614
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:13,338
Because your sister won't let me manage her money,

615
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:17,278
I'm nothing but a maid for her now.

616
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:20,338
I was going to borrow it briefly and start a business.

617
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:24,618
I was trying to do something myself with it.

618
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:27,328
And you turned him into a scam artist?

619
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:29,298
Her father called Do Jun a scam artist.

620
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:31,718
He said he scammed her with you!

621
00:39:31,718 --> 00:39:35,158
What strange people. I didn't scam her!

622
00:39:35,158 --> 00:39:38,308
She gave me the money voluntarily.

623
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:41,598
- Mom! 
 - Hey...

624
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:44,198
Ahjumma, where's the 200 million?

625
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,648
Yes, I'll believe what you said.

626
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:49,638
So, give me the 200 million you got from her.

627
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:55,028
I don't have it.

628
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:57,318
I don't have any left.

629
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,398
Mom.

630
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:03,398
200 million is gone? What do you mean?

631
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:08,708
Mom, did you lose all that money through gambling again?

632
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,628
It's not true, right?

633
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:12,838
You didn't do that, right?

634
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:14,648
Mom, I need to pay that money back.

635
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:18,448
I need to pay them back! So, give me the money right now.

636
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:20,928
Give me the money right now! Right now!

637
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,928
Do Jun.

638
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:26,078
Do Jun, I'm sorry. I...

639
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:30,058
I wanted to make more money since I had some on hand.

640
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:31,848
So, I...

641
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:36,998
I tried to turn 200 million into 300 million, but I lost all of it.

642
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:41,418
I tried to jump into the Han River and die then...

643
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:44,458
I even went all the way to Han River. I really did.

644
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,858
Do Jun, Ji Yeong, and Do Sik, please forgive me.

645
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,968
I swear I will...

646
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:54,138
You know, I will... make money and pay you back.

647
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:59,838
Do Jun, Ji Yeong, and Do Sik, please forgive me. Forgive me.

648
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:02,578
How could you do that?

649
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:06,268
How could you do that?

650
00:41:08,018 --> 00:41:09,778
 This is the police! 

651
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:13,628
Yes, just one second.

652
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:20,438
- What's this about? 
 - You reported about lost gold, right?

653
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,988
Yes, I did.

654
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:25,238
We found the gold blocks you reported while surveying stolen goods.

655
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:28,328
It says Ms. Baek Mi Ja sold them.

656
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:34,968
Hold on, does this mean you sold Grandma's gold?

657
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:36,778
Is that what they mean?

658
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:39,128
I'm sorry.

659
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:40,598
I'm sorry!

660
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,788
I'm sorry.

661
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:45,718
I'm sorry!

662
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:52,418
I'm sorry!

663
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:56,338
I'm sorry...

664
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:57,908
I'm sorry...

665
00:41:57,908 --> 00:42:01,488
My gosh. I'm sorry.

666
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:07,068
I'm sorry...

667
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:25,828
Mom.

668
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:29,598
I managed to hold back when Do Ra died.

669
00:42:30,378 --> 00:42:34,638
But I don't think I could see you ever again.

670
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:38,858
Do Sik, what do you mean?

671
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:43,588
I said I was sorry.

672
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:49,058
Our youngest, Do Jun, whom you loved and cherished.

673
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:51,728
What did you do to him?

674
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,778
We went bankrupt overnight,

675
00:42:56,778 --> 00:43:01,110
but Do Jun has been living diligently.

676
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:04,668
He just needed to live happily with his girlfriend,

677
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,740
but you turned Do Jun...

678
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:10,518
into a despicable bastard who took money from her.

679
00:43:12,468 --> 00:43:15,918
Do Sik, I'm sorry.

680
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:19,688
Please forgive me just once.

681
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:23,158
I can't live without you.

682
00:43:23,158 --> 00:43:25,308
Don't abandon me!

683
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:28,698
Forgive me.

684
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:33,328
Do Sik! Do Sik, I swear...

685
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:38,508
If I gamble again, I'll cut my wrist off.

686
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:42,758
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

687
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:45,478
Do Sik! Do Sik, don't go!

688
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:47,018
Don't go, Do Sik!

689
00:43:47,018 --> 00:43:48,718
Take me with you.

690
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:51,638
Take me with you! I can't be without you!

691
00:43:51,638 --> 00:43:53,618
I can't be without you, Do Sik!

692
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:56,958
Do Sik! Do Sik!

693
00:44:10,258 --> 00:44:11,978
Hey.

694
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,558
Oppa.

695
00:44:25,768 --> 00:44:27,168
Oppa,

696
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:29,878
this is 200 million won.

697
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:32,368
Please pay them back for him.

698
00:44:33,578 --> 00:44:37,228
Where did you get all this money?

699
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:40,998
I got paid for the drama and commercial.

700
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:48,518
I'm sorry.

701
00:44:49,468 --> 00:44:51,788
I should be doing this instead.

702
00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:57,468
No, Oppa.

703
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:01,038
No, Oppa.

704
00:45:01,038 --> 00:45:03,138
Don't say stuff like that.

705
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:34,918
Here's the money my mother, Baek Mi Ja, received from your daughter.

706
00:45:34,918 --> 00:45:37,828
I apologize on her behalf. I'm very sorry.

707
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:44,138
Okay, you can leave now.

708
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:47,838
Chairman,

709
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:54,708
my mother did a terrible thing to your daughter.

710
00:45:55,648 --> 00:46:00,148
I'm ashamed, and I feel terrible.

711
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:02,928
But...

712
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:08,098
Do Jun knew nothing about it.

713
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,708
Do Jun did nothing wrong.

714
00:46:11,528 --> 00:46:16,228
He's more honest and proper than anyone.

715
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:19,208
I swear he didn't do it.

716
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:24,458
So, what I'm saying is...

717
00:46:25,308 --> 00:46:28,738
I hope you believe that, at least.

718
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:36,138
Please leave if you're done.

719
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:51,148
I...

720
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:54,558
felt sorry for Mom.

721
00:46:57,088 --> 00:47:01,388
When Dad passed away, Mom was in her mid-to late 30s.

722
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:04,258
Thinking about it, she was about my age.

723
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:09,548
At a young age, with three children,

724
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:13,188
she struggled as a single mother.

725
00:47:13,848 --> 00:47:15,838
She went through a lot.

726
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:23,648
Do Jun, you probably don't remember her then because you were young.

727
00:47:25,438 --> 00:47:27,368
She wasn't like this at first.

728
00:47:27,368 --> 00:47:30,658
She sold apples and melons at a market.

729
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:33,118
And she did dishes at restaurants.

730
00:47:33,968 --> 00:47:36,758
She went through so much.

731
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:38,888
And I witnessed all that.

732
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:48,280
But at some point, she started playing Go-Stop with people at the market.

733
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:52,808
"Mom, don't do stuff like that."

734
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,368
I couldn't say that to stop her.

735
00:47:57,138 --> 00:48:00,868
I pitied her for not having any joy.

736
00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:11,288
When Do Ra died, I couldn't let go of her.

737
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:16,190
I knew she did a horrible thing, but I couldn't let go of her. Why?

738
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:18,670
Because she's my mom.

739
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,118
Because she's our mom.

740
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:26,348
I couldn't let go of her.

741
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:31,618
If I did, you two wouldn't be suffering like this.

742
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:35,158
I put you through this.

743
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:38,538
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

744
00:48:38,538 --> 00:48:40,258
No, Hyung.

745
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,678
No.

746
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:50,678
We don't have a mom from now on.

747
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,628
I'll pretend she died when Do Ra died.

748
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:55,958
I'll think that.

749
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:58,778
You should pretend she died, too.

750
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:01,558
Do Jun,

751
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:05,508
Do Ra,

752
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:07,788
I'm sorry.

753
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:10,698
I'm sorry.

754
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:30,918
   

755
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:33,488
   

756
00:49:33,488 --> 00:49:35,838
"Director Go Pil Sung finds success abroad, too.

757
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,698
Will he continue the success story with the new actor?"

758
00:49:38,698 --> 00:49:41,048
All the articles are praising you.

759
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:42,708
Congratulations.

760
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,908
- Congrats! 
 - That's enough. That's enough.

761
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:49,048
I can't look at you because I'm embarrassed.

762
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:52,558
This is all thanks to the actors and staff members

763
00:49:52,558 --> 00:49:56,308
who worked their hardest on hot summer days.

764
00:49:56,308 --> 00:50:00,398
Let's work hard until the end to return the favor to our viewers.

765
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,498
Let's cheer up today, too!

766
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:04,288
Fighting!

767
00:50:04,288 --> 00:50:05,728
Fighting.

768
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:11,748
Who sent that?

769
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:15,908
I wasn't told anything today.

770
00:50:20,138 --> 00:50:22,998
Thank you, everyone!

771
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:26,838
I made money because the Seoul Lady's premiere was a success.

772
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:29,448
That's why I'm treating you with this coffee truck.

773
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:31,168
Help yourselves.

774
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:35,558
    
 I prepared gelato from Italy, too.

775
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,608
Cool off with it, okay?

776
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:42,778
Ji Yeong, are you really getting engaged to him?

777
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:46,478
The engagement article was removed and said it was an error.

778
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:48,398
So, I thought there was nothing going on.

779
00:50:48,398 --> 00:50:50,828
- Are you dating him again? 
 - No.

780
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:53,028
I swear there's nothing going on between us.

781
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:54,438
Move it out. Move it out.

782
00:50:54,438 --> 00:50:58,298
Move it further out so it's more visible. Come on.

783
00:50:58,298 --> 00:51:02,488
CEO Gong, let's talk for a second.

784
00:51:02,488 --> 00:51:04,838
I have nothing to say to you, CEO Go.

785
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:07,568
Director, I'll talk to him.

786
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:13,178
CEO Gong, let's talk for a moment.

787
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:15,808
Okay, let's.

788
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:32,078
CEO Gong, why are you doing this?

789
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:35,358
Why do you keep asking me that question?

790
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,408
How much more do I need to explain?

791
00:51:38,408 --> 00:51:40,338
I told you last time.

792
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:43,898
I need time to process the breakup.

793
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:48,188
My heart is still not ready to let go of you.

794
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:53,308
And I came here to celebrate your drama's success as a fan.

795
00:51:53,308 --> 00:51:55,278
To lift you up.

796
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,368
Why do you not understand my pure intention?

797
00:51:57,368 --> 00:52:02,868
Even if your intention were pure, it's abuse when the other person rejects it.

798
00:52:02,868 --> 00:52:04,508
I'm rejecting you.

799
00:52:04,508 --> 00:52:06,638
Why do you keep doing this to me?

800
00:52:06,638 --> 00:52:09,918
What would people think of me if you kept doing this?

801
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:14,508
I don't want others to misunderstand me because of you.

802
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:17,448
- So, please stop. 
 - I can't stop.

803
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,368
I made it clear.

804
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:21,378
I'm not done with you yet.

805
00:52:21,378 --> 00:52:24,178
You want to keep doing this, huh?

806
00:52:24,178 --> 00:52:27,408
Okay, I have no choice, then.

807
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:31,898
I tried not to do this because of your social status,

808
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:37,078
but I'll sue you for stalking and request a restraining order.

809
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:39,958
What? What?

810
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:42,298
I-I'm a stalker?

811
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:44,538
You'll report me?

812
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:50,068
Hey, did I hit you, imprison you, or call you hundreds of times?

813
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:52,328
What are you reporting me for?

814
00:52:52,328 --> 00:52:55,338
I'm saying I want to be your fan with a pure heart.

815
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,388
- Your fan, your fan! 
 - Hey, Gong Jin Dan!

816
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:02,898
Wow.

817
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:06,168
What? What did you say just now?

818
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:09,288
"Hey"? "Gong Jin Dan"?

819
00:53:09,288 --> 00:53:13,628
How dare you talk down to me in this polite country? I'm way older than you.

820
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:17,288
- Are you on drugs? 
 - You must be on drugs.

821
00:53:17,288 --> 00:53:18,998
You think I'm a joke, don't you?

822
00:53:18,998 --> 00:53:22,248
You'd better stop while I'm being nice, okay?

823
00:53:22,248 --> 00:53:26,748
I'll report you if you act like a lunatic again!

824
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:29,408
This is my last warning.

825
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:42,238
She's not Kim Ji Yeong.

826
00:53:42,238 --> 00:53:47,018
Only her face is Kim Ji Yeong.

827
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:49,108
She's changed inside.

828
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:52,088
She was possessed by someone else.

829
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:56,708
CEO Gong tried to give Ji Yeong a commercial deal?

830
00:53:56,708 --> 00:54:00,988
Yes, he used that to make a move on her.

831
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,518
He's bragging his wealth or something.

832
00:54:03,518 --> 00:54:05,808
I don't know what's wrong with him.

833
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:09,668
So, what happened?

834
00:54:09,668 --> 00:54:11,978
She rejected it immediately.

835
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,518
Because she has zero feelings for him.

836
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:17,968
And now he sends her the coffee truck.

837
00:54:19,378 --> 00:54:21,778
What should we do with CEO Gong?

838
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:24,868
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.

839
00:54:24,868 --> 00:54:27,498
I'm sorry for making you worry, Director.

840
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,308
We should take care of this on our own.

841
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,868
No, thank you for letting me know.

842
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:34,498
Okay.

843
00:54:34,498 --> 00:54:37,958
I'll get going now, Director.

844
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,688
Thank you.

845
00:54:48,308 --> 00:54:50,178
 It says Ms. Kim is engaged. 

846
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:52,128
 Here's the article. 

847
00:54:53,948 --> 00:54:55,808
 

848
00:54:57,568 --> 00:55:01,988
 We released a statement denying the engagement, 

849
00:55:01,988 --> 00:55:04,678
 but it disappeared immediately. 

850
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:09,878
 We're asking for the articles to be removed, but it's only spreading all over the social media. 

851
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,538
 CEO Gong trapped me... 

852
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,828
 in that villa. 

853
00:55:17,758 --> 00:55:19,778
 Oppa, 

854
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:23,698
 Oppa, I want to get away from him. 

855
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,988
 I really hate him so much. 

856
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:32,788
 He's still doing this. 

857
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,068
 If he finds out I'm Do Ra, 

858
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:39,338
 I shudder to think what he'd do. 

859
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:06,498
Ji Yeong.

860
00:56:09,648 --> 00:56:13,918
Oppa, you did something wrong, didn't you?

861
00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:16,738
You've been so anxious.

862
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:18,758
You're acting strange today.

863
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:22,758
- Give me your hand. 
 - My hand?

864
00:56:38,448 --> 00:56:40,068
Ji Yeong,

865
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:44,528
please marry me.

866
00:56:57,298 --> 00:56:59,268
Marry?

867
00:57:00,978 --> 00:57:03,218
What are you talking about?

868
00:57:05,928 --> 00:57:10,858
When our drama, "Seoul Lady," ends,

869
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:13,008
let's get married.

870
00:57:13,008 --> 00:57:15,748
The moment I knew you were Do Ra,

871
00:57:16,628 --> 00:57:18,948
I wanted to marry you.

872
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:21,138
No way.

873
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:24,288
How could I marry you?

874
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:26,498
Why can't you?

875
00:57:26,498 --> 00:57:30,858
We managed to reunite... and we like each other.

876
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:37,428
And I think we need to be married... so I can protect you.

877
00:57:45,948 --> 00:57:47,478
Oppa,

878
00:57:48,688 --> 00:57:51,308
I'm Park Do Ra.

879
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:53,588
I'm a dead person.

880
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,848
What if people find out I'm Park Do Ra?

881
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,428
You'd go down, too.

882
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:02,418
I can't risk that and marry you.

883
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:15,048
As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to go to hell.

884
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:21,798
I told you... that I'll never let go of your hand again.

885
00:58:23,328 --> 00:58:25,578
For me to protect you,

886
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:28,168
I need to marry you.

887
00:58:29,478 --> 00:58:31,868
So, no one can hurt you.

888
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:37,478
So, no one can walk all over you.

889
00:58:50,548 --> 00:58:52,708
I appreciate the thought, Oppa.

890
00:58:54,688 --> 00:58:56,918
I really appreciate it.

891
00:58:58,218 --> 00:59:01,998
But I can't put you in danger, too.

892
00:59:01,998 --> 00:59:06,148
♫  I will love you  ♫

893
00:59:06,148 --> 00:59:08,428
Okay.

894
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:11,528
Let's get married later, not now.

895
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:16,488
When I clear my name and show myself proudly as Park Do Ra,

896
00:59:16,488 --> 00:59:19,098
we'll consider it then.

897
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,548
Okay?

898
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:26,358
I don't care if you're Kim Ji Yeong, Park Do Ra, or Go Chun Ja.

899
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:30,518
I'll be by your side, no matter who you are.

900
00:59:30,518 --> 00:59:33,028
I won't let you be lonely.

901
00:59:33,758 --> 00:59:36,210
When you're in danger,

902
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,658
I'll be by your side...

903
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:42,228
and hold your hand.

904
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,298
So, let's get married.

905
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:49,458
Oppa, why are you so foolish?

906
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:53,148
You can be on the cliff's edge because of me.

907
00:59:53,148 --> 00:59:56,708
- Because of me, you can— 
 - Answer me this one question.

908
00:59:57,268 --> 00:59:59,688
Do you like me or not?

909
00:59:59,688 --> 01:00:06,458
♫  Our days together  ♫

910
01:00:07,558 --> 01:00:09,820
I like you.

911
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:14,090
♫  Even the awkward days  ♫

912
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,680
♫  Please remain and  ♫

913
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,780
I like you.

914
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,130
♫  Remember them  ♫

915
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,220
I like you.

916
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:26,200
♫  I'm happy because I met you  ♫

917
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,758
That's enough, then.

918
01:00:28,698 --> 01:00:30,228
That's enough.

919
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:33,548
You just need to trust me...

920
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,098
and follow me.

921
01:00:42,858 --> 01:00:44,628
Don't worry.

922
01:00:44,628 --> 01:00:50,818
♫  You, who became my light  ♫

923
01:00:56,518 --> 01:00:58,850
   

924
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,860
   

925
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,808
Yes, what made you call me, Hyung?

926
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:18,728
A drink?

927
01:01:20,398 --> 01:01:22,398
Sure.

928
01:01:22,398 --> 01:01:24,188
Okay.

929
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:25,748
Bye.

930
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:32,448
What's this?

931
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:35,048
Will the sun rise from the west tomorrow?

932
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:39,918
Can't believe he called me to have a drink together.

933
01:01:39,918 --> 01:01:42,698
What's this now?

934
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:48,588
Does he feel guilty about adopting Go Pil Sung and wanting to give me a few more companies?

935
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:54,568
Hyung.

936
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:57,438
You made it.

937
01:01:57,438 --> 01:01:59,758
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

938
01:02:05,298 --> 01:02:09,728
So, what's going on? Can't believe you suggested a drink with me.

939
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:22,348
CEO Go, you came. Have a seat here.

940
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:25,088
Okay.

941
01:02:34,408 --> 01:02:37,898
Hyung, what are you doing right now?

942
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:41,048
You didn't want to drink alone with me.

943
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:44,598
You invited me to drink with Go Pil Sung, this bastard?

944
01:02:46,168 --> 01:02:49,678
Hyung, I...

945
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,178
can't drink with this bastard.

946
01:02:52,178 --> 01:02:57,318
You two can play a clapping game and drink together.

947
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:59,208
Sit down.

948
01:03:13,078 --> 01:03:15,998
Okay, let's all have a drink.

949
01:03:29,618 --> 01:03:35,468
If CEO Go gets adopted, we'll become a family.

950
01:03:35,468 --> 01:03:37,148
Jin Dan, you'll become his uncle.

951
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:43,978
You and CEO Gong can't go to the police station together and embarrass yourselves.

952
01:03:43,978 --> 01:03:49,528
So, if you have any misunderstandings or hurt feelings,

953
01:03:49,528 --> 01:03:53,478
you should get them off your chests.

954
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:58,058
- That's why I arranged this. 
 - A family?

955
01:03:58,058 --> 01:04:01,838
Hyung, let me make this clear.

956
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,498
I can never acknowledge him as your adoptive son.

957
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:09,998
It's not your place to acknowledge it or not.

958
01:04:09,998 --> 01:04:12,598
I have already made the decision.

959
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:16,578
You'd become CEO Go's uncle.

960
01:04:16,578 --> 01:04:18,218
You'd better act like an adult.

961
01:04:18,218 --> 01:04:20,048
How dare you speak so rudely?

962
01:04:20,048 --> 01:04:22,718
How dare you turn him and me into a family?

963
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:26,170
I said I didn't want to be a family with him!

964
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:34,430


965
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:37,648
CEO Go, I'm sorry.

966
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:40,608
I don't think I should've arranged this.

967
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:45,308
No, I'm okay.

968
01:04:45,308 --> 01:04:47,458
Fine.

969
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:49,188
Then...

970
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:55,528
if CEO Go agrees to one condition, I'll do what you say.

971
01:04:57,428 --> 01:04:59,688
What is it? Tell us.

972
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,940
Kim Ji Yeong, the woman I used to date.

973
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,740
If CEO Go breaks up with her,

974
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,160
Then...

975
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:11,038
I'll at least think about it if I can... accept him as my family.

976
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:19,338
Break up with Kim Ji Yeong.

977
01:05:19,338 --> 01:05:21,958
I'll think about it, then.

978
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:24,408
Since Hyung is begging me so much.

979
01:05:26,778 --> 01:05:31,808
I have no interest in breaking up with Ms. Kim.

980
01:05:32,858 --> 01:05:37,268
And we're even considering getting married.

981
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:43,238
What? Marry?

982
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,818
Who says you can marry her?

983
01:05:53,758 --> 01:05:56,708
   

984
01:05:56,708 --> 01:06:01,618
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

985
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:06,988
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

986
01:06:06,988 --> 01:06:12,988
♫  I've already fallen for you  ♫

987
01:06:12,988 --> 01:06:18,658
♫  I'm not able to free myself anymore  ♫

988
01:06:18,658 --> 01:06:24,008
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

989
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,768
 You want to marry Kim Ji Yeong? 

990
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:34,698
 Go Pil Sung, that bastard, drove you to die! 

991
01:06:34,698 --> 01:06:37,238
 Stop telling lies like that! 

992
01:06:37,238 --> 01:06:41,088
 If you act like this, I'll tell everyone she's Do Ra. 

993
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:43,768
 Kim Ji Yeong is Park Do Ra! 

994
01:06:43,768 --> 01:06:48,268
 I don't want to waver, but I feel bad for you again. 

995
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:52,038
 We should get married with blessings, but because of me... 

996
01:06:52,038 --> 01:06:57,098
 No matter what anyone says and what happens, we can never change our minds, okay? 

997
01:06:57,098 --> 01:07:01,338
 If I can't have her, Go Pil Sung can't, either.
