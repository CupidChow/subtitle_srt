1
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,196
Please let go! 
    

2
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,586
Let go of me, and we'll talk.

3
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,976
Mom, my ear is about to fall off.

4
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:58,346
Shut up! You need to lose your ear to get your act together.

5
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:02,216
Hey, Park Do Ra. It was you, wasn't it?

6
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:04,296
You told my mom, didn't you?

7
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:07,746
How could you do this to me? I even bought you ttoekbokki.

8
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:09,486
You're the one who broke the promise.

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,416
- Hey, Park Do Ra! 
 - Who said you could yell?

10
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,106
Come inside! Come inside!

11
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:15,786
Gosh, Mom!

12
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:18,216
You little bastard.

13
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,166
It really hurts, I said.

14
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,666
Let go, please. What's so bad about what I did?

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,236
- You little... 
 - What?

16
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:26,746
You did nothing wrong?

17
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,526
You lied to me, didn't study,

18
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:32,626
and fooled around with the older girl at the hair salon.

19
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,706
- And you say you did nothing wrong? 
 - You're the one who's at fault.

20
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,436
You're the one who's at fault.

21
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:38,706
You grabbed Jeong Mi by her hair and destroyed the hair salon.

22
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,066
What are you, a thug?

23
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,506
How could you behave so coarsely?

24
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:45,416
Is it a sin to be in love? Is it?

25
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,956
What? Love?

26
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,806
Did you say "love" just now?

27
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:55,606
You bastard. You're dead tonight. You little bastard.

28
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,546
Gosh, you bastard!

29
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:00,486
- What are you doing, Mom? Dad, Dad, Dad. 
 - Get over here!

30
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,506
- I'll kill you myself! 
 - S-Save me!

31
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:05,896
What's going on? Just talk to me. Talk to me.

32
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:12,306
Hyeon Cheol, hold on. So, is it true Dae Chung and Jeong Mi from the Sol Hair Salon

33
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:16,676
have been going on dates riding a motorcycle?

34
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:17,926
Gosh, seriously!

35
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:20,816
Hey, Go Dae Chung, you...

36
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:25,116
Have you been fooling around with that girl, Jeong Mi?

37
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:28,286
Mom, what does "fooling around" mean?

38
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:32,086
Mom, what are you talking about? What motorcycle and hair salon?

39
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:35,466
- Dae Chung, you— 
 - Wait, Honey.

40
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,456
It's not like that.

41
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:43,996
The older girl at the hair salon seduced our innocent Dae Chung and...

42
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:48,006
Anyway, that cunning thing took advantage of our innocent son.

43
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,446
Mom, that's not true.

44
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:52,416
Mom, Jeong Mi didn't seduce me.

45
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,586
I seduced her.

46
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:57,666
She didn't want to date me because I'm young,

47
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,466
but I begged her to go on just one date with me.

48
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,976
So, don't badmouth her.

49
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,306
She's not a cunning thing, I said.

50
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,586
Gosh, you little...

51
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:11,336
Go Dae Chung, she's 26 years old.

52
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:14,486
She's eight years older than you. But you're saying you seduced her first?

53
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,586
You're a high school student. Are you crazy?

54
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:18,526
- Why does the age gap matter in love? 
 - Oh, my.

55
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:22,146
Is there a rule that a high school student can't love someone older?

56
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,936
It's not illegal. So what if she's 10 years older,

57
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,536
20 years older, or 100 years older?

58
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:30,336
- You're crazy. You're crazy. He's out of his mind. 
 - He's crazy.

59
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,726
- You, go inside. Go inside. 
 - Honey, hold him. Hold him.

60
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,946
- Go inside, you bastard. 
 - Dad, let go of me.

61
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:38,936
I need to go see Jeong Mi right now. She's in shock because of Mom.

62
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,496
- Stop the nonsense and go in. 
 - I need to go see her now.

63
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:42,806
- Go inside, I said. 
 - Honey!

64
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,296
- Let go of me. Let go. 
 - What the heck are you going around doing?

65
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:48,626
Yes, you're crazy. Who do you take after, anyway?

66
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:54,556
You can't stop the love between Jeong Mi and me, no matter how you try to stop me!

67
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:59,276
Wow, Dae Chung is so daebak.

68
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,766
He's totally...

69
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,076
 Obnoxious. Obnoxious. Totally obnoxious. 

70
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:08,636
 I didn't know Dae Chung was that obnoxious. 

71
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:12,186
 I can't believe I had a crush on someone so obnoxious. 

72
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,976
 Open the door! 

73
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,646
 Open the door, I said. 

74
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,976
 What's wrong with all of you? 

75
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:22,026
 - Mom! Dad!  
 - Quiet!

76
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:26,256
You're a high school student, and you've been dating an older woman instead of studying.

77
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,886
How dare you cause a scene right now? How dare you?

78
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:31,126
Gosh, my head.

79
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,986
Unni, drink some iced water.

80
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:37,986
Yes, drink some water and calm down.

81
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,216
I still can't calm myself down.

82
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:49,536
That older girl did this, trying to kiss Dae Chung.

83
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,796
My blood pressure goes up just thinking about it.

84
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:55,926
Really? Jeong Mi must be out of her mind.

85
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,356
Don't call her "Unni."

86
00:04:57,356 --> 00:05:01,956
What kind of crazy bitch does that to a high school student?

87
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,646
 Don't speak badly of Jeong Mi, I said! 

88
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:08,186
 She's not a crazy bitch! 

89
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:11,066
How could he lose his mind like that?

90
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,516
That young thing is crazy about a woman. Gosh.

91
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:17,426
Gosh, how embarrassing. So embarrassing.

92
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:20,916
Where did he get the motorcycle? Did he borrow it from someone?

93
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:26,856
He's been taking money, saying he's going to the academy and buying workbooks

94
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:29,366
and he bought a used motorcycle with it.

95
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:34,116
He's been riding that dangerous thing while deceiving us completely.

96
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:37,466
What if he got into an accident?

97
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,196
Gosh, my heart is palpitating.

98
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:43,986
Unni, I told you that he might be stealing.

99
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:49,416
Aigoo, aigoo. You've been coddling your son, saying, "My Dae Chung. My Dae Chung."

100
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,976
He stabbed you in the back, I suppose.

101
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:58,286
You totally ignored me when I asked for a dental implant.

102
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:01,256
Gosh, Mom. Why would you...

103
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,166
 Open the door, I said. 

104
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,246
 I-I need to pee. 

105
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:10,326
Pee in the plastic bottle or do whatever.

106
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:14,066
You don't even have the right to pee! You know that?

107
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:23,100


108
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,906
   

109
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,316
 The call is not going through. You'll be... 

110
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:36,676
Why isn't she answering? Why?

111
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:43,796
Something must've happened to Jeong Mi.

112
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,136
Mom.

113
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:00,016
Dad.

114
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:03,876
If you just open the door,

115
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:06,486
I promise I'll study hard from now on.

116
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:09,576
I'll study hard, go to a good university,

117
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,376
and I'll do my duty as a good son later.

118
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:15,326
So, Mom and Dad, please...

119
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:19,016
Please open the door. Please.

120
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,466
 What? Be a good son? 

121
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,666
 Are you kidding me right now? 

122
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,046
 You lied about going to the academy and buying workbooks and took the money. 

123
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,196
 Be a good son, my foot. 

124
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:34,836
Open the door, I said!

125
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,556
   

126
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,336
 Dae Chung, 

127
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,396
 thank you so much for everything. 

128
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:53,036
 I was happy. 

129
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,256
 I won't forget it. 

130
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,206
 Bye. 

131
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:01,796
Bye....

132
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,836
Bye? What is she saying?

133
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:14,366
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

134
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:17,126
Why... Why aren't you answering? Why?

135
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,926
Why? Why can't I call you? Why?

136
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:26,986
- Noona, please answer the phone! Please, Noona! 
  - The phone is turned off... 

137
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:33,856
Sounds like Jeong Mi isn't answering Dae Chung's calls.

138
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:37,126
He's totally flipping out right now.

139
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,926
Crazy bastard.

140
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:41,326
I should've taken his phone away.

141
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:45,236
But I guess that Jeong Mi is listening to me.

142
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:47,646
Since she's not answering his calls.

143
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:51,986
I said I wouldn't forgive her if she met him one more time.

144
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:56,666
By the way, how long will you lock him in? He also needs to go to school.

145
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,636
The school isn't important right now.

146
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:04,896
Ms. Park said she'll send her to the countryside where her parents live. So, not until then.

147
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:08,066
 I need to go see her right now! 

148
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:11,246
 I'll break the door down if you don't open it right now! 

149
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:14,886
Go ahead! Break it! Break it!

150
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,806
- My gosh. Hey! 
 - Hey.

151
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:24,956
- Dae Chung! Dae Chung! 
 - Dae Chung... Go Dae Chung!

152
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,206
Dae Chung!

153
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,596
Dae Chung!

154
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,096
Hey, where are you going, Dae Chung?

155
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,726
My gosh, I heard a loud noise.

156
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,596
Did something terrible happen?

157
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,066
I thought a bomb dropped.

158
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,676
Dae Chung broke the door and got out.

159
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:47,176
Gosh, I can't believe it.

160
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:51,476
He broke the door down to go see Jeong Mi?

161
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,396
That's what I said.

162
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:56,696
Young or old, men go crazy when they fall for women, they say.

163
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,136
How could he break the door like that? How?

164
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:02,166
He's no good already. Seriously.

165
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:07,466
Hi, is something going on at home today?

166
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:10,686
What's with Seon Yeong and Hyeon Cheol?

167
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:13,206
Did Dae Chung cause trouble?

168
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:14,776
In-law, the thing is...

169
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,696
Gosh, I can't believe it.

170
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:19,216
- Dae Chung, that bastard— 
 - Dae Chung...

171
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:23,246
has been fooling around with the noona at the hair salon.

172
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,236
Tell me where Jeong Mi went to. Please.

173
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:33,296
You must know since she's your niece.

174
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:38,196
Who knows what your mom would do to me if I told you?

175
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:41,726
You have eyes, right? Have a look at this, then.

176
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,006
Look at this place.

177
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:48,166
Your mom did all this, didn't she?

178
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,396
All the ladies in the neighborhood came around, and...

179
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:55,166
they pointed fingers and swore at Jeong Mi and me.

180
00:10:57,176 --> 00:11:01,016
I might have to close the salon because of you.

181
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:02,866
I'm about to go out of business.

182
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:07,296
So, don't ever look for Jeong Mi or come near here again.

183
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:10,996
My head. Hey, get lost now.

184
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:14,806
Get out. Get out. Get lost!

185
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:27,526
Are you sure the girl at the hair salon packed her things and left?

186
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:30,146
Yes, I just got a call from Ms. Park.

187
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:35,286
She went to the bus terminal with her and saw her leaving.

188
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:40,516
Jeong Mi even left her phone behind, saying she'd never talk to Dae Chung.

189
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,326
That's probably enough, then.

190
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,096
Won't things end naturally if they don't stay in touch or meet?

191
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:51,936
Talk to him gently without yelling when he comes back.

192
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,826
Pretend you don't know about this.

193
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,076
Okay, Dad.

194
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:02,086
Here comes Dae Chung.

195
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:05,496
Mom, get up. Come with me right now.

196
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:06,956
What are you doing?

197
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:10,416
Come with me, apologize to Ms. Park at Sol Hair Salon,

198
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,906
and tell her to bring Jeong Mi back. Now!

199
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:18,026
Hey, Go Dae Chung. What are you doing in front of your grandparents right now?

200
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:20,476
Jeong Mi disappeared because of Mom.

201
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:23,486
Because she flipped out at the hair salon.

202
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:28,302
So, apologize for what you did and tell her to bring Jeong Mi back.

203
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:30,906
I really can't live without her, okay?

204
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,896
I sincerely love her!

205
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,246
How dare you break us apart?

206
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,706
Why?

207
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,496
Yes, okay, okay.

208
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:43,166
Date her when you graduate high school and start university.

209
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,806
Why is the high school diploma so important?

210
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,506
Is it more important than love?

211
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:51,486
If you don't apologize to Ms. Park and bring Jeong Mi back,

212
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,026
I won't go to school and misbehave.

213
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:55,066
I'll do whatever I want!

214
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,846
Yes, yes. Go ahead and misbehave.

215
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,926
Do whatever you want.

216
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,796
What did you say? You'll misbehave?

217
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:06,376
What kind of son of a bitch are you?

218
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:09,006
How ungrateful are you when you were nothing but an abandoned baby!

219
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,956
- How dare you cause a scene right now? 
 - Mother!

220
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,906
- Mom. 
 - In-law.

221
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,946
- Mom. 
 - Abandoned baby?

222
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:20,006
Were you referring to me just now, Grandma?

223
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:23,286
Was I abandoned as a baby?

224
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:27,906
N-No, no. What are you talking about right now?

225
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,926
Am I not your child?

226
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:33,006
Did you find me somewhere?

227
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:35,296
No, no, I said.

228
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:37,366
Grandma said that by mistake.

229
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:41,736
Grandma, you said I was an abandoned baby just now.

230
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,166
Yes, that's right.

231
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:48,256
You should tell him now. So, he gets his act together.

232
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:51,646
Mother, why are you doing this?

233
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:54,956
I...

234
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,286
am not your son, am i?

235
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:05,266
I thought it was so strange that only I had curly hair.

236
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:07,866
That's what I thought...

237
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:11,836
Dae Chung, that's not true. I gave birth to you.

238
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:15,596
You're my son. My son.

239
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:21,096
Dae Chung! Dae Chung! Dae Chung!

240
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,626
- Dae Chung! 
 - Dae Chung!

241
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:23,956
Dae Chung!

242
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:27,126
Dae Chung! It's not like that!

243
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,776
Dae Chung.

244
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:38,636
- Dae Chung! 
 - Dae Chung!

245
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,826
Dae Chung!

246
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:42,536
 Dae Chung! 

247
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:46,086
Hey, Park Do Ra! Where are you going?

248
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:59,166
He must be very shocked.

249
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,466
What if something happens to him?

250
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,716
This is all my fault. My fault.

251
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:10,226
This wouldn't have happened if I didn't tell on him.

252
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,136
Where is he?

253
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,736
Come have a seat, Yeoju-daek.

254
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,236
What for?

255
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:27,966
Listen, come sit if I told you to. What do you mean, "why"?

256
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,866
Why do you talk back at me?

257
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:33,876
And why don't you call me "Ms. Hong"?

258
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:39,136
I'm still not used to it.

259
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,896
What did you want to tell me, Ms. Hong?

260
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,556
This is a seafood shop I know well.

261
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,676
Get seafood from them from now on.

262
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:53,476
There's a place we've been working with for a long time.

263
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:58,296
Just do as I say. I'm the head of this family now.

264
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:04,596
And report to me when you create a weekly meal plan from now on.

265
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,026
Why won't you answer me?

266
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:08,756
Okay, I will.

267
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:10,276
I'm going to the gym, ahjumma.

268
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,566
Yes, Ms. Jang.

269
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,946
What is it? Do you need to tell me something?

270
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:22,096
Well, I was told to switch to this seafood shop from now on.

271
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,616
I thought you should know.

272
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:32,066
I see. Okay. Go ahead and rest.

273
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,536
What's this now?

274
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:42,316
I know you've been having a hard time managing this big house.

275
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:45,336
My mom and I will be in charge of the housework from now on.

276
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:48,646
You should relax and just focus on Ma Ri's education.

277
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:50,456
Oh, also...

278
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:55,006
give me the living expenses bank book, too. I'll manage it.

279
00:16:56,606 --> 00:17:00,096
I appreciate the thought, but you don't have to.

280
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:04,736
I just want you to stay quiet instead of worrying about stuff like this.

281
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,376
What are you doing right now?

282
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:10,116
You tossed the business card I gave her in front of me?

283
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:13,096
Do you look down on me? I'm your mother-in-law.

284
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:16,386
No matter how much you try to deny, I'm your mother-in-law.

285
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:19,146
And what did you say? Stay quiet?

286
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,746
What does that mean?

287
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:25,166
Are you telling me to live in hiding like an unwanted in-law or a mouse?

288
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:28,616
Why do you talk so aggressively?

289
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:31,906
When did I tell you to live in hiding like a mouse?

290
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:34,326
What else did you mean, then?

291
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:37,466
You look down on me and act superior,

292
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,286
but I gave birth to a son when you couldn't.

293
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:43,696
I gave birth to a son who'll continue the bloodline.

294
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:48,696
Continue the bloodline? Who? We have our Ma Ri.

295
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:53,036
And what era are you from? You think only sons continue the bloodline?

296
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:56,356
You'll get criticized if you say that in public nowadays.

297
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,446
I don't want to have this talk with you. I'm leaving.

298
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,316
Hey! How dare you talk casually to me?

299
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,816
I'm your mother-in-law!

300
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:11,066
Gosh, yes. I've been talking to you as a friend until now.

301
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:14,426
You're my mother-in-law, but a friend, too.

302
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:19,186
Mother, I'll go to the gym now, then.

303
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:25,476
I hate her. I hate her.

304
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,766
That bitch.

305
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:38,396
Jin Taek oppa, I mean, Chairman Gong, let's talk.

306
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:43,036
So what if I move into the main house?

307
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,856
No one treats me like a human.

308
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:49,586
I told you and Soo Yeon to call me "Mother,"

309
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,336
but it wasn't because I really wanted to hear it.

310
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,716
I just wanted to be treated with basic manners.

311
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,386
But Soo Yeon, that girl, still treats me like dirt.

312
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:01,146
I can't stand to live like this anymore.

313
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:04,686
Just give me the Angel Investment Company instead.

314
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,396
If you do, I'll move out of this house tomorrow if you want.

315
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,736
- What did you say? 
 - You'll give Angel to my Jin Dan anyway.

316
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,266
Chairman told you to do that.

317
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,856
I'll run it and give it to Jin Dan later.

318
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:23,866
So, put it under our names.

319
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:27,846
What nonsense. I can't do that yet. Leave.

320
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:29,676
Why is it nonsense?

321
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:32,446
You think I'll ruin the business or something?

322
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,356
It's my Jin Dan's.

323
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:44,186
Is he trying to keep it for himself instead?

324
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:46,156
Who says?

325
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:59,296
Seon Yeong, it's me. What are you up to?

326
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,236
I'm out on a walk. Do you want to join me?

327
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:04,486
Let's run by Han River like we used to.

328
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,756
Seon Yeong, what's wrong with your voice?

329
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,676
Are you crying right now?

330
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:15,026
 Soo Yeon, our Dae Chung disappeared. 

331
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:18,556
 He ended up finding out everything. 

332
00:20:18,556 --> 00:20:20,136
What?

333
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,066
He found out everything?

334
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,616
Yeah, yeah.

335
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:41,096
Hey.

336
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,496
Soo Yeon.

337
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,116
Oppa!

338
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:59,216
Dae Chung Oppa!

339
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:16,736
Oppa.

340
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:23,986
Oppa, why are you standing there?

341
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,976
It's dangerous.

342
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,316
I'm sorry, Oppa. It's my fault.

343
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:35,806
So, please don't die.

344
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:38,726
Oppa, where are you going?

345
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:42,086
Your mom is worried sick looking for you.

346
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:45,566
You can't do this to Ahjumma.

347
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,226
Dae Chung!

348
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:50,856
Dae Chung!

349
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,546
Oppa!

350
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,736
Dae Chung! Dae Chung!

351
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,636
- He went that way. That way. 
 - Okay.

352
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,826
Dae Chung!

353
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,176
Dae Chung! My gosh!

354
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:09,048
Dae Chung! My son!

355
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:10,891
Dae Chung, are you okay?

356
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,163
Gosh, you're bleeding.

357
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:17,698
You're bleeding. What do we do? What do we do?

358
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:20,448
Let's go to the hospital, Dae Chung.

359
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,551
Mom.

360
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,981
Yes.

361
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,821
Yes, my son.

362
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,041
My son.

363
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,661
Mom.

364
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:36,244
If I'm not your son,

365
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:38,734
who am I?

366
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,521
Where did I come from?

367
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:46,531
Dae Chung, what are you talking about?

368
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,081
You're my son.

369
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,501
You're Dad's son.

370
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:58,861
You come from... my heart. Right here.

371
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:01,751
Mom.

372
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:08,431
I'd be lost without you.

373
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,381
I can't live without you.

374
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,691
Can you live without me?

375
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,231
No.

376
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:21,111
I can't live without you, Mom.

377
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:23,931
Dae Chung.

378
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:31,071
Dae Chung.

379
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:42,591
I can't live without you.

380
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,071
Dae Chung.

381
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:59,121
 Oppa broke up with Jeong Mi because of me 

382
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:02,981
 and he found out he was adopted because of that, too. 

383
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:05,011
 It's my fault. 

384
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:07,731
My goodness.

385
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:10,511
Dae Chung was an abandoned baby?

386
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:14,051
That's why he was the only one with curly hair.

387
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:17,581
But his parents are so impressive.

388
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,581
I never would've thought he was adopted.

389
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:23,501
How could they raise him like their biological son?

390
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:28,791
The landlord's family actually seem like very nice people.

391
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:33,851
By the way, I'm your son, right, Mom?

392
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:37,181
Did you think you were my biological son?

393
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:38,281
What?

394
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:40,181
What about me, Mom?

395
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:43,521
Do Jun is my son, of course.

396
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:45,351
Mom, how could you do this?

397
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:49,411
Sorry. Sorry. That's why you should study hard and behave.

398
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:53,041
Gosh, sweethearts. Sweethearts. Sweethearts.

399
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:07,951
Soo Yeon, what are you still doing here?

400
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:10,921
I was worried. I wanted to see you before I go.

401
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,141
Is Dae Chung feeling okay?

402
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:20,801
Yes, he fell asleep just now.

403
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:26,981
What did he say?

404
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:30,261
He must be very shocked, right?

405
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:33,761
He just...

406
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:35,941
keeps crying.

407
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,881
He says he can't help but keep crying.

408
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,431
It breaks my heart.

409
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,091
Our Dae Chung...

410
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,281
was found here...

411
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,831
wrapped in a blanket 18 years ago.

412
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:13,851
I came out as if I was in a trance because I heard a baby crying.

413
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:18,011
But he stopped crying when I held him.

414
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:24,361
He was so sweet and lovely.

415
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:28,091
It felt like a gift from the heavens.

416
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:34,491
From that point on,

417
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:38,721
I never doubted he wasn't my son.

418
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:44,241
I just raised him, thinking of him as my son.

419
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:50,731
Even if...

420
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:54,371
everyone in the world found out,

421
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:58,281
I didn't want Dae Chung to know this.

422
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,961
What do I do with him now?

423
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:11,371
He'll be okay, right?

424
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,251
Of course.

425
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,921
He'll be okay.

426
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:26,001
He'll be okay.

427
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,621
He'll be okay.

428
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:17,461
Dae Chung.

429
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,211
- Hey. 
 - Why aren't you sleeping?

430
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:30,371
Mom.

431
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:32,001
Dad.

432
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,581
Yes.

433
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,531
Yes, go ahead.

434
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:45,321
Who are my biological parents?

435
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:50,991
I still want to know who I am.

436
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:55,941
Dae Chung, how many times did I tell you?

437
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:59,171
You're our son.

438
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:04,211
We're in front of you. Why do you keep saying such nonsense?

439
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:07,691
Honey, hold on. Hold on.

440
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,591
Yes.

441
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,431
Of course, you're curious.

442
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:16,441
I'm sure you are.

443
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:21,401
Dae Chung.

444
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:33,821
Mom and Dad don't know much about your biological parents, either.

445
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,950
One night 18 years ago,

446
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:43,881
we heard a baby crying.

447
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:46,521
Mom went outside and...

448
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:52,001
found you in a basket.

449
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:56,351
With a note with your birthday written.

450
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,961
Is that everything?

451
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,551
Yes.

452
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:08,141
It is.

453
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,711
Dae Chung,

454
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,374
from the moment we saw you,

455
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:20,604
we thought of you as our son all this time.

456
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:23,444
We never thought of you as an abandoned baby

457
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:27,144
or someone else's child, even for a moment.

458
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:33,284
We gave birth to you that day.

459
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:36,694
You're our son. No matter what anyone says,

460
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:40,714
you're your mom's and my son.

461
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:44,254
That will never change.

462
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:02,534
Mom, Dad...

463
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:09,534
thank you so much for raising me all this time.

464
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,614
Dae Chung.

465
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,434
- Dae Chung. 
 - Dae Chung.

466
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:06,974
Seon Yeong.

467
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,314
I'm sorry.

468
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:16,144
I should've watched my silly mouth.

469
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:19,424
By the way, Seon Yeong,

470
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:23,184
didn't he have to learn at some point?

471
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:25,904
There are no secrets in this world.

472
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:37,394
Are you crazy, Mom? Come out. Come out.

473
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:41,884
 Honey, he's gone! Dae Chung is gone! 

474
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:44,804
What? W-What did you say?

475
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:52,054
- Honey! W-Where did our Dae Chung go? 
 - Not sure...

476
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,744
He was sleeping until just now. What happened?

477
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:58,084
Hey, hey, you can just call him.

478
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,324
Call him right now.

479
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,124
 Hey, Mom. 

480
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:13,314
Dae Chung, where did you go off to?

481
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,924
Where are you right now?

482
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:19,624
 Mom, I stepped out to get some fresh air. 

483
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,954
 Don't worry. I'll be back soon. 

484
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:28,204
Okay. I won't worry, then, okay?

485
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:31,144
Just get some fresh air and come back.

486
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:38,034
- Gosh, I won't last at this rate... 
 - Honey...

487
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:42,194
I got scared because I thought he had run away again.

488
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,974
Mom, please.

489
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:50,564
You said you wanted to ask me something?

490
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:53,304
Yes.

491
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:56,464
Okay.

492
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,064
Go ahead and ask me.

493
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,344
Ahjumma,

494
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:05,994
you're my mom's best friend.

495
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:09,064
You keep no secrets and know everything about each other.

496
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,664
That's true.

497
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:17,724
You must know I was adopted, too, then.

498
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,174
That I'm not Mom's biological son.

499
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:22,524
What?

500
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:26,044
Yes.

501
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:33,484
I found out yesterday.

502
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:36,744
Oh, I see.

503
00:34:37,854 --> 00:34:40,144
You must've been very shocked.

504
00:34:41,674 --> 00:34:46,374
So... I don't mean anything else.

505
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:51,174
I just wanted to know what kind of person I am and where I come from.

506
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:56,004
My parents said they don't know anything but my birthday.

507
00:34:56,004 --> 00:35:02,024
I was wondering if Mom told you something she couldn't tell me.

508
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:07,064
If you know anything, please tell me.

509
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,784
I'll keep it a secret from Mom.

510
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:20,784
Dae Chung,

511
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:24,104
I'm sorry.

512
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:26,534
I don't know anything, either.

513
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,734
I haven't heard anything.

514
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:33,994
Are you sure?

515
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:36,364
You really don't know anything?

516
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:40,014
No. Only your birthday was written and

517
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,654
there was nothing else there.

518
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,964
That's what I heard.

519
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,404
I see.

520
00:35:55,534 --> 00:36:00,934
The person who gave birth to me must be a really bad person.

521
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:07,614
She didn't leave me anything, so I can't visit her when I grow up.

522
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:11,834
Because she never wanted to see me again,

523
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:15,994
she abandoned me without leaving any trace.

524
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,294
I won't look for my biological parents again.

525
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:32,844
I'm so sorry for suddenly... asking you stuff like this.

526
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:35,514
I'm so sorry.

527
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,664
I'll get going now.

528
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:09,814
 My gosh. 

529
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,714
 A baby? 

530
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,554
 My goodness. 

531
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:19,774
 My gosh. 

532
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,534
I'm sorry.

533
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,044
I'm so sorry.

534
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:05,664
Dae Chung.

535
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:11,434
Why are you standing here in this cold?

536
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,824
Grandpa.

537
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,334
It's okay. It's okay.

538
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:24,594
Let's go inside now.

539
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:32,354
Mom made bulgogi, your favorite, earlier. Let's go in. Let's go.

540
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,862
I almost ran into him.

541
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,712
Is he gone now?

542
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:24,372
Hey, Park Do Ra.

543
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:31,032
You're looking for me, aren't you?

544
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:35,972
- No, the thing is— 
 - Will you keep hiding whenever you see me?

545
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:38,552
You run away whenever you see me in the morning

546
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:43,012
and you go back inside the house and don't come out when I'm in the yard.

547
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:45,102
Why are you doing this?

548
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:47,212
Why are you avoiding me?

549
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:53,542
I feel guilty toward you for many reasons and...

550
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,492
I'm too ashamed to face you.

551
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,042
Park Do Ra.

552
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,992
Follow me.

553
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,982
Where's he going?

554
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:14,512
By chance...

555
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:20,472
Will he tie me upside down on a tree and beat me?

556
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,512
Help yourselves. Enjoy.

557
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:27,482
Thank you.

558
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:39,322
Eat. Why won't you eat?

559
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:48,122
I'm sorry... for acting so unruly, Oppa.

560
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,932
You broke up with Jeong Mi because of me

561
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,242
and because of me, you...

562
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:59,382
found out what you didn't have to.

563
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:03,862
That's why you felt hurt and cried.

564
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,542
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

565
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,012
Is that why you aren't eating tteokbokki?

566
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:14,702
Eat. I'm okay.

567
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:16,872
I'm actually grateful to you.

568
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:19,522
I'm buying you tteokbokki to thank you.

569
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:22,092
You're thankful?

570
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,192
Me?

571
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:29,152
I've been a bit of a troubled kid all this time.

572
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:33,762
I would've kept living like that if it wasn't for you.

573
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:36,532
Thanks to you, I learned who I am.

574
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:40,662
I've been looking back and reflecting on my actions, too.

575
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,932
That's why I'm thankful for you.

576
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,172
 What's he talking about right now? 

577
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,632
 Was he struck by lightening? 

578
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:52,442
By the way, I've been thinking for days and nights, but

579
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:55,262
I'm still my parents' son.

580
00:41:55,262 --> 00:42:01,732
To be honest, they couldn't have raised me with love if they had not considered me their son.

581
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:07,062
I disobeyed them, caused so much trouble,

582
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:10,292
and made them upset countless times.

583
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:18,762
I never doubted that they were my biological parents all this time.

584
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:21,742
Don't you find my parents so impressive?

585
00:42:23,572 --> 00:42:25,842
So, I made up my mind.

586
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:28,362
I'll study hard and be a good son.

587
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:32,902
- Wow. Seriously, Oppa? 
 - Yes.

588
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:35,072
Work hard on your acting and be a good daughter.

589
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:37,612
I'll study hard and become a great person.

590
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,992
Let's do our filial duty to our parents.

591
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:42,572
Okay. Let's, Oppa.

592
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:44,582
You'll eat tteokbokki now, right?

593
00:42:44,582 --> 00:42:46,592
Yes.

594
00:42:46,592 --> 00:42:48,762
Go ahead and eat. Eat a lot.

595
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,742
This is so tasty.

596
00:42:54,742 --> 00:42:56,482
Help yourself.

597
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:14,002
 No, this isn't a dream. 

598
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:17,912
 Dae Chung finally became mine. 

599
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:21,942
 The wall that's been between us is gone now. 

600
00:43:21,942 --> 00:43:24,762
 The sky seems to be blessing us today, too. 

601
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:30,602
 The sky is clear, the clouds are pretty, and the wind is gentle. 

602
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:33,852
 Our love is bubbling up indeed. 

603
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:53,702
- I'll take this. 
 - Okay.

604
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,512
Here you go.

605
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:04,202
Ms. Baek, this card isn't working.

606
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:08,302
Gosh. There's no way. Try one more time.

607
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:16,382
It's not working. I think it was suspended.

608
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:22,032
What do you mean? There must be an error.

609
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:29,462
It must've gotten suspended because she didn't pay.

610
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:34,152
 Hello? Hello? 

611
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:40,992
Hello?

612
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:46,092
Is no one home?

613
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:15,322
Wow, this family is more well-off than I thought.

614
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:18,112
They have meat and croaker...

615
00:45:19,462 --> 00:45:23,002
My kids like croaker.

616
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:18,992
Ms. Baek.

617
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:22,552
What are you doing here, Ms. Baek?

618
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:24,092
Pardon?

619
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:27,722
What's all this? Huh?

620
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:31,092
There's fruit, croaker, meat, and rice.

621
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:33,602
There's fruit, croaker, meat, and rice.

622
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:37,212
Ms. Baek, did you steal from our house just now?

623
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,612
No, no, it's not that.

624
00:46:39,612 --> 00:46:42,302
I ran out of rice. So I came to borrow some, but—

625
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:43,612
- Rice? What rice? 
 - No one...

626
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:45,562
This isn't just rice.

627
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:47,452
There's meat, fruit, and croaker...

628
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:51,082
Ms. Baek, what are you, a thief?

629
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:52,462
What's wrong, Mother?

630
00:46:52,462 --> 00:46:57,102
I'm sorry. I-I ran out of rice at home, so I—

631
00:46:57,102 --> 00:47:01,292
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong, this woman just...

632
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:04,912
Look at this. Fruit, croaker, meat, and rice.

633
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:08,242
She got caught trying to steal all this.

634
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,292
Seon Yeong, we let a thief in. A thief.

635
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:16,692
Hold on. How much have you been stealing from our fridge all this time?

636
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:18,992
No, no...

637
00:47:18,992 --> 00:47:20,702
- What? What? What? 
 - In-law.

638
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:22,682
That's not true.

639
00:47:25,182 --> 00:47:31,172
Do Ra's mom said she'll borrow rice, so I told her to take meat and stuff.

640
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:34,132
Dad, is that true?

641
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:36,102
A-Are you sure?

642
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:38,632
This isn't that much, In-law.

643
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:42,242
Not only that, it's food.

644
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:45,812
Take this with you, Ms. Baek. The kids must be hungry.

645
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:51,662
N-No, I'm sorry...

646
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:24,322
Goodness. What's wrong with In-law, exactly?

647
00:48:24,322 --> 00:48:27,502
She was definitely stealing, but he defended her.

648
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:29,082
How could he do this to me?

649
00:48:29,082 --> 00:48:32,822
He's treating me like a heartless person.

650
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:36,282
Ms. Baek said it's not like that, Mother.

651
00:48:36,282 --> 00:48:39,012
What else was it, then? Seriously...

652
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:40,932
Gosh, this is lousy!

653
00:48:40,932 --> 00:48:45,122
How upsetting! I need to move out of this house.

654
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,832
- Seriously. I can't believe it. 
 - Gosh.

655
00:48:48,832 --> 00:48:51,442
What is all this?

656
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,162
How could you do that, Mom?

657
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,592
How could you steal from someone else's house?

658
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:03,742
That's stealing!

659
00:49:03,742 --> 00:49:06,162
No, I just went to borrow some rice.

660
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:08,152
Didn't you hear what the grandfather said?

661
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:11,002
He just told me to take it.

662
00:49:11,002 --> 00:49:14,362
He defended us out of pity. That's why.

663
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:17,002
You think I wouldn't know that?

664
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:20,162
Did I tell you I wanted to eat meat?

665
00:49:20,162 --> 00:49:22,082
Did I tell you I wanted to eat fish?

666
00:49:22,082 --> 00:49:24,402
I'd rather starve to death.

667
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:26,722
I want to die because you embarrass me!

668
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:29,552
I said it's not like that, didn't I?

669
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:32,022
Why won't you believe me? Why?

670
00:49:32,642 --> 00:49:35,892
Do you think I want to live like this?

671
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:43,202
Do you think I want to live like this, I asked!

672
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:54,162
Why do you keep following me?

673
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,852
I wasn't following you.

674
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:59,242
I was going this way, too.

675
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:07,612
You really are following me right now.

676
00:50:07,612 --> 00:50:09,752
I said I'm not.

677
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:15,462
Do Ra, if you run to the tree over there faster than me,

678
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:19,152
I'll get you a teddy bear at the crane game machine at the intersection.

679
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:24,612
You mean it, right?

680
00:50:24,612 --> 00:50:26,122
You can't be lying this time, okay?

681
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,692
Why would I lie?

682
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,252
I don't even know what a lie is.

683
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:35,572
Fine. Start now, then.

684
00:51:45,532 --> 00:51:48,912
 Do Ra, Do Sik, and Do Jun. 

685
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,812
 I'll make a lot of money... 

686
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:55,132
 and make sure to come back for you. 

687
00:51:55,132 --> 00:52:00,752
 So, study hard and be well. 

688
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:03,802
 Do Sik, take good care of Do Jun. 

689
00:52:03,802 --> 00:52:09,072
 Do Ra, take good care of Oppa and Do Jun. 

690
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:34,562
Ms. Baek.

691
00:52:35,582 --> 00:52:38,722
What are you doing here?

692
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,412
Go ahead and eat.

693
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:54,022
You were freezing outside. It'll warm you up.

694
00:53:00,022 --> 00:53:05,672
When Seon Yeong was 10, her mom died

695
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:08,802
and I raised her alone.

696
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:11,792
So, I might not understand everything,

697
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:15,652
but I understand how you feel a bit.

698
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,832
Life works out as you go on.

699
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:20,202
The kids will grow up in no time, too.

700
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:22,302
So...

701
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:27,282
Gosh, h-here. Here.

702
00:53:27,282 --> 00:53:28,732
Gosh, h-here. Here.

703
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:18,112
Hello.

704
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:25,322
Gosh, I wish I had a father like him, too.

705
00:54:25,322 --> 00:54:26,352
Pardon?

706
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:29,562
Dae Chung's grandfather over there.

707
00:54:29,562 --> 00:54:32,142
Yes, he's a good person.

708
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:33,882
He's not just kind.

709
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:36,592
He still loves his married and grown daughter so much.

710
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:39,792
He even bought her that house, too.

711
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:41,652
- He bought her the house? 
 - Yeah.

712
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:44,492
Wow, he sounds very capable.

713
00:54:44,492 --> 00:54:48,992
Of course. He must have savings from being a principal,

714
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:51,322
and he gets a pension regularly, too.

715
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,792
Where could all that money go?

716
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:58,042
 I'm most jealous of Dae Chung's mom. 

717
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:24,932
Sir, over here.

718
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:30,942
Ms. Baek, is everything okay?

719
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:33,642
What did you want to meet me here for...

720
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:38,442
I wanted to give this to you, but I felt awkward giving it to you at home.

721
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:40,362
What is it?

722
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:44,082
It's nothing. Go ahead and open it.

723
00:55:47,722 --> 00:55:49,702
This is a scarf.

724
00:55:49,702 --> 00:55:54,942
You really helped me out and did me a lot of favors, too.

725
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:57,552
I felt so thankful and guilty about it.

726
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:59,822
What do you mean by favors?

727
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:02,712
Ms. Baek, you don't have to do this.

728
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:08,492
No, sir. I wish I could give you a better gift, but I can't afford to.

729
00:56:08,492 --> 00:56:13,072
It's not that valuable since I knitted it myself.

730
00:56:13,072 --> 00:56:15,592
You mean you knitted this yourself?

731
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:17,412
Yes.

732
00:56:17,412 --> 00:56:19,142
Try it on, Sir.

733
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,082
Let me put it on you.

734
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:26,382
Come here. Come, come.

735
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,372
Wow, it suits you so well, Sir.

736
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:45,112
Whoa! Be sure to wear it whenever you exercise or go out.

737
00:56:45,112 --> 00:56:49,452
You'd catch a cold if your neck is bare.

738
00:56:49,452 --> 00:56:54,042
You knitted it yourself. It's so precious. I can't take this.

739
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:57,132
I don't know how to thank you.

740
00:56:57,132 --> 00:56:59,732
If so, would you...

741
00:56:59,732 --> 00:57:02,202
buy me a drink, Sir?

742
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:03,922
A drink?

743
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:14,372
Gosh, Ms. Baek.

744
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:17,512
You drank a lot. I think you'd better stop now.

745
00:57:17,512 --> 00:57:22,662
Sir, I'm not drunk at all. I'm fine.

746
00:57:22,662 --> 00:57:24,622
Let me drink just one more glass.

747
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:27,092
Just one more glass, then.

748
00:57:27,092 --> 00:57:28,932
Okay.

749
00:57:36,082 --> 00:57:40,662
They say even animals don't abandon their kids.

750
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:45,902
When you saw me running away, leaving my kids behind,

751
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:51,792
you must've thought I was less than an animal. Didn't you, Sir?

752
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:54,492
Ms. Baek.

753
00:57:55,592 --> 00:58:01,502
But, Sir, that's how bad it's been. It's been that bad.

754
00:58:01,502 --> 00:58:04,442
But you didn't get on the bus.

755
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:07,302
You didn't leave the kids behind.

756
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:13,672
Sir, would things really work out as I go on?

757
00:58:14,312 --> 00:58:16,942
Every day is such a struggle...

758
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:20,042
- and I don't want to wake up in the morning... 
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

759
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:22,142
Ms. Baek. Gosh.

760
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:31,342
How could I go on with those young kids?

761
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:38,142
I don't know how to go on in this harsh world. I really don't, Sir.

762
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:40,542
I don't think I could go on, Sir.

763
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,622
M-Ms. Baek.

764
00:58:42,622 --> 00:58:48,292
Sir, how can I go on? Sir...

765
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,522
Ms. Baek.

766
00:58:49,522 --> 00:58:51,732
Sir...

767
00:58:56,422 --> 00:59:01,142
He should be contacting me by now. Why doesn't he?

768
00:59:01,142 --> 00:59:05,562
Am I wrong? Am I mistaken?

769
00:59:14,572 --> 00:59:18,092
 Ms. Baek, we should talk briefly. 

770
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:21,312
Yes, of course, he did.

771
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:23,422
Of course, he did.

772
00:59:25,922 --> 00:59:27,512
Here.

773
00:59:28,382 --> 00:59:30,092
What's this, Sir?

774
00:59:30,092 --> 00:59:33,502
Get food for the kids. They're still growing. It's not that much.

775
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:35,122
Sir, Sir...

776
00:59:35,122 --> 00:59:36,432
Gosh, no.

777
00:59:36,432 --> 00:59:38,832
Don't do this. You can't do this, Sir.

778
00:59:38,832 --> 00:59:42,022
I'm giving you this for the kids.

779
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:44,282
It doesn't mean anything else. Don't feel pressured.

780
00:59:44,282 --> 00:59:45,822
Get them some meat.

781
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:49,132
No, no, don't do this, Sir.

782
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:53,762
Pay me back when you can afford to later. That should work.

783
00:59:56,362 --> 00:59:58,192
Thank you, Sir.

784
00:59:58,192 --> 01:00:00,992
I'll treat you to a meal instead, Sir.

785
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:03,952
Please don't say no. I won't take this if you do.

786
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:07,142
Okay, okay. Let's do that.

787
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:19,122
Hey, I heard you're a child actor.

788
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:23,212
I'm not quite there yet.

789
01:00:23,212 --> 01:00:26,342
I was an extra a few times.

790
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:28,662
Wow.

791
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:32,042
Anyway, that means you've been on TV a few times.

792
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,952
You're an actor, then.

793
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:35,922
You must've made money, too, then.

794
01:00:35,922 --> 01:00:41,112
Appearance fee... I don't know much about it. My mom gets the money.

795
01:00:41,112 --> 01:00:43,522
What do you mean, you don't know?

796
01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:45,642
You did get paid.

797
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:53,382
We need to relieve stress from studying by shouting at the karaoke.

798
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:56,782
Why don't you give us some pocket money?

799
01:00:57,352 --> 01:01:00,322
I don't have money.

800
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:01,492
Listen to you.

801
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:04,992
Why don't you have money if you make money?

802
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:06,712
You think that makes sense?

803
01:01:06,712 --> 01:01:11,172
And why don't you have money if you're an actor?

804
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,782
I really don't have any.

805
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:15,702
Shit.

806
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:18,552
You don't understand because we're asking too nicely.

807
01:01:18,552 --> 01:01:20,532
Hey!

808
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:25,132
We'll beat you 10 times per 100 won we find. Got it?

809
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:26,862
Get up.

810
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:30,882
Please don't. No, I really don't have any. Don't do it.

811
01:01:30,882 --> 01:01:32,442
Hey!

812
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:39,172
What's with you guys?

813
01:01:39,172 --> 01:01:43,092
What's this? Why is a high schooler getting involved?

814
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:46,682
Just keep going your way, Oppa.

815
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:49,752
Park Do Ra, come here.

816
01:01:49,752 --> 01:01:51,912
Oppa.

817
01:01:55,642 --> 01:02:00,652
I won't just sit back if you bother my sister again.

818
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:03,822
I'll let it slide today,

819
01:02:03,822 --> 01:02:07,162
but if I catch you again, you won't get away with it.

820
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:11,492
What are you, her manager or what?

821
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:13,402
You've got to be kidding me.

822
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:19,062
The manager oppa should give us money if you don't want to see your actress sister getting beaten.

823
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:21,472
Do Ra, let's go.

824
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:25,142
Hey! You can't just leave like that.

825
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:26,972
Give us pocket money, I said.

826
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:29,242
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it.

827
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:30,742
- Hey. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

828
01:02:30,742 --> 01:02:32,692
Hey, you little...

829
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:35,572
Stop it while I'm trying to be nice, okay?

830
01:02:35,572 --> 01:02:37,432
Hey, you little...

831
01:02:37,432 --> 01:02:39,642
Come here. Come here.

832
01:02:40,372 --> 01:02:42,792
You'd better stop right now.

833
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,622
Hey, hey, hey.

834
01:02:51,712 --> 01:02:57,032
Do Ra, did you get hurt anywhere else?

835
01:02:58,112 --> 01:03:00,402
I'm okay, Oppa.

836
01:03:01,182 --> 01:03:03,332
Oppa, look at you.

837
01:03:03,332 --> 01:03:05,682
Your curly hair got plucked...

838
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,682
and you lost your buttons, too.

839
01:03:07,682 --> 01:03:09,162
It's okay.

840
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:11,572
I have a lot of hair.

841
01:03:11,572 --> 01:03:15,592
And I usually never get beaten,

842
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:18,532
but a man can't hit a woman.

843
01:03:18,532 --> 01:03:20,712
I just let it slide.

844
01:03:21,262 --> 01:03:25,872
I think you're so cool, and you're just the best.

845
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:28,792
Come on...

846
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:35,182
Do Ra, just tell me if someone harasses you again, okay?

847
01:03:40,312 --> 01:03:43,082
What? What? What is it?

848
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:45,072
Why are you looking at me like that?

849
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,462
Well...

850
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:55,202
The thing is...

851
01:03:56,752 --> 01:03:59,442
I like you, Oppa.

852
01:03:59,442 --> 01:04:01,292
What?

853
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:04,682
What did you say? I can't hear you well.

854
01:04:04,682 --> 01:04:07,562
I like you, I said!

855
01:04:07,562 --> 01:04:09,142
What?

856
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:11,022
You like me, too, right?

857
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:12,712
That's why you gave me a bike ride and

858
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:16,122
saved me by throwing yourself and getting your hair yanked out.

859
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:17,822
Right?

860
01:04:20,072 --> 01:04:22,182
Of course, I like you.

861
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:24,222
You're like my little sister, you know.

862
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:26,342
That's not what I'm talking about.

863
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:29,322
I like you like how boyfriends and girlfriends do.

864
01:04:29,322 --> 01:04:30,972
What did you say?

865
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:35,522
Did something happen to your head after getting beaten by them?

866
01:04:35,522 --> 01:04:38,942
Hey. How dare you bring up boyfriends and girlfriends right now?

867
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,482
You're still a baby. Give me a break.

868
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:43,082
Let's go.

869
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,392
What?

870
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:55,092
Did he reject me just now?

871
01:04:56,382 --> 01:04:59,272
Has he not gotten over Jeong Mi yet?

872
01:05:00,402 --> 01:05:04,132
 Yes, they say, "Little strokes fell great oaks." 

873
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:06,212
 This is only my first stroke. 

874
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:10,362
 Just wait. I'll make sure you fall over. 

875
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:45,402
 Say goodbye to your phone for now. 

876
01:05:46,052 --> 01:05:49,322
 Watching illegal channels is strictly banned. 

877
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:52,852
 Watch your steps on the stairs. 

878
01:05:52,852 --> 01:05:54,942
 For the customers' safety... 

879
01:05:54,942 --> 01:05:57,642
Oh, I'm sorry.

880
01:05:57,642 --> 01:05:59,622
It's okay, Sir.

881
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,692
Your hand is very warm, by the way.

882
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,512
My hands tend to be warm.

883
01:06:06,102 --> 01:06:12,732
Sir, may I hold your hand for a bit since it's so warm?

884
01:06:12,732 --> 01:06:15,452
Oh, okay.

885
01:06:18,612 --> 01:06:21,132
Looks like the movie is about to start.

886
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:39,502
Sir, what did you think of the movie?

887
01:06:39,502 --> 01:06:41,822
- It was fun. 
 - Really?

888
01:06:41,822 --> 01:06:45,642
It's been so long since I watched a movie in a theater.

889
01:06:45,642 --> 01:06:47,732
Thank you so much for today.

890
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:49,212
Not at all.

891
01:06:49,212 --> 01:06:53,272
I wanted to do more than just treat you to a meal.

892
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:56,422
Thanks to you, I got to treat myself for once, too.

893
01:06:56,422 --> 01:07:01,572
I haven't been to a theater since my husband died.

894
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:04,062
You, too?

895
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:07,352
Yes. The kids are expecting food like hatchlings

896
01:07:07,352 --> 01:07:09,602
and it's too busy to just get by every day.

897
01:07:09,602 --> 01:07:13,442
How could I ever have time to enjoy a movie?

898
01:07:13,442 --> 01:07:14,972
I see.

899
01:07:14,972 --> 01:07:18,662
Sir, let's come back for a movie like we did today.

900
01:07:18,662 --> 01:07:21,282
I don't know about anything else, but I can treat you to movies sometimes.

901
01:07:21,282 --> 01:07:24,602
No, since you treated me today,

902
01:07:24,602 --> 01:07:27,862
I'll treat you next time around.

903
01:07:28,572 --> 01:07:30,742
- Gosh. 
 - What's wrong?

904
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:34,062
I wore heels since I was going out for a movie.

905
01:07:34,062 --> 01:07:35,882
Are you okay?

906
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:37,622
I don't think I sprained it, but...

907
01:07:37,622 --> 01:07:39,672
I'm sorry, Sir. Could you help me walk there?

908
01:07:39,672 --> 01:07:42,292
Oh, okay.

909
01:07:51,130 --> 01:08:00,120


910
01:08:06,522 --> 01:08:08,532
Hey, Baek Mi Ja.

911
01:08:11,182 --> 01:08:12,772
Geez...

912
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:14,772
How dare you take our money and take off?

913
01:08:14,772 --> 01:08:16,702
Did you think we wouldn't find you if you hid here?

914
01:08:16,702 --> 01:08:18,912
- Well, the thing is— 
 - Geez!

915
01:08:18,912 --> 01:08:20,322
You thief and scammer.

916
01:08:20,322 --> 01:08:26,392
How could you be doing perfectly fine after taking my precious money?

917
01:08:26,392 --> 01:08:29,232
Let's go. Hurry up and go.

918
01:08:29,232 --> 01:08:33,562
If you took someone else's money, you should pay with labor, serve time, or whatever.

919
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:36,462
No, I said I'll pay you back! I will—

920
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:38,172
How much is it?

921
01:08:38,172 --> 01:08:39,962
How much do you need in total?

922
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:42,462
What would you do if I told you?

923
01:08:42,462 --> 01:08:44,372
It's 30 million won.

924
01:08:44,372 --> 01:08:46,902
Would you pay on her behalf?

925
01:08:52,182 --> 01:09:01,912
    
 ♫  You showed up, made my heart flutter, and got me excited over and over again  ♫

926
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:05,562
♫  You keep finding me without fail  ♫

927
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:08,782
♫  So I can't think about anything else  ♫

928
01:09:08,782 --> 01:09:13,682
♫  I think this is what they call fate  ♫

929
01:09:21,142 --> 01:09:26,042
♫  The sky is clearer than usual, and my feet feel light  ♫

930
01:09:27,252 --> 01:09:30,112
 I told you. I like you, Oppa. 

931
01:09:30,112 --> 01:09:33,092
 I wanted to look like an adult for you because I like you. 

932
01:09:33,092 --> 01:09:35,692
 Because you only think of me as a little kid next door. 

933
01:09:35,692 --> 01:09:37,972
 Don't act like you know me from now on, Park Do Ra. 

934
01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:41,212
 I won't act like I know you, either. Got it? 

935
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:43,032
 Do you like it? 

936
01:09:43,032 --> 01:09:44,512
 Yes, I like it. 

937
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:47,122
 I thought you should know, Seon Yeong. 

938
01:09:47,122 --> 01:09:49,642
 Dae Chung's grandpa, the principal is... 

939
01:09:49,642 --> 01:09:53,332
 Are you trying to say I seduced him for money? 

940
01:09:53,332 --> 01:09:57,772
 Would you want to date a grandpa like that if you were me? Huh? 

941
01:09:57,772 --> 01:09:59,622
 Dad.
