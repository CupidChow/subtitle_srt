1
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,090
Seon Yeong! Seon Yeong!

2
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,310
   

3
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,510
Ae Gyo, please leave if you'll bring up Soo Yeon again.

4
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,690
I'm busy. I don't have time to chat with you.

5
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,840
Seon Yeong, the thing is... Have a look at this.

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,020
Do you remember this picture?

7
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,640
Gosh, Ae Gyo.

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,920
Why do you have my Pil Sung's photo?

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,240
Seon Yeong, is this really Pil Sung?

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,130
Yes.

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,900
Gosh, he was really pretty and cute then.

12
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,620
By the way, where did you get this photo?

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,090
Huh?

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,910
I was looking through my old photo album and saw this.

15
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,150
I guess I asked you for one because he was so cute as a baby.

16
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,610
My Baby Pil Sung was so cute, right?

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,040
Gosh, silly me.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,800
Seon Yeong, I forgot I have to meet someone.

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,350
You're busy, too, right? I'll go.

20
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,650
Oh, my, my. She barged in and acted like she'd say something important.

21
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,490
What's with her?

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,050
I mean...

23
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,390
why does that family frequent our house and restaurant so much?

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,670
I don't like them coming by. Tell them not to come, okay?

25
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,050
I didn't tell her to come.

26
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,180
Why would Ae Gyo just show up when no one wants to see her?

27
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,650
Yes, Soo Yeon could have a photo of Pil Sung.

28
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,100
She and Seon Yeong used to be so close.

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,620
But what's strange is that she was hiding in a secretive place.

30
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,620
She gave him a lot of contract money to hire him.

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,850
She risked her life to save him.

32
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,930
But Pil Sung was an abandoned baby.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,640
My gosh, is Pil Sung Soo Yeon's son, then? Gosh...

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,880
My gosh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,780
But still. She wouldn't have abandoned him at a friend's house.

36
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,910
Yes, she might be annoying, but not that crazy.

37
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,000
Gosh, what am I thinking?

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,550
No way, no way, no way.

39
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,770
Excuse me, Noonim. President Baek.

40
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,570
You should've told us first if you got out of jail.

41
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,120
You should've paid our 500 million back first.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,690
Did you think we wouldn't know if you were hiding like a mouse?

43
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,840
Don't do this. Spare me, please.

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,320
I went to jail after my daughter died.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm basically a beggar. I don't have money to give you.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
But you say 500 million?

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
500 million?

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
I don't have a single penny. Please believe me.

49
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,750
I don't want to hear your excuses.

50
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,140
I'll be generous and give you until tomorrow. Bring me 500 million won.

51
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,220
You'd better not run away like a mouse again.

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,200
You'd better not die somewhere after taking my money.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,170
If that happens, your two sons, Park Do Shik and Park Do Joon, won't be safe.

54
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,230
Keep that in mind, got it?

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,210
What?

56
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,309
My... sons?

57
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:26,769
Hey! You crazy bastard. You scoundrel!

58
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,799
You'd better not touch my Do Sik and Do Jun.

59
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,019
You'd better not even lay a finger on them!

60
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:33,649
I won't forgive you.

61
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:39,219
I'll follow you to hell and rip you apart, you asshole!

62
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:42,759
You bastards! Bastards!

63
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,909
Bastard!

64
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,089
You have until tomorrow.

65
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,759
Until tomorrow, I said.

66
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,289
What did you say? 500 million won?

67
00:04:55,749 --> 00:05:00,079
President Baek, do you think 500 million is a joke?

68
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,279
And what are you to me?

69
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,939
Why do you always ask me for money?

70
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,789
You think I'm a bank?

71
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,499
Am I holding your money or something?

72
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:13,119
And don't you feel guilty toward me?

73
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:16,019
Of course, I am! I really am! I'm sorry.

74
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,059
I know I'm shameless, but President Gong, think of the late Do Ra and help meâ€”

75
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,659
Do Ra, Do Ra, Do Ra! Seriously!

76
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,469
Stop talking about Park Do Ra!

77
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:29,349
I'm about to go crazy!

78
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,129
It's because I still think of you as my son-in-law.

79
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,209
You would've been my son-in-law if you had married Do Ra.

80
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,139
Marry, my foot.

81
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,679
She was the one who ruined it, too.

82
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:48,889
She left me behind and ran away at the wedding shop on the engagement day.

83
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,139
Why would you call me son-in-law after that?

84
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:57,689
If it weren't for Go Pil Sung, Do Ra would've married you.

85
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,309
This is all because of Go Pil Sung.

86
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:03,229
It's all his fault.

87
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,529
G-Go Pil Sung?

88
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,479
Why would you bring him up now?

89
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,369
To be honest,

90
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,089
when Do Ra was young, we used to live in his rental unit briefly.

91
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:25,259
Later, as the female lead and assistant director, they worked on "Straightforward Romance" together.

92
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,019
But because Go Pil Sung seduced my Do Ra,

93
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,389
she fell for him, and we ended up in this situation.

94
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,729
It's because Go Pil Sung tempted her.

95
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:44,939
If so, my engagement fell through because of Go Pil Sung?

96
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,409
- Is that right? 
 - I'm telling you.

97
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,749
If it wasn't for him, you would've been my son-in-law.

98
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:56,559
You know how much I liked you, too.

99
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,899
Gosh, damn it.

100
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,369
Why would you tell me that now?

101
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,889
What took you so long?

102
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:09,699
My Do Ra died. What's the point of saying that?

103
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,599
It'd be like crying over spilled milk.

104
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,589
Get out.

105
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,809
I'm sick of both you and the late Park Do Ra.

106
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,949
Get out of my face immediately.

107
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:32,099
   

108
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:41,129


109
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,509
What do I do? President Gong is acting like that, too.

110
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,769
Where do I get that much money?

111
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,699
It's not like I can just die somewhere.

112
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,979
What do I do with Do Shik and Do Joon? What do I do...

113
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,379
Go Pil Sung and Park Do Ra used to date?

114
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,599
That's why she called off our engagement.

115
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,119
   

116
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,759
I can't believe this. What's this, then?

117
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,539
Did Go Pil Sung also date Kim Ji Yeong because she resembles Park Do Ra, too?

118
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:30,239
Wow, did I lose my woman to Go Pil Sung twice?

119
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,859
How could this be?

120
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:37,819
The more I think, the angrier I get.

121
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:40,619
No. That's right.

122
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,839
They apparently broke up.

123
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,609
Yes, it's okay, Jin Dan.

124
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:49,039
Yes. Just let it go. Yes...

125
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,139
Just let it go. Let it go.

126
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,949
Shit.

127
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,429
That's not it.

128
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,599
They're at the office together every day.

129
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:08,739
And they're like that at home, too?

130
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,659
He likes that woman that much?

131
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,239
Why does he only look at her?

132
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:19,519
Why doesn't he ever look at me?

133
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,219
I want to ruin her face.

134
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,709
Would he look at me once, then?

135
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,369
Cut, okay! Nice.

136
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:44,399
We'll stop shooting for the day.

137
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,729
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

138
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,859
- Good work. 
 - You did great.

139
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,489
I'm so scared of you, Ji Yeong.

140
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,189
What will you do to my face?

141
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:57,349
I know. Why are you so good at acting?

142
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,149
Just hearing your voice gave me the chills.

143
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,149
Really? Thank you.

144
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,939
You're really good.

145
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:06,469
- Good work, Hyung. Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

146
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:08,499
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

147
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:11,609
Ji Yeong, good work.

148
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,319
Thank you.

149
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,599
Gosh, why are you crying, Grandma?

150
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:31,289
Why are you being so mean?

151
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,939
Why would you want someone else's man

152
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:37,779
and say you'd ruin her face?

153
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,919
That's not how I raised you.

154
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,999
Grandma, I was just acting. Acting.

155
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,099
It's not for real.

156
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,739
Gosh, Director.

157
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:52,069
- Director. 
 - Yes, Grandma.

158
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:57,129
Why do you make Ji Yeong do something so bad?

159
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,729
Why would you turn her into an awful woman?

160
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,559
Grandma.

161
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,399
Grandma, she was just acting.

162
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,069
She was acting a character in a drama.

163
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,649
I don't think it was acting.

164
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,869
I think she became an awful woman.

165
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:21,019
Wow, she got you absorbed. Ji Yeong must've given a great performance.

166
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,969
Grandma, I think our drama will become a huge hit.

167
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,689
But still.

168
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:29,719
She was rolling her eyes around like this.

169
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:32,229
Why would she seduce a man who's taken?

170
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:34,459
That's not a human thing to do.

171
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:40,469
Director, I'm against Ji Yeong doing that. I'm totally against it.

172
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,089
- Let's go. Let's go now. 
 - Grandma.

173
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,569
Grandma. Grandma, it would be terrible if Ji Yeong didn't play this role.

174
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,769
What would make you feel better?

175
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,979
Buy me jjajangmyeon, then.

176
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:56,619
What?

177
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,139
Grandma, is the jjajangmyeon to your liking?

178
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,159
It's really delicious.

179
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,459
It's even more so since you bought it for me.

180
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,649
Ma'am, do you feel a bit better, then?

181
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:21,479
I'm totally fine.

182
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:24,749
I think it was because

183
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:30,509
she acted so well, as you said.

184
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,209
Wow! I'm so happy because I think our drama will be a hit.

185
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:38,459
Grandma, I'll buy you dessert, too. What would you like?

186
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:43,609
I don't need dessert, but there's a place I want to go to.

187
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,369
- What? 
 - Where?

188
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,229
Namsan.

189
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:54,859
Ok Ja said you need to go to Namsan when you're in Seoul.

190
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,169
- Namsan? 
 - Yes.

191
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,639
G-Grandma, do you have to go there?

192
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,079
Yes.

193
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,699
How nice.

194
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,099
Look at all this.

195
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:16,019
- Grandma. 
 - It's so nice.

196
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,059
Grandma, let's go that way. Not this way.

197
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,039
No, I like it here.

198
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,929
This is nice.

199
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,999
Aigoo.

200
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:39,509
Why are there so many locks?

201
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,219
Oh, my. Aigoo.

202
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:45,219
Gosh, how pretty.

203
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,309
"Kevin heart Jenny."

204
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:50,909
Wow...

205
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,609
Foreigners did this here, too.

206
00:13:55,609 --> 00:14:01,089
Aigoo. I never got to do stuff like this in my life.

207
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,639
I have no idea what I did in my life.

208
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,829
My life seems so futile.

209
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:13,389
Should I find myself an old man now or something?

210
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,129
Grandma.

211
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,939
No, no. I was kidding. Just kidding.

212
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:27,149
I'm okay. Why don't you and the Director put one of these here?

213
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,199
Gosh, seriously.

214
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,989
Grandma...

215
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:34,399
Why would we do something so cheesy like this?

216
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:37,799
What do you mean, cheesy?

217
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:43,589
You have to do fun things like this with someone you like. That's life.

218
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,909
They call you a country bumpkin because you say stuff like that.

219
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:49,189
I'm fine.

220
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,989
I don't want to do stuff like this even if they called me a country bumpkin.

221
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,849
And this is...

222
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,719
for people who like each other.

223
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:04,759
You and the Director like each other.

224
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,169
Grandma, why do you keep saying that?

225
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:10,049
I said I don't.

226
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:16,499
Hold on. This says, "Ji Yeong heart Pil Sung."

227
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:21,919
Isn't your name Pil Sung, Director?

228
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,629
Ji Yeong, when did you do this?

229
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,679
Have you been lying to me?

230
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,519
No, this isn't me.

231
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,899
What are you doing? Aigoo.

232
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,929
Why did you find this thing?

233
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,549
You should've pretended you didn't see it.

234
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,329
Ji Yeong, Ji Yeong!

235
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,779
Gosh, what are you doing?

236
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,469
Go ahead and follow her.

237
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:56,119
Please wait here for a moment, Grandma.

238
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,639
Okay.

239
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:05,639
Hold on, Ji Yeong.

240
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,379
Ji Yeong,

241
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,929
you still like me, too, right?

242
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:23,719
No. I no longer like you.

243
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,679
What do you mean, no?

244
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,069
I know you like me, too.

245
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,749
Why do you keep denying it, then?

246
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:36,939
I know it's hard and heartbreaking for you to push me away since you like me.

247
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:40,249
I don't want you to have a hard time like this.

248
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,699
Let's just do what we feel like.

249
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,639
Why do you keep doing this, Director?

250
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,859
I said I no longer like you.

251
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,709
Why did you cry, then?

252
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,579
It's because...

253
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,999
To be honest, I'm not so sure, either.

254
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,299
I feel so confused about everything.

255
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:26,509
When I see you, you don't seem like a bad person,

256
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:31,339
but according to my mom, you are.

257
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,479
I can't make a decision one way or another.

258
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,269
I think it's because I haven't gotten my memory back.

259
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:48,549
â™«  I was happy to have met you  â™«

260
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,089
I like you so much,

261
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:54,819
but I might get my memory back

262
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,369
and end up blaming you

263
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:02,679
and hating you.

264
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,619
I'm afraid I'd hurt again.

265
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:11,419
â™«  You became my light  â™«

266
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,959
Ji Yeong.

267
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,899
I'm okay with everything.

268
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,479
You can get your memory back and end up hating me and blaming me.

269
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,349
I'm okay with being hated,

270
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,439
but I can't stand to see you hurting.

271
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,979
So, Ji Yeong,

272
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,379
just go ahead and like me so you feel better.

273
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:43,769
And if I seem like a bad person after you get your memory back, just dump me, then.

274
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,099
Why don't you do that?

275
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:48,349
How could I do that?

276
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:49,669
You can do it.

277
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:56,399
â™«  You mean the world to me  â™«

278
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,329
So, Ji Yeong,

279
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,919
just follow your heart, okay?

280
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,929
â™«  You became my light  â™«

281
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,229
Gosh, Director, Ji Yeong!

282
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:22,389
My gosh.

283
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:25,589
Were you doing the you-know-what?

284
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,349
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:32,359
What's that "You-know-what"?

286
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,489
What do you mean what it is?

287
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:39,169
There's such a thing as you-know-what, okay?

288
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:53,419
Gosh, Director. I'll go inside now.

289
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:58,269
I'll let the young couple finish things up.

290
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,629
Seriously, w-w-what do you mean, "Finish things up"?

291
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:05,829
Gosh, Director.

292
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:11,039
This is how naive Ji Yeong is.

293
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,829
Ji Yeong,

294
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:17,899
kissing is the last step on a date.

295
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:20,719
- What? 
 - I'll go inside first.

296
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,689
- Gosh, Grandma! 
 - I'm going in!

297
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,569
Geez, she's so unbelievable.

298
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,829
Well, g-get home safely.

299
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:39,459
Thank you so much for today.

300
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,559
Ji Yeong.

301
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,119
Don't forget I'm always by your side.

302
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,779
Let me know whenever you need my help.

303
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:00,509
For example, when you crave tteokbokki, your favorite

304
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,949
or you want to go to a food cart.

305
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,709
This oppa will get you anything at any time.

306
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:19,089
Drive safely.

307
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,699
Get going now.

308
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,829
After I see you going in.

309
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:28,679
I can't leave before you do, Director.

310
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,639
Then, let's go at the same time. Go.

311
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,629
Ji Yeong.

312
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,059
What?

313
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,219
Are they back together again?

314
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,219
Park Do Ra left me for Go Pil Sung.

315
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:09,439
Did Kim Ji Yeong also dump me because of him?

316
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,719
Whoa, shit.

317
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,979
What am I supposed to do?

318
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,900
Mom, what's wrong? Are you sick?

319
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,370
You've looked sick since yesterday. Are you dizzy?

320
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,440
Well, Do Sik, if something happens outside, call me immediately.

321
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,980
And if someone asks you to go somewhere, you can't go with them.

322
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,860
Run away, no matter what, okay?

323
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,410
You think I'm a kindergartener?

324
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,030
Are you worried someone would kidnap me?

325
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,080
What's wrong? Is something going on?

326
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,350
- Huh? 
 - Hey, meanie!

327
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,450
Hey, hey, hey!

328
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,300
What are you doing with your husband, who's about to go to work?

329
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,650
It's nothing!

330
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,270
I'm just telling him to be careful at work.

331
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,070
You're so nosy about everything.

332
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,850
Do Sik, go to work now. Here.

333
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,820
- Close it all the way. 
 - Okay.

334
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,380
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

335
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,970
Yes, Geum Dong. Make a lot of money.

336
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,960
Okay, Mother.

337
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,140
Gosh, my baby. Aigoo.

338
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,190
Hey, you meanie.

339
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:49,090
Are you pouting because I told you to make 100 cabbages of kimchi?

340
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,190
Come on, Grandma.

341
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,310
I made 200 cabbages every year ever since I got married.

342
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,180
Your husband went to work at dawn.

343
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,480
But you're counting grains of rice like this?

344
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,740
Finish eating and start making kimchi!

345
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,850
- You littleâ€” 
 - Grandma!

346
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,830
I want to die already.

347
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,200
Why are you doing this to me? Seriously!

348
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,390
Ahjumma, is something going on?

349
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,880
 Baek Mi Ja! 

350
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,820
Wow, I'm so tired.

351
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,190
- What? 
 - Ahjumma, who are these people?

352
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,370
- What's this? 
 - You look relaxed.

353
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,020
Baek Mi Ja, why won't you answer your phone?

354
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,530
Why make me waste my precious time here?

355
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,870
What happened to the money? The money!

356
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,550
Spare me! Spare me!

357
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,740
Young man, give me some time.

358
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,620
How could I get that much money overnight?

359
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,370
Give me time. Five years. I mean, just one year.

360
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,380
I'll make money and pay you back, then. Please?

361
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,000
- How can you eat? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

362
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,070
Hey, you son of a bitch!

363
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,220
- Why would you kick the precious dining table? 
 - Grandma!

364
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,950
That's what the worst people do, you bastard.

365
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,930
Get out of the way.

366
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,720
Why are you doing this, anyway?

367
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,700
I'll call the police!

368
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,450
Ji Yeong, no, no, no!

369
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,130
Do Sik and Do Jun will die. No, no...

370
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,900
Gosh, how annoying!

371
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,740
Let's finish it up and leave. Take it out.

372
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,340
Look, put a stamp on this.

373
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,930
What's this? What is it?

374
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,120
It's a physical rights waiver form!

375
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,890
Sell an organ to pay back if you don't have money!

376
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,700
Spare me! Spare me, young man!

377
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,730
No, no. Spare me!

378
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,550
Let go!

379
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,690
   

380
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,310
Gosh, gosh, gosh!

381
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,300
Our deal went through just now.

382
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,260
I'll forget about it if you pay me back before you give up an organ.

383
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,650
You know what happens if you run away, right?

384
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,130
- Let's go. 
 - Gosh!

385
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,460
We're busy. Let's go.

386
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,860
Let's meet again, President Baek.

387
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,950
Hey! Hey!

388
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,370
My goodness...

389
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,030
Ahjumma, Ahjumma...

390
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,200
Ahjumma, what's all this?

391
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,120
Physical rights waiver?

392
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,440
Ji Yeong, it means they'd sell her liver, kidneys,

393
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,400
eyeballs and everything.

394
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
Let's call the police right now.

395
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,220
No, no, no! Ji Yeong, Ji Yeong!

396
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,190
They'll take Do Sik and Do Jun, then.

397
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,820
They'll follow us to our graves. You can't. You can't.

398
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,690
Ahjumma, how much money did you borrow, and how?

399
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,560
It's the money I borrowed when you were Do Ra.

400
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,400
Other debts were taken care of since I went to jail,

401
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,210
but I still have the private loan left.

402
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,880
I can't even die because of Do Sik and Do Jun.

403
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,980
My Do Jun and Do Sik...

404
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,870
Gosh, what do I do? What do I do?

405
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,590
What do I do? What do I do?

406
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,080
President Gong. It's President Gong.

407
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,990
President Gong. President Gong. 
    

408
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,900
President Gong! President Gong!

409
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,710
President Gong...

410
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,590
President Gong, it's me. President Gong...

411
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,910
So...

412
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,040
how much do you need, exactly?

413
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,880
Why do you ask?

414
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,400
Will you help me if I tell you?

415
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,090
Tell me.

416
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,700
It's...

417
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,340
500 million won for now.

418
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,840
Really?

419
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,920
Will you do anything if I give you 500 million?

420
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,690
I'll do anything!

421
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,390
Of course!

422
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,210
President Gong, please help me.

423
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,640
Please spare me.

424
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,210
If so...

425
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,000
your actor, Kim Ji Yeong, who's living with you.

426
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,110
Make her come to me.

427
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,410
President Gong, what do you mean by that?

428
00:28:50,990 --> 00:29:01,280
â™«  I remember the day the sky so blue when I first laid my eyes on you  â™«

429
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,270
â™«  You smiling at me, my heart took flight  â™«

430
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,050
Have a seat.

431
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,180
Why did you insist on meeting outside?

432
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,320
We could've talked at the office if it's about work.

433
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,260
I have something to give you.

434
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,730
Yes.

435
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,900
It's a photo of your dad.

436
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,540
His Korean name is Kim Seong Su.

437
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,120
His English name is John Kim.

438
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,530
Your dad...

439
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,030
studied biology at Columbus University

440
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,470
and he was a Korean-American.

441
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,070
We were a campus couple.

442
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,820
I loved him and...

443
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,210
we considered marriage, too.

444
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:27,270
But when he was 28,

445
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,540
he went on a hike and...

446
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,120
died from an accident.

447
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,230
He was only 28 years old.

448
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,200
Your dad...

449
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,320
was a very cool and impressive young man.

450
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,160
I abandoned you,

451
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,630
but your dad would've never abandoned you.

452
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,650
I hope you know that, at least.

453
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,030
That's why I brought it with me.

454
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,160
I thought you should know your dad's face, at least.

455
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,890
You...

456
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,760
resemble him a lot.

457
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,900
 Chairman Gong! Chairman Gong! Chairman Gong! 

458
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,090
- Chairman Gong! 
 - What's going on?

459
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,890
I'm glad you're home.

460
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,070
We have a serious problem.

461
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,760
Gosh, where do I even start?

462
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,340
First of all, have a look at this. Look.

463
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,880
This is Pil Sung and my wife.

464
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,330
But why is she crying, by the way?

465
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,660
That's what I'm saying.

466
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,900
I took a photo because I thought it was weird.

467
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,090
But thinking about it on the way,

468
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:22,330
she's been very strange about Pil Sung all this time.

469
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,210
When Ma Ri said she liked him, she slapped her and disapproved of it.

470
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,110
She hired him at Go Go Entertainment, paying him a lot of contract money.

471
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,420
And she threw herself to save Pil Sung from the accident.

472
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,140
Not anyone can just do that.

473
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,490
What are you talking about right now?

474
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,780
S-So, I felt impatient, so...

475
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,140
Well, let me start from the beginning.

476
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,630
I lost my nail clipper.

477
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,700
So I went into Soo Yeon's room to borrow hers and ended up dropping her jewelry box.

478
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,350
And there was a photo of a baby in there.

479
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,200
Why is there a baby photo in the jewelry box?

480
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,690
Why would she hide it?

481
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,350
It looked like Pil Sung's baby photo, so I showed it to Seon Yeong.

482
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,360
She said it was indeed Pil Sung's baby photo.

483
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,410
What's the problem with that?

484
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,910
You still don't understand after everything I said?

485
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,320
Are you still not getting the hint?

486
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,200
I think Pil Sung is Soo Yeon's son.

487
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,910
W-What... What did you say? S-Son?

488
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,390
Pil Sung is Seon Yeong's adoptive son.

489
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,720
You probably don't know, but there's a rumor Soo Yeon had a baby a long time ago.

490
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,080
This has to be true.

491
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,250
- Hong Ae Gyo! 
 - Oh, my God!

492
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,140
Are you out of your mind?

493
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,140
C-Chairman Gong.

494
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,440
What's wrong? What's going on?

495
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,680
Aunt, I can't live in the same house with this woman anymore.

496
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,810
What did you say? My wife had a baby in the past?

497
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,740
And that baby is Pil Sung?

498
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,570
Are you kidding me right now?

499
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,170
You think you can just say anything?

500
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,580
Hong Ae Gyo, get out of my house immediately.

501
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,400
Get out of here right now!

502
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,580
C-Chairman Gong, I must've gone crazy.

503
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,570
I must've been possessed.

504
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,380
I'm sorry, Chairman Gong. Please forgive me.

505
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,390
Don't embarrass yourself if you must go crazy!

506
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,900
Oh, no...

507
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,750
What were you thinking?

508
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,680
How does that make sense?

509
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,750
The gentle Chairman Gong won't get so furious for no reason.

510
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,490
It really was strange.

511
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,980
Have a look at this photo.

512
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,950
It's strange.

513
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,260
Why would she be like this with her friend's son?

514
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,320
And why would she keep his baby photo like a treasure?

515
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,380
You fool. This makes her Go Pil Sung's mother?

516
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,520
What crazy woman would abandon her baby at a friend's house?

517
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,020
You once said Soo Yeon gave birth to a baby.

518
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,230
We don't know that for sure.

519
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,320
I've been looking for the evidence for years, but I couldn't find it.

520
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,820
If you're that curious, find the evidence.

521
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,110
You can't say that without evidence.

522
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,070
You think I'm not saying anything because I don't want to?

523
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,420
I've been quiet since there's no clear evidence.

524
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,620
Major accusations have to come with firm evidence.

525
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,100
Without it, you face backlash like just now.

526
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,950
Evidence?

527
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,980
Ahjumma...

528
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,640
What will my mom do?

529
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,510
Where would she suddenly get that much money?

530
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,580
I mean, what would happen if she can't pay them back?

531
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,650
How could they remove an organ from someone alive?

532
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,150
Ahjumma!

533
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,760
Ahjumma!

534
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,460
Ahjumma, what happened?

535
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,690
What will we do? We can't run away, either.

536
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,640
Why did you borrow money from such scary people?

537
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,260
Ji Yeong,

538
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,380
there's one way to survive.

539
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,770
Pardon?

540
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,430
What is it?

541
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:45,250
But you have to help me to do it.

542
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,060
Me?

543
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,070
Will I work at a nightclub again?

544
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,730
When will I make 500 million doing that?

545
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,880
And I can't do that because it goes against the drama contract.

546
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,910
It's not that.

547
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,780
You know CEO Gong Jin Dan, right?

548
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,890
Y-Yes, I do.

549
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,270
To be honest,

550
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:14,020
when you were Do Ra, you were engaged to him.

551
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,930
What did you say? I was?

552
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:23,850
You probably... don't know because you lost your memory,

553
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,700
but you and CEO Gong... used to be in love.

554
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,520
Is that true?

555
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,870
Yes.

556
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:40,660
That's why he liked you because you reminded him of Do Ra.

557
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,350
Ji Yeong,

558
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,630
could you date CEO Gong again?

559
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:54,050
He agreed to give me 500 million if things work out with you again.

560
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,390
Ahjumma, what are you talking about?

561
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,570
I don't have a memory of the past at all.

562
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,590
I don't even like CEO Gong currently.

563
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,370
How could I date someone I don't even like?

564
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,270
And he has a fiancee, too.

565
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:12,460
No, he doesn't. They apparently broke up.

566
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,320
And he helped us a lot when you were Do Ra.

567
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,840
As long as Go Pil Sung didn't butt in, you would've married President Gong.

568
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,470
Did I betray President Gong, then?

569
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,030
I'm telling you.

570
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,740
There was an article about your engagement, too. You want me to show you?

571
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,780
Here.

572
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,620
Look.

573
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,050
   

574
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,200
It's true.

575
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,510
Yes, read it. Read the article.

576
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,630
He generously helped us when we went bankrupt.

577
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,720
He's a good person once you get to know him. But...

578
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,560
you couldn't get engaged to him because of Go Pil Sung.

579
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,150
When you chose Go Pil Sung after betraying President Gong,

580
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,630
he took down all the engagement articles, so you won't get hurt.

581
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,870
That's how great of a person he is.

582
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,950
Does he know I'm Park Do Ra, too?

583
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,640
No, no. He doesn't.

584
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,590
No one should find out you're Do Ra.

585
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,920
Once people find out about it, they won't leave you alone.

586
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,200
No one but our family should know you're Park Do Ra.

587
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,250
So, Ji Yeong...

588
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:42,210
keep the fact that you're Do Ra a secret and try seeing President Gong once.

589
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Gosh, Ahjumma...

590
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,590
Ji Yeong, that's the only way for us to survive.

591
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,650
Please help me, your mom, just once.

592
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:59,250
Please spare Do Sik and Do Jun just once, Ji Yeong.

593
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,450
Ahjumma.

594
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,160
Aigoo.

595
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,340
What's this photo?

596
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,890
It's not Pil Sung, but...

597
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,400
he looks a lot like him. Who's he?

598
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,920
What? Did something happen?

599
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,550
No...

600
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:15,020
I found a strange photo in Pil Sung's wallet.

601
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,580
What photo? He carries a photo of us.

602
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,430
Not that. There was another photo.

603
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,190
Of someone who resembles him.

604
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:33,080
I think he's Pil Sung's birth father.

605
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,890
He resembles Pil Sung so much.

606
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,210
President Jang must've given it to him.

607
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,250
Pil Sung, what is it? Why aren't you in bed?

608
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,870
I wanted to tell you guys something.

609
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,460
Is that so? What is it?

610
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,730
I found out who my birth father is today.

611
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,810
President Jang suddenly called me, saying she needed to give me something.

612
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:16,650
So I met her, and she gave me a photo of my birth father.

613
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,340
He was a Korean-American and... he died from a hiking accident when he was 28.

614
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,340
He was a Korean-American and... he died from a hiking accident when he was 28.

615
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,130
Oh, is that so?

616
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,830
I see.

617
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,040
Pil Sung, could we have a look at that photo?

618
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,330
Yes.

619
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,870
Yes.

620
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,140
Wow, he was handsome.

621
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,910
Pil Sung...

622
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,180
you look just like your father.

623
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,410
Right, Honey?

624
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,120
Yes, he does.

625
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,110
To be honest, I've always had misgivings that I couldn't get rid of

626
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,020
about who my birth father was.

627
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,340
But seeing this photo makes me feel better.

628
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,270
I see.

629
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,920
That's a relief.

630
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,000
Mom.

631
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm sorry I met President Jang without telling you.

632
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,870
Gosh, no. Why would you say that?

633
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,070
You work together, too.

634
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,840
I'm okay as long as you're okay.

635
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,210
Thank you.

636
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,590
I'll let you two rest. I'll go upstairs.

637
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,060
- Okay, okay. Go to bed now. 
 - Good night.

638
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,800
- Sleep tight. 
 - Yes, good night.

639
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,730
To be honest,

640
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,400
I was very curious about

641
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,090
his birth father, too, but...

642
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,690
finding out actually makes me feel better.

643
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,930
I know.

644
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:26,440
Otherwise, our Pil Sung would've always felt sad, wondering who his father was.

645
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,020
I'm thankful that she gave him a photo of him.

646
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,330
What did you do today?

647
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,260
I did some shopping and got groceries, too.

648
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,310
Yes.

649
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,710
Is Pil Sung's shoot going well these days?

650
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,580
I heard he's shooting a drama called "House of Roses."

651
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,250
Yes, I suppose it's going well.

652
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,520
I haven't seen Pil Sung for a while, either.

653
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,090
It's been a while?

654
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,630
You didn't see him separately, either?

655
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,560
No, there's no reason to do that.

656
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,390
He's busy, and I have no reason to be on set, either.

657
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,130
I see.

658
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,540
 And there was a photo of a baby in there. 

659
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,480
 Why is there a baby photo in the jewelry box? 

660
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,970
 Why would she hide it? 

661
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:06,700
 It looked like Pil Sung's baby photo, so I showed it to Seon Yeong. 

662
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,260
 She said it was indeed Pil Sung's baby photo. 

663
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,790
 Pil Sung is Seon Yeong's adoptive son. 

664
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,030
 You probably don't know, but there's a rumor Soo Yeon had a baby a long time ago. 

665
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,310
 This has to be true. 

666
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:29,360
 Yes, I suppose it's going well. 

667
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,690
 I haven't seen Pil Sung for a while, either. 

668
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,740
You didn't forget our promise, right?

669
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,110
Of course not. I'll make sure to keep the promise.

670
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:06,270
If you break the promise and run away from home, I won't buy you ice cream anymore.

671
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,370
Okay. I said I won't.

672
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,400
Geez, how clumsy.

673
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,190
- You have some here, too. 
 - What?

674
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,350
You're good at taking a bow.

675
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,520
Huh? Grandma!

676
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,310
Gosh, seriously!

677
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,050
- Okay, okay. 
 - Come here.

678
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,720
- You come here. 
 - Okay, okay. I won't. I won't.

679
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,750
- Come here. 
 - Let me wipe it off.

680
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,330
- Hold it. 
 - Why?

681
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,620
Why did you wipe it on my face, then?

682
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,010
And?

683
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,270
Were Ma Ri and Pil Sung always that close?

684
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,800
- Dad. 
 - Have a seat.

685
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,790
Why did you want to see me?

686
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,050
You hurt my feelings, Ma Ri.

687
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:16,720
You were near the office, but you didn't tell me.

688
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,690
How did you know I was nearby?

689
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,650
What do you mean, how? I used my superpower.

690
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,030
Come on.

691
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,800
On the way back from a meeting, I saw you and Pil Sung walking by and eating ice cream.

692
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,050
Your arms were locked, even.

693
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,510
Have you fallen for him again, by chance?

694
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,010
Do you want to marry him again?

695
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,270
No, Dad! Pil Sung is just an oppa. Just an oppa.

696
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,780
Come on, Dad. Oppa and little sister can't get married.

697
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,000
Don't think about stuff like that.

698
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,310
Oppa and little sister can't get married.

699
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,750
That can never happen.

700
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,910
Oh, really?

701
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:05,910
If you've fallen for Pil Sung, I was going to talk to him in person.

702
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,560
No, don't say stuff like that.

703
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,720
Oppa and I cannot be.

704
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,220
O-Okay, okay.

705
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,700
Dad, I'm running late for the academy.

706
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,760
I'll leave now.

707
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,620
Okay, be safe out there.

708
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,220
Okay.

709
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,030
Pil...

710
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,560
Director Go.

711
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,350
I'm not here for another reason.

712
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,560
I stopped by to sign off on something.

713
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,660
You need to do your job, too.

714
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,260
I'll leave you to it.

715
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,340
I need to prepare for tomorrow's shoot.

716
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,550
 Oppa and little sister can't get married. 

717
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,030
 That can never happen. 

718
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,750
 Let's get divorced. 

719
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,960
 It's not all of a sudden. 

720
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,310
 I've actually been... 

721
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:41,250
 considering divorce for a long time. 

722
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,300
Yes, Mr. Gu.

723
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,210
I need you to look into something quietly.

724
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,340
Excuse me.

725
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,210
Me?

726
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,170
I fell for you at first sight.

727
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,150
Could you give me your phone number?

728
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,900
You fell for me at first sight?

729
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,500
Yes, give me your phone.

730
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,680
I'm sorry. She's my girlfriend.

731
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,730
I'm sorry.

732
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,960
Girlfriend?

733
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,440
I'm your girlfriend?

734
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,510
Ma Ri, you can't give anyone your phone number.

735
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,480
You don't know what kind of person he is.

736
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,790
He said he fell for me. At first sight, even.

737
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,980
We can become friends.

738
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,000
It could be dangerous, too.

739
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,630
So, say you have a boyfriend from now on.

740
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,680
I don't have one, though.

741
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,650
But still. Just say you do.

742
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,280
Okay?

743
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,170
Do I have a boyfriend now, then?

744
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,670
Gosh, Eun Hee.

745
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,050
It's been so long.

746
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,150
I'm on my way to the store.

747
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,200
Do you want to meet me there?

748
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,850
Okay, see you soon.

749
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,490
My baby.

750
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,430
My Ae Gyo.

751
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,530
She looks exactly the same.

752
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,540
Just the same.

753
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,580
Ae Gyo, is this really your store?

754
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,230
Yes, my son got it for me.

755
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,440
My goodness.

756
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,520
You used to crave creampuffs when we were school kids.

757
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,150
How could you become the madam of APP Group after having a son?

758
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,300
Oh, my God. You have it made in the shade.

759
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,870
Seriously, girl. You still blabber your mouth the same way.

760
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:26,020
I heard you live in Brazil. What brings you to Korea?

761
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,720
My husband is on vacation. So I'm here for a month.

762
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,940
Right, I heard you live with Soo Yeon.

763
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,820
You're her mother-in-law, and she's your daughter-in-law.

764
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,870
That's old news. Why ask that now? How silly.

765
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,370
A relationship like that isn't common.

766
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:45,440
It's so unusual and fun.

767
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,220
Is your daughter-in-law, Soo Yeon, doing well?

768
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,960
Yes, she is.

769
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,280
How many kids does she have?

770
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,230
- She has one daughter. 
 - Really?

771
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,550
She must be married since she's the same age as my daughter.

772
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,390
No way. She hasn't married yet.

773
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,440
Oh, my. She's 34, and she's not married yet?

774
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,500
I suppose people get married late these days.

775
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,270
34? Gosh, no.

776
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,050
Ma Ri is still 28. What are you talking about?

777
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,470
You said Soo Yeon has one daughter.

778
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,920
She's 34, then. How could she be 28?

779
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,490
When I was almost due with my daughter, she was also almost due.

780
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,890
W-What...

781
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:29,480
What? When you were almost due with your eldest daughter, she was also almost due?

782
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,430
Eun Hee, are you sure about this?

783
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,720
Yes, I'm sure.

784
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,360
She didn't see me then, but I definitely saw her at Chukbok Hospital.

785
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:44,430
Her belly looked as big as mine, so I thought she might give birth in the same month.

786
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,470
Whenever it's my eldest daughter's birthday,

787
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:51,650
I used to wonder if Soo Yeon's child was doing well.

788
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:54,620
I-Is that true? Are you sure about this?

789
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,470
How many times do you have to ask?

790
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:00,700
You think I mistook a stranger as Soo Yeon?

791
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,170
Hey, hey, hey. Did I just make a slip of the tongue?

792
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,890
Eun Hee... what you just said and saw, then...

793
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,380
Could you tell Chairman Gong about it?

794
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,750
Y-You want me to tell Soo Yeon's husband?

795
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,130
O-Oh, my God.

796
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,120
By chance...

797
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,660
Hey, Ae Gyo. Please ignore everything I said.

798
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,590
I think I was mistaken about something.

799
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,200
I'm busy. I'll get going now.

800
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,190
Gosh. Oh, my God.

801
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,810
Eun Hee!

802
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,300
Ma Ri is 28, Pil Sung is 34.

803
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,470
Gosh, even the age makes sense.

804
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:52,150
Yes, Pil Sung has got to be Soo Yeon's son.

805
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,310
My hunch was correct.

806
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:59,390
Calm down. Calm down.

807
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:03,990
I need to present conclusive evidence this time.

808
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,520
I'd get yelled at like last time if I said it wrong.

809
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,730
It'd make me look crazy.

810
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,520
I did bring them, but which one is Soo Yeon's?

811
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,180
Whatever. I'll test them both.

812
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:31,730
Seon Yeong! Mother!

813
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,040
Is anyone home?

814
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,940
Who is it?

815
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,910
What brings you here?

816
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,200
Seon Yeong is at the restaurant right now.

817
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,440
Oh, my. I suppose she's at work at this time of day.

818
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,730
The thing is, I got so thirsty passing by.

819
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,150
Could you give me a glass of water?

820
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,140
Water?

821
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,790
So, you mean you came here to drink water?

822
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,930
Where did she go off to?

823
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,050
She asked for water.

824
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,540
Did she just leave?

825
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,460
Huh? Her shoes are still here.

826
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,170
You asked for water. What were you doing up there?

827
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:45,440
The thing is, I wasn't thirsty. I needed to use the bathroom. So...

828
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,290
There's a bathroom on the first floor, too.

829
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,120
Why did you go upstairs?

830
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,120
I got you water. Do you want it?

831
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,870
No, Mother. I got to use the bathroom, thanks to you.

832
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:59,420
Thank you. Take care.

833
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,950
My goodness. She could've asked to use the bathroom, to begin with.

834
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,050
Why does she keep changing her mind?

835
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,250
As if she's training me like a pup.

836
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,580
Mom, I'm leaving now.

837
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,940
Myeong Dong, Myeong Dong, come here.

838
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,010
Take this before you go.

839
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,030
Why?

840
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,540
Hey, you bump into things all the time.

841
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,520
Don't make me worry and take this.

842
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,120
Gosh, I'm busy.

843
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:47,100
You're getting old, too. You should care for yourself.

844
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,080
Okay.

845
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:57,620
Myeong Dong, you're always writing.

846
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,480
When will it air, exactly?

847
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,590
I don't know! Why would you ask that?

848
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,580
Gosh, seriously.

849
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,380
Why did she choose to suffer?

850
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,720
Aigoo, she's going through so much.

851
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,320
Lady, tell CEO Baek... to eat well.

852
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,110
She can't get sick.

853
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,530
She needs to be healthy, so her organs are, too.

854
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,410
And I know where Park Do Joon lives.

855
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,000
My boys are standing guard there, too.

856
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,330
Tell Baek Mi Ja not to try running away or die.

857
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,850
You got that?

858
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,130
We'll pay you back.

859
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,650
We'll pay all the money back. Don't say scary stuff like that.

860
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,880
You'll have to pay it back.

861
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:07,490
 Ji Yeong, don't forget I'm always by your side. 

862
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:11,750
 Let me know whenever you need my help. 

863
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,390
No.

864
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,640
Even so, I can't ask him for money.

865
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,950
It's not just a small amount. It's a huge amount.

866
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:44,550
Even if I am shameless, I can't be that shameless.

867
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:07,750
 Park Do Ra, please take good care of Mom, Oppa, and Do Joon. 

868
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,030
 Dad told me that in my dream last time. 

869
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,470
 Don't worry, Dad. 

870
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,460
 Mom, Oppa, and Do Joon... 

871
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,750
 I'll save my family. 

872
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,920
Ji Yeong, where have you been?

873
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,910
Ahjumma.

874
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,460
Yes, Ji Yeong.

875
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,460
If I go out with CEO Gong Jin Dan, would he really pay off your debt?

876
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,600
Yes.

877
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,400
He said he will. He'll pay it off completely.

878
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,060
Okay.

879
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,350
I'll go out with him.

880
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,880
Ji Yeong...

881
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,310
I'm glad you decided to do that, Ji Yeong.

882
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,650
CEO Gong is a good man. He's good.

883
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,860
I'm glad you decided that, Ji Yeong.

884
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,430
You... You saved us all, Ji Yeong.

885
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,180
Thank you. Thank you, my daughter.

886
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,290
Thank you so much.

887
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,500
Thank you, Ji Yeong.

888
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,800
Thank you so much.

889
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,360
Thank you.

890
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,420
Yes, Mr. Gu.

891
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,060
What did you say?

892
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,850
She had a fiance?

893
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:17,140
His name was Kim Seong Su...

894
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,890
O-Okay. Keep looking into it.

895
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:32,000


896
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,400
   

897
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,140
   

898
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,740
 Aunt! 

899
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,140
Aunt! Aunt! Have a look at this. Look at this.

900
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,280
What's this now?

901
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,070
Aunt, try not to be so shocked when you see this.

902
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,250
You need to brace yourself.

903
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,140
What is it?

904
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:04,010
What is it that you're all fired up?

905
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:08,060
Auntie, I got Soo Yeon's and Pil Sung's DNA tested today.

906
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,380
It says they are mother and son.

907
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,960
It says 99.9999%, whatever...

908
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,340
Anyway, it's true.

909
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,920
Look at this.

910
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,640
What did you say?

911
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,780
   

912
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,020
"Jang Soo Yeon and Go Pil Sung are mother and son biologically."

913
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,800
"Jang Soo Yeon and Go Pil Sung are mother and son biologically."

914
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:32,400
My gosh. Gosh.

915
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,610
My goodness!

916
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,780
Auntie, Auntie, are you okay?

917
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,950
- Hang in there! 
 - My goodness.

918
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,260
My gosh, how could this be?

919
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,680
Yes, get back safely.

920
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,010
Chairman Gong! Chairman Gong!

921
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,690
Soo Yeon... Kick Soo Yeon out immediately.

922
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,120
Kick her out immediately.

923
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,160
What are you talking about?

924
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,700
Look at this, Chairman Gong. Look.

925
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,340
Aigoo, my goodness. My goodness.

926
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,830
My goodness...

927
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,660
I'm home.

928
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,830
Where's Jin Taek?

929
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,190
Chairman Gong!

930
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,040
Chairman Gong!

931
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,330
Jang Soo Yeon!

932
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,670
   

933
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:57,450
â™«  You mean the world to me  â™«

934
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:04,830
â™«  You came to me like a star in the dark  â™«

935
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:11,090
â™«  You became my light  â™«

936
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:17,210
â™«  Tears are filling up  â™«

937
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,700
â™«  Our time together  â™«

938
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,460
 Not today, Grandma. 

939
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,170
 I need to do something important. 

940
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,550
 Behave yourself and stay with Ahjumma. 

941
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,080
 I'll be right back. 

942
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,270
 You really promise me, right? 

943
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,220
 You aren't leaving me to go somewhere far away, right? 

944
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,210
 What was I to you? 

945
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:36,690
 Was I just an empty shell? 

946
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,560
 That bastard was Soo Yeon's illegitimate son? 

947
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,090
 Will you let Go Pil Sung stay at the company? 

948
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:42,660
 I'll do it if you can't, Hyung. 

949
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,980
 I'll take care of everything. 

950
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,440
 President Jang passed out in front of the office. 

951
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,610
 So, I brought her to the hospital, but she's still unconscious. 

952
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,100
 I think you need to come, Chairman.
