1
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,007
- Pil Sung! 
 - Go Pil Sung!

2
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,897
Pil Sung! 
    

3
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:51,087
Pil Sung!

4
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,347
Pil Sung, are you okay?

5
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,457
What happened?

6
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:58,507
Mom, I'm okay, but the President...

7
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:02,227
Oh, my! Soo Yeon!

8
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,927
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon, open your eyes!

9
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,397
Ma Ri, what happened?

10
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:11,227
A wall fell on her on the set

11
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:15,007
and Mom tried to protect Pil Sung, and this is what happened.

12
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,017
My mom won't wake up, no matter how much I try to wake her.

13
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:21,437
What? She was trying to protect Pil Sung?

14
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,447
No... No, not my Pil Sung!

15
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:27,680
Pil Sung!

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,880


17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,637
Mom, Mom, what are you doing?

18
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:38,297
Wake up, Mom.

19
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:40,097
Open your eyes, Mom!

20
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:42,647
Mom! Mom!

21
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:48,587
Mom, can you see me?

22
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,347
It's me!

23
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,617
Soo Yeon, are you okay?

24
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:53,777
Are you awake now?

25
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:56,167
Where's Pil Sung?

26
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,847
President, I'm here. I'm okay.

27
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:05,397
Yes, Director Go.

28
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:07,527
Are you sure you're okay?

29
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,667
Yes.

30
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:19,677
President Jang, you must've worried a lot about Pil Sung getting hurt.

31
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,847
Doctor, are my mom and oppa okay?

32
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:27,337
There's nothing wrong with Director Go, according to the test results.

33
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:30,497
But Ms. Jang bruised her knee and shoulder.

34
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:34,687
She'll have to take medicine and receive physical therapy for now.

35
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:37,057
 Yes. 

36
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,957
Thank you.

37
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:44,457
I'm glad nothing worse happened.

38
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:49,827
Pil Sung is totally fine. How did you get so injured, President Jang?

39
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:55,187
My mom held Pil Sung like this to protect him, and they fell.

40
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:04,307
Soo Yeon, thank you so much for saving Pil Sung. But...

41
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:07,107
I'm so sorry you got injured.

42
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:10,527
I feel so guilty about it. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:12,527
It's okay, Seon Yeong.

44
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:16,087
I'm totally fine. I'm really okay.

45
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:20,337
The doctor said I was fine, too.

46
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:25,377
Honey, what happened?

47
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:26,757
How did you get into an accident?

48
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,837
Are you okay?

49
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,597
I'm okay.

50
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:34,177
They said I'm totally fine.

51
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:42,427
My gosh, my gosh.

52
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:47,607
If it wasn't for your friend, something bad could've happened to Pil Sung.

53
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,757
I know.

54
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:56,587
How could she throw her fragile body to save Pil Sung?

55
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:01,247
Your friend must really care for him a lot.

56
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:03,507
She paid him so much contract money, too.

57
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,847
And now she saved his life.

58
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:12,747
Pil Sung, you'll have to be loyal to President Jang from now on.

59
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:14,177
Of course.

60
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:18,387
I didn't know she cared about me this much, either.

61
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:22,197
You still need to relax. Rest upstairs.

62
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:24,997
- Okay, I'll go upstairs. 
 - Yes, go upstairs.

63
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,917
Hey, Myeong Dong. Get me some water.

64
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,317
My heart is still racing so much.

65
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,547
 - Okay.  
 - Aigoo.

66
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:38,547
I'm glad Soo Yeon didn't get injured more.

67
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:43,517
What if something terrible happened to her trying to save Pil Sung?

68
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:47,557
I felt so bad that I couldn't face Chairman Gong earlier at the hospital.

69
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:51,617
I know. I don't even want to think about it.

70
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:54,287
By the way, CEO Jang...

71
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:57,917
She said, "Pil Sung, my Pil Sung," unconsciously.

72
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,337
Why was she calling for him in that situation?

73
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,387
As if he was her child.

74
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:06,777
One might've thought he was her son.

75
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:10,307
It's because she got injured saving him, I'm sure.

76
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:16,137
Soo Yeon has cared for Pil Sung since he was a baby.

77
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:22,057
I'm too lucky to have a friend like her.

78
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,587
You sure are lucky to have a good friend.

79
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:28,027
You're lucky to have your husband, too? Right?

80
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:32,247
Pardon? My husband? I'm lucky?

81
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,997
W-What? She's right.

82
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:41,240
Seriously, you always say nothing but truths.

83
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:44,927
Yes, yes. You're right.

84
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,947
Gosh, I got so scared.

85
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:57,047
My gosh, how could you throw yourself to save that big man?

86
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:59,467
We almost had a funeral today.

87
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,877
I know.

88
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,927
We can't break our bones at our age.

89
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,747
How could you throw yourself to save Pil Sung?

90
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:10,027
Were you that worried about Seon Yeong's son getting hurt?

91
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,837
How could I just let someone get injured?

92
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:17,687
He got into that dangerous situation working for my company.

93
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:19,627
Let's go inside for now.

94
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:23,617
Right. I left the medicine in the car.

95
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,107
Ma Ri, bring her to the room. I'll get her medicine.

96
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:28,807
Okay, Dad.

97
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,547
Let's go, Mom.

98
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:35,007
Heavens helped her today. Seriously.

99
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:39,317
She's so devoted to Seon Yeong's family.

100
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,987
She risked her life to save her son this time.

101
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:45,317
Seriously, what a touching friendship.

102
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,017
Having a barbecue reminds me of something.

103
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:56,977
You once got us ribs once.

104
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,767
When we used to live in that grandpa's house.

105
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,717
- Do you remember, Do Jun? 
 - I do.

106
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:06,237
I don't know where you got the money, but you told us to eat as much as we'd like.

107
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:09,767
I think we ate about 15 servings, the four of us.

108
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:13,067
Ji Yeong must not remember it.

109
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:17,417
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

110
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:22,057
Gosh, seriously. Stop talking about something she doesn't even remember.

111
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,607
Let's just eat. Seriously.

112
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:28,957
Here. Do Ra, say ah.

113
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:32,127
Mom, we agreed not to call her that.

114
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:34,877
Oh, right. It came out of nowhere.

115
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:37,607
We have to call her Ji Yeong from now on, okay?

116
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:41,057
It'd be a disaster if people found out she was Do Ra.

117
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:44,317
Ji Yeong, say ah. Ah.

118
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,557
Okay.

119
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:55,657
It's tasty.

120
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:59,297
Thank you so much for caring for me so much.

121
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:03,387
Gosh, don't thank me. We're a family.

122
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:07,057
Do Jun, you say ah, too. Ah.

123
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,807
I'll eat it myself.

124
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:14,177
Come on, Mom wants to feed you.

125
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:19,077
Yes, just take it. Her arms are hurting.

126
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:24,647
Yes, yes, yes.

127
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:30,477
Mom, why are you crying?

128
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:37,807
The four of us having a meal together...

129
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,067
feels like a dream.

130
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,337
I'm so happy.

131
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:44,827
Gosh, Mom. Why are you doing this now?

132
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,087
You're making me tear up.

133
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,837
Let's not ever...

134
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,797
be separated and live together like this.

135
00:08:54,797 --> 00:09:00,447
We can't afford Korean beef, but pork belly makes us so happy.

136
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:05,157
Ji Yeong, you don't remember, but you're my daughter,

137
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:10,147
Do Sik's younger sister, and Do Jun's older sister, okay?

138
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:14,017
Okay, got it.

139
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,707
I'm so happy, too.

140
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:21,187
My Do Ra... I mean, Ji Yeong is alive and well like this.

141
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:27,177
Seriously. Why are we doing this during a meal?

142
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,027
Let's eat.

143
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:35,427
Things are still awkward, but we'll get used to it once we start living together.

144
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,307
Yes, Ahjumma.

145
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:43,327
I'm happy to have a family like this, too.

146
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:46,557
I wish she'd called me "Mom" when it's just us.

147
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:49,607
She keeps calling me "Ahjumma."

148
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,227
Mom, we agreed to take things slow.

149
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,817
She'll get her memories back soon.

150
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:58,947
Yes, yes. Let's take it slow. Take it slow.

151
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:04,757
And Ji Yeong, you can call me "Ahjumma" forever. It's okay. It's okay.

152
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,647
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:10,957
Don't apologize. I said it's okay. It's okay.

154
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:14,947
Let's eat. Let's eat. Come on and eat. Hurry, eat.

155
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:18,157
Eat, eat.

156
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:19,787
Let's eat.

157
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,547
Grandma, what are you up to?

158
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:43,277
What do you mean? I'm about to go to bed.

159
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,867
What? Is something going on?

160
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:49,867
Do I call only when something's going on?

161
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,227
Everything's fine.

162
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,287
How about you? You're okay, right?

163
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,387
Did you go somewhere random singing the national anthem again?

164
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:00,907
No, no.

165
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:06,607
Deok Ja would've called you if I had gone berzerk.

166
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:10,937
 Is it because I'm happy you're in a show? 

167
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,627
 I'm totally fine these days. 

168
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:18,907
Ji Yeong, the neighbors saw you on TV

169
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:21,377
and they say you became successful.

170
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:26,067
 My shoulders are almost touching the sky these days because of pride!. 

171
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:27,927
Really?

172
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,527
 Yes. 

173
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:33,357
So, don't worry about me at all

174
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:37,467
and just focus on your job, okay?

175
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,897
Okay, Grandma.

176
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:45,477
You know... I love you the most in the world, right?

177
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:51,907
 I love you the most in the world, too. 

178
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:54,337
Thank you, Grandma.

179
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,497
Thank you, Grandma.

180
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:02,417
I love you.

181
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,417
I love you, Grandma.

182
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:33,447
 Soo Yeon's company made me an amazing offer. 

183
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,027
 Then, the CEO did that on her own? 

184
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:37,497
 Without even asking you? 

185
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:40,467
 No, not my Pil Sung! 

186
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,317
 Pil Sung! 

187
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:44,877
How strange.

188
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,687
How strange.

189
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:51,657
This is more than just strange.

190
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:57,167
Mom, why do you keep mumbling instead of sleeping?

191
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,247
What do you find so strange, exactly?

192
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:04,367
Myeong Dong, don't you find it strange?

193
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,127
Find what strange?

194
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:10,267
She almost died because the wall fell on her.

195
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:15,047
But she wasn't calling for her daughter, Ma Ri, or her husband.

196
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:19,067
Why did she call for Pil Sung in that situation?

197
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,427
So desperately, too.

198
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,577
Mom, are you still talking about that?

199
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:29,977
It's probably because she passed out saving Pil Sung.

200
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,537
That's why I find it strange.

201
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:37,037
Why would she call for Pil Sung in that situation?

202
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:42,017
And you said this, too.

203
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:46,847
Amazingly, she offered him that much contract money with Pil Sung's experience.

204
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:51,507
Why? Why did she pay him twice as much to hire him?

205
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:57,277
She's always been too generous to Pil Sung.

206
00:13:57,277 --> 00:14:01,657
She always sent tons of presents and food whenever he was celebrating something.

207
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:10,570
But she risked her life to save him this time.

208
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,897
Who would...

209
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:15,767
Who would do that for a friend's son?

210
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:20,967
So? What are you trying to say right now?

211
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,737
Hey...

212
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,987
No, no. It's just strange.

213
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:31,377
Seriously, why wake me up for this?

214
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:44,137
It's strange. It's strange.

215
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:47,477
This isn't more than just strange.

216
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,707
You didn't have to get us a meal, Pil Sung.

217
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:56,327
I felt so bad and grateful toward you.

218
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,377
You got injured saving me.

219
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,357
Is it okay to come to work already?

220
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,157
Of course. I came out because I'm okay.

221
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:05,417
I feel okay since I took medicine and got good sleep.

222
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,477
How about you? Are you really okay?

223
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:10,817
Yes, I'm fine, thanks to you.

224
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,547
Thank you so much.

225
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:16,477
How many times did you thank me? Stop now.

226
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:20,347
How long will you thank each other for?

227
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,117
Enough with the pleasantries.

228
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:25,217
How about we start eating now?

229
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:27,647
Shall we?

230
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:30,577
- Let's eat. 
 - Enjoy, President Jang.

231
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:33,307
- The blue one. 
 - This blue one?

232
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,047
Yes, yes, yes.

233
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,897
No! What happened?

234
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:51,867
Isn't it working?

235
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,387
I got it!

236
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,387
- Try again. 
 - Okay, okay.

237
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,577
No, no. I can get it. I can get it.

238
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,247
- Again! Get another one! 
 - Another one? Okay.

239
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:21,287
 Yes, I hope Pil sung and Ma Ri continue to get along like this. 

240
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,577
 I hope they continue to be happy like this. 

241
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,057
- This one, right? 
 - Yes.

242
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,147
Go further.

243
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,877
Gosh, it's so hot.

244
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:31,507
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Yes.

245
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:37,597
I'll make your favorite, kimchijjim, with ribs.

246
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,347
Whenever you finished a strict diet for a shoot,

247
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,977
you always wanted my kimchijjim with ribs.

248
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:46,577
You ate two bowls of rice easily.

249
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:47,967
Was I like that?

250
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:51,067
I still like kimchijjim with ribs.

251
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:55,537
Oh, my. You lost your memory, but your taste buds haven't changed.

252
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:05,376
Yes, this is Baek Mi Ja of Bbaek Entertainment.

253
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:09,066
 A nightclub wants Ms. Kim to perform as the market lady 

254
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,646
 from "Don't Lie to Me." Do you want her to do it? 

255
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:16,476
 There will be 10 shows. I'll negotiate the pay. 

256
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,576
Excuse me.

257
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:21,746
Ji Yeong is about to play a supporting actor in a 30-billion-won show.

258
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:25,196
She'll be a star once it gets on air.

259
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:27,806
So, get her something dignified instead.

260
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:31,426
Such as cosmetics or drinks commercials.

261
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,656
Call me if you get something like that, okay?

262
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:38,056
Seriously, what was he thinking?

263
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,136
What was it? What was it about?

264
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:43,756
Huh? You don't have to know.

265
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,246
Why do we keep getting gigs like this?

266
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:49,796
Hand me those.

267
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:03,286
You're preparing the restaurant opening well, right?

268
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:07,956
Of course, I am. Everything is going perfectly.

269
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,236
- You mean it, right? 
 - Of course. I'll really surprise you this time.

270
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:14,396
- You mean it, right? 
 - Of course. I'll really surprise you this time.

271
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:20,536
I'm opening a restaurant thanks to Pil Sung.

272
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,236
We raised our son well, right?

273
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:27,646
Yes, we're so lucky to have him.

274
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:35,406
Yes, I'll work hard and pay Pil Sung back.

275
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:40,886
And I'll buy him a nice apartment when he gets married, too.

276
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,156
- Gosh, really? 
 - Of course.

277
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,926
My gosh! How exciting!

278
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:55,376
Jin Dan, why did you start drinking again?

279
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:57,746
You said you'd get your act together.

280
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:01,686
The in-laws' gathering is next week. You can't be like this.

281
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,806
Mom,

282
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:09,036
can we push back the in-laws' gathering?

283
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,296
Why would you push it back?

284
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:14,696
Why are we rushing it so much?

285
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,056
It's not like we'd get married immediately.

286
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:22,786
Gong Jin Dan, will you keep saying "Do Ra" again?

287
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,886
Is this because of her?

288
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:27,646
Are you still not back to your senses?

289
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,726
Gosh, I don't know.

290
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,926
I don't know why I'm like this, either.

291
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:36,146
What do we do with you?

292
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:40,106
My gosh. 
    

293
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:45,076
Hyeon Cheol, this is our restaurant, right?

294
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:47,866
Yes, Mom. This is our restaurant.

295
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:49,726
Congratulations, Oppa.

296
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,026
Thank you.

297
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,926
Congratulations, Father.

298
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,916
Thank you.

299
00:19:54,916 --> 00:20:00,056
I paid off the loan and got a nice restaurant like this, thanks to you.

300
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:02,076
I'll work hard.

301
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,216
We'll work hard and pay you back in full.

302
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:07,326
What are you talking about? I gave you that money.

303
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,316
Gosh, no.

304
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:12,416
You have to work and pay back the contract money.

305
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:16,236
How could I just take your hard-earned money?

306
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:20,606
Parents and children need to be financially independent, too.

307
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,466
Yes, I agree with Mom.

308
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:26,406
Much, much later, then.

309
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:29,506
It's big. There's endless space back there.

310
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:32,196
This is so great.

311
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:33,636
Welcome.

312
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:36,286
Two people? Over there, please.

313
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:42,396
Gosh, Soo Yeon! Ma Ri! What brings you here?

314
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:46,886
What do you mean? We couldn't miss your opening.

315
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:50,986
Jin Taek wanted to come, too, but he suddenly had to attend a seminar in Jeju-do.

316
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:54,116
He said he's sorry and he'll make sure to come next time.

317
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:58,256
He sent us the beautiful garland. That's enough.

318
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,846
Seeing the garland from the APP Group's chairman,

319
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:06,836
the other store owners asked us how we knew him.

320
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:09,166
Hyeon Cheol is feeling so confident.

321
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,276
He's been smiling all day.

322
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,546
Should I tell him to send one every day, then?

323
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:16,556
Gosh, come on.

324
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,166
You came.

325
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,876
- Yes, Pil Sung. 
 - Hi, Oppa.

326
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,786
Hi, Ma Ri. You should eat.

327
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:23,606
Come this way.

328
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,396
Let's go.

329
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:31,046
Give me that.

330
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:33,046
Pil Sung, have a seat. I'll grill instead.

331
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:36,036
No, we grill for you here.

332
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,236
I'll make it tasty for you.

333
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,536
Look how sweaty you got.

334
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,686
Thank you.

335
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:56,396
Why would she wipe the sweat off someone else's son's face?

336
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:02,856
Why would he do that for a man in his 30s?

337
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:04,296
I know, huh?

338
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:06,726
That's a bit much.

339
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:12,266
I know she's Seon Yeong's friend, but people might get the wrong idea.

340
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:13,926
Wrong idea?

341
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:15,646
Like what?

342
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:17,346
Huh?

343
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,766
- It's nothing. 
 - Have some, Mother.

344
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:22,666
Hey, hey. Your friend, Soo Yeon...

345
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,676
just because Pil Sung was sweating...

346
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:28,726
she wiped it off of his face like this.

347
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:32,356
Who does that to a friend's son?

348
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,206
Tell her not to do that anymore.

349
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,146
It looks kind of weird.

350
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,596
Mother, come on.

351
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:42,336
Why is that weird? It's okay to wipe off someone's sweat.

352
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:43,376
- Go ahead and eat. 
 - Excuse me.

353
00:22:43,376 --> 00:22:45,186
Yes.

354
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:56,346
Why would she look at someone else's son like that?

355
00:22:57,736 --> 00:23:00,866
She's so strange.

356
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:05,786
- Take care. 
 - Come back with Chairman next time.

357
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,596
- Did you enjoy the food, Ma Ri? 
 - Yes.

358
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,346
- Come back again. 
 - Okay.

359
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,776
Thank you for coming.

360
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:14,056
- Take care. 
 - Get back safely.

361
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:21,206
Myeong Dong, this looks like Ma Ri's earring.

362
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:23,276
I'll give this to her now.

363
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,806
Okay.

364
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:33,295
Mom, can I hang out here for a little longer?

365
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,265
What do you mean you want to hang out here?

366
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,365
Didn't you see how busy everyone was?

367
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:41,295
Well, I don't mean I'll just hang out.

368
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,215
I want to help them with Oppa, too.

369
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,435
Do it next time.

370
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:51,285
Since today's the opening day, it's too crowded and chaotic. Get in the car.

371
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:53,975
I hate saying goodbye to Oppa like this all the time.

372
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,695
I want to live with him in our house.

373
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:59,455
PIl Sung is my oppa and your son.

374
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:02,065
How long do we have to be separated like this?

375
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:06,215
Ma Ri, you promised not to say that.

376
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:08,105
Get in the car.

377
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:09,795
Come on.

378
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:15,845
Good girl. Get in.

379
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:31,345
My goodness.

380
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:34,335
What did I just hear?

381
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,605
What did she say just now?

382
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,375
Have a seat.

383
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:51,945
Mom, lie down.

384
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:55,515
Why are you suddenly dizzy?

385
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:57,625
Did you overdo it today?

386
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,465
What if you have anemia?

387
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,575
Let's go to the hospital and get a blood test.

388
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:05,725
I don't have anemia.

389
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:09,355
It's because I'm in shock. I'm in shock.

390
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,425
Shock? About what?

391
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:15,405
Myeong Dong, I...

392
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:20,445
I think I know who Pil Sung's biological mother is.

393
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:23,055
Pil Sung's biological mother?

394
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:27,445
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

395
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:32,495
Myeong Dong, this is a secret between us two.

396
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:35,025
You have to keep it a secret until we die.

397
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:38,765
Especially from Pil Sung and your sister-in-law.

398
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:40,615
Come on, seriously!

399
00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:45,075
Today is Oppa's opening day. Why are you wasting time instead of helping?

400
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:52,155
Myeong Dong, Ma Ri's mom... your sister-in-law's friend, President Jang.

401
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:57,255
She's Pil Sung's biological mother.

402
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,015
Pil Sung is that woman's son.

403
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:07,435
What are you talking about?

404
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:11,245
This is no good. Let's ask the doctor if you have dementia.

405
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:14,305
Come on! I don't have dementia...

406
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:18,045
When I followed them to give Ma Ri her earrings back,

407
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,405
I overheard clearly with these two ears.

408
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:24,685
Do you know what Ma Ri and President Jang said?

409
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:27,555
"How long do we have to be separated?

410
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:31,345
Pil Sung is your son and my oppa."

411
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:33,075
That's what she said.

412
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:36,245
Mom, you're acting strange.

413
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,455
Let's get you tested for dementia.

414
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:41,095
Come on. What's wrong with you?

415
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:43,535
It's because you're talking nonsense.

416
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,815
Don't say stuff like that to anyone.

417
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:49,785
You'd get arrested for defamation if you say that without evidence.

418
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:56,725
And Ma Ri has said weird things about him since she likes him. Don't you know that?

419
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,155
Is that why?

420
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,415
I'm going back to the store.

421
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:08,465
We're so busy because it's Oppa's opening day, but you're talking nonsense.

422
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:11,585
What's wrong with you?

423
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:17,695
Did I really hear that wrong?

424
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:23,015
I don't think so. My ears work just fine.

425
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:27,031
Am I wrong?

426
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,495
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

427
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:32,465
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

428
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:40,015
Do Sik, don't skip the team dinner from now on.

429
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:42,105
Stop disappearing all the time.

430
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:43,995
Okay, I won't.

431
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,645
The soju ad model is Kim Na Bi now.

432
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,745
You're right. Wasn't it Jo Sa Ra before?

433
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:52,935
Jo Sa Ra got cancelled because of prostitution.

434
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:56,205
Park Do Ra killed herself because of it, too.

435
00:27:57,525 --> 00:28:00,575
Park Do Ra was innocent of that.

436
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:04,095
What do you mean? There were articles about it, too.

437
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:06,405
It was to pay off her mom's gambling debt.

438
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:08,555
The photos at the hotel were everywhere, too.

439
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:09,845
It's not true, I said.

440
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:11,685
Why do you talk about it as if it is?

441
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:13,125
What do you mean it isn't?

442
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,565
You can still look it up on the internet.

443
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,175
It's all fake news.

444
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,465
Enough is enough, please.

445
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:23,085
Geez, why is this asshole pissing me off?

446
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:25,625
That's enough. Why are you ruining the mood?

447
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,745
You're drunk. You're all drunk.

448
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:31,095
Hey, why would you call it fake news?

449
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:36,015
Should I show you a photo of Park Do Ra with a man at the hotel?

450
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:42,075
It says she died out of shame after sleeping with someone for money.

451
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,005
It's not true, you bastard.

452
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:51,145
Hey, what are you? Are you her cousin or something?

453
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,565
Or are you her older brother?

454
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,975
Yes, I'm Park Do Ra's older brother.

455
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:58,935
Die, you bastard!

456
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,615
Hey! Park Do Sik!

457
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:08,965
What happened? Why did you hit someone?

458
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,845
You've never done this before!

459
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:13,725
Excuse me, are you Mr. Park's mother?

460
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:16,065
Yes, I'm his mother.

461
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:18,715
I'm his younger sister.

462
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,435
The victim is at the hospital. Just try to settle.

463
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:25,405
It'd be a headache if it gets escalated.

464
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:28,725
Looks like they blew off steam over drinks.

465
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,925
No need to have a criminal record at a young age.

466
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:32,975
He doesn't even have previous criminal records.

467
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:35,025
You little. Seriously...

468
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,465
Gosh. My goodness.

469
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,365
Seriously.

470
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:46,555
W-What did you say? 50 million won  (~$36K) ?

471
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:50,615
We have no 50 million. We can't get that money.

472
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:52,705
Please forgive us just once, sir.

473
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:56,735
Send him to jail if you don't, then.

474
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:59,165
Is Park Do Ra his sister or something?

475
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:03,425
He did this to me by saying Park Do Ra died because she had sex for money.

476
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:08,415
I can't settle unless you pay me 50 million, okay?

477
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:10,965
Let the law take care of it! Let's!

478
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:13,095
He should do time for doing this to me.

479
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:16,505
My gosh, please have some of this.

480
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:17,925
This, too. This, too.

481
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,685
Please forgive him just once, Sir.

482
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,595
We're sorry.

483
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:28,855
I didn't know he got into a fight because of me.

484
00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:33,395
I don't even have five million. How will I get 50 million?

485
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:35,925
Hold on. Should I call Do Jun?

486
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:42,115
No, he must be living off his small wage.

487
00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:43,835
He can't have any money.

488
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:46,865
Calling him would only make him worry.

489
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:51,765
Have some water and calm down, Ahjumma.

490
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:58,065
Hey, Ji Yeong. Do you have money, by chance?

491
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,635
Could I use it if you do?

492
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:02,535
We need to stop your brother from going to jail.

493
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:07,075
I got five million back for the security deposit when I moved out of Director's house.

494
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,645
Is that all you have?

495
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:10,165
Yes.

496
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:15,075
Hey, how about the contract fee you're getting from the drama?

497
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:18,825
Ask Jae Dong when that'll get deposited. Hurry, hurry.

498
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,425
Okay.

499
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:37,675
President Lee, it's me.

500
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:42,365
When will I receive the contract fee?

501
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:47,675
Is that so? Okay.

502
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:51,205
No, no. E-E-Everything's fine.

503
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:52,665
I was just curious.

504
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:55,135
Okay, okay. Bye.

505
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,415
That won't work, either.

506
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:02,585
I get 30% after the first shoot, but that needs to be used as project expenses.

507
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:07,035
Gosh, what are we supposed to do, then?

508
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:15,175
Oh, how about your grandma in the countryside? Does she have money?

509
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:17,705
My grandma? Gosh.

510
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:20,715
How would she have any money?

511
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:22,895
What are we going to do about Do Sik?

512
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:25,335
What do we do about Do Sik?

513
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:31,445
Gosh, Do Ra. I mean, Ji Yeong...

514
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:34,875
What? Did you come up with a solution?

515
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:40,925
You can get 30 million if you agree to do something.

516
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,975
What? What is it?

517
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:45,405
I'll do it right now if there's a solution like that.

518
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:47,525
What is there to think about?

519
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:49,615
   

520
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:56,935
I didn't want you to do stuff like this again,

521
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:01,455
but this is the only way to make money now.

522
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:02,835
It's okay.

523
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:06,725
They'll pay me 30 million if I sing "Pick one, pick one" 10 times.

524
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:08,115
Of course, I'll do it.

525
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:11,835
There isn't an easier way to make money than this.

526
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:16,555
And we can't let Do Sik go to jail.

527
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:19,495
He did that for his sister, Do Ra.

528
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:25,425
Do Ra... I mean, Ji Yeong, thank you so much.

529
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:29,795
Thank you so much, my daughter. Thank you.

530
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:32,655
Don't worry, Ahjumma.

531
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:33,935
 Everyone! 

532
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:36,475
Thank you so much for waiting.

533
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:42,695
We barely managed to invite the star of "Don't Lie to Me."

534
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:45,425
You know her, too, right?

535
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:50,245
"Pick one, pick one. Look around. Pick one."

536
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:54,945
Here's Lady "Pick one, pick one," Kim Ji Yeong!

537
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:32,605
 I want to live with him in our house. 

538
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:35,155
 PIl Sung is my oppa and your son. 

539
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:37,755
 How long do we have to be separated? 

540
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:40,045
 Ma Ri... 

541
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:46,095
Yes, I heard them right. I definitely did.

542
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:53,295
I-Is Pil Sung really President Jang's son?

543
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:59,255
If that's true... That makes no sense.

544
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,925
What do I do?

545
00:35:01,785 --> 00:35:04,285
Why am I shivering right now?

546
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:22,685
Where did the other earring go, anyway?

547
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:28,105
Yes, Grandma.

548
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:32,835
What? You have my other earring?

549
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:45,625
Why is no one home, by the way?

550
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:50,265
Everyone went to the restaurant to work.

551
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:58,085
By the way, Ma Ri, you and I are true friends, right?

552
00:35:58,085 --> 00:36:00,175
Of course, we are.

553
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:07,695
You know true friends can't lie to each other, right?

554
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:12,085
I guess that's true.

555
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:14,075
Why do you ask that?

556
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:19,135
The day our restaurant opened,

557
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:24,235
you left this earring behind.

558
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:27,375
So, I followed you to give this back to you

559
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:31,675
and heard everything you and your mom, President Jang, said.

560
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:37,325
W-What did you hear?

561
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:39,425
You said...

562
00:36:39,425 --> 00:36:42,835
"Pil Sung is your son and my oppa.

563
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:45,405
How long do we have to be separated?

564
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,625
I don't like saying goodbye to him all the time.

565
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,975
When can we start living together?"

566
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,195
You said that.

567
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,405
What?

568
00:36:55,655 --> 00:37:01,065
Ma Ri... is Pil Sung your mom's son?

569
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:05,345
Is Pil Sung your biological brother?

570
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:09,745
Grandma, no! This is top secret.

571
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:13,145
No one can find out about this.

572
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:16,495
My gosh, i-is it true?

573
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:19,215
M-Ma Ri, is it all true?

574
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:23,225
Yes. You won't... you won't...

575
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:25,145
You won't tell anyone about it, right?

576
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:27,765
My dad can't find out about it. That can never happen.

577
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:32,325
If so, my mom would get kicked out.

578
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:35,355
She'd get kicked out?

579
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:44,975
Does it mean Pil Sung isn't your dad's son?

580
00:37:45,935 --> 00:37:51,535
Yes, he isn't my dad's son. He's my mom's son.

581
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,515
He can't find out about it.

582
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:57,555
Why did you have to find out about it?

583
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,545
Oh, my God...

584
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,845
W-What...

585
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:14,171
   

586
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:16,555
- Oppa! 
 - Do Sik! Do Sik!

587
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,235
You shouldn't have come.

588
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:21,635
Look at your face. You lost so much weight already.

589
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,835
Oppa, are you okay?

590
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,155
Looks like you got injured from the fight, too.

591
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,115
This is no good. Let's go to the hospital first.

592
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:31,215
No, no. I don't have to.

593
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:34,065
I can't spend money at the hospital after what I did.

594
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,545
I'm okay.

595
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:37,655
Mom, I'm sorry.

596
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,125
Ji Yeong, I'm sorry.

597
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,035
Eat tofu. Don't ever come back here.

598
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:45,105
Don't get into fights because you're angry.

599
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:47,165
Just eat the tofu.

600
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,665
By the way, how did you settle?

601
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:53,295
You didn't pay him or anything, right?

602
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,005
You know we have no money!

603
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:59,245
Just eat the tofu! Eat it!

604
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:04,255
We didn't spend any money. Don't worry and eat. Hurry.

605
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,565
- Take a big bite! Come on! 
 - Yes, yes. Eat a lot of it. Eat!

606
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:12,561
   

607
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,855
Yes.

608
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,965
President Jang, we have a bit of an issue.

609
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,655
What is it?

610
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,055
Have a look at this.

611
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:34,225
   

612
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:37,155
What's this?

613
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:43,295
Ms. Kim, is it true that you're performing here?

614
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:46,925
Yes, it's true.

615
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:52,676
Are you serious?

616
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:55,376
I-I'm sorry, President Jang.

617
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:58,216
Director and Writer, I'm so sorry.

618
00:39:58,216 --> 00:39:59,666
Ms. Kim!

619
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,156
Why would you do this after agreeing to be on our drama?

620
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:03,896
You didn't tell us anything.

621
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,386
Didn't you check the contract?

622
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:08,436
Didn't you read the pre-shoot reminder?

623
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:14,176
I'm sorry. I was so desperate for money.

624
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:18,016
And I had no idea this would be a problem.

625
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,926
You didn't know this would be a problem?

626
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,916
How could you be this thoughtless?

627
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,326
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:27,456
I should've taken better care of her since she has no experience.

629
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:29,236
It's all my fault.

630
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:35,266
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

631
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:37,996
I'm sorry.

632
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:45,749
Let's just dismiss her instead of discussing it further.

633
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:50,309
If we feature an actor who sings and dances at a place like this,

634
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:54,769
our drama would be considered cheap, too.

635
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:58,659
Writer, this isn't right. Don't you agree?

636
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,649
I'll understand as we're dismissing Ms. Kim, then.

637
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:11,129
Director Go, we could've done something if it were just once.

638
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:14,729
But she needs to keep working at the nightclub.

639
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:19,809
If all of this is true, we can't continue to work with Ms. Kim.

640
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:23,619
Can't believe this happened.

641
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,749
Ms. Kim,

642
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,449
how could you do something so careless?

643
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:39,889
Tell me what happened.

644
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,569
My older brother...

645
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:49,369
had a team dinner with his colleagues

646
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:53,409
and one of them said Park Do Ra died because she got caught having sex for money.

647
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:57,179
I suppose he said bad things about Park Do Ra.

648
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:02,909
So, Oppa had a fistfight with him and the colleague got injured a bit.

649
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:09,869
He said he'd send him to jail if he didn't pay him to settle.

650
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:18,079
The reason he got into a fight was to defend me of all things.

651
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,359
I couldn't let him go to jail for that.

652
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:25,689
Getting the settlement money was all I could think of then.

653
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:31,719
The nightclub said they'd pay me 30 million won in advance if I performed 10 times.

654
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,189
That's why I performed just once.

655
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:36,819
You should've told me first if you were in that situation!

656
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:40,459
How could I ask you for money?

657
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,929
President Baek made you do this, didn't she?

658
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,249
No, I volunteered.

659
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,169
Tell it to me straight.

660
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:51,099
How did you know about that place?

661
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:53,249
You've never even been to a place like that.

662
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:56,339
President Baek did tell you to do this!

663
00:42:57,439 --> 00:43:01,679
Director Go, why do you keep blaming my mom?

664
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,829
Why do you keep making her a bad person?

665
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:07,749
I said I'd do it. I did.

666
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,929
And I couldn't send Oppa to jail.

667
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:13,679
That was all I could think about.

668
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,449
That's why I did it without considering the consequences.

669
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:20,519
I really didn't know this would be such a serious problem.

670
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,479
I'm so sorry, Director.

671
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,739
It's 100% my fault.

672
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:34,549
I did the wrong thing without thinking about our drama.

673
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:43,159
I'm...

674
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:46,199
getting fired now, right?

675
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:50,639
I'm so sorry.

676
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:05,809
President Baek, what the hell is this?

677
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,509
How could you do such a thing?

678
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:11,109
Ms. Kim is about to get fired because of you.

679
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:13,919
They're about to cancel her contract right now.

680
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:16,019
And I'm your co-CEO.

681
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:19,739
How could you send her there without even telling me?

682
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:25,009
I mean, she's still unknown as an actor and the shoot hasn't started yet. So I thought it'd be okay.

683
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,529
We were desperate for money. What could we do?

684
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:30,729
Ji Yeong's brother is my son. Was I supposed to send him to jail?

685
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,459
You should've looked for another solution, then.

686
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:40,879
As soon as she becomes popular in "House of Roses," what if

687
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:43,819
videos of her singing dressed up as the "Pick One" lady at a nightclub appears

688
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:46,399
all over on social media? What are you going to do then?

689
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:50,059
It's all over once it spreads on social media!

690
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:52,249
Don't you know how things operate in this field?

691
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:53,859
So?

692
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:57,259
Are they firing Ji Yeong?

693
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:01,599
Yes. And we can't argue about it, either.

694
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:05,889
What will you do now?

695
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:11,319
   

696
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:14,109
I'll give you back what you paid Ms. Kim.

697
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:17,689
Please cancel the contract for the rest of the shows.

698
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,959
There's a penalty fee. Do you still want to cancel?

699
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:26,159
Yes, how much is that?

700
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:41,469
 Director Go, can I see you for a moment? 

701
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:48,249
We needed money. I thought I should put out the fire first.

702
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:49,949
I did it without thinking through it.

703
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:52,659
I really didn't know this would happen.

704
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:54,499
And my Do Ra...

705
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:58,759
I mean, my Ji Yeong can't get fired from the drama.

706
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,199
Please forgive me just once. I beg you.

707
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,279
I know you needed money, but still.

708
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:07,509
How could you sell Do Ra...

709
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:09,509
I mean, Ji Yeong to a place like that?

710
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:12,379
What do you mean, sell? How could you say that?

711
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:16,829
My son was about to go to jail, but there was no way to get money.

712
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:19,309
And I didn't force her to do it.

713
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:24,229
Do Ra said she'd do it. How could I stop her?

714
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:27,719
Did you already forget...

715
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,721
how much pain Do Ra was in because of you?

716
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:36,489
Did you already forget what kind of hell she went through because of you?

717
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,619
If she came back to life,

718
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:43,279
if you're truly her mother, you should've embraced her more warmly than anyone.

719
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:44,789
But...

720
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:49,289
how could you make Do Ra sing at a place like that?

721
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,419
Can you call yourself a mother?

722
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,219
What did you say?

723
00:46:54,219 --> 00:47:00,029
This is why I didn't tell you Do Ra was alive. This is why.

724
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:02,879
That's how desperate I was. That's how...

725
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:07,559
Don't you feel sorry for me at all?

726
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,239
Seriously, how dare you...

727
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:11,169
President Baek!

728
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:14,309
I'm warning you one more time.

729
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:20,009
If you do something like this again, I swear I won't sit still.

730
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:21,959
Keep that in mind.

731
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:25,999
Director Go, it's not like that. Let me...

732
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,329
Wow!

733
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:30,619
How dare that bastard blabber his mouth at me?

734
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:34,479
My daughter is mine. Why does he care how I use her?

735
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,489
How dare he tell me what to do?

736
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:41,719
Wow, that bastard. Seriously, how dare he?

737
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,689
This... Where do I hide this?

738
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:59,999
No, no, no. I need to tell them about this.

739
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,679
How could I hide something this important?

740
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,119
No, I still promised Ma Ri, though.

741
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:11,439
How could I...

742
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:14,559
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

743
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:20,109
Mom, what is it?

744
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:22,099
Why are you so surprised?

745
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,059
W-What? I didn't do anything.

746
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:28,099
What's that? Why are you hiding it?

747
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:29,879
Did you cause trouble again?

748
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:33,519
Gosh, I said it's nothing. It's nothing.

749
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,629
Geez! Give me that!

750
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:40,839
This is a DNA test result.

751
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:44,739
Mom, why do you have something like this?

752
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:48,279
Did you do this by chance?

753
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:51,739
Yes. I-I did it.

754
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:56,639
I took Pil Sung's toothbrush and Ma Ri's hair.

755
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,569
They really are biological siblings.

756
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:02,509
W-What did you say?

757
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:06,499
Pil Sung and Ma Ri are s-siblings?

758
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:11,089
So, Ma Ri's mom gave birth to Pil Sung. She's his biological mother.

759
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:13,379
What? Hold on...

760
00:49:13,379 --> 00:49:16,529
Gosh, no way! 
    

761
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:19,429
Mom, I'm home.

762
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:24,329
Seon Yeong has to run an errand somewhere.

763
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,959
Aigoo, aigoo. So tired...

764
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:32,409
What's with you two? What's going on?

765
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:35,099
What's that piece of paper?

766
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,969
What's that?

767
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:39,389
Let me see. What is it?

768
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:43,689
- Oppa, Pil Sung's biological mother— 
 - Hey, hey! You little...

769
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,089
I promised Ma Ri to keep it a secret!

770
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:48,799
Oppa needs to know. You think that's important?

771
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,919
He's Pil Sung's father.

772
00:49:50,919 --> 00:49:54,459
What about Pil Sung? Did something happen to him?

773
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,939
What's wrong?

774
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:59,869
Oppa, have a look at this.

775
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:05,819
- What's this? 
 - Pil Sung and Ma Ri...

776
00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:09,189
They're siblings, apparently.

777
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:11,879
What? Seriously.

778
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:14,979
Mom, what's she saying?

779
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,599
 Cheers! 

780
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:27,999
It's so nice and refreshing.

781
00:50:29,649 --> 00:50:33,859
I know. It's so nice and cold.

782
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:40,599
Soo Yeon, Hyeon Cheol has always wanted to have his own restaurant so badly.

783
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:44,519
He achieved his dream, thanks to you. Thank you so much.

784
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,059
Don't say that.

785
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:48,679
Pil Sung got him to open the restaurant.

786
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,349
It's because you paid him a lot for the contract.

787
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:53,329
So, it's all thanks to you.

788
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:57,249
You keep saying I paid him a lot for the contract.

789
00:50:57,249 --> 00:51:01,259
How many times did I say I hired our Director Go because he's talented?

790
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,899
Thank our Pil Sung instead, okay?

791
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:15,079
Soo Yeon, you must've been an angel in your previous life.

792
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:20,329
Or my mom sent you to me from heaven.

793
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:26,219
I don't know what I've done to deserve a friend like you.

794
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:30,799
Gosh, I'm tired of having to thank you constantly.

795
00:51:33,229 --> 00:51:35,259
I'm thankful, too... that I have a friend like you by my side.

796
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,739
that I have a friend like you by my side.

797
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:44,359
Without you, I would've gone through a lot of hardship.

798
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:48,299
You've always been by my side whenever I struggled.

799
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:49,909
Okay, okay.

800
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:53,829
I'll treat you properly tonight for that reason.

801
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:57,309
Should we drink up this cold beer and do karaoke later, too?

802
00:51:57,309 --> 00:51:59,719
and do karaoke later, too?

803
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:01,939
Yes, yes! Sounds great!

804
00:52:01,939 --> 00:52:03,689
Cheers!

Soo Yeon!

812
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:30,009
What was that?

813
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:34,999
Wait...

814
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:37,629
H-How could this happen?

815
00:52:37,629 --> 00:52:39,939
Thinking back now,

816
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:44,219
that woman has been frequenting our house ever since we took in Pil Sung.

817
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:46,559
She said she decided to be friends with Seon Yeong.

818
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,949
Think about how nice she's been to Seon Yeong and Pil Sung.

819
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:52,689
She did all this on purpose, I'm telling you.

820
00:52:52,689 --> 00:52:57,309
She wanted to keep an eye on her son after abandoning him here.

821
00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:01,199
A character like that is considered a villain in soap operas.

822
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,649
No, no. She's evil. She's evil.

823
00:53:03,649 --> 00:53:06,849
She's the most evil person ever.

824
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:09,919
Seon Yeong was so proud of her as a friend.

825
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:14,559
She depended on her and appreciated her so much. How could she do this?

826
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,329
They say there's nothing scarier than humans.

827
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:22,439
Oppa, will you tell Seon Yeong about this?

828
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:25,339
What are you talking about? Why would I tell her?

829
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:27,969
She'd pass out if she heard about it.

830
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:30,769
No, she'll die. She'll die...

831
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:33,359
And Pil Sung is my son. My son.

832
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,169
He's not her son, but mine. Okay?

833
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:38,999
So, Mom, pretend you know nothing about it.

834
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:40,959
Okay, I will.

835
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:44,569
Go Myeong Dong, you can't say anything, either.

836
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:47,419
I won't, Oppa. Don't worry.

837
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:53,699
 Honey! Mother, I'm home! 

838
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:56,779
Oh my gosh, S-Seon Yeong must be here.

839
00:53:56,779 --> 00:53:58,209
What do we do?

840
00:53:58,209 --> 00:54:01,729
What do you mean? Keep your mouth sealed.

841
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:07,659
What are you all doing here?

842
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:14,459
We discussed whether we needed anything else at the restaurant.

843
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,969
Where have you been, Honey?

844
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:22,779
You were able to open the restaurant thanks to Soo Yeon.

845
00:54:22,779 --> 00:54:26,849
So, I treated her to thank her.

846
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:30,549
We had a beer together like the old days

847
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:34,929
and we sang together, promising a forever friendship at the karaoke.

848
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:40,529
I'll go to bed now.

849
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:42,449
I'm so tired!

850
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:47,549
They promised a forever friendship.

851
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:51,059
- What do we do with her? 
 - My goodness.

852
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:54,749
What are we going to do now?

853
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:59,299
She has blind faith in that bitch.

00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:25,099
Blow out the candle and make a wish, Pil Sung.

859
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:26,919
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

860
00:55:26,919 --> 00:55:29,129
I told you not to do this. I'm too old.

861
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:31,199
- What am I, a child? 
 - Come on.

862
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,439
- Stop complaining and just do it. 
 - Seriously.

863
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,889
Father, Mom, Grandma, and Auntie, thank you.

864
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,409
- Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday.

865
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:45,309
Happy birthday.

866
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:55,369
Gosh, Honey. Are you crying?

867
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:59,709
Gosh, you're so funny.

868
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:03,919
I-I'm not crying.

869
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:06,199
Gosh, seriously.

870
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:09,859
Father.

871
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:12,699
I love you!

872
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:14,109
I'll go to work now.

873
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:16,599
Gosh, hey. You should have a slice of cake.

874
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:17,939
Later.

875
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:20,569
Aigoo, my son is so busy.

876
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:26,519
It feels like it was yesterday when he was crawling around here.

877
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:29,709
When did he grow up so much?

878
00:56:30,409 --> 00:56:33,759
Honey, you're so funny.

879
00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:36,279
I heard men go through menopause, too.

880
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:41,109
You're probably the only man who cried singing "Happy Birthday" to his son.

881
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:45,949
He used to be this big, but now he's that big.

882
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,799
Of course, he tears up. Why wouldn't he?

883
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:51,579
Gosh, well... um...

884
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,159
Looks like you're having menopause, too.

885
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:55,939
Come on now.

886
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:00,099
- My goodness. 
  - Is anyone home? 

887
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:03,039
Who's that?

888
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:05,739
Unni, someone must be here.

889
00:57:07,649 --> 00:57:09,779
Gosh, Soo Yeon.

890
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:14,219
You shouldn't have sent all this.

891
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:18,829
You remember Pil Sung's birthday every year.

892
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:21,119
Yes, thank you.

893
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,749
What?

894
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:29,419
It's Pil Sung's birthday. Why did you send presents for Hyeon Cheol and me?

895
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,189
Seriously.

896
00:57:32,189 --> 00:57:35,879
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

897
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:40,189
Okay, thank you.

898
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:43,799
It's Pil Sung's birthday.

899
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:46,049
She sent you and Hyeon Cheol presents, too?

900
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:51,599
Yes, she's telling us we went through a lot raising Pil Sung all this time or something.

901
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,279
Anyway, she's always coming up with excuses to send presents.

902
00:57:56,279 --> 00:57:57,829
Yes.

903
00:57:57,829 --> 00:58:00,029
This is a purse for me.

904
00:58:00,029 --> 00:58:02,919
This is a belt for you.

905
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:05,329
Why don't you try this on?

906
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,749
It's okay.

907
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:13,779
Why does that woman send stuff like this on our son's birthday?

908
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:16,569
Tell her to care for her daughter instead!

909
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,419
Honey, what's wrong with you?

910
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:25,939
She's always been generously sending presents for Pil Sung's birthday.

911
00:58:25,939 --> 00:58:29,479
Why are you suddenly doing this?

912
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:34,489
And what do you mean, "that woman"?

913
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:38,529
What... What are we, beggars?

914
00:58:38,529 --> 00:58:41,059
Can't we dress or feed ourselves?

915
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,459
We do just fine without stuff like this.

916
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:45,059
Tell her not to send stuff like this anymore.

917
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,099
You shouldn't accept anything, either.

918
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:52,019
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

919
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:02,329
Geez...

920
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:05,089
Hyeon Cheol, what's wrong with you?

921
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:07,849
She'd end up finding out at this rate.

922
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:10,369
You told us to play ignorant.

923
00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:13,359
Why would you do this right now?

924
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:17,159
Am I supposed to tolerate this, then?

925
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:19,549
We didn't know anything before.

926
00:59:19,549 --> 00:59:22,129
But now we know what she's thinking.

927
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:25,999
We know what that cunning woman's intentions are.

928
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:29,089
Are we supposed to just accept stuff from her?

929
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:31,009
What else can you do, then?

930
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:33,589
Do you think we want to?

931
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:38,379
As you said, if Seon Yeong finds out the truth, she'll die.

932
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:40,339
And Pil Sung would find out, too.

933
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:43,329
Do you want that to happen right now?

934
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:49,519
Yes, I know I shouldn't. But this isn't right.

935
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,799
How dare she say we raised our son well and stuff like that?

936
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:58,449
She abandoned her child. How dare she? How dare she?

937
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,969
No, Mom. This is no good.

938
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:04,799
I'll go see her first thing in the morning and warn her.

939
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,509
I'll tell her never to overstep her boundaries.

940
01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:12,359
I'll tell her to stop showing interest to Pil Sung and Seon Yeong.

941
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:16,069
Honey...

942
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:21,759
what are you talking about right now?

943
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:24,099
H-Honey...

944
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:27,529
A woman who abandoned her baby?

945
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:30,599
Who are you talking about right now?

946
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:33,259
S-Seon Yeong.

947
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:37,259
Mother, by chance...

948
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:41,149
are you talking about Pil Sung's biological mother?

949
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:48,349
W-Who is it? Who's that woman?

950
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,479
Well, H-Honey...

951
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:52,639
You said it just now.

952
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:54,569
You said you'd go see her!

953
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:56,829
That you'd warn her!

954
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:00,129
T-Tell me who it is.

955
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:02,879
Tell me who that woman is.

956
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:06,669
Who's the woman you said you'd go and see?!

957
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:19,289
It's Jang Soo Yeon. Jang Soo Yeon.

958
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:22,019
Your friend, Jang Soo Yeon.

959
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:26,429
W-What...

960
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:28,219
What did you say?

961
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:33,349
Yes, you need to know, too. Yes.

962
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:37,799
Pil Sung's biological mother is your friend, Jang Soo Yeon.

963
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:43,309
So, tell her not to do stuff like this again. Never again.

964
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:46,929
How...

965
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:49,949
How...

966
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:53,359
Honey, Honey!

967
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,939
Seon Yeong, Seon Yeong...

968
01:01:55,939 --> 01:01:58,159
Hyeon Cheol, what do we do? Seon Yeong!

969
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,999
- Honey! 
 - Seon Yeong, wake up.

970
01:02:06,779 --> 01:02:08,729
 Let me see. 

971
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:11,329
 How sweet. 

972
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:13,999
 - Let's go. 
 - Gosh. 

973
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:17,589
 Gosh. Oh, my! Seon Yeong! 

974
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:20,479
 You're Soo Yeon, right? Jang Soo Yeon. 

975
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:24,119
 Yes, that's right. Do you recognize me? 

976
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,549
 Of course. Everyone knew you in high school. 

977
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:31,749
 By the way, what brings you to this neighborhood? 

978
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:38,599
 I was on my way to meet someone, and I saw you. 

979
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,639
 Oh, my gosh! 

980
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:44,919
 How cute. 

981
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,649
 I-Is it a boy or a girl? 

982
01:02:48,649 --> 01:02:50,009
 It's a boy. 

983
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:52,479
 Gosh, he's so cute. 

984
01:02:55,139 --> 01:03:01,489
 O-Oh, S-Seon Yeong, it's so nice to see my high school classmate. 

985
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:04,829
 Let's keep in touch from now on. 

986
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:07,789
 Gosh, sweetie. 

987
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:09,289
 Are you curious? 

988
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:12,259
 Seon Yeong, may I hold Dae Chung just once? 

989
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:13,979
 Of course, go ahead. 

990
01:03:13,979 --> 01:03:15,469
 Here. 

991
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:18,299
 Gosh, so cute. 

992
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,859
 It's Soo Yeon. 

993
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:31,559
 Soo Yeon, what's wrong? 

994
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:35,989
 It's because Dae Chung is so lovely. 

995
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:38,639
 I want to have a baby like him, too. 

996
01:03:39,499 --> 01:03:41,109
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

997
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,619
 Gosh, come on. 

998
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:48,669
 Soo Yeon, you can have a baby, too. 

999
01:03:48,669 --> 01:03:50,219
 Gosh. 

1000
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:53,379
 Yes! You beat me! 

1001
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:55,359
 Huh? It's Auntie Soo Yeon. 

1002
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,079
 - It's Auntie Soo Yeon. 
 - Dae Chung! 

1003
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,889
 Dae Chung! Gosh, have you been well? Have you been well? 

1004
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:06,689
 Gosh, you grew so much, Dae Chung. 

1005
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,999
 Give me a kiss. 

1006
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:17,399
 Aigoo, aigoo. 

1007
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:39,599
Honey.

1008
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,569
Take this medicine.

1009
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:51,319
Honey, where are you going?

1010
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:53,639
Honey, Honey!

1011
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,619
- Seon Yeong, what's wrong? 
 - Where are you going, Honey?

1012
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:59,489
- Honey! 
 - Seon Yeong, what's wrong?

1013
01:05:08,991 --> 01:05:12,061
   

1014
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:19,039
Seon Yeong, what brings you here at this hour?

1015
01:05:19,769 --> 01:05:21,859
You bitch.

1016
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:28,489
Seon Yeong.

1017
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:31,089
You bitch!

1018
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:38,661


1019
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:41,629
   

1020
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:47,539
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

1021
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:52,959
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

1022
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:58,869
♫  I've already fallen for you  ♫

1023
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:04,619
♫  I'm not able to free myself anymore  ♫

1024
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:09,999
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

1025
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:17,069
 President Baek must've checked your contract. 

1026
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:19,489
 Do you think she would've done that if she cared about you? 

1027
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:21,509
 How could she cause trouble like this? 

1028
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:24,539
 She has no basic understanding. I don't have a good feeling. 

1029
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:26,559
 What did you want to talk about urgently? 

1030
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,069
 I was fired, right? 

1031
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:30,239
 What did you do wrong, exactly? 

1032
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:31,979
 Just tell me. Tell me. 

1033
01:06:31,979 --> 01:06:34,259
 I'll tell you later. Later. 

1034
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:38,249
 I said I'll tell you later! So, stop this, everyone! 

1035
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:41,209
 Please don't let Pil Sung know about this. 

1036
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:44,339
 I don't want to break his heart. 

1037
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:48,801
♫  If I could forget you by saying I would  ♫
