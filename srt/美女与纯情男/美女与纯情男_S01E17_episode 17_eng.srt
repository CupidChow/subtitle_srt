1
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,407
    
    

2
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:54,947
Assistant Director, how about the child actor? Didn't you request one?

3
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:56,787
Just one moment, Director.

4
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:59,147
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Yes.

5
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:01,687
Why isn't the child actor here?

6
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,587
Are you sure you contacted them? Ask them where they are.

7
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:08,027
Pardon? I thought that was tomorrow.

8
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,417
What do you mean?

9
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,967
The child actor shoot is today.

10
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:15,297
Did you tell them to come tomorrow?

11
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:17,667
Yes.

12
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:22,607
I told them to come tomorrow because I thought it was on Wednesday.

13
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:25,867
Assistant Director, what's going on here?

14
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:29,597
How could you make the newcomer do something so important?

15
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:33,557
And even if you did, you should've double-checked.

16
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:36,397
Well, I...

17
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,717
I'll try calling them now.

18
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,057
And then what?

19
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,787
I heard they live in Cheonan. Will we wait all day?

20
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:46,367
How could you make a mistake like this?

21
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,877
Forget it! We'll cancel the shoot today.

22
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:01,617
Assistant Director, I'm sorry.

23
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:04,187
I'm sorry I did this.

24
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:06,157
It's fine.

25
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:12,337
Gosh, what do I do?

26
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,057
You stupid idiot.

27
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:17,247
What have you done?

28
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:25,677
Director, Director!

29
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,867
I'm so sorry, Director.

30
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:37,407
But this is completely my fault.

31
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,287
The Assistant Director did nothing wrong.

32
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:43,507
I misread the date.

33
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:46,147
I'm so sorry, Director.

34
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,597
Even if you did,

35
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:53,127
you would've noticed if you checked the schedule.

36
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:55,047
Didn't you even check the schedule?

37
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,627
Is that how you do your job?

38
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,127
Never mind.

39
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:09,597
I'm a stupid fool.

40
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:13,147
What am I supposed to do now?

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:23,090


42
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,027
Ji Yeong,

43
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,827
what are you still doing here so late?

44
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,987
Well...

45
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:51,117
The thing is...

46
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:53,707
I was afraid I'd make another mistake.

47
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:58,047
I checked the props for tomorrow again.

48
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:01,687
I-I-I'm about to go home now.

49
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:04,377
Okay, see you tomorrow.

50
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,067
Yes, take care.

51
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:11,827
By the way, the buses or the subway must've stopped at this hour.

52
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:12,837
How will you get home?

53
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,797
Oh, I can take a taxi.

54
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,717
Where do you live?

55
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,347
I live in Heukseok.

56
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,847
Come with me. I'll drop you off.

57
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,377
Pardon?

58
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,667
Gosh, no, no, no. I'm okay.

59
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,057
Geez, you must be tired.

60
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:34,037
I'd feel bad if you had to take a detour for me.

61
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:37,007
I won't take a detour. I live there, too.

62
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:41,297
It'd be weird not to drive you when I know you live there.

63
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,547
Get your stuff and come.

64
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:48,187
We live in the same neighborhood.

65
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,397
Why is he doing this?

66
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,557
Okay.

67
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,437
Well, Director,

68
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,657
I'm so sorry about earlier today.

69
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:18,967
I'll never make a mistake like that again.

70
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,797
So, please don't fire me.

71
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:27,617
Well, to be honest,

72
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:32,897
I told everyone in the neighborhood that I got a job here.

73
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:38,967
So, the neighbors congratulated me for my success.

74
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:44,417
I'd be too embarrassed to go back home after getting fired.

75
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,977
Were you worried you'd get fired?

76
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:49,607
Yes.

77
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:53,717
I made such a serious mistake.

78
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:58,387
I'll never make another mistake like that.

79
00:05:58,387 --> 00:06:04,767
So, please forgive me generously just once.

80
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:10,377
Okay, I won't fire you. Don't work this late anymore.

81
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,317
You mean it, right?

82
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:17,647
Gosh, thank you!

83
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:21,797
I'll never forget that you forgave me.

84
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:27,767
I'll devote myself and work as hard as I can.

85
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,017
Where's your home?

86
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,617
It's back there.

87
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,407
You can drop me off here.

88
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,357
It's hard to turn around once you get up there.

89
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:50,107
Director, thank you so much.

90
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:53,037
I'll buy you coffee tomorrow.

91
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,517
No, it's okay. Go home and rest.

92
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:57,207
Okay.

93
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,497
Get home safely.

94
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,577
Drive safely!

95
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,307
Excuse me.

96
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,207
- Me? 
 - Yes.

97
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,887
What?

98
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,827
Do you want to go out with me?

99
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,647
D-Do what?

100
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:33,657
I'm asking you to go out with me.

101
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:35,187
Are you crazy?

102
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,827
I don't know you. Why would I go out with you?

103
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:42,897
Stop talking nonsense. Wash your feet and go to bed.

104
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:46,697
You think I'm a joke since I asked nicely.

105
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,577
- Hey, you country bumpkin. 
 - What?

106
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:50,787
You should be grateful that I'd go out with you.

107
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:52,797
How dare you play hard to get?

108
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,517
Follow me.

109
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:59,187
My gosh, what are you doing? Let go!

110
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,007
I said let go!

111
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,687
Let go! Let go of me! Come on, let go!

112
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,707
Let go, you bastard!

113
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,497
Let go while I'm asking nicely!

114
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:11,057
- You little— 
 - Ji Yeong!

115
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,377
You're dead today!

116
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:20,547
Gosh, Director.

117
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:23,927
Ji Yeong, are you okay? Are you hurt?

118
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,497
Yes, I'm okay.

119
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:29,507
What happened? Do you know him?

120
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,487
No, I've never met him before.

121
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,387
I was on my way home and...

122
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:38,217
that bastard asked me to go out with him and dragged me somewhere.

123
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,427
He tried to hit me,

124
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:43,187
so I kicked his you-know-what.

125
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:48,727
Director, is the entire Seoul like this?

126
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:52,017
Was it such a scary place?

127
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:59,187
By the way, what are you doing here?

128
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:03,467
You left your phone in the car.

129
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,447
Gosh, what a klutz. What a klutz.

130
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,587
I'm sorry, Director.

131
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:13,377
I made you come back here because of this.

132
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:15,777
No, it's okay.

133
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,987
Forgive me for saying this,

134
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:22,717
but I'm glad I left my phone there.

135
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:26,787
Something bad could've happened if you didn't come here.

136
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:32,437
I was able to avoid disaster since you came here.

137
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:35,117
Thank you so much.

138
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,447
I wondered if I should tell you earlier,

139
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:40,357
but this place is too remote for a woman to be alone.

140
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:42,347
Why don't you move somewhere else?

141
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:49,257
I was thinking of moving somewhere once I adjust to work, anyway.

142
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,047
My grandmother said she'd come, too.

143
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,677
Okay. Make sure to find someplace else.

144
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:55,927
Go inside.

145
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:59,687
I'll watch you going inside. Go ahead.

146
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:01,537
Okay.

147
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,027
Thank you.

148
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,497
Oh, you have my number, right?

149
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:07,527
Yes, I do.

150
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,707
Call me immediately if something happens.

151
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:14,007
Director, thank you so much.

152
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,797
I'll never forget your kindness.

153
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:29,097
   

154
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:33,277
My gosh, why are they all so expensive?

155
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,987
There's nothing for me out of all these places?

156
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,047
Hello, Director.

157
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,727
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Yes.

158
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,347
Did you find a new place, by chance?

159
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:58,077
No. I was looking into it now, but it's all expensive.

160
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:02,687
There's no place for me in the entire Seoul.

161
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:06,437
There's a place I know. Do you want to check it out?

162
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:08,947
A place you know?

163
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,637
My goodness. Gosh.

164
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:23,877
Do you like the room?

165
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:27,337
Yes, I really like it.

166
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,267
It gets a lot of sun, too.

167
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:34,587
You're letting us rent this nice room for so cheap.

168
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:39,007
Looks like the owners are so nice, too.

169
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,137
I'm so grateful.

170
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:45,317
I'm signing the contract since Pil Sung asked me.

171
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,527
I heard you're a member of his film crew.

172
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:49,267
"Pil Sung"?

173
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,927
Is this Director Go's place, then?

174
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,817
Yes, Director Go is my son.

175
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,367
Aigoo. Hello, Ma'am.

176
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:04,867
I had no idea this was his place.

177
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:08,167
He's such a good person.

178
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,887
You raised your son so well.

179
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:17,327
I'll live quietly and cleanly here.

180
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:21,557
When can I move in, then?

181
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:25,947
Well, you could even move in today. It's vacant anyway.

182
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,897
I heard your current neighborhood is dangerous.

183
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:31,177
Don't stay there and move immediately.

184
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:34,547
Okay. Thank you so much.

185
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,537
Aigoo, thank you so much.

186
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:39,747
Keep looking around. I'll leave now.

187
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:42,097
- Take your time. 
 - Thank you.

188
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,437
Grandma, this place is so nice.

189
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,807
The director is an angel.

190
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:55,387
He hired me when I had no experience and he got me a place like this, too.

191
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,907
Yes.

192
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,427
Gosh, how did she carry all this heavy stuff?

193
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:05,587
She loves her granddaughter so much.

194
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:08,447
The soy sauce crab and shrimp are so good.

195
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,057
This would be amazing with rice, right?

196
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,307
Yes. Isn't it so good?

197
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:18,777
By the way, the new tenant looks oddly familiar.

198
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,957
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

199
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:23,707
How do you know a young lady from a seaside town?

200
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:28,317
- She said this was her first time in Seoul. 
 - No, I've definitely seen her somewhere.

201
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:32,397
Seon Yeong, haven't you seen her before?

202
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:36,927
I don't know. I don't think I've seen her before.

203
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,877
Director, this place looks good.

204
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,407
Perhaps since it's designated for redevelopment and vacant,

205
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:52,577
it already feels empty and eerie.

206
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,457
Yes, let's shoot here.

207
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:56,147
Okay.

208
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,467
That's Park Do Ra.

209
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:03,877
Yes, it is Park Do Ra.

210
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,850
   

211
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,857
   

212
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:26,007
"Straightforward Romance"?

213
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:28,780
I don't think I've watched this.

214
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,397
    
 Wow.

215
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:36,657
The title is speaking to my heart somehow.

216
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:41,657
Maybe I've seen it, but I forgot due to memory loss.

217
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:50,607
Let me see.

218
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:53,427
Cha Bong Soo was in it.

219
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:31,707
"Oppa, why should we break up when we love each other?

220
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,087
I'll just love you even if it's on my own.

221
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:45,417
I'll just head straight toward you."

222
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:04,167
- Do Ra. 
 - That was nothing.

223
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,047
Nothing at all.

224
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:11,047
I was enjoying the script so much that

225
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:14,947
I got sucked into it emotionally.

226
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,587
I didn't even realize...

227
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:20,647
I was acting.

228
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:28,207
B-By the way, I saw your name here.

229
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:31,397
Did you work on "Straightforward Romance," too?

230
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:35,327
This is so moving and fun.

231
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:38,857
Yes.

232
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,367
Is there something on my face?

233
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:51,467
Why are you staring at me like that?

234
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,217
It's nothing.

235
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,147
Huh?

236
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:07,957
There's nothing on it.

237
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:37,517
Is it because Ji Yeong was acting like Do Ra while reading the script?

238
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:42,437
But still, how could I think she's Do Ra?

239
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,947
No way.

240
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:49,497
No way.

241
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,740
   

242
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:03,517
My gosh, "Straightforward Romance" was a huge hit.

243
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,987
Of course. The script was so fun.

244
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,867
Huh? What's this?

245
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,637
   

246
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:20,527
"Did Park Do Ra of 'Straightforward Romance' commit suicide?"

247
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:22,187
How could this be?

248
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,917
The lead actor died?

249
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,277
But why?

250
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:28,767
   

251
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,977
What is all this?

252
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:35,447
Prostitution due to her mom's... gambling debt?

253
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,177
My goodness.

254
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:43,627
Wow, how could it be?

255
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,357
Director, Director!

256
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:57,117
Is Park Do Ra, the female lead of "Straightforward Romance," really dead?

257
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:02,227
- What did you say? 
 - Well, I saw strange articles here.

258
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,877
Did Park Do Ra really die after getting caught prostituting

259
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,667
because of her mom's gambling debt?

260
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,977
Ms. Kim Ji Yeong.

261
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:14,387
What makes you think you can talk about that?

262
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,347
Prostituting?

263
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:19,167
All of those articles are fake. They're lies.

264
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,977
She died because of people like you who talked about it without knowing anything. Don't you know?

265
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:25,107
She died because of people like you who talked about it without knowing anything. Don't you know?

266
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,807
So, don't you dare talk carelessly about it.

267
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,677
Why is he getting so angry?

268
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,897
It's not like I made things up.

269
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:43,617
I was just asking because I didn't know.

270
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:48,387
Does he find me annoying?

271
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:54,777
I'm so, so grateful you joined our store. It's such a relief.

272
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,597
Don't mention it. I should be thanking you.

273
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,417
I'm just a housewife who can only come half of the month.

274
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,107
But you let me work somewhere so comfortable.

275
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:09,197
It'd take all night listing the things I'm grateful toward you.

276
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:11,387
I didn't do anything.

277
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:13,777
Of course, you did so much.

278
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:16,927
You sold me that nice car you barely used at such a ridiculous price.

279
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:20,467
at such a ridiculous price.

280
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:24,867
Thanks to you, Pil Sung is making good use of it.

281
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,757
I see. Pil Sung has been using that car.

282
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:34,267
Of course. He's the only one in my family who needs a car.

283
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,917
Anyway, Director Go is doing well, right?

284
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,247
He's always busy, you know.

285
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:46,217
He's directing a major mini-series. I never even get to see him.

286
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:51,157
Wow, Pil Sung is directing a mini-series? That's wonderful.

287
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,977
He doesn't have a girlfriend yet, right?

288
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:57,947
He doesn't.

289
00:20:57,947 --> 00:21:02,457
And you promised to find someone for him.

290
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:06,747
That's why I always tell him not to just date anyone.

291
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:08,327
That's good.

292
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,037
He's a major director now.

293
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,947
I should start looking for someone, then.

294
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,097
Why isn't he coming out?

295
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,687
I texted him a long time ago.

296
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:26,667
Gosh, the noodles will get bloated if they sit.

297
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:29,657
There he comes.

298
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:31,937
Aigoo.

299
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:37,887
Hello, Director.

300
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:43,057
What is it? What did you want to talk about?

301
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,197
Well, Director...

302
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:51,977
I'm so sorry about earlier today.

303
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:58,267
I spoke rudely about someone who passed so tragically.

304
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,827
- Is that what this is about? 
 - Yes.

305
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:06,997
If someone spoke rudely of someone I was close to,

306
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:11,877
I would've gotten angry and offended, too.

307
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,987
I'm sorry, Director.

308
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:16,017
It's my fault.

309
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,607
Let's stop talking about that.

310
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:24,327
I don't watch TV since I lived in the countryside,

311
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:30,667
and a while ago, I... aigoo...

312
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:34,957
I got into an accident, so I was very ill.

313
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:40,007
I didn't know what was going on since I was hospitalized for a long time.

314
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:43,307
That's why I made such a foolish mistake.

315
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:46,177
I'm so sorry, Director.

316
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:50,787
I won't ask about anything, and...

317
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,997
I won't say anything unnecessary, either.

318
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:57,907
All right.

319
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:00,507
I'm sorry I flew off the handle.

320
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:02,627
Well, then...

321
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:05,457
Gosh. Hold on, Director.

322
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:07,757
Just one moment.

323
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:18,757
I prepared this as an apology.

324
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:21,497
Please take it.

325
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:26,587
I'll go now, then.

326
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:52,017
How is a young lady so generous?

327
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:57,097
She ran a restaurant with her grandmother in the countryside. That's why.

328
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:59,807
Mom. Not only generous, but it's really tasty.

329
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:03,057
It's way tastier than the stuff you buy.

330
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:05,447
She can start her own restaurant.

331
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:07,477
Yes, tell her to do that.

332
00:24:07,477 --> 00:24:09,697
She'll get tons of customers if she served this.

333
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:12,297
She shouldn't be wasting her talent.

334
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:17,057
Pil Sung, she's good at her job, too, right?

335
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,487
Yes.

336
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,917
They say a glimpse tells you everything.

337
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,667
We got a good tenant this time.

338
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,177
By the way, isn't it so strange?

339
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:35,417
Why does she look so familiar?

340
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,287
You mean, Ji Yeong?

341
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:44,227
Yes, so I asked her if we'd met somewhere.

342
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:47,807
But she said she's never seen me before. She said no.

343
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:51,917
I suppose you met someone who looks like her.

344
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,957
Yes, I think so.

345
00:24:54,957 --> 00:25:00,887
Anyway, it's such a relief we got someone nice, thanks to Pil Sung.

346
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:02,817
We're thanking Pil Sung again?

347
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:06,147
Everything is always about Pil Sung with you, isn't it?

348
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:11,337
- You're right. You're right. 
 - It's true. He did this.

349
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,277
Are you okay?

350
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,787
Well, yes.

351
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,307
There's a step. Be careful.

352
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:00,947
Yes, thank you.

353
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:04,477
By the way, why are you out so late?

354
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:09,947
Well, I got some snacks because I felt hungry.

355
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:13,907
By the way, do you work out at this hour?

356
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:18,617
Yes, I was so full from eating too much of your delicious noodles.

357
00:26:18,617 --> 00:26:22,127
Was it really delicious? Do you mean it?

358
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:25,257
Yes, my whole family enjoyed it. Thank you.

359
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:27,107
I'm so glad.

360
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:32,607
I worried it wouldn't be enough because I made so little.

361
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:36,027
I'll make them again soon. I'll make more.

362
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,407
It's okay. It's late. You should go inside.

363
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,947
I'll circle around one more time.

364
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:41,987
O-Okay.

365
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:47,027
Fighting, Director!

366
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:57,527
My gosh, how does he run so lightly and bouncy?

367
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:01,807
My heart...

368
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:06,167
Why is it beating so fast?

369
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:27,607
My gosh, what am I thinking about?

370
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:32,447
Did I fall for him by chance?

371
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:47,017
Hey, Grandma.

372
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,657
Is everything okay with you?

373
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:55,577
Everything's fine, but my heart is racing for some reason.

374
00:27:55,577 --> 00:27:58,347
Your heart is racing?

375
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:01,227
You went to Seoul to work.

376
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:04,157
You can't fall for a man already

377
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:07,167
and get excited about it.

378
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,287
No, it's not like that.

379
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,047
Don't try to fool me.

380
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:12,837
Grandma knows everything.

381
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,417
I need to go to bed, Grandma.

382
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:18,217
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

383
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:22,237
Does she have a superpower or something?

384
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:24,667
All I said was that my heart was racing.

385
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:27,857
How did she know I fell for a man?

386
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:33,007
What? Do I have a crush on the Director right now?

387
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:44,157
   

388
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:47,447
- Se Ra sent this? 
 - Yeah, Se Ra.

389
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:52,907
Thank you.

390
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:03,187
Gosh, she's so pretty.

391
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:04,587
She looks prettier in person.

392
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:08,017
Hello. Thank you.

393
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:11,147
Hello, Director.

394
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:14,477
Long time no see, Se Ra. Thank you for the coffee truck.

395
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:17,077
You didn't have to do all this, though.

396
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:21,247
It's your first mini-series. I can't even do this?

397
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:23,707
We've worked together before, too.

398
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:26,857
I appreciate your support. We'll enjoy it.

399
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:32,677
Director, we have something to talk about, you know.

400
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:36,657
I'm sorry, Se Ra.

401
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:39,517
I can't afford to see someone right now.

402
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:44,777
I hope we meet again as colleagues in the next project.

403
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:47,337
You rejected me just now, right?

404
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:49,867
I'm sorry. Thanks for the coffee truck today.

405
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:52,857
I'll return the favor when you're filming next time.

406
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,067
W-Wait...

407
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,737
What? You've got to be kidding me.

408
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:01,907
Why is he being so cold to me?

409
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:05,867
Could he do this just because he's tall and handsome?

410
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:08,307
I guess he could.

411
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:21,857
What did I see just now?

412
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:28,207
Did the Director reject the top actress, the queen of rom-com, Se Ra?

413
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:34,657
He even rejected Se Ra, who's so pretty and cool.

414
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:37,827
How did I dare to have a crush on him?

415
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:40,827
I can't do this.

416
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:45,417
I'm nowhere near Se Ra.

417
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,517
How dare I want the Director?

418
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:54,917
Yes, from now on, he's not a man.

419
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,150
He's a rock. A rock.

420
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,140
   

421
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,847
Mom, I'm here.

422
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:08,437
Ma Ri, you came.

423
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:12,307
Gosh, Ma Ri. Long time no see.

424
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,067
Hello, Ahjumma.

425
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,917
Yes. You've been well, too, right?

426
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,027
- Yes. 
 - Gosh.

427
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,957
Right. Say hello, Lulu.

428
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:23,307
Hello, Ahjumma.

429
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:27,387
Hey... Hello, Lulu.

430
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:31,977
So cute.

431
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,707
Hey, Pil Sung.

432
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:38,797
You're already here?

433
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:42,357
I'm all done, too. I'll be out.

434
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:44,057
P-Pil Sung is here?

435
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:46,687
Yes, he said he gets off work early today.

436
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,717
I asked him if he could pick me up, and he's already here.

437
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:51,367
Who's Pil Sung?

438
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,537
He's my son.

439
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:58,347
Thinking about it, you never got to meet him.

440
00:31:58,347 --> 00:32:00,437
He's old enough to be your oppa.

441
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,737
Do you want to say hello to him?

442
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:05,367
Oppa? Yes, sounds good.

443
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:07,757
M-Ma Ri, Seon Yeong...

444
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:10,617
Next time. Let's make it official next time.

445
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:13,597
Mom, we can say hi now. Why do it later?

446
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,867
I'll say hello to her son.

447
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:19,337
- Let's go, Ahjumma. 
 - Yes, you should meet him since he's here.

448
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:21,847
What do I do?

449
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:24,017
Pil Sung, you were already here.

450
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:25,977
Pil Sung

451
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,287
- Hey, Mom. 
 - You came early.

452
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:30,717
- You must be tired. 
 - Not as much as you.

453
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:33,307
- Let's go. 
 - Yes. Right...

454
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:36,277
 Are you okay? 

455
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,817
 He's that Oppa. That Oppa. 

456
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:43,567
- Let's go. 
 - Yes. Right...

457
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,157
Say hello, Pil Sunf. She's Soo Yeon's daughter.

458
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:50,397
Oh, really? Hello.

459
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,497
Hello.

460
00:32:56,267 --> 00:33:00,827
Haven't we met before, by the way?

461
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:02,297
Where?

462
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,407
I don't think so. I'm sure this is your first time.

463
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,887
This isn't the first time.

464
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:10,837
I saw Oppa once before a while ago.

465
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:15,547
You dropped your doll in front of the subway station, right?

466
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:17,047
The lemon candy.

467
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:22,557
Yes, I gave you lemon candy.

468
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:27,267
My goodness, you've met before?

469
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,667
That's so crazy.

470
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:31,367
 The man of fate Ma Ri was talking about... 

471
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,107
 - was Pil Sung?  
 - What's your name?

472
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:35,617
- Ma Ri. 
  - What's going on right now? 

473
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,307
See you again, Ma Ri.

474
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,067
- Okay. 
 - Bye, Ma Ri.

475
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,687
Soo Yeon, I'm leaving!

476
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,287
Yes, see you.

477
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,567
Bye, Ahjumma. See you again.

478
00:33:53,707 --> 00:34:00,297
Mom, Mom! That man of fate I've been looking for is that Oppa!

479
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:03,227
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

480
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:07,097
No, he remembered me, too. The lemon candy.

481
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:10,007
He remembered me, too. What do I do?

482
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:15,137
Mom, you told me... that we'd meet again if it were meant to be.

483
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:18,127
He and I must be meant to be.

484
00:34:18,127 --> 00:34:19,777
How could we meet like this again?

485
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:24,457
You were right, Mom! What do I do? What do I do?

486
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:31,397
 Dad! Dad! Dad! 

487
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:35,117
Ma Ri, what's going on?

488
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:38,547
Dad, don't be shocked hearing this.

489
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:42,527
Princess Ma Ri, what's this about now?

490
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:47,437
Dad, I finally met the man of fate I've been looking for.

491
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:51,637
W-What? The man of fate? Really?

492
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:53,187
Dad, guess who it is.

493
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:56,437
My fate has been waiting just around the corner.

494
00:34:56,437 --> 00:35:00,477
Just around the corner? Who could it be?

495
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:03,437
It was Seon Yeong ahjumma's son.

496
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:06,537
It was Pil Sung Oppa.

497
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,247
What did you say? Pil Sung?

498
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:14,937
The man you've been looking for was Pil Sung?

499
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:18,307
Honey, is that really true?

500
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:20,927
Well, yes. Apparently.

501
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:24,887
By the way, do you know him, too? Have you met him?

502
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:27,697
Of course, I do. I've met him, too.

503
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,267
Really? Is that true?

504
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,727
Dad, you should help me, then.

505
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:36,677
I want to marry Pil Sung Oppa.

506
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,887
Let me marry him.

507
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,467
Ma Ri.

508
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,057
I know you're powerful. You can do anything.

509
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,887
Let Pil Sung and I get married, Dad.

510
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:49,067
What did you say?

511
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,697
- You mean it, right? 
 - Yes.

512
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:25,657
 Why Pil Sung out of all people? 

513
00:36:25,657 --> 00:36:29,277
 This makes no sense. It can't be. 

514
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:31,767
 Ma Ri and Pil Sung... 

515
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:35,657
 This can never happen. Never. 

516
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:17,517
 Oppa, I'm so happy we met again. 

517
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:20,217
 I missed you so much. 

518
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:22,727
 Do Ra. 

519
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:26,187
 I did, too. 

520
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:30,437
 I missed you so much, too. 

521
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,457
Hello, Director!

522
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:14,917
The weather's so nice today.

523
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,147
The breeze is so nice.

524
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,297
What's wrong?

525
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:32,027
It's nothing.

526
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:43,267
Gosh, Kim Ji Yeong. You fool.

527
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,257
What's wrong with you?

528
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:49,107
Since you stared at him so longingly,

529
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:52,437
he got scared and ran away.

530
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:54,877
Don't ever look at him like that again.

531
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,557
Look down in front of him.

532
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:02,577
Gosh, I brought this all the way from the Alps.

533
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,947
You worked so hard.

534
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:08,747
I stopped by because I was bored.

535
00:39:15,517 --> 00:39:17,257
Ji Yeong.

536
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:20,677
Yes, Director.

537
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:29,857
Do you have a relative in Seoul, by chance?

538
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:33,647
Relative? No, I don't.

539
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:39,737
It's just me and my grandma in this whole world.

540
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:47,017
And this is my first time in Seoul, too.

541
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:51,167
What is it, by the way?

542
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:54,457
It's nothing. Get back to work.

543
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,137
Okay.

544
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:05,867
I'm sorry!

545
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:10,297
 Yes, Ji Yeong didn't know Park Do Ra at all. 

546
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:13,427
 So, there's no way she's related to her. 

547
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:18,617
 But why do I keep thinking she's Do Ra? 

548
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:23,907
 Is it because I've been thinking about Do Ra lately? 

549
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,920
   

550
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,394
- Mom! 
 - You scared me. Seriously.

551
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:03,374
Did you use my card? What cost more than two million?

552
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,734
Did you buy all this with my card?

553
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:11,074
What can I do? I need to have a career, but I don't have a proper outfit.

554
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:13,744
Should I look like a beggar, then?

555
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:17,964
But still, how could you spend two million instantly? Are you crazy?

556
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:19,764
I didn't buy designer clothes or anything.

557
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:23,034
I just bought some reasonably priced clothes.

558
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:25,914
You should've packed my clothes and purses when we moved out of Cheongdam-dong.

559
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:28,924
I wouldn't have to buy clothes like this.

560
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:33,464
Mom, have a seat. Have a seat, I said!

561
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:41,334
I should've packed? It said "seized" on it. How could I?

562
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:45,154
Mom, with my monthly salary, I pay the rent, utility bills,

563
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:48,994
and make a payment for your debt, then I have this much left. That's what I live off.

564
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:52,084
How could you spend two million now?

565
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:56,604
When will we find a long-term lease place? Don't you have any sense?

566
00:41:56,604 --> 00:42:01,054
How dare you say that to someone who raised you?

567
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:04,894
I dressed you in the best clothes, fed you the best food,

568
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:07,194
and let you not worry about money.

569
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,394
How dare you flip out for using your card a few times?

570
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,834
What did you do for me?

571
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:16,384
We lived off Do Ra's hard-earned money. Why take credit for it?

572
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:17,964
You little bastard.

573
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:21,464
Hey, who helped Do Ra to make money like that?

574
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:24,744
Gosh, there's no point in raising a child.

575
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:29,274
I've been living in a cold jail cell for over two years!

576
00:42:29,274 --> 00:42:32,914
But you flip out because I bought some clothes?

577
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:35,704
Seriously! Do Ra!

578
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:39,224
I should've died with Do Ra.

579
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:42,044
Do Ra, you should've taken me with you! Why did you leave by yourself?

580
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:44,894
Why did you leave by yourself? Why?

581
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:49,664
Seriously, it's so unfair. So unfair.

582
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:53,464
It's so unfair! Seriously!

583
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:57,964
What happened to me? Seriously!

584
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:08,964
Seriously, what's wrong with my mom?

585
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,944
How am I supposed to live now?

586
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:05,014
Mom, get up. Mom.

587
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:09,084
Get up, Mom! Get up. Get up.

588
00:44:10,894 --> 00:44:12,884
What?

589
00:44:14,014 --> 00:44:15,834
Did you drink?

590
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:21,714
Are you flipping out drunkenly because I spent some money?

591
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:27,404
Mom, I pity Do Ra so much.

592
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:31,494
I pity our Do Ra so much.

593
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:35,014
I didn't realize when she was around,

594
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:37,044
but since I've been working...

595
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:40,924
I barely get by working to death for a month.

596
00:44:40,924 --> 00:44:44,814
I find it so hard. Imagine how hard it must've been for her.

597
00:44:44,814 --> 00:44:46,814
She let Do Jun study abroad,

598
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:49,884
and let you and I live lavishly.

599
00:44:49,884 --> 00:44:53,024
I took that for granted.

600
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:58,484
But I didn't do anything for her. I feel so bad about that.

601
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:00,994
You used to spend tens of millions,

602
00:45:00,994 --> 00:45:06,024
but I'm blaming you for spending two million. I hate myself for it.

603
00:45:08,564 --> 00:45:10,764
Do Sik...

604
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:20,764
Mom, you made me feel hopeless by spending two million.

605
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:22,914
Please, Mom.

606
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:24,954
Please, Mom...

607
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:30,424
She died after working like a money-making machine her whole life.

608
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:33,594
I feel so sorry for Do Ra.

609
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:36,404
I feel so bad for her. What do I do?

610
00:45:44,644 --> 00:45:47,360
Do Ra!

611
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:51,154
Do Sik, Do Sik…

612
00:46:03,384 --> 00:46:05,654
 Eel and odolbbyeo? 

613
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:07,784
 I love that. 

614
00:46:07,784 --> 00:46:09,324
 My heart is racing. 

615
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:11,404
 - What? Your heart is racing? 
 - Yes. 

616
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:15,364
 You're probably the only woman whose heart races about that stuff. 

617
00:46:40,094 --> 00:46:41,864
Do Ra...

618
00:46:51,984 --> 00:46:53,674
Do Ra.

619
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,110
Huh?

620
00:47:01,254 --> 00:47:03,164
What's wrong, Director?

621
00:47:03,164 --> 00:47:05,164
Are you okay?

622
00:47:11,584 --> 00:47:13,224
Huh?

623
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:21,904
Is it because he's drunk?

624
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:25,794
How much did he have to drink, anyway?

625
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:30,964
By the way, I think he said, "Do Ra" just now.

626
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:33,304
Did I hear that wrong?

627
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:42,694
He won't fall at that rate, will he?

628
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:46,224
Hold on, the tteokbokki...

629
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,334
Why do I keep doing this?

630
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,574
Why do I keep thinking Ji Yeong is Do Ra?

631
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,854
Why?

632
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:12,354
Why...

633
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:16,024
♫  It's been erased  ♫

634
00:48:16,024 --> 00:48:23,574
♫  The countless days and time we spent  ♫

635
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:30,284
♫  As if none of that happened  ♫

636
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:37,354
♫  The memories that I've been collecting  ♫

637
00:48:37,354 --> 00:48:43,534
♫  They are still lingering in my heart  ♫

638
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:48,514
It's been a while.

639
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:53,964
Do Ra.

640
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:57,944
Are you doing well?

641
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:02,704
I'm doing well, too.

642
00:49:04,904 --> 00:49:06,614
But...

643
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:11,054
I think I miss you a lot.

644
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:15,484
I keep thinking a random person is you.

645
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:21,624
But don't worry.

646
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:24,264
I'll try to be well.

647
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:30,384
♫  While looking at your back  ♫

648
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,134
Do Ra,

649
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:37,694
I miss you so much.

650
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:53,554
Do Sik.

651
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:56,754
I made hangover soup with beansprouts in it.

652
00:49:56,754 --> 00:49:59,424
Eat this before going to work.

653
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:13,084
Fine.

654
00:50:13,084 --> 00:50:19,004
I'll get it together and make money somehow. And...

655
00:50:19,004 --> 00:50:21,404
I won't use your credit card.

656
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:28,334
Mom, please wait until I make enough money for a two-bedroom apartment.

657
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:30,484
That way, we can bring Do Jun back.

658
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:31,994
I'm sorry, too, Mom.

659
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:35,534
Hey, Do Sik! Eat more! Why...

660
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:45,834
Why did you leave us behind?

661
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:51,354
How are we supposed to live? How are we supposed to live?

662
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:03,774
Gosh, hurry up, Ahjumma!

663
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:05,404
You can't be so slow like that.

664
00:51:05,404 --> 00:51:07,544
Customers are rushing in right now.

665
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:08,844
Hurry up. Hurry!

666
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:10,904
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll hurry up.

667
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,224
Geez, seriously.

668
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:17,554
My back. Gosh...

669
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:20,304
My back is about to break.

670
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:22,124
I can't stretch my legs from sitting too long.

671
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:24,854
I'll get sick at this rate.

672
00:51:24,854 --> 00:51:26,914
Gosh, my legs.

673
00:51:26,914 --> 00:51:28,624
Gosh...

674
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,494
Gosh, what's all this? What's all this?

675
00:51:33,494 --> 00:51:35,524
Aigoo, aigoo...

676
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:39,624
Look around!

677
00:51:39,624 --> 00:51:43,134
Look around! Look around, Ahjussi. Look around, Ahjumma.

678
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:46,024
Look around! Look around! Look around!

679
00:51:46,024 --> 00:51:48,204
Cut. NG! NG!

680
00:51:52,044 --> 00:51:56,364
Her voice is gone due to a cold. What should we do?

681
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,054
We can't cast someone else now, right?

682
00:51:58,054 --> 00:52:02,314
We'd lose about three hours if we waited for someone else to come.

683
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,914
Can someone from the film crew do it?

684
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,714
Assistant Director.

685
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:12,394
Me?

686
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:14,834
No, I can't do it.

687
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:23,444
Well, Director, should I give it a try?

688
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,504
I went to the market a lot while running a restaurant.

689
00:52:28,504 --> 00:52:31,034
I think I could do it.

690
00:52:38,294 --> 00:52:40,774
Are you ready, Ji Yeong?

691
00:52:40,774 --> 00:52:42,754
Yes.

692
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:44,414
Stand by.

693
00:52:45,044 --> 00:52:47,124
One, two...

694
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:49,304
Ready, go!

695
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,904
Look around! Look around and pick one. Pick one.

696
00:53:06,904 --> 00:53:08,934
Look around and pick one.

697
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:10,894
5,000 for one. 7,000 for two.

698
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:13,014
Look around. Look around.

699
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:15,204
Look around and pick one. Pick one.

700
00:53:15,204 --> 00:53:17,304
Look around and pick one. Pick one.

701
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:20,674
Pick one. Pick one.

702
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:24,164
Pick one. Look around. Pick one. Pick one.

703
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:26,404
Even if a bottle of soda appears in the sea of Incheon,

704
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,354
you can't drink it without a bottle opener.

705
00:53:28,354 --> 00:53:31,524
Look around. Look around. Look around.

706
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:34,664
Look around. Look around. Look around.

707
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:36,794
Cut, okay! Nice!

708
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:52,564
Director Go, our newbie, is amazing at acting. She could be an actor.

709
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:55,364
Bring a contract, Yoon Jae. She can sign right now.

710
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:57,964
Gosh, thank you.

711
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:00,484
Ji Yeong, you did a great job.

712
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:03,724
Thank you, Ji Yeong. The shoot went well, thanks to you.

713
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:05,054
Don't mention it.

714
00:54:05,054 --> 00:54:06,784
Let's get changed.

715
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:10,134
- Assistant Director, make sure to pay her for it.
- Of course.

716
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:14,264
No, I'm okay. I don't need money.

717
00:54:14,264 --> 00:54:17,724
Come on. You need to get paid for your work.

718
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:24,724
Well, if you insist... I'll accept it gladly.

719
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:32,794
By the way, Director, I felt so nervous before I started,

720
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:36,084
but it was so fun once I was doing it.

721
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:37,974
Why is it so fun?

722
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:42,674
Hire me again if you need me later.

723
00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:44,614
I want to do it again.

724
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,584
 Let's move to the next location. 

725
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,324
Okay.

726
00:54:56,674 --> 00:54:58,484
Director!

727
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,924
Director, try some of this.

728
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,874
- What is it? 
 - They're pupas.

729
00:55:04,874 --> 00:55:06,974
You have no idea how nutty they are.

730
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:09,884
They were seasoned just right, too.

731
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:14,064
 You don't know how nutty they are. 

732
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:17,114
They were perfectly seasoned, too.

733
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:23,474
Put that away. I don't eat stuff like that.

734
00:55:24,244 --> 00:55:28,034
Gosh, I lost all the precious pupas.

735
00:55:29,424 --> 00:55:32,874
He could've just said no if he didn't want it.

736
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:36,194
Is he acting superior right now?

737
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:44,924
Seriously, what's with Ji Yeong?

738
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,224
She's driving me crazy.

739
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:50,084
No.

740
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:52,654
Anyone could've said that.

741
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:56,314
Anyone could've said the pupas were seasoned well.

742
00:55:56,314 --> 00:56:00,034
She's not the weird one. You are. You are!

743
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,770
♫  Why are you forcing something that's not even complete?  ♫

744
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:09,300
♫  I want nobody, nobody but you  ♫

745
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,790
♫  I want nobody, nobody but you  ♫

746
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,200
♫  I don't want anyone else  ♫

747
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,020
♫  I don't want anyone who is not you  ♫

748
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,180
♫  I want nobody, nobody but you  ♫

749
00:56:35,204 --> 00:56:38,874
W-What was all that?

750
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:43,454
What was that image I just thought of?

751
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:46,434
What was all that?

752
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:13,994
What's all this?

753
00:57:13,994 --> 00:57:16,564
This front yard.

754
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:20,594
It looks just like the one from the image just now.

755
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:25,124
Have I been here before?

756
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:32,904
What's going on?

757
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:48,604
Ji Yeong, what's wrong? What are you doing here?

758
00:57:48,604 --> 00:57:53,154
Well... The thing is...

759
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,694
Director, something strange happened just now.

760
00:57:57,694 --> 00:57:59,544
Something strange?

761
00:58:00,704 --> 00:58:05,814
I think I must've lived here in my previous life.

762
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:08,374
What do you mean...

763
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:12,444
I was making ramen with the TV on

764
00:58:12,444 --> 00:58:15,374
and they played No. 1 pop songs from the past.

765
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:17,624
They played Wonder Girls' "Nobody,"

766
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:23,300
but I remembered a young man

767
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,340
with curly hair dancing to it in this yard.

768
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:35,894
What did you say?

769
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:39,094
Is that true?

770
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:43,984
Yes. I didn't make it up. It's true.

771
00:58:43,984 --> 00:58:47,714
I don't know why I remembered that, either.

772
00:58:47,714 --> 00:58:54,064
I really saw a curly-haired young man dancing to that song here.

773
00:59:01,564 --> 00:59:07,774
Thinking about it, I think he looked kind of like you.

774
00:59:07,774 --> 00:59:10,544
- My gosh. 
 - What's with you?

775
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:12,354
Who are you?

776
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:15,454
Who are you, exactly?

777
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:20,614
Gosh, what are you doing, Director?

778
00:59:20,614 --> 00:59:23,344
I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

779
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:25,524
What are you doing?

780
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,494
I'm sorry.

781
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:40,144
I'm sorry.

782
00:59:47,454 --> 00:59:50,884
Why is he scaring me like that?

783
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:12,904
 - Geez, you scared me! 
 - I remembered a young man 

784
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:17,014
 with curly hair dancing to it in this yard. 

785
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:22,084
Yes, only Do Ra and I know about that.

786
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:24,554
No one else knows about it.

787
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,964
But how does Ji Yeong...

788
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:29,914
Yes.

789
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:32,724
I haven't been acting weird.

790
01:00:34,084 --> 01:00:35,724
If so...

791
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:38,984
is Ji Yeong Park Do Ra?

792
01:00:41,374 --> 01:00:44,694
No, there's no way.

793
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:48,044
Do Ra is dead.

794
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,964
She's a totally different person.

795
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:54,404
What are you thinking right now?

796
01:00:55,214 --> 01:00:58,184
Everything she said is nonsense.

797
01:00:58,184 --> 01:00:59,704
Complete nonsense.

798
01:00:59,704 --> 01:01:03,344
It's all nonsense! Nonsense!

799
01:01:25,194 --> 01:01:26,694
My gosh!

800
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:36,944
Ji Yeong! Are you okay?

801
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:40,114
- Ji Yeong!
 - Are you okay? Ji Yeong!

802
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:43,024
Ji Yeong.

803
01:01:43,024 --> 01:01:46,004
Ji Yeong, are you okay? Ji Yeong!

804
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:50,204
Ji Yeong, wake up. Ji Yeong!

805
01:01:50,204 --> 01:01:54,200
   

806
01:02:08,794 --> 01:02:11,804
What condition is she in? Did you get the test results?

807
01:02:11,804 --> 01:02:13,844
Yes, nothing was wrong with the results.

808
01:02:13,844 --> 01:02:16,004
You don't have to worry.

809
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:21,314
But why isn't she waking up? You said nothing is wrong with her.

810
01:02:21,314 --> 01:02:24,604
She'll wake up soon. It's because she's on tranquilizer right now.

811
01:02:24,604 --> 01:02:27,444
I see. Thank you.

812
01:02:31,434 --> 01:02:33,374
What a relief, Director.

813
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:37,534
I was so scared, thinking something happened to her.

814
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,294
I'll bring her back when she wakes up.

815
01:02:39,294 --> 01:02:41,584
Get back on set and tidy things up.

816
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:44,314
Okay. We'll get going, then.

817
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:45,884
Let's go.

818
01:03:38,474 --> 01:03:41,364
Why am I doing this to Ji Yeong?

819
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:43,594
Why?

820
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:46,280
I miss Do Ra a lot, but still...

821
01:03:46,904 --> 01:03:49,494
What am I doing right now?

822
01:03:52,134 --> 01:03:56,534
 I think I must've lived here in my previous life. 

823
01:03:56,534 --> 01:04:01,140
 I remembered a young man 

824
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,000
 with curly hair dancing to it in this yard. 

825
01:04:09,924 --> 01:04:12,084
Kim Ji Yeong, that woman...

826
01:04:13,094 --> 01:04:15,444
She's too suspicious.

827
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:17,194
I think...

828
01:04:18,244 --> 01:04:19,824
Yes.

829
01:04:20,744 --> 01:04:23,454
I need to find out who she is.

830
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:45,060


831
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:30,274
 You're my star, and I'm your moon. 

832
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:46,014
♫  You can't forget just because you try  ♫

833
01:05:46,014 --> 01:05:51,094
♫  You can't erase things just because you try  ♫

834
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:53,704
   

835
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,744
   

836
01:05:56,744 --> 01:06:00,834
♫  The time we spent together  ♫

837
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:07,524
♫  As if none of that happened  ♫

838
01:06:07,524 --> 01:06:14,754
♫  The memories that I've been collecting  ♫

839
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:21,804
♫  They are still lingering in my heart  ♫

840
01:06:21,804 --> 01:06:29,464
♫  Just like a moment from a season  ♫

841
01:06:29,464 --> 01:06:34,114
 I heard Ji Yeong was in a serious accident about two years ago. 

842
01:06:34,114 --> 01:06:37,144
 J-Ji Yeong's accident? 

843
01:06:37,144 --> 01:06:39,314
 What do you mean, a strange rumor? 

844
01:06:39,314 --> 01:06:41,584
 She wasn't the Ji Yeong we knew. 

845
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:43,794
 She acted like a completely different person, too. 

846
01:06:43,794 --> 01:06:46,904
 Park Do Ra's mom, Ms. Baek Mi Ja. Could you tell me where she lives? 

847
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:51,134
 How could there be a coincidence like this? If that's true... 

848
01:06:51,134 --> 01:06:53,374
 When will the result come out?
