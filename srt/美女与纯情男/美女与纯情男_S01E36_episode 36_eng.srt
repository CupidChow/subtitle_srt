1
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:49,605
   

2
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,465
Hey, Director Go.

3
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,465
How dare you come in here?

4
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:03,485
I'm here to see Ma Ri.

5
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:05,665
What did you say?

6
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,025
You're here to see Ma Ri?

7
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,675
I can't believe this.

8
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:14,015
Who says you can?

9
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:17,515
By chance, did that woman Jang Soo Yeon call you?

10
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:22,095
She's no longer a part of our family.

11
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:24,765
She got kicked out of this house.

12
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:27,255
So, get out of here immediately.

13
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:30,515
Don't try to act like you're Ma Ri's older brother.

14
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:35,065
 Jin Dan, what are you doing to our guest? 

15
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:39,735
I called Director Go.

16
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,705
You called him?

17
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,085
Why?

18
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:46,255
Director Go, Ma Ri's room is on the second floor.

19
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:49,045
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

20
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:57,385
What's wrong with Hyung, anyway?

21
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,625
My gosh, who's that?

22
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,305
Isn't that Pil Sung? Did he really call Pil Sung?

23
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:04,915
Mom, what's going on right now?

24
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:07,965
Looks like your brother can't see straight because of Ma Ri.

25
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:12,035
She looked for Pil Sung without drinking a drop of water all day.

26
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:14,055
But still, how could he call him?

27
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,895
He's Soo Yeon's son, who she's been hiding for over 30 years.

28
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:19,065
Is he out of his mind?

29
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,135
Does he not have any self-respect?

30
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:33,965
D-Director Go, what brings you here?

31
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,765
I called him over.

32
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,835
How's Ma Ri?

33
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:42,865
She keeps sleeping because she has no energy.

34
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,405
Ma Ri...

35
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,585
Pil Sung is here.

36
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,095
Ma Ri,

37
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,945
I'm here.

38
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,845
Are you sleeping?

39
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,915
Ma Ri, do you recognize me?

40
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:22,395
- Mom. 
 - Yes, Ma Ri.

41
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:26,165
I think I'm dreaming.

42
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:30,165
Pil Sung Oppa is in front of me.

43
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:35,545
Ma Ri, you aren't dreaming.

44
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:39,285
Pil Sung Oppa came here to see you.

45
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,485
Really?

46
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,645
Mom, help me up.

47
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:46,515
Yes, Ma Ri.

48
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,925
See?

49
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,755
It's really Pil Sung Oppa, right?

50
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:58,735
Oppa.

51
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,445
Ma Ri.

52
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:05,255
Why are you crying? Huh?

53
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:17,175
It's just that seeing you makes me cry for some reason.

54
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,855
Gosh, why are you crying?

55
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:28,235
Ma Ri, where does it hurt so much?

56
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,095
Tell me.

57
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,165
Oppa, it...

58
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,560
it hurts so much here.

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,300
Right here.

60
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,845
It feels stuck, and I can't even drink water.

61
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,215
I didn't know you were this sick.

62
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:55,765
Because I heard you can't eat anything, I brought your favorite, strawberry ice cream.

63
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,210
Really?

64
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,670
The one we had together last time?

65
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,805
I think I can eat what you brought.

66
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,475
I'll eat it.

67
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,275
Ma Ri, hold on.

68
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,940
You haven't had a drop of water.

69
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,525
Cold food might upset your stomach.

70
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:16,595
- Why don't we have some water first? 
 - Yes, Ma Ri.

71
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:19,805
Let's drink water first, as Chairman said.

72
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:22,815
Okay.

73
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,625
M-Ma Ri, did you just drink water?

74
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,055
Did it go down?

75
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,475
Yes.

76
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:50,385
I swallowed it without realizing it.

77
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,505
Let's take another sip now.

78
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:07,725
I swallowed it again.

79
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:11,845
Yes, thank you, Ma Ri. Thank you.

80
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:15,905
Oppa, give me the ice cream now.

81
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:19,895
Auntie, look at Ma Ri.

82
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,475
She threw up everything, including water, until just now.

83
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:26,425
How could she eat porridge and ice cream just because Pil Sung told her to?

84
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:30,525
Maybe they plotted this, trying to change Chairman Gong's mind.

85
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,625
I know. Dr. Kim couldn't even do it.

86
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,305
But how can Director Go... He's not even a doctor.

87
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:41,465
How could he fix her when she couldn't even drink water?

88
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:45,875
Auntie, I think they're putting on a show. A show.

89
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,505
A show?

90
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:57,485
Director Go, thank you so much for today.

91
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,365
I'm sorry about earlier today.

92
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:03,465
I took it too far. I'm sorry.

93
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,095
No, it's okay.

94
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:15,105
If you need me for Ma Ri again, call me any time.

95
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:19,805
I'll help as much as I can until she recovers.

96
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,905
Thank you, Director Go.

97
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,465
I'll get going now, then.

98
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,545
Hey, Director Go.

99
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:00,405
You think I don't know what you're plotting?

100
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:04,665
Your birth mother, Jang Soo Yeon, shamelessly came back using her daughter as an excuse.

101
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:07,085
What is it that you want?

102
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:12,335
Are you trying to secure a position using slow Ma Ri now that you're in this situation?

103
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,845
Watch your mouth.

104
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:24,295
If you talk about Ma Ri like that again, I won't forgive you.

105
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,115
Understand?

106
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:36,555
Hey, Go Pil Sung! You think I'd let you be?

107
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:41,595
I won't let him get away with this.

108
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,475
Answer properly.

109
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:49,525
You're scheming using Ma Ri, aren't you?

110
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,345
Pardon?

111
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,125
What are you talking about?

112
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,485
Who are you trying to fool?

113
00:08:55,485 --> 00:09:01,435
Why did you bring your son here using Ma Ri as an excuse?

114
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:03,795
How could you be this shameless?

115
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,445
That's not true.

116
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:09,015
I asked Director Go to come here.

117
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,015
Soo Yeon has nothing to do with this.

118
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:16,755
Chairman Gong, what were you thinking?

119
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:20,745
I know Ma Ri's sick, but who's Go Pil Sung?

120
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:24,305
He's the son of this cunning thing she has been hiding.

121
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,915
What was I supposed to do? Ma Ri is sick.

122
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:30,155
I can call anyone as long as Ma Ri gets better.

123
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,965
So, don't yell at Soo Yeon.

124
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:40,485
Auntie, Chairman Gong must be crazy.

125
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:44,585
How could he defend Soo Yeon of all people?

126
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,375
   

127
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:08,285
 If you talk about Ma Ri like that again, I won't forgive you. 

128
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,445
What am I supposed to do with Go Pil Sung?

129
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:37,075
Oh, okay. 
    

130
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:43,065
Chief.

131
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,145
Chief!

132
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,175
 Yes, President Gong. 

133
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:55,355
Looking at the script, there's a raining scene in Scene #8.

134
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:59,245
But it doesn't have to rain here.

135
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:02,285
It's so expensive to call a water truck. Why should we?

136
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,995
And look at this here.

137
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:09,355
Why are there so many extras here?

138
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:11,565
Tell them to remove this, okay?

139
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,375
And lastly, the ending scene.

140
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:18,075
Why go to Jeju-do just to shoot the ending scene?

141
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:21,405
Are they crazy? It costs too much.

142
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:24,935
Are they going on a vacation using the shoot as an excuse?

143
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,925
If they want to go to Jeju-do so badly, tell them to spend their money.

144
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:32,955
They don't care because it's not their money.

145
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:40,865
Hey, tell Director Go everything I just said.

146
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,925
- Understand? 
 - President Gong.

147
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:48,495
The director and writer said they needed to go to Jeju-do.

148
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:52,415
Chief Yun, who pays your salary?

149
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:56,415
Got it. I'll tell them that.

150
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:14,785
Go Pil Sung... nothing will go the way you want.

151
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:17,945
Let's wait and see who wins.

152
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,815
Even if this drama fails,

153
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:26,975
I'll risk my everything to kick you out.

154
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:32,700
You must be busy writing the script.

155
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,890
What brings you here?

156
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:40,635
I came because there's something you need to know.

157
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,735
Feel free to tell me.

158
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:49,735
It's been over 20 years since I worked in the TV industry.

159
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,535
I've worked with many production companies, but this never happened.

160
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:58,505
He told us to kill the male lead because he doesn't like him.

161
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:01,775
And he told us to make someone else the male lead.

162
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:06,475
He also told us to remove a crucial scene.

163
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:13,035
Of course, if the production budget is too high, I should discuss it as the writer.

164
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:20,095
But I can't tolerate someone who has no knowledge butchering our drama.

165
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:24,705
TV dramas are public art.

166
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:28,535
He stomps our pride as artists.

167
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,655
Chairman.

168
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:39,735
Do you also think art can be controlled by money and power?

169
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,775
Writer Kim, I understand what you mean.

170
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:48,835
I'll look into it and take care of it.

171
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:57,045
It's about time Go Pil Sung arrives.

172
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:02,455
Is he plotting with Kim Oh Gyeong to fight me together?

173
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,015
Fine.

174
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,695
I'll destroy all of them.

175
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:15,195
Yes, Secretary Jo.

176
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,995
What did you say?

177
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:22,265
Chairman wants to see me?

178
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,245
What do you think you're doing?

179
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:39,205
What's wrong, Hyung? I mean, Chairman?

180
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:43,415
What did you do exactly to have Writer Kim come to see me here?

181
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,880
Writer Kim?

182
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,300
That woman came here?

183
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:56,995
Hyung, Writer Kim led the protest defending Go Pil Sung.

184
00:14:56,995 --> 00:15:00,825
She's really nasty and hopeless, Hyung.

185
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,785
There's no point in discussing this.

186
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:05,735
Leave Go Go Entertainment as of today.

187
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:09,595
What did you say?

188
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:11,455
Hyung!

189
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,015
Fine.

190
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:28,935
I quit.

191
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,775
I quit. I quit.

192
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:33,145
I quit!

193
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,715
Gosh, Jin Dan. What's wrong?

194
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:39,715
- What's this now? 
 - Hyung fired me as the temporary CEO of Go Go Entertainment.

195
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:41,165
What's wrong with him?

196
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,895
Why get so angry over stuff like that?

197
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:49,435
Once you become the chairman of APP Group, you can just shut down Go Go or Goo Goo Entertainment.

198
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:52,105
Yes, you're right.

199
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:55,625
You shouldn't be worrying about little stuff like that.

200
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,675
What did he say? He didn't say anything about adopting you?

201
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:02,035
He didn't. That's why I'm going crazy.

202
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:05,235
He should just say he will. What's he waiting for?

203
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:08,795
I'm so sick of tiptoeing around him.

204
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,285
Is he even going to?

205
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:13,045
You know how uselessly he thinks too much.

206
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:16,085
He doesn't even have an option besides you. I don't know why he's doing that.

207
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:19,795
Anyway, watch your behavior for now.

208
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:22,685
You know it's all over if he dislikes you, right?

209
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,805
Okay, okay.

210
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:27,605
I understand everything, too.

211
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:33,995
Director, isn't President Gong just bullying us?

212
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:37,765
If not, why would he tell us to switch the male lead and remove scenes?

213
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,905
It makes no sense.

214
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,225
How are we supposed to work this way?

215
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:47,695
Writer Kim also flipped out and said she couldn't work like this anymore.

216
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:52,965
We won't be able to air if we keep postponing shoots.

217
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:56,535
I'll meet with President Gong and settle things today.

218
00:16:56,535 --> 00:17:00,535
Director! They want you to just go with the script.

219
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:01,965
You can go to Jeju-do, too.

220
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:04,045
No need to touch the original script.

221
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,845
- Who said that? 
 - Chairman Gong Jin Taek.

222
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:11,475
Writer Kim went directly to the Chairman and told him everything.

223
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:14,275
So, Chairman Gong got furious and

224
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:18,505
fired President Gong right there and then.

225
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:23,365
Don't worry and just follow the script from now on.

226
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,725
- Is this all true? 
 - Yes.

227
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:29,635
I got a call directly from the Chairman's secretary.

228
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,165
Writer Kim, this is Go Pil Sung.

229
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,265
You did a great thing.

230
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,675
Just focus on writing the script now.

231
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:45,825
I'll shoot well, so you don't have to worry about the set.

232
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,285
Fighting, Writer Kim!

233
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:57,365
 Jeju-do! Jeju-do! 

234
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:00,915
 Jeju-do! Jeju-do! 

235
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:13,741
   

236
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,031
I've been feeling crappy lately.

237
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:23,461
But driving with you makes me feel alive.

238
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:27,411
You're my vitamin, Ji Yeong.

239
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,031
- Vitamin? 
 - Yes.

240
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:36,481
It's kind of hot, isn't it?

241
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:39,591
Turn down the temperature.

242
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,951
Why are you so surprised?

243
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,591
Okay, Ji Yeong. Ta-da.

244
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,021
Which finger do you think it was?

245
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,571
I'm not sure.

246
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:24,081
It was this one.

247
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:28,031
I'll try it again. Guess it correctly this time.

248
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:34,311
Okay. Which finger was it?

249
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,001
T-This one.

250
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,361
Huh? Wow!

251
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:44,411
You're a genius, Ji Yeong!

252
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,541
That can't make me a genius.

253
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:50,801
Anyway, you guessed correctly. Give me a noogie.

254
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:52,371
- A noogie? 
 - Yes.

255
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:56,001
You won. Go ahead.

256
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:16,421
 You probably don't know because you lost your memory, 

257
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:18,631
 but you and President Gong... 

258
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,461
 used to be in love. 

259
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,961
 Please help me, your mom, just once. 

260
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,571
 Please spare Do Sik and Do Jun just once, Ji Yeong. 

261
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:30,001
 Spare us just once, please. 

262
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,501
 Yes. 

263
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:36,021
 I need to try hard. 

264
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:39,401
 President Gong saved us. He did. 

265
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:44,111
 He really is a good person. 

266
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:58,761
 I no longer like you. I decided to like President Gong. 

267
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:16,861
President Gong, thank you for dropping me off.

268
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,591
Get home safely, then.

269
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:23,761
I hate to leave you behind here.

270
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:27,071
I really hate having to say goodbye.

271
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,951
My gosh.

272
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:35,851
What's that?

273
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:39,591
Wait, that's Ji Yeong, isn't it?

274
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:44,301
It is. But who's that guy with her?

275
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:48,271
That's President Gong.

276
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:50,601
Why is he with Ji Yeong?

277
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,581
Is she out of her mind?

278
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,151
What about Director Gong?

279
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:58,821
What's she doing with another man? That little—

280
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,531
Mom, Mom.

281
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:04,121
I forgot to get something from the store. Let's go real quick.

282
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:06,381
Aigoo, are we just leaving?

283
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,961
Ji Yeong, what did you do just now?

284
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:32,466
I-I-I'm sorry.

285
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,686
I'm sorry.

286
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:38,481
Ji Yeong, you don't want to kiss me?

287
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,961
The thing is...

288
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:48,661
I-I-I guess I'm not ready for it yet.

289
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:52,991
Why do you need to be ready to kiss? Just do it.

290
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:55,601
Forget it.

291
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:58,961
So, you mean I was rushing things, right?

292
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,641
I should give you some time, then.

293
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,661
Yes, hello?

294
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:54,081
Director, it's me.

295
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:58,371
I'm calling you for the last time.

296
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,491
Last time?

297
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:02,971
Grandmother, what do you mean by that?

298
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:07,451
Ji Yeong fell for another man.

299
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:12,431
 So, please forget Ji Yeong now. 

300
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:17,581
I never would've thought she'd do that,

301
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,741
but she changed her mind. What can we do?

302
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:24,891
 Director, I hope you meet someone way better. 

303
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:28,471
Please forget Ji Yeong now.

304
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,051
Grandmother...

305
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:54,841
♫  Trying to forget won't make me forget  ♫

306
00:24:54,841 --> 00:25:01,771
♫  Trying to move on won't make me move on  ♫

307
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,421
Kim Ji Yeong.

308
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,711
What are you doing here? How pathetic.

309
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:09,981
Why did you come here again?

310
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,941
I can't be doing this.

311
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:21,381
♫  The memories that have been collected one by one  ♫

312
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:23,491
Ji Yeong!

313
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:26,561
♫  It will stay here in my heart  ♫

314
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,161
Ji Yeong.

315
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,865
Why did you come here?

316
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:34,271
You came to see me, right?

317
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:38,125
Why are you running away, then?

318
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,781
N-No, I didn't.

319
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:42,621
I...

320
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,501
I didn't come here to see you.

321
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:48,761
I was around the area...

322
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:53,211
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

323
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,421
I think you came to see me.

324
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:58,061
Why are you lying?

325
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:03,801
♫  You made me fall for you  ♫

326
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,541
You're right.

327
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:11,561
To be honest, I came to see you.

328
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:16,741
I think I feel...

329
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:21,581
so bad for you.

330
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:24,971
You feel bad for me?

331
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:27,961
About what?

332
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:34,091
I'm not sure, either.

333
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,731
I just...

334
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,821
I just feel bad.

335
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,701
Ji Yeong, listen carefully.

336
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,421
I'm the one who feels bad.

337
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:55,581
Once you get your memory back, you'll understand why I'm saying this.

338
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:00,961
I know I don't have the right to tell you this,

339
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:05,081
but I still need to say it now that I see you.

340
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:10,211
Don't date President Gong.

341
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,841
He's not a good person for you.

342
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:20,521
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

343
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,611
I don't think I should've come here.

344
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:29,801
Listen to me, Ji Yeong.

345
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:32,381
I'm worried you'd get hurt.

346
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:37,261
It's true you were about to get engaged to him, but you didn't like him.

347
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,361
I'll get going.

348
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:49,121
Get your memory back quickly if you are like this!

349
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:57,851
♫  The tears I've been holding back are falling  ♫

350
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:06,321
Hey! Ji Yeong, where have you been in this rain?

351
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:09,351
Oppa, what are you doing here?

352
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:13,221
I thought I saw you in front of the house, but you didn't come inside.

353
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:18,001
I stopped by somewhere.

354
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:22,971
Ji Yeong, are you seeing President Gong again, by chance?

355
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:24,351
Pardon?

356
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:28,211
Yes.

357
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,031
Since when?

358
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,481
The thing is...

359
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:35,001
It hasn't been that long.

360
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,511
Ji Yeong, do you want to get a beer with me?

361
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,331
Beer?

362
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:06,381
Ji Yeong, are you dating him because you like him?

363
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:07,781
Pardon?

364
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:11,621
Well...

365
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:16,331
Did Mom force you to date him by chance?

366
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:19,581
N-No, it's not like that.

367
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,411
Is that so?

368
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:28,005
By the way, Oppa,

369
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:31,115
I was Do Ra...

370
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:35,945
is it true I was about to get engaged to President Gong?

371
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:41,051
Did I really like him back then?

372
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:43,401
Well, I guess.

373
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:47,761
I suppose that's why you set the date for the engagement ceremony.

374
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:52,561
Yes, right.

375
00:29:56,081 --> 00:30:01,255
Ji Yeong, are you seeing him just because of that?

376
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:05,835
- Without any feelings? 
 - No, it's not like that.

377
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:10,691
Ji Yeong, the past has nothing to do with now.

378
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,581
Don't date him if you don't want to.

379
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:16,515
Don't force yourself because of the past you don't even remember.

380
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:21,161
Of course, I support you if you like him.

381
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:25,011
He's a capable and impressive person.

382
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:27,385
But honestly

383
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:31,925
I'm worried he'd find out that you're Do Ra.

384
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:37,171
So, don't force yourself to see him, okay?

385
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,735
Oppa.

386
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:44,685
From your perspective,

387
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:48,845
do you think I liked Director Go more in the past,

388
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:52,701
or President Gong more?

389
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:58,061
Do you still have feelings for Pil Sung?

390
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:02,791
No, it's not that.

391
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:08,421
To be honest, I can't forgive Pil Sung.

392
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:13,061
He knew you were Do Ra, but he kept you away from us.

393
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:25,011
Right.

394
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:33,561
Everyone, just one moment. Just one moment.

395
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:40,305
My son, Director Go Pil Sung's "House of Roses," will premier tonight at 10.

396
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:45,611
I'll give everyone here steamed eggs to celebrate.

397
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:51,611
 - Thank you! 
 - Enjoy! 

398
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:55,251
Wow, oh, my gosh.

399
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,267
 I want to ruin her face. 

400
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,781
 Would he look at me once, then? 

401
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,881
Gosh, this is so entertaining.

402
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,411
I know. It really is.

403
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:19,611
Pil Sung, I completely got sucked into it.

404
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:23,161
Pil Sung, I think this will be a huge hit.

405
00:32:23,161 --> 00:32:26,741
Hey, you're really a good director.

406
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:29,371
And Ji Yeong is such a good actor.

407
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:32,111
Is she the same person who used to be our tenant?

408
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:34,471
She's way better than Na Bi.

409
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,951
I'm sure she'll become a star from this.

410
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:40,571
Everyone is talking about her on the live chat, too.

411
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:42,771
Pil Sung, you worked so hard.

412
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:46,751
It's really entertaining. I think it'll be a huge hit.

413
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:49,651
Was it really okay? You aren't just saying that, right?

414
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:52,401
It's really good.

415
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,345
I'm really not lying.

416
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:59,001
I'm glad you all liked it.

417
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:02,005
The show turned out so well.

418
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,755
Why do you look so sad?

419
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:05,321
Is something going on?

420
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,801
Huh? Not at all.

421
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:11,771
I have a headache because I drank with everyone earlier.

422
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:15,531
Thank you for enjoying it, everyone. I'll go upstairs.

423
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,841
- Yes, well done. 
 - We enjoyed it.

424
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:24,811
By the way, the tenant lady is a really good actor.

425
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:27,651
I know. I was surprised, too.

426
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:31,315
I suppose he broke up with her

427
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:34,741
looking at his face.

428
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:37,651
Stop talking about that now.

429
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:40,131
She has nothing to do with us.

430
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,491
She's just an actor. An actor.

431
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:44,561
It's a good thing they broke up.

432
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:46,001
What if they were still together?

433
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:51,321
People would've criticized him for dating his actor.

434
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:32,021
Hey, where have you been at this hour?

435
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,881
My goodness!

436
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:38,041
Why are you so surprised?

437
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,091
Did you do something wrong?

438
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,551
W-What do you mean?

439
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:45,721
Why are you sneaking into your own house?

440
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:50,571
You're walking in like a stray cat and you got spooked as if you saw a ghost.

441
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:54,291
It's because I didn't want to wake you up.

442
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,151
Is that so?

443
00:34:57,325 --> 00:35:01,131
By the way, where have you been at the crack of dawn?

444
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:02,751
Pardon?

445
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,911
Well... The t-temple. I went to the temple.

446
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:08,141
You went to the temple?

447
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:11,751
Why all of a sudden at this hour?

448
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:15,321
M-Ma Ri has been sick lately, you know.

449
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:21,851
So, I wanted to pray for her health, our family's health, peace, and stuff like that.

450
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:27,171
And Jin Dan, I prayed for him to get adopted and lead APP Group well. That's why I went.

451
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:31,301
Our family should be happy forever.

452
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:37,271
Gosh, I'm proud of you for thinking that.

453
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:43,011
But you usually pray at dawn and come back in the morning.

454
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:46,341
But why did you leave at night and come back at dawn?

455
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:47,761
Pardon?

456
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,891
What are you two doing this early?

457
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,235
Are you going to work out?

458
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,075
Yes.

459
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:02,581
Your mom said she was coming back from the temple.

460
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:04,801
So, you weren't home last night?

461
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:07,111
What? Oh, yeah...

462
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:08,581
Get going, Jin Dan.

463
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:11,661
I'll let you rest. I need to rest, too.

464
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:20,211
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

465
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,311
You're our new tenant, right?

466
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:27,461
I finally get to meet you since I work long hours.

467
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,861
I should've introduced myself first.

468
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:33,451
Not at all. Let us know if you need anything.

469
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:35,421
Well, then...

470
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,921
By the way, just one moment, sir.

471
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:41,501
Yes?

472
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:46,391
Haven't we met somewhere, by chance? You look familiar.

473
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,891
- I'm not sure... 
 - Hyung.

474
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,901
You're Hyeon Cheol, right?

475
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:56,721
Yes, I am. W-Who are you...

476
00:36:56,721 --> 00:37:00,151
I'm Sang Gu. Jin Sang Gu.

477
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:06,541
Y-You mean the idiot Jin Sang Gu from Dotong Middle School?

478
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,531
Yes, Hyung. It's Sang Gu!

479
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:10,001
Hey!

480
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,091
Wow, Sang Gu!

481
00:37:14,091 --> 00:37:17,501
My goodness. What an amazing coincidence.

482
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:21,311
How did you meet your middle school classmate like this?

483
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:24,361
I know. It's so amazing.

484
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:27,491
Are you married?

485
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:28,801
Do you have children?

486
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:33,391
Gosh, Mother. It's rude to ask that these days.

487
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:35,141
What's the big deal?

488
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:39,531
He's Hyeon Cheol's junior and used to be our neighbor.

489
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:43,211
My wife passed five years ago due to a car accident.

490
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:45,171
I don't have any children.

491
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:48,201
My goodness.

492
00:37:48,855 --> 00:37:51,651
I shouldn't have asked you that.

493
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,261
It's okay.

494
00:37:54,405 --> 00:38:00,261
I heard you were living abroad a while ago.

495
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:04,051
Yes. I lived in the Philippines for over 30 years and just came back.

496
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,411
I'm planning to stay here from now on.

497
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:09,641
My homeland, Korea, is the best.

498
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:12,581
Yes, yes. You're still young.

499
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,551
You should have a fresh start.

500
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,741
Yes, I should.

501
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,451
My gosh.

502
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:21,741
Looks like you're seeing someone.

503
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:24,961
Yes, I suppose.

504
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,421
Gosh.

505
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,891
   

506
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:39,471
   

507
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:42,001
- Congratulations. 
 - Well done.

508
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:44,491
Thank you so much, everyone!

509
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:47,531
Let's have a team dinner tonight.

510
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:51,491
Let's invite everyone. I'll treat everyone!

511
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:56,251
 - Kim Oh Gyeong! Kim Oh Gyeong! 
 - Writer! 

512
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,551
 - Kim Oh Gyeong! Kim Oh Gyeong! 
 - Writer! 

513
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:02,101
 - Kim Oh Gyeong! 
 - Writer! 

514
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:06,118
Do Joon! Over here.

515
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,710
What is it all of a sudden?

516
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,740
Is something going on at home?

517
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,790
Gosh, nothing's going on.

518
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,930
I just wanted to give you this.

519
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,340
What's this?

520
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,430
It's meat pancakes, cucumber kimchi, jangjorim, and side dishes.

521
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,970
I made all of your favorites.

522
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,020
You should be eating a lot at your age.

523
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,930
Thank you.

524
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,520
But don't do this from now on.

525
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,000
Why talk to your mom so formally? We aren't strangers.

526
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,870
I'm eating and living well where I live.

527
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,380
So, you should be good to Noona instead.

528
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,210
Okay.

529
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,850
I'll be good to her, too.

530
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,930
But I feel the most guilty toward you.

531
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,790
So, please wait just a bit.

532
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,390
We'll get a new place once I start making more.

533
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,900
Let's live together then.

534
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,440
And I'll let you study abroad again, no matter what, okay?

535
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,260
I'm no longer a child.

536
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,040
I'll figure out my studies and everything myself.

537
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,340
So, don't worry about stuff like that.

538
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,390
But still, I can't stop worrying about you.

539
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm most worried about you and miss you the most.

540
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,660
And...

541
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,820
take this. It's not much, but use it as pocket money.

542
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,710
Mom, Noona made this money, right?

543
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,110
You should spend it on her instead.

544
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,220
Do Jun.

545
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,290
Mom, don't give Noona a hard time this time.

546
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,840
Please.

547
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,460
- I'll get going now. 
 - Do Jun, Do Jun.

548
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,730
Do Jun, we'll live together when we get a new place. Okay?

549
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,580
Do Jun!

550
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,840
Why do you keep looking at your phone, Do Sik?

551
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,110
I'm not. Their cold noodles are good, huh?

552
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,340
Do Sik, do you know that you've been acting weird lately?

553
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,890
Me?

554
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,940
You don't call me or want to see me lately.

555
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,260
And you seem distracted even when we're together.

556
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,650
Was I like that? I didn't mean to.

557
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,310
Is something going on at home, by chance?

558
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,130
No, not at all.

559
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,610
I'm sorry for making you worry, Myeong Dong.

560
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,620
I'm glad if everything is okay.

561
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,030
Say ah.

562
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,740
Eat quickly. The noodles will get bloated.

563
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,650
Say ah, Do Sik.

564
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,450
What's this?

565
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,040
Why is it so tasty? Is it because you gave it to me?

566
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,340
Anyway, let's watch a movie since we finally got to meet.

567
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:39,120
There are too many movies I've been wanting to watch with you.

568
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,320
Movie?

569
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,560
Myeong Dong, I'm so sorry, but can we do that later?

570
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,870
I need to get going early today.

571
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,960
What did you say? You're leaving early?

572
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,270
Right after finishing these noodles?

573
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,530
Should we get dumplings, too?

574
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,440
I'll be in touch, Myeong Dong. Get home safely.

575
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,990
Wait...

576
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,600
What? What's wrong with Do Sik?

577
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,840
Did he have a change of heart already?

578
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,380
This is no good.

579
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,930
Oppa!

580
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,420
Hey, Ji Yeong.

581
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,070
I'm sorry.

582
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,910
You come home as soon as you get off work because of Grandma.

583
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,570
Thank you so much, and I'm sorry.

584
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,950
Why would you say that?

585
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,710
I should be with her when you aren't around.

586
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,660
What's that?

587
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,650
Why are Do Sik and Ji Yeong together?

588
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,240
What's this?

589
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,820
What did I see just now?

590
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,920
Not even Pil Sung,

591
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,200
not that chaebol named President Gong,

592
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,190
but Do Sik is living with Ji Yeong in this house?

593
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,330
How? How could this happen?

594
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,060
I can never forgive those two. Never.

595
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,630
 Yes, Myeong Dong. 

596
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,910
 I can't talk right now. I'll call you back later. 

597
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:42,270
Yes, I'm sure. Of course, you can't.

598
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,470
But you'd better come out right now.

599
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,410
I'm in front of your house right now. Come out now! Now!

600
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,070
Hey, Myeong Dong. What brings you here?

601
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:12,080
Hey, Park Do Sik. Let me just ask you one thing.

602
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,300
Do you live with Kim Ji Yeong right now?

603
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,260
That Kim Ji Yeong, our old tenant?

604
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,610
Yes, we do. We do live together, but—

605
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,690
Son of a bitch.

606
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:37,360
Don't you ever call me again. Got it?

607
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,160
Wait, M-Myeong Dong...

608
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,110
Yes, Chairman.

609
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,160
Right now?

610
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,410
Yes, I'm free now.

611
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,560
Okay, got it.

612
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,290
Are you still very sick, Ma Ri?

613
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,850
You should eat and sleep well now.

614
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,700
Yes, I'm also trying to do that.

615
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,600
But I can't help but keep having negative thoughts.

616
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,910
Thinking about Mom and Dad breaking up makes me so sad that my heart is about to explode.

617
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:33,610
I feel like I'm all alone in this world.

618
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,050
What?

619
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,900
That's why I don't want to eat.

620
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,880
I try to sleep, but I keep waking up in the middle of the night.

621
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,600
 Ma Ri, why do you think that? 

622
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,400
 Chairman Gong and President Jang aren't going anywhere. 

623
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,360
 They will always be by your side. 

624
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,160
 But... 

625
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,010
 I'm scared of everything. 

626
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,250
 I don't know why I'm like this, either. 

627
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,220
Ma Ri, you have me, too.

628
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,590
I promise you that you aren't alone.

629
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,720
Oppa, do you mean it?

630
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,670
Will you really be by my side?

631
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,990
 You'll never leave me? 

632
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,210
 Of course, I won't. 

633
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,960
 If so, promise me. 

634
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,930
Okay, I promise.

635
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,690
Oppa, I want to eat.

636
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,860
I want to eat and go for a walk with you.

637
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,030
Okay, let's eat and go for a walk.

638
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,130
 Friendship test. Friendship, friendship. 

639
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,250
Come here.

640
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,720
- I'll slap you hard. 
 - Go ahead.

641
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,550
Don't cry.

642
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,450
Gong Ma Ri.

643
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,680
I knew it'd hurt.

644
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,620
 Friendship test. Friendship, friendship. 

645
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,860
   

646
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,540
   

647
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,810
   

648
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:39,040
 Thanks to the drama produced by Go Go Entertainment, "House of Roses," 

649
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,310
 APP Group's image is improving, too. 

650
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,550
I didn't realize a drama can have so much power.

651
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,420
This drama turns out to be...

652
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,180
much more effective than any ads we've put out.

653
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:00,180
That's why I think we should invest in Go Go Entertainment and expand it.

654
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:06,130
But the CEO position is vacant right now.

655
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,710
I'm wondering if Director Go should become the CEO.

656
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,910
Yes, this is Go Pil Sung.

657
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,570
Does Chairman Gong want to see me?

658
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:48,320
I enjoyed the drama "House of Roses" very much.

659
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,490
I haven't gotten into a drama so much in a while.

660
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,780
Congratulations on your success.

661
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,390
Thank you for speaking highly of it.

662
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,730
It's thanks to all of your help.

663
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,100
I've been wrong about you a lot because of my wife.

664
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,100
You did nothing wrong, but you've been misunderstood.

665
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,780
You've also gone through a lot of hardship for no reason.

666
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,720
Not at all.

667
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,530
I decided to forget about everything

668
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:25,870
and acknowledge you as Director Go Pil Sung.

669
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,100
Since we're on the topic, Director Go, I'd like to officially appoint you

670
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:38,130
as the CEO of Go Go Entertainment today.

671
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,710
Pardon?

672
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,240
How could I...

673
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,390
A drama improved APP Group's stock value

674
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,800
and it let APP Group be known all around the world.

675
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,030
And it turned into a global corporation, too.

676
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:04,680
Thanks to you, I got to realize how...

677
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,960
powerful a TV show can be.

678
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:15,220
Only you qualify for the position if we consider your achievement.

679
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:24,530
But I'm planning to leave Go Go Entertainment once "House of Roses" ends.

680
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,500
I've been preparing to do so.

681
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:33,360
As for that, let's forget about everything that happened.

682
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,290
Pardon?

683
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:43,250
And that position belongs to President Jang.

684
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,350
I don't think it is appropriate to take that position.

685
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,280
Don't worry about that.

686
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,980
President Jang approved this decision, too.

687
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,290
President Jang did?

688
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,850
Director Go,

689
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:11,520
become the CEO of Go Go Entertainment and create shows that are even better than "House of Roses."

690
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,270
Let's benefit each other that way.

691
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:20,620
We'll improve the reputation of APP Group and K-contents, too.

692
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,650
I'll fully support Go Go Entertainment from now on, too.

693
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,310
What?

694
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:01,950
Chairman Gong asked you to become the CEO of Go Go Entertainment?

695
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,590
Is that true?

696
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,830
Yes.

697
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:11,790
My goodness. And on top of that, because the drama was a hit,

698
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,030
he wants to give you a share of the company, too?

699
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,520
- Yes. 
 - Aigoo! Oh, my goodness!

700
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,420
Myeong Dong! We need to celebrate!

701
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,660
To be honest, I've been so worried that

702
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:33,350
something negative might happen to you because of Ma Ri's mom.

703
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,830
I know. What an amazing twist.

704
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:40,190
Pil Sung, you need to say yes. You have to.

705
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,490
This is an amazing opportunity. You need to seize it.

706
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,700
But I should ask Mom and Dad.

707
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:51,280
I'll reconsider it if they don't want me to.

708
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,500
By chance, Seon Yeong, Hyeon Cheol,

709
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,080
you won't be against this. Will you?

710
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,980
Yes, why would you reject such a great opportunity?

711
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:10,160
Honey, I suppose Pil Sung did an amazing job, as Mother said.

712
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,840
He tried to kick him out once, but he wants him to become the CEO now.

713
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,240
Unni, he didn't just do a good job. He did an amazing job.

714
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,710
The stock prices of companies related to Go Go Entertainment are skyrocketing.

715
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:31,260
Chairman Gong is throwing bait at Pil Sung.

716
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,710
Let's face it. You know what kind of people they are.

717
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,730
He's a chairman of a corporation, to put it nicely,

718
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,810
but he's a salesman who is controlled by profit.

719
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:47,040
That's why we don't need to get personal feelings involved.

720
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,700
I suppose. I think you're right.

721
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:59,900
Pil Sung, I was going to tell you to quit working there after this drama.

722
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,240
But I don't think you should anymore.

723
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,510
You got this opportunity through hard work.

724
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,730
You're being rewarded for your achievement. Why say no?

725
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,720
Your future depends on this.

726
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,460
Honey, I think he should accept the proposal.

727
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,600
What do you think?

728
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:26,620
Well, Pil Sung is being rewarded for his achievement.

729
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:31,570
Why should I be against it? Of course, I'm happy.

730
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,160
Yes, Pil Sung. Go for it. Do it!

731
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,140
Accept the position and do even better.

732
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,490
Yes, I'm on board, too.

733
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:57,820
 Director Go, you deserve to be the CEO of Go Go Entertainment more than anyone. 

734
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,620
 Please agree to accept the position. 

735
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,550
 I support you sincerely as the former CEO. 

736
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:09,330
 President Go, please take good care of Go Go Entertainment. 

737
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,930
What? Who is it?

738
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,300
It's President Jang.

739
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,990
She said she'd support me as the former CEO and asked me to take good care of Go Go Entertainment.

740
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,860
Soo Yeon said that?

741
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,240
Yes.

742
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,350
   

743
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,090
Where's Ma Ri?

744
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,850
She went for a walk with Mr. Park.

745
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,700
Really?

746
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:11,350
You told Mr. Park not to... let her overdo it, right?

747
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:15,500
Of course. They're probably nearby.

748
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,440
You appointed Pil Sung...

749
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,170
I mean, Director Go as the CEO of Go Go Entertainment.

750
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,980
Thank you.

751
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,430
Why would you thank me?

752
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,590
The board of directors appointed him, not me.

753
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,200
I approved the decision based on

754
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,170
his achievement for the sake of the company's gain.

755
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,740
So...

756
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,910
don't get the wrong idea.

757
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,320
Okay.

758
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,690
Since we're on the topic,

759
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,250
I think Ma Ri improved a lot now.

760
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,640
I'll move out now.

761
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,710
What are you talking about?

762
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:19,560
You kept Go Go Entertainment... and you canceled Director Go's dismissal, too.

763
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:26,050
So, as we discussed initially, I'll do as you tell me to.

764
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,590
Send me the divorce papers...

765
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,240
once it's ready.

766
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,150
Ma Ri hasn't fully recovered yet.

767
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,670
She can't sleep at night without you.

768
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,770
But you'd still move out?

769
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:51,110
As long as you let me, I really want to live with Ma Ri.

770
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:56,680
But it won't be right for me to stay here.

771
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,390
I'm not letting you stay here because I want to see you.

772
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,790
I have no choice because of Ma Ri.

773
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,470
So...

774
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,520
stay for a while until Ma Ri recovers completely.

775
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,730
Mom, there you were.

776
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,290
Yes.

777
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,150
What's this? Did you two fight again?

778
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,190
No, of course not.

779
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,510
Go rest upstairs with Mom.

780
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,140
Okay.

781
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,520
Let's go, Mom.

782
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,630
Yes, let's go upstairs.

783
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,260
Hyung, Hyung!

784
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,060
What's wrong? Why are you yelling?

785
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,220
Hyung is home, right?

786
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,050
Hyung! Are you in the study?

787
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,070
What's going on?

788
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:11,400
Hyung, how does this make sense?

789
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,540
Yes, I understand I was fired as the CEO of Go Go Entertainment.

790
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,850
But how could you make that jerk Go Pil Sung the CEO?

791
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,030
You should be kicking him out.

792
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:24,030
But you made him the CEO? Why?

793
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,630
Chairman Gong, is that true?

794
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,250
Chairman Gong.

795
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:32,470
Jin Taek, what's he talking about?

796
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:37,200
So, you made Soo Yeon's son,

797
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,150
who she's been hiding for over 30 years

798
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:44,310
the CEO of our subsidiary company?

799
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,790
Are you out of your mind?

800
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,510
Auntie, Go Go Entertainment's CEO position was vacant.

801
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,810
It was unanimously decided at the board meeting.

802
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:59,090
Everyone agreed to make him the CEO because Director Go deserves it.

803
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,880
That's all.

804
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,770
What's wrong with him?

805
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:15,100
How could he make Soo Yeon's illegitimate son in that position?

806
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,460
I try to understand it,

807
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,190
but I really can't this time.

808
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,000
Auntie, how does this make sense?

809
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,300
Chairman Gong must be out of his mind.

810
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,990
What's he trying to do?

811
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:39,230
I suggested adopting Jin Dan, but he won't even talk about it.

812
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,530
And that woman is still living here.

813
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:45,720
Now he made her illegitimate son the CEO?

814
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,230
My goodness. This is serious.

815
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,570
We need to get Jin Dan adopted quickly.

816
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,200
Yes, we should.

817
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,580
It's really shady how things are turning out in this family.

818
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,490
Go meet with Attorney Kang tomorrow.

819
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,480
Ask him what's going on.

820
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,280
Okay, Auntie.

821
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,440
   

822
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,620
Attorney Kang, how's the adoption coming along?

823
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,620
Is there a legal issue, by chance?

824
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,120
There is no legal issue.

825
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,950
I explained the necessary steps to the Chairman.

826
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,260
I already gave him all the paperwork, too.

827
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,180
So, he hasn't changed his mind, right?

828
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,750
No. The process isn't complicated as long as the Chairman agrees to do it.

829
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,070
Okay, then. Thank you, Attorney Kang.

830
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,570
Let me know as soon as you hear from Chairman Gong.

831
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,700
Okay, I will.

832
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,660
Right. Attorney Kang, hold on.

833
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:48,170
How's his divorce with Soo Yeon going?

834
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:52,810
I gave him all the paperwork... and he's working on the details.

835
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,910
Oh, I see. Thank you.

836
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,540
It's me, Sang Gu.

837
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,010
We were supposed to meet tomorrow. You couldn't wait?

838
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,550
Did you miss me that much?

839
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,510
Yes.

840
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,010
No matter how often I see you, I keep missing you.

841
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,860
Come on, Sang Gu. Seriously.

842
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,780
And there's something I want to ask you, too.

843
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:32,760
You want to ask me something? What is it?

844
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,290
To be honest, I've been wanting to ask you this for a while.

845
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,170
For a while?

846
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,810
What is it? Tell me.

847
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,180
You know we can tell each other anything.

848
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,730
Ae Gyo.

849
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,990
- Have a look at this. 
 - Gosh. What's this?

850
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:56,520
It looks like it's from a magazine with Jin Dan in it.

851
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,240
Yes, I've been keeping this photo for a long time.

852
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,020
Gosh, why would you keep a photo of my son?

853
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:10,580
Doesn't he look so much like my father when he was young?

854
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,050
It gave me such a strange feeling.

855
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,760
W-What did you say?

856
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,500
Ae Gyo, we went on the last trip before we broke up way back when.

857
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,460
So, I was wondering...

858
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:29,840
isn't he my son by chance?

859
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,410
Sang Gu, what are you talking about?

860
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:34,980
Mom.

861
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,230
J-Jin Dan.

862
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,330
 Unni! 

863
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:17,320
 Unni! Wait! 

864
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,120
 You're my star, and I'm your moon. 

865
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,950
 I'm sorry. 

866
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,350
 I can't do it. 

867
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,160
 I'll make two billion if I do this for a few hours. 

868
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,260
 Can you give me that money? 

869
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,060
 I'll be the one who'd regret it. 

870
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:45,540
 So, shut up and leave unless you have two billion! 

871
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,150
I know everything now.

872
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,710
Ji Yeong!

873
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,890
Ji Yeong!

874
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:14,630


875
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,350
Oppa.

876
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:22,080
   

877
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,260
   

878
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:30,730
♫  Those words hurt more than anything  ♫

879
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:35,350
♫  I say it quietly  ♫

880
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,940
♫  It's difficult to say it now  ♫

881
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:49,050
♫  The moonlight suits you more than the bright sunlight in the morning  ♫

882
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:53,530
♫  The goodbye kiss  ♫

883
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:58,900
♫  I'll put that aside for now...  ♫
