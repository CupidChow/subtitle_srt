1
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:56,020


2
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,697
D-Do Ra!

3
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,477
   

4
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:27,277
Do Ra! Do Ra...

5
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,957
Do Ra, I'm sorry.

6
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,887
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

7
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:35,447
Do Ra, my Do Ra...

8
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:39,787
Do Ra, Do Ra, Do Ra...

9
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,737
This is my last wish.

10
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:45,887
Please see President Gong again.

11
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:50,067
Then you don't have to do this nude photoshoot.

12
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:55,130
President Gong said he'd help if you asked him.

13
00:01:55,947 --> 00:02:01,257
Getting paid two billion for this shoot won't fix things.

14
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:03,817
President Gong said he'd fix it.

15
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:11,747
- Mom... 
 - Do Ra, we can't go down like this. Do Ra...

16
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:15,597
Do Ra, let's ask for help just once.

17
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:17,597
Please, Do Ra...

18
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:21,517
Mom... Mom...

19
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,937
Mom...

20
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:27,067
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

21
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:33,227
- Mom... 
 - I'm sorry, Do Ra.

22
00:02:46,857 --> 00:02:51,447
 President Gong, I apologize for the last time. 
    

23
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:56,147
 May I treat you to a meal? 

24
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:15,377
I'm honored that you invited me to dinner, Do Ra.

25
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,027
 Oppa. 

26
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,927
 I get two billion for doing this. 

27
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,127
 Do you have two billion? 

28
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,827
Two billion?

29
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,897
No, I don't.

30
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:57,387
Not two billion, 200 million,

31
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:00,757
or even 20 million won.

32
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:06,897
But I can give you two million won.

33
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,927
If I save on everything else...

34
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,347
and make things work,

35
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:18,987
I can give you around two million.

36
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,817
 I'll make two billion if I do this for a few hours. 

37
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,457
 Can you give me that money? 

38
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:33,187
 I'll be the one who'd regret it. 

39
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:36,667
 So, shut up and leave unless you have two billion! 

40
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,917
Wow, why is it so easy to drink tonight?

41
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,517
Wow, it's so daebak.

42
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:56,727
Ma'am, I'll have another soju.

43
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,597
Okay.

44
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:11,467
Gosh! Oh, my! Pil Sung.

45
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:15,367
Hyeon Cheol, Seon Yeong, come out here!

46
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,137
- Huh? Pil Sung! 
 - What? What?

47
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,027
Honey, Honey, help him get up.

48
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,447
- Hey, Pil Sung, what happened— 
 - Pil Sung!

49
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,177
- What's wrong? 
 - Get up. Wake up.

50
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:25,117
What's wrong?

51
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,447
Hey...

52
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,147
I got a drink because I was in such a good mood today.

53
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:38,977
Aigoo, but you still can't drink to oblivion like this.

54
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:42,107
You could've gotten into an accident.

55
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,367
I'm sorry. Victory! 
  (T/N: Pilsung means Victory) 

56
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,197
- Geez, gosh... 
 - Well...

57
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:50,997
You little... So lanky.

58
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,277
Gosh, the alcohol smell.

59
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:57,127
Where did he drink that much, anyway?

60
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:59,747
Gosh, that smell...

61
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:05,817
Here. My goodness...

62
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:10,177
Geez, where did you drink so much—

63
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:15,387
Pil Sung, drink some honey water before sleeping.

64
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:16,977
Mom...

65
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,277
- Yes. 
 - Father...

66
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:30,287
I've never regretted becoming a producer for the broadcasting station,

67
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:34,877
but I regret it a bit today.

68
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,587
I should've chosen a profession...

69
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:44,797
where I could make lots and lots of money.

70
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:49,817
I regret that a bit today.

71
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:56,397
Why is he talking about money after binge drinking?

72
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,757
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,117
Stop being silly and go to sleep, okay?

74
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:07,327
- Mom... 
 - Let's go, let's go.

75
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,497
I wish I had just two billion won.

76
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:15,757
Just two billion. No more or less.

77
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:20,497
Aigoo, Pil Sung, just get some sleep.

78
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:23,117
Don't have silly thoughts and sleep.

79
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:32,647
Just two billion.

80
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,517
Just two billion.

81
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:43,097
If only I had two billion,

82
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:46,447
I could help Do Ra.

83
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,317
Aigoo, crazy bastard.

84
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,537
Not even two million or 20 million?

85
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:58,707
He's gotten audacious ever since he met Do Ra.

86
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:03,387
Is two billion someone's dog's name?

87
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:07,657
He probably wants to help Park Do Ra since she went bankrupt.

88
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:10,057
Did they fight about money, by chance?

89
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,187
Aigoo, crazy bastard.

90
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:16,097
Because of two billion we never even came close to?

91
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:53,027
 You're my star, and I'm your moon. 

92
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:56,717
 Even if we face hardship again, 

93
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:59,957
 we'll have faith and depend on each other. 

94
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,377
 We'll protect each other like the moon and the star. 

95
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,257
 Don't ever let go of my hand, okay? 

96
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:17,217
♫  Even if I close my eyes and cover my mouth  ♫

97
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:22,817
♫  It's impossible to fool you  ♫

98
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:29,637
♫  Even if the world stops me, could it be stopped?  ♫

99
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:33,777
♫  We'll meet after all  ♫

100
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:42,277
♫  Just like the waves drawn to the moonlight  ♫

101
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:49,237
♫  It's you in the end  ♫

102
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:56,867
♫  No matter how much I try to run away  ♫

103
00:09:56,867 --> 00:10:04,257
♫  Even at night when there's no light  ♫

104
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:10,367
 Do Ra, I'm sorry about yesterday... for getting angry with you. 

105
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,847
 You weren't doing that because you wanted to. 

106
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,937
 But I got angry when I couldn't even help you. 

107
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:22,827
 Do Ra, I still love you even so. 

108
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:28,837
♫  Even if my lips contained lies  ♫

109
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,947
♫  I won't be able to fool my heart  ♫

110
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:41,877
♫  It's you for me  ♫

111
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,303
Do Ra.

112
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,293
Are you still upset?

113
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,423
Oppa, I didn't do the nude photoshoot.

114
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,373
Is that right?

115
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,353
Do Ra...

116
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:36,163
Don't hug me anymore, Oppa.

117
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:42,703
What... What's wrong?

118
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:48,763
I thought I should tell you in person out of courtesy.

119
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,183
I'm getting engaged to President Gong.

120
00:11:58,563 --> 00:11:59,773
What?

121
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:04,173
Once we get engaged and things get sorted out,

122
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,363
we'll be getting married immediately.

123
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,973
Do Ra...

124
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,883
What do you mean by engagement and marriage?

125
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,633
What are you talking about right now?

126
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:22,913
Is it because I caused a scene on set?

127
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:25,483
I'm saying I understand it now.

128
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,933
I feel bad for you.

129
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:32,653
But it just worked out that way.

130
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:36,853
So, let's end things here...

131
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,093
and go separate ways.

132
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,483
Are you serious?

133
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:57,073
Is it... because of debt?

134
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,193
Did he say he'll pay off your debt?

135
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:04,903
So, you're marrying him for money?

136
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:16,663
Do you care more about money than our promise?

137
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:22,983
How could you make such a decision without trying on your own?

138
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:26,293
You're basically selling yourself for money.

139
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:30,823
Do Ra, please come to your senses.

140
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,363
Don't speak bluntly when you don't know anything.

141
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:37,223
You'd never understand how I got to where I am.

142
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:40,543
Yes, I care more about money.

143
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:46,023
Everything I've been building with blood, sweat, and tears is about to crumble.

144
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:49,333
What matters more than money now?

145
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,883
Even if I die, I don't ever want to live like before again.

146
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:57,013
I never want to go back to those days.

147
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,856
The promise I made to you?

148
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:03,993
What can that silly promise do for me?

149
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:07,263
What can silly love do for me?

150
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:12,793
What did you say?

151
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,563
None of that matters.

152
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,023
Say you love me a thousand times.

153
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:22,396
What would be the use of it?

154
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,563
It's a mirage without substance.

155
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:28,593
None of that matters without money.

156
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,453
So, let's end things now.

157
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,247
Okay.

158
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,437
Let's do that.

159
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,987
I didn't know you were like this.

160
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:56,247
I regret every moment I liked you.

161
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:02,737
As you wish, get engaged to President Gong, marry him,

162
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,987
and live a happy life.

163
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,507
And that precious money of yours...

164
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:13,237
I hope you get smothered in a pile of money.

♫  I'd feel better if I could see you the way you are  ♫

166
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:25,297
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

167
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:28,687
♫  The pain is unbearable  ♫

168
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:32,517
♫  I gave my everything  ♫

169
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,227
Don't cry, Park Do Ra.

170
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,907
Don't cry, Park Do Ra.

171
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:55,217
♫  Love is so difficult, challenging  ♫

172
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:58,657
♫  The pain is unbearable  ♫

173
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:08,897
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

174
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:26,107
   

175
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:31,137
   

176
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:34,947
There's me and your brother, too.

177
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:38,637
But you announced your engagement without discussing it with us?

178
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,747
What are you doing right now?

179
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,977
Did you know about this?

180
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:46,317
N-No, I just found out, too.

181
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:49,057
Gong Jin Dan, how could you do this?

182
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:51,077
Don't you care about your mother at all?

183
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:55,367
You'd get engaged with Park Do Ra, who went bankrupt due to gambling debt?

184
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,797
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

185
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:01,787
I didn't tell you beforehand because I knew you'd be like this.

186
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,627
You're the CEO of Angel Investment.

187
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:07,517
You have responsibilities in society.

188
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:11,567
But you're getting engaged to a woman from a family with gambling debt?

189
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,837
How does that make sense?

190
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:19,157
Release a statement that the engagement announcement was an error

191
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,457
and reconsider the engagement.

192
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:27,637
Yes, listen to your brother, Jin Dan.

193
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:32,597
Do Ra didn't create the gambling debt.

194
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:36,187
She didn't do anything wrong.

195
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:42,007
I'll make sure the APP Group isn't affected. Don't worry.

196
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:46,117
This is my personal matter.

197
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,817
How could this be your personal matter?

198
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,197
It'd damage the company and the group's image.

199
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,687
How much will it get damaged?

200
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,317
I'll pay back if you tell me the amount.

201
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:03,567
And I'm too old to get permission to be with someone.

202
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,947
Don't get involved in my business.

203
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:10,807
- Gosh, he must be crazy. 
 - You little...

204
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,767
I'm sorry, Chairman Gong.

205
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:16,227
I'm sorry, Auntie. My goodness...

206
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:24,647
This is why I shouldn't have given him Angel Investment in advance.

207
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:31,767
   

208
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:35,617
Seon Yeong, what's going on?

209
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:38,237
Did Pil Sung break up with Park Do Ra?

210
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:41,587
They just started dating. How could they break up already?

211
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,127
He would've told us if they did.

212
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:47,527
Why do they say she's engaged to the second eldest son of APP Group?

213
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:51,297
Do Ra, that brat must've dumped Pil Sung.

214
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,907
That's why he's been drinking and coming home late.

215
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:56,767
No way.

216
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,047
How could this be?

217
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:02,307
Park Do Ra, that bitch, played Pil Sung.

218
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,137
The mother, the gold digger, played In-law,

219
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:09,010
and now the daughter played Pil Sung.

220
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:14,007
She certainly is the daughter of a gold digger.

221
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:17,037
To be honest...

222
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:19,167
I'm not sure if I should say this.

223
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,397
What is it?

224
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:25,847
On the day it rained a lot, Pil Sung... came home after drinking a lot again.

225
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:29,667
He cried a lot in the morning that day.

226
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,367
- Why— 
 - I wondered what it was about.

227
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:36,347
Do Ra must've dumped him that day to do this.

228
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:38,657
- Those morons— 
 - Seon Yeong.

229
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,367
Honey, hold yourself back. Don't be like this.

230
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,017
Seon Yeong, calm down. Calm down.

231
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:44,967
Think this is for the better and calm down.

232
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,347
How could I calm down?

233
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:50,287
My Pil Sung cried because of that bitch.

234
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,777
- Those morons— 
 - Still hold yourself back, Seon Yeong...

235
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:55,137
- Hold it. Hold it. 
 - You still need to hold yourself back.

236
00:19:55,137 --> 00:20:00,277
I heard she went bankrupt because of her mom's gambling debt.

237
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:03,717
So, she switched to a rich man from a chaebol family.

238
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:06,177
This is for the better.

239
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:11,317
It's better not to get involved with the gold digger with a gambling addiction.

240
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:16,697
Seon Yeong, just think In-law is helping us from heaven.

241
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:19,337
She seduced the innocent Pil Sung first.

242
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:21,647
After toying with his heart like that,

243
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:25,587
how could she destroy him like this?

244
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:29,707
I... I must've been crazy.

245
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:31,037
I must've been crazy.

246
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:34,737
- Calm down, Seon Yeong. Calm down. 
 - Calm down.

247
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:37,067
- Unni— 
 - My goodness.

248
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:54,817
How dare you not greet me?

249
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,637
Hey.

250
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:03,617
You know Do Ra's getting engaged, right?

251
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:06,447
You'd better not blabber your mouth.

252
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:11,347
If you say you dated my Do Ra or whatever, I won't just sit back and watch.

253
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:15,527
I'm telling you not to rain on Do Ra's parade.

254
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,407
Understand?

255
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:22,307
How dare you not answer me when I'm talking to you?

256
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:23,907
Hey!

257
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,297
Y-You crazy woman.

258
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,717
You bitch.

259
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:32,837
What did you say after she broke my son's heart?

260
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:36,597
You bitch! You bitch!

261
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,957
- You bitch! 
 - How dare you...

262
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,337
You bitch!

263
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:42,727
You!

264
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:46,637
I'll kill you if you show up in this neighborhood again!

265
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,997
God will punish you!

266
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:51,887
Go inside, Pil Sung.

267
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:53,987
They're not worth engaging with.

268
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:55,747
Go in. Go in.

269
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,467
Damn you!

270
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,617
She grabbed me by the collar last time.

271
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,117
Now she dares to slap me?

272
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,487
You've got to be kidding.

273
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:14,847
I won't forgive that woman. Seriously.

274
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,547
Seriously!

275
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:25,944
How's Pil Sung? Is he okay?

276
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,404
I told him to think of it as a dream.

277
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,804
He said he already moved on, and he was fine.

278
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,924
Yes, good work, Pil Sung.

279
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:38,574
You should forget a bitch like her completely.

280
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:41,594
You've done great, Pil Sung.

281
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:46,114
Hey, why are you crying?

282
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,854
Pil Sung said he was okay.

283
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,824
I'm not crying.

284
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:52,404
I feel so satisfied right now.

285
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,794
Yes, you did a great thing.

286
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:59,874
I felt so great when you said you slapped that woman.

287
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:04,514
I would've plucked all of her hair if I were there.

288
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:11,524
This dress is so pretty, too.

289
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,814
You look so beautiful.

290
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:15,594
What do you think?

291
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:19,534
This is nice, too.

292
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,264
Everything's nice. What do we do?

293
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:25,764
Which one do you like, Do Ra?

294
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:28,134
I like all of them.

295
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,564
Let's go with what you like.

296
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:35,784
Since we still have a lot of time,

297
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:38,824
let's try just one more and decide.

298
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:44,134
Today is an important day. I want you to look pretty.

299
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,534
Okay.

300
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:00,574
President Gong,

301
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:04,374
I think you should come over here.

302
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:14,554
Do Ra, what's wrong?

303
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:20,554
I'm sorry, President Gong.

304
00:24:22,814 --> 00:24:25,104
I can't do it.

305
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:31,994
You can't do it? What do you mean?

306
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:36,464
I wanted your help.

307
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:39,744
I thought I couldn't get back up without your help.

308
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,584
So, I tried to marry you,

309
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:48,944
but I can't do it. This isn't right.

310
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:53,484
I'm so sorry, President Gong.

311
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,854
Get up.

312
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:14,114
Stop trying dresses on if it's too tiring for you.

313
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,964
Let's just go with the last one you tried on.

314
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:23,814
I'm getting engaged to you and marrying you without any feelings for you.

315
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:28,094
This doesn't seem fair to you, either.

316
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,734
I'm so sorry, President Gong.

317
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,694
I like you.

318
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:40,534
That's enough, then.

319
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:42,704
Everything is fine.

320
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,554
We can't ruin the engagement party.

321
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:52,534
Let's get ready now.

322
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:57,094
I can't do it, President Gong.

323
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,934
It's not too late to go back now.

324
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:13,364
Before I get even angrier.

325
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,074
President Gong, I'm sorry.

326
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,764
Please let go of my hand.

327
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:20,894
Hey, Park Do Ra!

328
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:23,844
You came to me and asked for mercy yourself.

329
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:26,174
That's why...

330
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:31,074
I accepted you unconditionally despite your many flaws.

331
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:33,250
But you're...

332
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:36,914
completely humiliating me right now.

333
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:41,644
You think you'd be okay after all this?

334
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:45,184
You could go down for real.

335
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,584
How could I possibly...

336
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:55,074
go down even further now?

337
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:01,744
But I don't want to regret more by making a mistake.

338
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:06,614
I'm sorry, President Gong.

339
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:08,924
If so, for the last time...

340
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,604
I'll ask you for the very last time.

341
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,234
Are you confident...

342
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,214
you won't regret leaving like this?

343
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,934
I'm sorry.

344
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:40,934
This isn't even my engagement party. Why am I so nervous?

345
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:45,714
Is it an engagement party or an in-law gathering today?

346
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,434
It's both of those things.

347
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:52,634
If he's engaged to Do Ra, will President Gong really save us?

348
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:54,984
Are you sure we aren't losing this place and the building?

349
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,994
I'm telling you.

350
00:27:56,994 --> 00:28:02,184
We're okay now, Do Sik. Let's go.

351
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:04,014
Let's go.

352
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:13,254
Do Ra, why are you here?

353
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:16,504
Do Ra, we were supposed to meet at the venue.

354
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:20,224
Why would you come home dressed like that?

355
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:22,724
Mom, I won't get engaged.

356
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,594
I won't do it.

357
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:28,444
You won't get engaged? What do you mean?

358
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:31,154
Do Ra, what would we do, then?

359
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:33,934
We'll lose the building and apartment.

360
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,484
Did President Gong say he'd help us without getting engaged?

361
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:39,014
Is he stupid? He won't just help us.

362
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:42,634
Do Ra, why are you suddenly doing this?

363
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:45,914
Everything will be okay as long as you get engaged.

364
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:48,464
Why are you doing this? Why all of a sudden?

365
00:28:48,464 --> 00:28:52,844
Yes, that's why I tried to do it, no matter what.

366
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:55,474
Because I can't go down like this.

367
00:28:55,474 --> 00:29:00,374
But I'd be deceiving him by marrying him without any feelings.

368
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:04,394
Mom, I don't think I can live that way.

369
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:06,554
So?

370
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:10,004
Did you tell him you can't get engaged?

371
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,484
Yes.

372
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:16,104
No, Do Ra. No.

373
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:20,594
I'd die, and we'd all die if this engagement is broken.

374
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,564
Go with me right now. It'd be okay, then.

375
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:25,844
I won't go! I don't want to!

376
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:31,824
Why do I have to marry someone I don't like because of your gambling debt?

377
00:29:31,824 --> 00:29:33,754
Whose fault is all this?

378
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:37,514
This is all your fault. You should be responsible.

379
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:41,054
You only think about selling your daughter off till the end?

380
00:29:41,054 --> 00:29:42,574
How could you?

381
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:47,554
Are you suggesting we all die, then? Are you?

382
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:50,054
I'll have a fresh start.

383
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:54,034
Mom. Mom, let's start from the beginning.

384
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:57,694
We started with nothing already.

385
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,574
Mom, we can do it.

386
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,534
Let's have a fresh start.

387
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:06,404
How could we have a fresh start? How?

388
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,934
You were young, then.

389
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,914
You're too old to have a fresh start.

390
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:14,794
We can do it again? No. No, I can't do it.

391
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:18,514
How could I get back on that treacherous path?

392
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:20,864
So, please...

393
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:23,194
Let's go to President Gong.

394
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:25,124
Get engaged, okay?

395
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:28,714
I don't want to! I said I won't! I won't go!

396
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:32,664
I'll die if you don't get engaged! I'll go to jail! Jail!

397
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,464
You did the wrong thing.

398
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:36,444
You're the one who did the wrong thing!

399
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:39,184
You should be punished if you commit a sin!

400
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:41,144
You crazy bitch!

401
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:44,694
You're telling your mother to go to jail? Crazy bitch.

402
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:47,994
How dare you? How dare you...

403
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:56,254
Mom, I...

404
00:30:57,054 --> 00:31:01,704
I regret that I was born as your daughter.

405
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:11,584
Mom, please!

406
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:14,054
Do Ra, Do Ra!

407
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:38,034
Gong Jin Dan, was the engagement party canceled today...

408
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:41,844
because Park Do Ra ran away from the shop, refusing to get engaged?

409
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:44,444
You didn't change your mind and cancel it?

410
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:49,454
I talked to Ms. Choi from the shop. Be honest with me.

411
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:52,744
Let's talk later.

412
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:58,894
Did you insist on getting engaged saying you'd pay off her mom's debt?

413
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:00,194
Did you really? And you still got dumped by her?

414
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:02,204
And you still got dumped by her?

415
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,244
Mom, please!

416
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:06,294
Let's talk later, I said.

417
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:09,054
You don't have the right to yell.

418
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:13,774
You tried to pay her to marry her?

419
00:32:13,774 --> 00:32:16,264
You think marriage works like that?

420
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:18,264
Stupid bastard.

421
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:23,834
I'll start dinner.

422
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:30,174
Humiliating. So humiliating.

423
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:33,544
Tell the PR team that the engagement announcement was a mistake.

424
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:35,554
Hurry!

425
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,474
Where are you going now?

426
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:44,084
By the way, that girl must be crazy.

427
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:46,074
Jin Dan said he'd help her.

428
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:49,304
He should be running away. How dare she run?

429
00:32:49,304 --> 00:32:53,234
Gosh, what kind of shitty nonsense is this?

430
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:57,300
   

431
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:18,814
Mr. Jeong, I need you to do something for me.

432
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:26,214
I'd rather die than go to jail.

433
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:32,444
Should I run away abroad somewhere?

434
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:38,124
Who's this?

435
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:43,514
Hello? Who's this?

436
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:45,824
Yes, this is she.

437
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:48,274
Cosmetics commercial?

438
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:51,684
Of course, she can.

439
00:33:51,684 --> 00:33:54,514
What's Park Do Ra's beauty secret?

440
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:59,434
It's cicada larva juice that detoxes and energizes.

441
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:01,604
Vitamins A, C, E, and K.

442
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:04,074
Join Park Do Ra.

443
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:07,064
Cut, okay!

444
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:09,664
- Applaud. 
 - Thank you.

445
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:13,214
Thank you. Thank you.

446
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,554
When will the payment get deposited?

447
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,284
It will be processed within a week.

448
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:22,184
A week?

449
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:26,614
I'm sorry, but could you process it a bit sooner?

450
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:32,204
Well, if so, I'll process it within two or three days.

451
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,374
Okay.

452
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:35,634
Thank you. Thank you.

453
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,284
Thank you.

454
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,534
Hey, Oppa. I just finished.

455
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:44,014
 Good work. Well... 

456
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:48,934
Do Ra, a kimchi stew restaurant, is opening, and they want you to come.

457
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,734
What should I tell them?

458
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:53,294
I need to do anything. Say yes. I'll do it.

459
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:55,394
 Okay, got it. 

460
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,584
We got a cosmetics commercial.

461
00:34:57,584 --> 00:35:00,244
- Cosmetics commercial? 
  - I haven't heard of the, but... 

462
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:02,354
 I guess they're launching a product. 

463
00:35:02,354 --> 00:35:04,324
 But the pay is really good. 

464
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:07,884
So, leave for Hanseo Hotel right now.

465
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:09,444
They want a meeting there right away.

466
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:13,154
Okay, I'll leave right now. Okay.

467
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:32,734
Why are we having an ad contract meeting at a place like this?

468
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:53,454
Welcome, Ms. Park.

469
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:59,594
Is this for the cosmetics commercial meeting?

470
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:02,854
Come in first. Come in.

471
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,944
Let's talk inside.

472
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:21,744
How come no one's here?

473
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:31,574
- Ms. Park. 
 - What are you doing?

474
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:37,344
Let's have the meeting for the commercial later.

475
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:41,794
Since you're here, have a date with me first.

476
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:45,514
Wasn't that your understanding, too?

477
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:47,774
- What did you say? 
 - Have a seat.

478
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,894
Let's sit down and have a drink.

479
00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:52,334
Let go of me!

480
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:54,894
Ms. Park!

481
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:58,954
Oppa, where are you?

482
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,494
Where are you right now?

483
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:02,654
 I'm on my way, too. I'll be there in about 10 minutes. 

484
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,034
I don't care about that. What's going on?

485
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:06,934
You said it was a cosmetics commercial.

486
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,584
You said it was a contract meeting. Who was that weird man?

487
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:12,794
 Do Ra, a weird man? What do you mean? 

488
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:15,104
 Mom told me to send you to the hotel. 

489
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:17,514
 Wasn't it a cosmetics commercial meeting? 

490
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:19,264
Was it Mom?

491
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:23,644
Was it her again?

492
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,394
Mom?

493
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:45,131
Mom, are you crazy?

494
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,581
Are you out of your mind?

495
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:50,401
Park Do Ra, what's wrong with you?

496
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,221
I know we're desperate,

497
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:54,801
but how could you try to get me a sugar daddy?

498
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:58,551
You tried to sell me to an old man now?

499
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:02,531
How could you do this as a mom? How could you?

500
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:06,738
Hey, what are you talking about?

501
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,908
Park Do Sik, what's wrong with her?

502
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:11,328
Why don't you say something?

503
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:13,958
You got her the cosmetics commercial.

504
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,948
We're talking about that now. That hotel.

505
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:20,608
You're no longer my mom.

506
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:23,808
Starting now, you and I are finished.

507
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:25,968
We really are finished!

508
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:40,548
- Ms. Park! 
 - It's Park Do Ra! Park Do Ra!

509
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:44,398
Were you really paid to be at the Hanseo Hotel?

510
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:46,038
Paid? What do you mean?

511
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:48,758
The whole world is talking about your prostitution.

512
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:51,218
Are you really playing innocent right now?

513
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:52,728
Prostitution?

514
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:55,108
Excuse me, watch what you say!

515
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:56,628
You were at the Hanseo Hotel, too, right?

516
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,308
Why did you go there, then?

517
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:01,588
Hanseo Hotel? I was there for a meeting for a commercial.

518
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:03,238
Who has a meeting in a hotel room?

519
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,198
You went alone to sign a contract?

520
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:06,918
Was it because of your mother's gambling debt?

521
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,958
It's not true. I didn't get paid for sex.

522
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,668
- Excuse me, Ms. Park! 
 - It's not true!

523
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:14,948
 Please say something! Ms. Park! Ms. Park! 

524
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:18,038
 Say something, Ms. Park! 

525
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,208
 Park Do Ra! 

526
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:02,088
   

527
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:05,608
   

528
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,170
   

529
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:19,208
W-What's all this?

530
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,808
What's all this?

531
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:26,550
This isn't right.

532
00:40:27,078 --> 00:40:29,578
This isn't right!

533
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,888
This isn't right... This isn't...

534
00:40:35,248 --> 00:40:37,018
No!

535
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,648
 No! I didn't do it! 

536
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:46,358
Excuse me, how could you write that without doing research?

537
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:48,538
Do Ra has never done that.

538
00:40:48,538 --> 00:40:51,588
She's not that kind of a person!

539
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:53,138
We...

540
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:56,828
We didn't know about the hotel meeting, either.

541
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:59,578
She was tricked to go there.

542
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:02,038
Hello?

543
00:41:02,038 --> 00:41:03,658
Hello?

544
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,868
 The number you dialed doesn't exist... 

545
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:11,748
It says the number doesn't exist. It's not going through. Is this the right number?

546
00:41:11,748 --> 00:41:14,588
Yes, it's exactly as it says.

547
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:17,468
- Are you sure it was an ad agency? 
 - Yes!

548
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:20,388
 Please check and try again. 

549
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:24,608
Mom, I think someone put us in a trap.

550
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,768
What? A trap?

551
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:31,448
What if someone harasses her for not repaying the debt?

552
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,828
Mom, what do we do with Do Ra?

553
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:38,008
I mean, who could it be? Who?

554
00:41:38,008 --> 00:41:42,888
They can't destroy me if they want me to pay back.

555
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:46,438
That's why she should've gotten engaged to President Gong.

556
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,948
This wouldn't have happened if she did.

557
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:51,948
Do Sik, what do we do now?

558
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:55,768
We can't live in Korea. How could we live here with our heads held up?

559
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:58,868
How will we make a living? I don't want to go to jail!

560
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:01,678
Do Sik, what will we do now? What do we do?

561
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:03,068
Mom!

562
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:05,888
That's not the problem right now.

563
00:42:05,888 --> 00:42:07,248
What will we do with Do Ra?

564
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,938
She can't be reached right now!

565
00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:14,638
Mom, what if she tried to do something terrible?

566
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:17,848
No, no. Should we report her missing now?

567
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:23,128
Hey, are you crazy? If we report her missing now, the media will say she's dead. Don't you know?

568
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:26,508
Hey, just text her and tell her to come back.

569
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:28,668
We... We need to run away abroad.

570
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:31,578
We can't live here, I said!

571
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:34,588
Okay.

572
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:40,138
   

573
00:42:40,138 --> 00:42:43,508
   

574
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:49,188
She must've learned her place now.

575
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:51,778
That she's nothing now.

576
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:56,648
She'll come to me soon and...

577
00:42:56,648 --> 00:42:59,508
desperately beg to spare her life.

578
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:16,888
H-Hye Seong,

579
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:20,018
Seon Min, Seon Hee.

580
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:23,858
The articles are not true.

581
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:32,488
I've been nothing but your fan over 10 years.

582
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:36,578
I've been the president of your fan club for almost 10 years, too.

583
00:43:36,578 --> 00:43:37,878
Guys.

584
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:41,598
So, regarding your mom's debt and your nude photoshoot...

585
00:43:41,598 --> 00:43:44,708
we've been defending you by making comments all over the internet.

586
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,588
Because you didn't do anything wrong. But what's this now?

587
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:51,648
I'll be your hater for 10 years from now on.

588
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,868
No, I'll hate you forever! Forever!

589
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:55,768
Guys, I didn't do it.

590
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:57,948
I-I didn't do it, guys.

591
00:43:57,948 --> 00:44:01,668
I'll have a press conference, too. Guys...

592
00:44:01,668 --> 00:44:04,798
Please believe me. Please believe me.

593
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:07,708
- I could explain... 
 - Stop making excuses! It's disgusting.

594
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,018
We shut down the fan club.

595
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:13,768
So, do whatever you want to do.

596
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:18,978
No.

597
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:22,018
I didn't do it, guys.

598
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:25,698
Guys! Guys, I didn't do it.

599
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:28,978
I didn't do it, guys!

600
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:31,208
Please believe me.

601
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:34,348
Guys, guys...

602
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:39,058
Guys, I... I didn't do it.

603
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:41,558
Please believe me just once.

604
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:44,958
Guys! Guys...

605
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:50,358
I... I didn't do it. I...

606
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:59,008
The broadcasting station decided to ban Park Do Ra permanently.

607
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:02,578
Pardon? Ban her permanently?

608
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,328
Director, is that true?

609
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,008
Cancel the scheduled meeting.

610
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:11,608
I've been fond of Do Ra for a long time,

611
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,368
she made "Straightforward Romance" a success, and she's a hard worker.

612
00:45:15,368 --> 00:45:20,818
So, I tried to give her another chance despite her mom's debt.

613
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,468
But there's nothing I can do now.

614
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:26,298
Okay, I understand.

615
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:29,208
How could she take things this far?

616
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:34,968
She lost all of her money, and she's in debt because of her mom, but prostitution?

617
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:38,708
That's not right, is it?

618
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:49,948
Hyung, what was he talking about just now?

619
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:52,828
Park Do Ra did what?

620
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:55,518
You haven't seen the articles yet?

621
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:58,388
Park Do Ra is all over the news now.

622
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:02,968
Is that why the engagement with President Gong got canceled, too?

623
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,588
   

624
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:08,248
Park Do Ra can't come back anymore.

625
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:10,448
She's totally done for.

626
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:21,978
   

627
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:25,778
 Oppa, can we meet up for a moment? 

628
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:28,378
 I need to tell you something for the last time. 

629
00:46:35,678 --> 00:46:37,408
Oppa.

630
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:43,318
What brings you here?

631
00:46:44,728 --> 00:46:47,458
I have something I need to tell you.

632
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,798
But you didn't answer my text, so...

633
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,108
What is it?

634
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:56,788
We shouldn't be seeing each other anymore.

635
00:46:56,788 --> 00:46:58,558
Oppa.

636
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,818
You saw the article, too, right?

637
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:05,108
The article is wrong.

638
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:08,408
Even if everyone else gets me wrong,

639
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,078
I don't want you to think of me that way.

640
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:14,368
None of that is true.

641
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:16,848
It was all fabricated.

642
00:47:17,528 --> 00:47:20,288
That's why I...

643
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,298
c-came here to tell you this.

644
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:31,558
What's with the photo taken at the hotel?

645
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,448
T-That's...

646
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:37,638
I went there because I was told it was a meeting for a commercial.

647
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:39,258
Park Do Ra.

648
00:47:40,298 --> 00:47:43,438
I didn't know you were this low.

649
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,948
The fact you chose a wealthy man over me because you're crazy about money?

650
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,848
Sure, I tried to understand it because...

651
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:55,658
you can't help the situation you're in, but...

652
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,218
I know you're money-obsessed,

653
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:02,728
but you can't do something like that.

654
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:06,488
Oppa.

655
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:10,078
How much does one have to pay you to do that?

656
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,688
Why do you live like this?

657
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:15,658
How did you live your life all this time?

658
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:22,468
No.

659
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:26,158
How you live doesn't concern me.

660
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:28,798
Live however you want.

661
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:30,438
Instead,

662
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:33,828
don't ever show up in front of me again.

663
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:43,438
 Dad, don't die. 

664
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,588
 Dad, you aren't going to die, right? 

665
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:48,298
 Do Ra, 

666
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:52,108
 later... 

667
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:54,838
 we'll meet again. 

668
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:57,618
 Later when? 

669
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:01,058
 Don't die, Dad. Don't die. 

670
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:03,148
 Do Ra... 

671
00:50:03,988 --> 00:50:06,528
 I have a favor to ask you. 

672
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,858
 What favor? 

673
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:14,758
 Please take good care of Mom, 

674
00:50:16,898 --> 00:50:19,298
 Oppa, and Do Joon. 

675
00:50:20,188 --> 00:50:22,278
 Dad... 

676
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:25,198
 Dad... 

677
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:27,208
 You're... 

678
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:33,788
 so young, yet I'm asking you this. 

679
00:50:36,288 --> 00:50:38,178
 I'm sorry. 

680
00:50:39,098 --> 00:50:41,558
 No, no, it's okay. 

681
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:42,888
 It's okay, Dad. 

682
00:50:42,888 --> 00:50:46,018
 Don't worry about anything, okay? 

683
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:54,658
 Dad... 

684
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:58,448
 Dad! 

685
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:02,128
 Dad! No, Dad! 

686
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:04,058
 Don't go, Dad! 

687
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:05,388
 Dad! 

688
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,678
 Dad! No! 

689
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:10,168
 - Honey! Honey! 
 - No! 

690
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:14,388
 - Dad... 
 - I'll start the CPR. 

691
00:51:21,038 --> 00:51:22,898
Dad...

692
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:29,478
I lived diligently.

693
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:33,098
You know, right?

694
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:40,298
I tried to be as good as you asked me to.

695
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,908
You know that, right?

696
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:53,728
But the world says I'm not.

697
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,958
They say I'm dirty.

698
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:01,678
They hate me.

699
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:06,898
Dad...

700
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:11,818
I...

701
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:18,158
no longer have the confidence to live as Park Do Ra.

702
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:22,828
Dad...

703
00:52:25,738 --> 00:52:28,068
Dad, I...

704
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:35,478
no longer have the hope to go on.

705
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:43,598
You'd still understand me, right?

706
00:52:46,608 --> 00:52:48,818
Dad...

707
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:57,178
Dad...

708
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:18,328
 Oppa, 

709
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:21,608
 I'll be with Dad first. 

710
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:24,278
 Please take good care of Do Joon. 

711
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:27,258
Do Ra... What does she mean?

712
00:53:27,258 --> 00:53:29,888
M-Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

713
00:53:29,888 --> 00:53:34,078
Mom, wake up! Mom...

714
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:37,098
What? What...

715
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:51,738
Don't be mistaken?

716
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:54,698
About what?

717
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:58,478
Give me a break.

718
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:01,378
Give me a break.

719
00:54:06,498 --> 00:54:08,548
You think I'm a joke?

720
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:14,008
Why did she come to see me?

721
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:29,188
   

722
00:55:06,078 --> 00:55:09,318
   

723
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:12,218
   

724
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:53,928
 You saw the article, too, right? 

725
00:55:53,928 --> 00:55:56,468
 The article is wrong. 

726
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:58,878
 Even if everyone else gets me wrong, 

727
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:02,888
 I don't want you to think of me that way. 

728
00:56:15,068 --> 00:56:17,668
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

729
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:19,638
Call Park Do Ra's manager now.

730
00:56:19,638 --> 00:56:21,718
Tell him to tell Park Do Ra to call me.

731
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:25,648
She won't answer my call. She won't read my texts, either.

732
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:26,888
Why do you want to talk to her?

733
00:56:26,888 --> 00:56:34,008
Well, I think someone planned this to ruin her career.

734
00:56:34,008 --> 00:56:36,218
What do you mean by that?

735
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:38,328
The man in the hotel room...

736
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:42,008
A cinematographer I know thinks he's a reenactment actor.

737
00:56:42,008 --> 00:56:46,118
He said he's definitely an actor he worked with a long time ago.

738
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:48,128
- Is that true? 
 - Yes.

739
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:51,308
So I told Reporter Kim Cheol Soo from the newsroom to look into it, too.

740
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:55,448
I wanted to give her that important information, but I can't reach her.

741
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:58,598
Geez, I have a bad feeling for some reason.

742
00:56:58,598 --> 00:57:04,388
I'm worried she might make an extreme decision.

743
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:07,018
Geez, geez!

744
00:57:17,448 --> 00:57:23,158
 Oppa, I said I liked you. But it was all a lie. 

745
00:57:23,158 --> 00:57:26,298
 I was playing with you because I was bored. 

746
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:29,078
 So, forget a terrible person like me. 

747
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,738
 Be happy, Oppa. 

748
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:33,308
What...

749
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:38,218
W-W-What does this mean?

750
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:46,578
 The phone is turned off. 

751
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:50,198
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

752
00:57:50,198 --> 00:57:52,280
 Once you get connected... 

753
00:57:52,948 --> 00:57:56,438
Jae Dong, since when did you lose touch with Park Do Ra?

754
00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:58,828
 She sent me a weird text and can't be reached. 

755
00:57:58,828 --> 00:58:03,068
 So, our vice president reported her missing to the police. 

756
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:08,568
Jae Dong, make sure to let me know if you reach her. Promise.

757
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:18,988
   

758
00:58:18,988 --> 00:58:20,838
What is that?

759
00:58:23,038 --> 00:58:26,188
   

760
00:58:31,938 --> 00:58:33,528
No.

761
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:36,228
No.

762
00:58:36,228 --> 00:58:38,308
   

763
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:41,498
That's wrong.

764
00:58:44,808 --> 00:58:47,138
Park Do Ra wouldn't do that.

765
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:57,048
Cheol Soo, what's with the news saying Park Do Ra's dead?

766
00:58:57,048 --> 00:58:58,848
That was an error, right?

767
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:00,168
 It's not. 

768
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:04,028
 A CCTV captured her jumping into the ocean 

769
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:06,298
 and her suicide note was found, too. 

770
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:09,758
What did you say?

771
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:11,478
 The body hasn't been found yet, 

772
00:59:11,478 --> 00:59:14,618
 but they had to stop searching because of the high tide warning. 

773
00:59:15,408 --> 00:59:19,918
She's not dead if the body wasn't found.

774
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:23,408
Why are you announcing that she's dead first?

775
00:59:25,408 --> 00:59:27,298
No.

776
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,798
Park Do Ra isn't dead.

777
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:31,708
She isn't.

778
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:34,948
There's no way she did that.

779
00:59:40,398 --> 00:59:42,708
Park Do Ra!

780
00:59:44,888 --> 00:59:47,028
Park Do Ra!

781
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:52,138
Do Ra!

782
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:57,558
Please stop playing around!

783
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:02,248
I believe you!

784
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:07,188
Even if no one does,

785
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:11,198
I believe you!

786
01:00:12,668 --> 01:00:15,278
So come back!

787
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:19,218
I'm sorry.

788
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:22,948
It's my fault.

789
01:00:24,128 --> 01:00:27,298
I didn't mean what I said!

790
01:00:29,388 --> 01:00:32,648
So, please come back!

791
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:36,668
Do Ra!

792
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,958
Do Ra!

793
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:43,218
Please...

794
01:00:44,468 --> 01:00:47,868
Please come back!

795
01:00:49,928 --> 01:00:52,608
Do Ra!

796
01:00:56,708 --> 01:01:00,308
Park Do Ra!

797
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:05,778
Do Ra...

798
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:56,878
Are you making dumplings?

799
01:01:56,878 --> 01:02:01,188
Yes. Pil Sung can't eat anything.

800
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:03,608
Yes, you should let him eat dumplings.

801
01:02:03,608 --> 01:02:06,458
It'd be a disaster if he passed out.

802
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,308
We'll have dumplings using him as an excuse, too.

803
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,408
You should make some, too.

804
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:17,078
By the way, it's a good thing she died after breaking up with him.

805
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:20,708
What if she died while dating him? That would've been terrible.

806
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:25,488
That woman was punished by the heavens.

807
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:27,938
How could she let her young daughter die first

808
01:02:27,938 --> 01:02:32,288
and swallow any food?

809
01:02:32,288 --> 01:02:35,708
And that rumor of her prostitution...

810
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:38,548
I'm sure her mother forced her to.

811
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:40,718
Because of her gambling debt.

812
01:02:40,718 --> 01:02:45,218
But still, how could you do that to your child?

813
01:02:45,218 --> 01:02:47,578
Mother, please stop talking about that.

814
01:02:47,578 --> 01:02:49,988
Pil Sung might hear you.

815
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:51,798
Okay.

816
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,848
 The man in the hotel room... 

817
01:02:55,848 --> 01:02:59,538
 A cinematographer I know thinks he's a reenactment actor. 

818
01:02:59,538 --> 01:03:03,668
 He said he's definitely an actor he worked with a long time ago. 

819
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,578
Who the hell are you?

820
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:21,598
Who are you, and why did you do that?

821
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,918
A woman died because of you.

822
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:27,428
She died after suffering an unbelievable amount of shame.

823
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,158
Reveal the truth now.

824
01:03:29,158 --> 01:03:31,998
Come clean about what you did!

825
01:03:31,998 --> 01:03:35,628
I just took on a part-time job!

826
01:03:39,158 --> 01:03:42,688
They said they'd pay me two million per day.

827
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:47,698
I was just doing a part-time job.

828
01:03:49,768 --> 01:03:52,188
Who hired you to do that?

829
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:07,378
When is Ji Yeong coming back?

830
01:04:07,378 --> 01:04:11,388
Her grandmother is waiting for her like this.

831
01:04:11,388 --> 01:04:16,078
Where is she that she can't come back?

832
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:21,768
Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong!

833
01:04:21,768 --> 01:04:26,358
Aigoo, my baby! Ji Yeong!

834
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:36,688
My gosh, w-what's that?

835
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:40,518
What...

836
01:04:40,518 --> 01:04:42,888
Is that Ji Yeong?

837
01:04:42,888 --> 01:04:45,328
Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

838
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:48,998
Hey! Ji Yeong! Hey!

839
01:04:50,248 --> 01:04:53,218
   

840
01:04:53,218 --> 01:04:57,248
♫  It's you in the end  ♫

841
01:04:57,248 --> 01:05:04,988
♫  You made me smile countless times  ♫

842
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:10,338
♫  At night, when there's no light  ♫

843
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:16,268
♫  You shine even brighter  ♫

844
01:05:16,268 --> 01:05:25,428
♫  Even if you ask me a thousand times  ♫

845
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:27,508
 This isn't right! 

846
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:31,428
 How am I supposed to live? 

847
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:36,968
 Put your hand on your heart and think about why I'm haunting you. 

848
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,728
 I'm Do Ra. Park Do Ra. 

849
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:42,408
 The world killed Do Ra. 

850
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:45,898
 The people pushed her off the cliff. 

851
01:05:45,898 --> 01:05:50,168
 Pil Sung has been working like a madman since Do Ra died. 

852
01:05:50,168 --> 01:05:52,208
 He's successful now. 

853
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:55,708
 Do Ra, are you okay? 

854
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,078
 You're doing well, right? 

855
01:05:57,078 --> 01:06:03,200
♫  The name that lingers on the tip of my tongue  ♫
