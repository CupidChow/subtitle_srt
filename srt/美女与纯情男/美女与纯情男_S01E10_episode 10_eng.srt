1
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,340
Oh, right. 
    

2
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,230
I saw Pil Sung earlier today.

3
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,360
What did you say? Why would you see him?

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,640
Why are you so shocked about that?

5
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,540
Am I not supposed to see him?

6
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,690
N-No, it's not like that, but...

7
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,140
Why... How did you get to see him?

8
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,110
Did you reach out to him first?

9
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,080
No, I didn't. I don't even have his phone number.

10
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,240
I just ran into him.

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,770
I guess he filmed in front of our building today.

12
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,440
So, I had tea with him since I was happy to see him.

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,690
Oh, I see.

14
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,140
By the way, he seems like a nice fellow.

15
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,930
The more I see him, the more I like him.

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,290
Oh, really?

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,860
Since we're on the topic, Honey...

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,530
What do you think of him as Ma Ri's significant other?

19
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,370
W-What did you say?

20
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,590
W-What are you talking about?

21
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,470
Ma Ri's significant other?

22
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,560
I...

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,410
really want Pil Sung.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,850
H-Honey.

25
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,620
I haven't seen him many times but for some reason,

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,560
I really find him dependable and likable.

27
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:27,220
And he's your friend, Seon Yeong's son. So he's trustworthy.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,240
I think someone like him could...

29
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,310
take good care of our Ma Ri.

30
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,290
How about you try to bring it up with Seon Yeong?

31
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,350
Honey, that makes no sense.

32
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,540
Why? Does that sound that ridiculous?

33
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:59,943
S-Seon Yeong has been living for nothing but her son.

34
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:04,863
But how could we ask her to protect Ma Ri

35
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:10,243
and give her son to us?

36
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:13,613
That'd be too greedy of us.

37
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:17,073
Greedy?

38
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:21,443
Even though we'd be giving everything we have?

39
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:27,673
Honey, no matter how much we have,

40
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:33,423
asking a man to devote his life to Ma Ri won't be right.

41
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,733
I can't ask Seon Yeong such a thing, Honey.

42
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:43,183
Yes, you're right. You are.

43
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:46,743
I was being too greedy.

44
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:51,683
Also, Honey, Pil Sung apparently has a girlfriend.

45
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,193
He has a girlfriend?

46
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,963
Yes.

47
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,933
I see.

48
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:04,313
We could've made a grave mistake.

49
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:14,093


50
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,593
It's so awful just thinking about it.

51
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,893
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

52
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,383
How could we give Pil Sung to our Ma Ri?

53
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:34,233
No way, no way...

54
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:45,133
What's going on with you?

55
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,583
- My gosh. 
 - Gosh, Auntie.

56
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,613
Why...

57
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:52,543
Why are you so startled?

58
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:56,083
Did you do something bad or something?

59
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,923
Pardon?

60
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,983
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

61
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:03,873
You were talking to yourself and got so startled.

62
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,493
Are you okay?

63
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:10,733
Yes, I'm okay.

64
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,483
A-Auntie, would you like something?

65
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:19,253
Well, Ms. Jo, just one moment.

66
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,243
Yes.

67
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,423
Ms. Jo, you can't come up tomorrow?

68
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:32,793
Why not?

69
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:40,073
The wind is so strong here that the flight got canceled.

70
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,443
I'll go as soon as the weather gets better and contact you.

71
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:48,303
Gosh, yes, Ms. Jo. Thank you so much.

72
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,563
Yes, call me.

73
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:56,423
Yes, so what if it gets delayed a day or two?

74
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:03,553
If Jin Taek hears about that cunning thing's past from Ms. Jo,

75
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,993
he won't just do nothing.

76
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:11,083
He can't live with her because he'd lose all his love for her.

77
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,163
Hold on.

78
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:22,963
Maybe she had the baby then, hid him somewhere,

79
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,643
and still sees him behind our backs.

80
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:29,583
Mother, why do you suddenly want to sew eyes on stuffed animals?

81
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,473
You won't make that much money doing this.

82
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:35,183
I want to earn even a little bit to contribute.

83
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:39,833
My son, Hyeon Cheol, is working his tail off at the construction site.

84
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:43,463
My gosh.

85
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,113
What? What is that?

86
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,903
Hey, look at that.

87
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:51,923
"An idiot and a fool?"

88
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,753
Look how tall he is. 
    

89
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:57,273
Why is he wearing such a thing on his back?

90
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,153
Aigoo, I wonder whose son he is.

91
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:05,763
Look at how drunk he is. Look at him. Good going.

92
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:09,303
- I know, Mother. 
 - How funny.

93
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,203
- By the way, 
 - What?

94
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:13,903
he looks like Pil Sung.

95
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,573
Mother, isn't that Pil Sung?

96
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:20,893
Come on, why would he put that on his back?

97
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:23,853
Pil Sung!

98
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:27,073
Gosh, Mother! It is our Pil Sung!

99
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,263
Hey! Hey!

100
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:32,463
Pil Sung! Pil Sung!

101
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:36,013
Huh? It's my mom.

102
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,863
Grandma's here, too.

103
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:41,013
Hey, Go Pil Sung. You...

104
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,673
What's this?

105
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:45,393
Why do you have this on your back?

106
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:47,183
What's this?

107
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,993
Idiot and a fool.

108
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:54,143
"I'm an idiot and a fool."

109
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,723
This was on my back?

110
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:03,793
Yes. Who were you with all this time?

111
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,713
Who did this to you? Who did?

112
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:10,363
I wonder.

113
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,583
How did I get this?

114
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:17,043
 Cheers. 

115
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:21,123
 - Just work, okay? 
 - Passion! 

116
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:28,343
We had a team dinner tonight. Someone must've put it as a joke.

117
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:30,083
- You had a team dinner? 
 - Yes.

118
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,623
Why would anyone do this as a joke?

119
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:37,483
Why would they call my precious son an idiot and a fool?

120
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:42,853
Not just a fool, but an idiot and a fool?

121
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:45,803
This was totally mean-spirited.

122
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:48,613
You can't just let this one slide.

123
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,563
Do you have any idea who it might've been?

124
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:54,493
Huh? Well...

125
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:58,953
You drank until you blacked out? You can't hold liquor that well.

126
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,133
Do you know how bad that is for your body?

127
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:06,083
Yes, don't drink too much. What if you made a mistake?

128
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,893
Okay, I'll be careful.

129
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,373
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

130
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:13,913
When did he ever get drunk and make a mistake?

131
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:17,603
Gosh, seriously. Why would you worry about that?

132
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,523
This isn't a big deal. So don't worry so much.

133
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:23,693
What do you mean it isn't a big deal?

134
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,583
Make sure to find out who did this, okay?

135
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,713
Okay, I will.

136
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:33,473
It's been 15 years. How could I still cry about it?

137
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:37,013
What? The clock of youth stopped?

138
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:40,643
Your heart is tearing in pieces?

139
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:45,543
He did all sorts of embarrassing things on the motorcycle then.

140
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,543
He's seriously so annoying.

141
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,893
I can't believe my heart fluttered for that Go Dae Chung.

142
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,473
I must've gone crazy for a moment.

143
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:55,553
I was out of my mind.

144
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:02,013
This is the biggest embarrassment of Park Do Ra's life.

145
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,883
Go Dae Chung...

146
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,903
I mean, Go Pil Sung.

147
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:11,023
Starting now, you're done. Done!

148
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:20,863
   

149
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,623
 This was you, wasn't it? 

150
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,893
 What's that? 

151
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:38,803
 You're playing ignorant? 

152
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,313
 I know this was you! 

153
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:43,363
Seriously...

154
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:50,313
 Excuse me, Assistant Director, why would you text an actress at this hour? 

155
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,933
 And why are you talking to me casually? 

156
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,963
 From now on, on set and even after we finish shooting, 

157
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:58,833
 treat me professionally as an assistant director. 

158
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,573
 And don't text me stuff like this in the middle of the night. 

159
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:11,693
It wasn't Park Do Ra?

160
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,753
Who was it, then?

161
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:19,883
By the way, why is she suddenly acting so seriously?

162
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,703
Did I make a mistake when I got drunk?

163
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,813
Geez, whatever. Whatever.

164
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:31,923
Not just a fool or a dummy, but an idiot and a fool?

165
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,953
I'll make sure to find out who wrote this.

166
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:38,423
I was all around town with this on my back.

167
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:40,863
How embarrassing.

168
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:49,173
Gosh, seriously.

169
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,573
Hello, Ma'am.

170
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,813
Yes, you're the young man from last night.

171
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,683
- What? Did you forget something? 
 - It's not that.

172
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:59,943
Ma'am, did you see who put this on my back by chance?

173
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:03,583
That? The lady you were with did it.

174
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,813
She asked for a pen and paper and put that on you.

175
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,673
Right? She did, right?

176
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,663
   

177
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:22,393
 Thinking about that day now is tearing my heart in pieces. 

178
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,833
 Do you understand love? 

179
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:29,833
 Do you understand a heart-wrenching love like that? 

180
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,551
Park Do Ra.

181
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:47,471
Why do you keep thinking about the curly-haired Dae Choong?

182
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:50,701
You put an end to this last night.

183
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:54,041
Don't even think about that awful, awful man.

184
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:06,601
 Do Ra, there's something I want to tell you. 

185
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:08,871
 Can we meet up right now? 

186
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,671
What? What's wrong with him?

187
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,451
What does he need to tell me all of a sudden?

188
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,051
Maybe...

189
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:50,091
Gosh, why did you make me come all the way here?

190
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:53,051
What important thing did you need to tell me?

191
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:58,781
What? You want to go to a night club?

192
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,641
   

193
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,571
I told you I didn't do it.

194
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:10,781
Did you make an actor studying a script come all the way here because of that?

195
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,721
Of course. What other reasons are there?

196
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,651
- I know you did this. 
 - I said I didn't.

197
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:18,261
And is there evidence I did it?

198
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,821
Anyway, I'm busy. I'll go.

199
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:25,531
Hold on. There's evidence.

200
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:30,881
You asked me to lend you paper, pen, and tape yesterday.

201
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:34,931
And you wrote, "I'm an idiot and a fool," and put it on his back.

202
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:40,991
And you asked me not to tell this young man you did it.

203
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:44,221
That's why I didn't say anything.

204
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:47,561
I thought you were just a couple joking around.

205
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,851
Ma'am, a couple? We're not like that at all.

206
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:58,071
Oppa, did you bring me all the way here just to punish me?

207
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,481
Of course, I did. What other reasons are there?

208
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:03,901
By the way, hold on.

209
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,671
This lady looks very familiar.

210
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,791
Aren't you a celebrity who's on TV?

211
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,211
No, I'm not, Ma'am.

212
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,461
Take care.

213
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:15,561
I'll be back soon, Ma'am. Thank you.

214
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:23,351
Park Do Ra, why did you put this on me?

215
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:25,321
Do you look down on me because I'm a staff?

216
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:28,701
Do you think I'm a joke? Or did I wrong you somehow?

217
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:31,051
Let's say I did.

218
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:33,251
How could you put this on me?

219
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:35,811
There's a limit to a joke.

220
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,171
Are you still 12 years old?

221
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,361
I didn't know this was on my back.

222
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,271
I was all around town from here to my house.

223
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,291
The whole neighborhood laughed at me

224
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,571
and even my mom and grandma saw me.

225
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:51,261
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

226
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:54,461
Let's hear the reason, at least.

227
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,381
Why are you doing this to me?

228
00:15:56,381 --> 00:16:00,421
If there's something that I've done wrong, I'd rather you talk to me about it!

229
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:10,951
Do you really not know why I did that?

230
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:13,161
I don't. I don't, I said.

231
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,781
I'm asking because I don't know.

232
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:17,511
You really are an idiot and a fool.

233
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,821
W-What? What did you say?

234
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:23,521
I like you.

235
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,671
I did that because I like you.

236
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:30,031
What?

237
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,831
But what did you say to me?

238
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:35,971
Your heart is still tearing up because of Jeong Mi?

239
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,221
And you even cried?

240
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:44,151
The half of men in this country love me, and while I'm sitting in front of you,

241
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,351
how could you cry talking about another woman?

242
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:48,441
How could you be so pathetic?

243
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,531
Doesn't that make you an idiot and a fool? That's why I did it.

244
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:56,881
I've been hinting at the fact that I like you countless times, but you didn't notice it once.

245
00:16:56,881 --> 00:17:00,711
That makes you an idiot and a fool, you idiot and a fool!

246
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:09,221
Do Ra, what are you saying? You're...

247
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:12,621
joking out of embarrassment because you got caught, right?

248
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:16,281
Why would you say that after I said all that?

249
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,391
I'm not joking.

250
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:22,671
I'm very, very serious right now.

251
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:24,531
I'm serious.

252
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:29,171
I'm not joking. So listen carefully.

253
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,481
I like you, Oppa.

254
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:41,901
I've been liking you even when I didn't know you were Dae Chung.

255
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,751
So, we'll start dating starting today.

256
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:47,961
Today is our day 1, okay?

257
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:53,601
Well, Do Ra, I...

258
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,501
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

259
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,321
Get home safely.

260
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,951
You need to answer! You can't just leave!

261
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,731
Anyway, we're dating starting today!

262
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:12,611
What do you mean we're dating?

263
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,401
I don't like you.

264
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,481
I don't want to date you.

265
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,881
What?

266
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,531
You don't like me?

267
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,841
You don't want to date me?

268
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,881
I heard you wrong just now, right?

269
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,541
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,771
I really don't like you.

271
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,661
No way.

272
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:38,471
How could you not like me?

273
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:44,271
Are you playing hard to get right now?

274
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,351
No, Do Ra.

275
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,971
I'm really not interested in dating you.

276
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,651
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said.

277
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:56,851
So, let's not be awkward on set. We'll be professional.

278
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,491
I'll get going.

279
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,271
No way.

280
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,811
What just happened?

281
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,221
He's shocked. He's in shock right now.

282
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:21,071
He's shocked because I suddenly told him how I feel.

283
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:24,851
I suppose. Any man would be in shock if I said I liked him.

284
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,061
Of course, he's in shock.

285
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:30,991
Once he comes to his senses and calms down,

286
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:34,811
he'll contact me later, I'm sure.

287
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:49,731
Park Do Ra... She was so straightforward back then, too.

288
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,271
What's wrong with her? She's got me all confused.

289
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,401
Gosh, whatever.

290
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:58,461
Is this Ms. Kim Seon Yeong's residence? Ms. Jang Soo Yeon sent this.

291
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,341
Oh, yes. Thank you.

292
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:03,831
Well, thank you.

293
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:08,561
- Gosh. 
 - What's that? Hey, what's all that?

294
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:11,061
What's all this, anyway?

295
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:13,991
Your friend, the chaebol wife, sent stuff again?

296
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:18,001
Yes. I don't know why she sent so much. She always makes me feel bad.

297
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,061
Bring everything here. What's all in there?

298
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:24,311
Wow, the fruit looks so fresh and tasty.

299
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,941
Hey, what's all that? Yellow croakers?

300
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,601
- And this. This is Korean beef, right? 
 - Yes.

301
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:33,541
And that's... Wow, it's that expensive Jeju beltfish.

302
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,581
What's this now? What is it?

303
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,241
I can't tell what's in here.

304
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:40,361
Let me see. Let me see...

305
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,051
Rice cakes. They're rice cakes.

306
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,231
Gosh, why are they so pretty?

307
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:46,331
Gosh, look at these colors.

308
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,841
Aigoo, this looks so good.

309
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:52,781
Let's see. Let's see. Let me try some.

310
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,421
- It's pink. 
 - Looks good.

311
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:03,791
Hey, it's so chewy and subtly sweet. It's so good.

312
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,331
Myeong Dong, you should try one, too.

313
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,751
You should... T-Try this one.

314
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,391
Isn't it so good?

315
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,341
- Gosh, it's good. 
 - Right? Right?

316
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,411
Unni, you should try one, too.

317
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:23,211
- Gosh, seriously. Why is it so pretty? 
 - So pretty.

318
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:28,241
Gosh, how could it be so tasty?

319
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,301
I'm home!

320
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,411
Pil Sung, what brings you...

321
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:35,921
- Hey, Pil Sung. 
 - What brings you home so early?

322
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,561
I deserve a break sometimes.

323
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:38,931
By the way, what's all this?

324
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,371
Hey, Pil Sung...

325
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:46,591
Your mom's friend, that chaebol wife sent all this stuff again.

326
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:51,991
And she remembered to send your favorite, the Jeju beltfish, this time, too.

327
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,581
- Soo Yeon Ahjumma did? 
 - Yeah.

328
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:55,191
Pil Sung, try one, too.

329
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:57,791
They're so soft and tasty.

330
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:02,121
Seon Yeong, you're so lucky to have a friend like this.

331
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,701
Listen to this. She sends meat when we're almost out of meat.

332
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,961
She sends fish when we're almost out of fish.

333
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,451
My goodness, no one has a friend like that.

334
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,661
I know.

335
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:17,621
I feel so grateful and guilty, too.

336
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:21,161
I don't know how to return this favor.

337
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:25,331
Right. Soo Yeon Ahjumma's husband, the chairman, got me coffee yesterday.

338
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:30,331
What? Chairman Gong got you coffee? Really?

339
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,521
How?

340
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:36,531
I ran into him while we were shooting in front of APP Group.

341
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:40,201
Did he suggest getting coffee first?

342
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:45,751
Yes. I was initially surprised and nervous because he's such an important person.

343
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:48,141
But he made me feel so comfortable.

344
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:51,401
So, what did you talk about while drinking coffee?

345
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,391
Well, he asked what I ate to get so tall.

346
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:57,361
He asked if I enjoy my job and what kind of drama I want to make.

347
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:58,771
- Stuff like that. 
 - My goodness.

348
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,761
Hey, you're really successful now.

349
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:05,621
You had a coffee alone with the chairman of APP Group, too.

350
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:08,551
Not just anyone can have a coffee with someone like him.

351
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:09,951
I know.

352
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:14,071
Pil Sung, you can brag about that somewhere.

353
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:21,271
Gosh, I should've taken a photo with him then. I forgot to do that.

354
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,311
What a shame.

355
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:34,901
Hey, Seon Yeong.

356
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:37,861
What? You're in front of my house?

357
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:47,583
Gosh, it's so delicious.

358
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,223
You're the best.

359
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:53,173
I'm so happy that you like it.

360
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:58,013
By the way, how did you carry such a heavy thing? I feel so bad.

361
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,713
Gosh, don't mention it.

362
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:03,423
I'm the one who should be feeling bad.

363
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:09,673
Soo Yeon, stop sending us beef and stuff like that.

364
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:12,323
I feel so shameless to take stuff all the time.

365
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:15,763
All I can do is to make you kimchi like this.

366
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,303
What are you talking about?

367
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:23,263
Jin Taek and Ma Ri love the kimchi you made.

368
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:26,653
I get so worried whenever I'm out of your kimchi.

369
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,273
Is that true?

370
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:32,903
You should ask me anytime. I can always make them for you.

371
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:36,633
I didn't want to trouble you. It's not so easy to make kimchi.

372
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:41,773
Gosh, it's okay. Just ask me anytime.

373
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,733
This isn't hard at all compared to what you do for me.

374
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:49,903
I'm dying to do anything for you. Okay?

375
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:52,933
Really? Okay, okay.

376
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,283
- Thank you. 
 - My gosh.

377
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:59,683
By the way, looks like Ae Gyo isn't home.

378
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:02,093
I don't know. I guess she went out.

379
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:04,233
 Honey, I'm home. 

380
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:07,003
Gosh, hello, Seon Yeong.

381
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:08,813
Hello.

382
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,563
You came home early today.

383
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:15,153
Honey, Seon Yeong brought yeolmu kimchi and mul kimchi, your favorite.

384
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:19,183
Really? My mouth is watering just hearing that.

385
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:23,263
Thank you. We always enjoy the kimchi you make.

386
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:29,413
Gosh, it's nothing. I'm just grateful you enjoy it.

387
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:34,973
By the way, I heard you got Pil Sung coffee.

388
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:38,993
You said kind things to him, too. Thank you so much.

389
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:43,273
Yes, I noticed how nice of a young man he became.

390
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:48,603
He became such a nice young man and now has a girlfriend.

391
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:50,963
It made me feel so happy.

392
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:52,543
Pardon?

393
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:56,753
Pil Sung doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

394
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:59,753
Did he say he has a girlfriend?

395
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:01,843
Well, no.

396
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,803
She told me that.

397
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:07,103
That he has a girlfriend.

398
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:11,053
Gosh, Soo Yeon. Did you see his girlfriend?

399
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:14,873
Huh? Well, the thing is...

400
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,893
I'll tell you later.

401
00:26:16,893 --> 00:26:18,563
Honey, go inside and take a shower.

402
00:26:18,563 --> 00:26:20,693
Seon Yeong needs to go and prepare dinner, too.

403
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:23,823
Okay, ask Mr. Kang to drive her home.

404
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,823
No, no, it's okay.

405
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:29,223
No, get home comfortably. And visit us often.

406
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:32,133
Okay, take care, then.

407
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,923
- I'll see her off. 
 - Okay.

408
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:48,036
By the way, Soo Yeon, what was that about? Pil Sung has a girlfriend?

409
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:51,136
Did you see him with his girlfriend?

410
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,796
No, it's not that...

411
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:57,306
My husband said he turned out to be so handsome.

412
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,626
He said he must have a lot of girlfriends. So I said, "Probably." And he's saying that now.

413
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:03,626
So I said, "Probably." And he's saying that now.

414
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:05,216
Oh, I see.

415
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:06,696
Get in now.

416
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:08,436
Oh, okay.

417
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:15,206
Mr. Kang, drive her safely.

418
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:17,056
See you later.

419
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:19,856
Okay, see you. Thank you.

420
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,416
Bye.

421
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:42,296
What's with Soo Yeon today?

422
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:47,596
Pil Sung doesn't have a girlfriend. Why did she say he does?

423
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:01,946
 I like you, Oppa. 

424
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:06,126
 I like you. I like you! 

425
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,646
The more I think, the more ridiculous it gets.

426
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,836
It's day one starting today?

427
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:16,226
Do I have to date her if she says she likes me?

428
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:22,626
Why did she suddenly tell me that and provoke me?

429
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:25,356
We have a shoot tomorrow.

430
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:28,656
Why did she suddenly have to say that?

431
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:32,146
She's making me uncomfortable. Seriously.

432
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:38,176
How am I supposed to face her now?

433
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,886
- Jae Dong, please hand this out. 
 - Okay.

434
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:44,326
Seong Hwan.

435
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,636
Dae Chung...

436
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:16,736
Pil Sung.

437
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,156
What is it, Ms. Park?

438
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:21,676
You promised not to do this on set.

439
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,916
Is your phone broken, by chance?

440
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,016
No, it's fine.

441
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,746
Why don't you contact me, then?

442
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:33,026
Do you really not like me, by chance?

443
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:36,036
Come on. That's not true, right?

444
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:53,096
Seriously, what's wrong with you? We're at work.

445
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:58,116
Oppa, I totally understand why you were shocked yesterday.

446
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:01,986
An actress confessed her love to you. How could you believe that?

447
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:05,296
You must've wondered if you were dreaming or not.

448
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:09,146
But it's true that I like you.

449
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:11,296
It's not a dream.

450
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:18,016
To be honest, I don't believe that you don't like me.

451
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,096
How could you not like me?

452
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:22,776
That's just not possible.

453
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:28,856
If it's because I'm an A-list actor and you're an assistant director,

454
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:30,916
don't worry about that at all.

455
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,806
I'm really okay.

456
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:36,466
Oppa, why don't we just try dating?

457
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:38,106
You have feelings for me, too.

458
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:42,136
Do Ra, I'm not interested in that.

459
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:47,026
Do you...

460
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,596
really not like me?

461
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,346
- No. 
 - How does that make sense?

462
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:54,926
Okay, okay.

463
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:59,956
Give me three reasons you don't like me so I can understand.

464
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:03,516
I'll reconsider if they're good reasons.

465
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:05,926
See? You don't have any, do you?

466
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:08,076
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

467
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:12,066
One, I don't like pushy women like you.

468
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,776
Two, you wrote "I'm an idiot and a fool" on my back.

469
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:16,716
I don't like women who look down on people like that.

470
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:21,206
And lastly, you're not my type. Okay?

471
00:31:24,856 --> 00:31:26,726
How does that make sense?

472
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:29,676
How does that make sense?

473
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,806
Ms. Park, what is it? Huh?

474
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,186
- What's going on now? 
 - Pardon?

475
00:31:33,186 --> 00:31:34,786
Did Go Pil Sung say something again?

476
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:36,286
N-No.

477
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:38,166
- It's nothing. 
 - Hyung,

478
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:41,146
I didn't do anything wrong, okay?

479
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:43,726
Did he talk behind your back again?

480
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:45,666
No, well...

481
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:50,086
There was just a tiny bit of disagreement.

482
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:54,666
So, please don't say anything to Assistant Director Go.

483
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:59,476
What's going on now? Why do this toward the end?

484
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:02,286
How could they be the reasons he doesn't like me?

485
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,406
I'm not his type?

486
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:07,926
Wow, that makes no sense at all.

487
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:16,186
Well, I know he likes me, too.

488
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,466
Why is he doing this, anyway?

489
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,996
The karaoke and the photo booth were fun. Everything was so fun today.

490
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,006
Shall we meet up next weekend, too?

491
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:42,216
Yes, yes. Let's go to a theme park next weekend, then.

492
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:44,196
Theme park? Okay, deal!

493
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,826
- Bye, Unni. 
 - See you, Unni.

494
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:47,566
Yes, bye.

495
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,026
See you next weekend.

496
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:54,506
Lulu, we should leave, too.

497
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:02,526
It's a crane game machine!

498
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:10,836
Lulu, I took out a lot of coins today.

499
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:14,136
I'll make sure to get you a friend today.

500
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:35,986
Again.

501
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:37,646
Yes.

502
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,226
Wow.

503
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,796
That's the one I really wanted.

504
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:45,806
Do you want this doll?

505
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:48,956
Yes, it's cute.

506
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:56,196
The shop over there has many more prettier dolls.

507
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:58,896
I'll get you more. Do you want to come with me?

508
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:01,756
Really? Yes, let's.

509
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:10,856
Are we there yet?

510
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:14,186
I don't think there'd be a shop here.

511
00:34:15,426 --> 00:34:17,286
Excuse me.

512
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,196
I'll just leave now.

513
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:24,446
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?

514
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:26,356
There are pretty dolls there, I said.

515
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,476
I just want to leave.

516
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:30,856
- Hurry up and come! 
 - Mommy!

517
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:34,216
Mommy! Lulu! Lulu!

518
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:42,806
 Just come, I said! Hey, hey! 

519
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:43,966
- What? 
  - Help! 

520
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:46,716
- What's that noise? 
  - We're almost there. Be quiet! 

521
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:49,296
- Hurry up! Be quiet, I said! 
 - Go away!

522
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,676
Hey! Do you want to die?

523
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,786
   

524
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,936
- Ma Ri! Ma Ri! 
 - Ma Ri!

525
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:00,776
- Ma Ri!  
 - Dad!

526
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,226
-  Ma Ri! 
 - Mom! Dad!

527
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,576
Yes, yes!

528
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:05,606
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.

529
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,636
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.

530
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:10,056
Dad is here now. It's okay.

531
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:12,176
What happened, Ma Ri?

532
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,516
You're okay, right?

533
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:15,766
Yes.

534
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:18,316
That bad man tried to take me away,

535
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,776
but that oppa saved me.

536
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,356
That's not true.

537
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,936
She happily followed me when I suggested going somewhere.

538
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:29,616
I didn't force her to come with me.

539
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:33,546
But she suddenly hit my head with a brick

540
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,926
and he started punching me out of nowhere.

541
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,756
This is so unfair.

542
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:40,606
You did something bad first!

543
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:45,856
You said you'd get me a pretty doll, but you dragged me to an alley.

544
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,106
I said I didn't like it, but you touched me,

545
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,786
and you did this to my clothes, too!

546
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:53,276
You son of a bitch. How dare you touch my daughter?

547
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,616
- You bastard. Come here! 
 - Stop, sir!

548
00:35:56,616 --> 00:36:00,936
- Help me! Help me! 
 - Come here!

549
00:36:01,566 --> 00:36:03,556
It'll only take a moment.

550
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:06,666
Ma Ri, how many times did I tell you?

551
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,986
I told you not to follow a stranger.

552
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:12,426
It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman.

553
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:14,016
I'm sorry, Dad.

554
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:19,146
I know that, too, but I liked his doll too much.

555
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:22,776
I wanted it as Lulu's sister. So I forgot.

556
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:26,556
And he looked nice at first.

557
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:28,146
He didn't look like a bad man—

558
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:29,656
I told you not to get fooled.

559
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:32,066
I told you not to follow anyone.

560
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:35,336
You almost got into trouble the last time this happened, too.

561
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:37,486
It was a bad man.

562
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,026
How could you just follow a random person like a fool?

563
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:42,166
Honey.

564
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,376
You promised Mom and Dad.

565
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,906
But how could you forget about it and...

566
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:51,366
Are you a child? Are you a fool?

567
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:55,706
Mom, I'm sorry.

568
00:36:55,706 --> 00:36:59,096
I'm sorry, I...

569
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:02,436
I'm sorry, I'm a fool.

570
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:12,286
No, Ma Ri. No.

571
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:15,886
I said the wrong thing.

572
00:37:15,886 --> 00:37:20,056
Ma Ri, I'm sorry.

573
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:22,996
It's not your fault.

574
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:27,716
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

575
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:29,546
I'm sorry.

576
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:34,426
Ma Ri, you're not a fool. You really aren't.

577
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:38,106
You overcame a serious accident...

578
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,766
and you endured countless difficult surgeries.

579
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:44,046
You're so strong and cool.

580
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:48,196
You're such a sweet daughter to me.

581
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:52,996
I'll never follow anyone from now on.

582
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:55,126
I promise.

583
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:59,046
So don't cry, Dad.

584
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,756
Mom, you stop crying, too.

585
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:04,676
I... I'm sorry, okay?

586
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,446
Don't cry.

587
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:09,886
Ma Ri, it's okay.

588
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:13,606
Don't do it from now on. Be careful.

589
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:16,276
It's okay.

590
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:18,666
Why are you crying?

591
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,676
 Don't cry. 

592
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,326
Auntie.

593
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,556
Something terrible could've happened today.

594
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:33,016
Ma Ri forgets about everything once she gets obsessed with something.

595
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:36,026
She follows a random person because of a cheap doll.

596
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:40,036
She's friends with little neighborhood kids at her age, too.

597
00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:41,746
What did you say?

598
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:45,336
She's friends with little neighborhood kids?

599
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:49,676
Yes. Because kids her age won't hang out with her.

600
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,816
Not only that, she buys them ice cream, and lollipops, and takes them to karaoke.

601
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:55,016
and takes them to karaoke.

602
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:59,136
They hang out with her because she spends money on them.

603
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,926
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

604
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,886
But they're talking about making her the successor

605
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:09,686
or getting her married to get a son-in-law and whatnot.

606
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:15,156
How could she find a normal person when she doesn't know what's going on?

607
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:18,186
I'm sure she'd only attract weirdos.

608
00:39:18,186 --> 00:39:22,026
Gosh, whenever something like this happens,

609
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:27,806
I feel so upset as her grandmother, Auntie.

610
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:31,806
Gosh, I feel so bad for Jin Taek.

611
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,406
My poor Jin Taek.

612
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,976
Her only daughter is like that.

613
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:41,306
He doesn't even know he's being tricked by a fox wearing a human mask.

614
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:44,266
Auntie, what do you mean by that?

615
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:47,106
A fox wearing a human mask? Who's that?

616
00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:50,506
Are you talking about Soo Yeon, Ma Ri's mom?

617
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:53,236
What do you mean? I didn't say anything.

618
00:39:53,236 --> 00:39:55,776
You should keep your mouth shut for once.

619
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,996
You don't know what's an appropriate thing to say.

620
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,406
Pardon? M-Me?

621
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:05,596
Gosh. What a dysfunctional family this is. Geez.

622
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:07,656
What did I do, exactly?

623
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:10,476
She's the one who said that.

624
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:14,276
By the way, a fox in a human mask?

625
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:16,396
What did she mean by that?

626
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,710
Yes, Ms. Jo. It's me.

627
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,770
I was waiting for your call.

628
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,440
Yes, the weather has improved here.

629
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm taking the last flight to Seoul later.

630
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
What time should we meet tomorrow?

631
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,460
Is that so?

632
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,870
Gosh, Ms. Jo. How's tomorrow morning at 11, then?

633
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,730
See you at Seoul Hotel's coffee shop at 11, then.

634
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,140
Yes, Ms. Jo. Thank you so much.

635
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,470
Get back safely.

636
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,250
Yes. The timing is better this way.

637
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,550
Ma Ri's in that condition right now.

638
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:06,080
If Jin Taek hears everything from Ms. Jo tomorrow,

639
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,480
he'll finally start listening to me, too.

640
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,290
Yes, tomorrow...

641
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,830
Gosh, look who's here!

642
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,280
Is it my son, Do Jun?

643
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,350
You should be in the US. What are you suddenly doing here?

644
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,820
- Mom, I'm on a spring break. 
 - What?

645
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,070
Gosh, yes. Spring break. Look how forgetful I am.

646
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,520
Do Jun, I would've picked you up at the airport if you let me know.

647
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,220
Long time no see.

648
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,800
Hold on. Move, move.

649
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,120
- What? What? 
 - W-What happened to your face?

650
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,900
Huh? Who did this to you?

651
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,520
It's nothing, Mom. I helped someone on the way here.

652
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,960
Who did you help? Why would you get involved in someone else's business?

653
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,070
There are so many weirdos these days.

654
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,800
Look what happened to your handsome face!

655
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,600
- It's okay. 
 - Seriously.

656
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,410
- Hey, you got hurt a lot. 
 - I know.

657
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,790
- Do Jun! 
 - Noona!

658
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,640
Hey, what's going on? What's this?

659
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,420
You said you couldn't come because you had to study.

660
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,170
I wanted to surprise you like this.

661
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,050
Aigoo, aigoo, my baby.

662
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,010
I missed you so much.

663
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,440
My goodness. People might think you're his mom.

664
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,900
Mom, did you forget I practically raised him?

665
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,570
- Aigoo, my baby. 
 - Gosh, seriously.

666
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,290
Welcome home.

667
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,350
O-Okay, me, too. Come here now.

668
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,470
Let me try hugging you, too.

669
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,550
Gosh, me, too. Me, too!

670
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:38,690
- Do Jun! Do Jun! 
 - Long time no see!

671
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,860
Honey, Mr. Kang is here.

672
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:08,500
Mr. Kang, please take good care of Ma Ri whenever she goes out.

673
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:15,320
You can't let her get out of your sight even for a second.

674
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,400
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

675
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,960
Thank you. You may leave now.

676
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,750
Honey...

677
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,230
What happened today won't happen again.

678
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,290
We just need to keep her safe.

679
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,030
   

680
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,750
Gosh, who are we seeing, exactly?

681
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,090
I have another meeting in a bit.

682
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,560
It's someone you must meet.

683
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,370
You'll see once you see her.

684
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,690
A meeting isn't important right now.

685
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,200
It's been 30 minutes. Where is she?

686
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,390
Is there bad traffic?

687
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,480
Or was she not able to leave Jeju yesterday?

688
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,570
She won't answer her phone, either. What's going on?

689
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,320
Auntie, try calling her again.

690
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,380
Okay.

691
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,120
She's answering now.

692
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,020
Hello?

693
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,700
Isn't this Ms. Jo's phone?

694
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,590
Who's this?

695
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,520
W-What did you say?

696
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,250
What did you say just now?

697
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:13,820
Auntie, please tell me what's going on.

698
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,430
Who's this Ms. Jo who just passed away?

699
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,980
Honey, here's some warm honey water.

700
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,460
Auntie, have some honey water.

701
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,020
Get out.

702
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,440
Get out. I want to be alone.

703
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,950
What's going on?

704
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,160
We were supposed to meet someone today.

705
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,930
I guess it was someone important.

706
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,480
But she suddenly passed away in a car accident.

707
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,880
Gosh, who was that?

708
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,260
Get out.

709
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,240
Get out! I said I wanted to be alone.

710
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,270
I hate to see both of you. Get out.

711
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,100
Okay.

712
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,510
Honey, let's go.

713
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,250
Ms. Jo is gone now.

714
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,590
If I say that to Jin Taek without evidence,

715
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,250
he'd treat me like a senile old woman.

716
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,270
What do I do now?

717
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,740
Yes.

718
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,380
I need to find Jessica.

719
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,150
Ms. Jo's friend, Jessica.

720
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,720
Jessica, her old boyfriend's landlord.

721
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,460
It's me.

722
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,680
I need to look for someone.

723
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,690
Find me a woman named Jessica who lived in Boston about 35 years ago.

724
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,850
She's in her late 60s.

725
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,380
Well...

726
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,340
I'll have a cappuccino.

727
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,310
You ordered one cappuccino.

728
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,550
 Do Sik, why did you come here today? Why? 

729
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:53,400
 You even got slapped by that woman. 

730
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,020
 No, I can't let a woman remember me as a jerk. I'm Park Do Sik. 

731
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,290
- Take care. 
 - Thank you.

732
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,400
Excuse me.

733
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,590
- Take care. 
 - I'll have two iced vanilla lattes.

734
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,960
What are you doing right now?

735
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,100
I'm working right now.

736
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,470
Two.

737
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,180
Here are two iced vanilla lattes.

738
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,070
Excuse me.

739
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,710
Drink it. One is yours.

740
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,030
Hey, meet me outside.

741
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,770
What is it, Noonim?

742
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,540
What are you trying to do at my workplace?

743
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,480
Is this a joke right now?

744
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,090
It's not a joke.

745
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:13,710
Noonim, can you stop being angry at me?

746
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,450
You need to stop being angry so I can go my way.

747
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,320
I can't walk away easily when you're so angry like this.

748
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,570
Gosh, what am I supposed to do?

749
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,320
Hey, do you want to get beaten again?

750
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,320
I think I hurt you too much.

751
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,880
I want to comfort you somehow, but you don't want the purse.

752
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,570
What can I do to make you feel better? What should I do?

753
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:39,900
Don't show up in front of me anymore, I said.

754
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,910
I no longer want to see a piece of trash like you.

755
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:52,030
I don't want to do this, either.

756
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,150
But why do I keep coming back here?

757
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,020
And why can't I stop feeling bad for her?

758
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,670
This is why you can't live with a sin.

759
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,580
Oppa, I've been giving this a serious thought.

760
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,770
I wondered why you deny it when you have feelings for me, too.

761
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,330
But thinking from your perspective,

762
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,930
I realized it's probably not so easy to date me.

763
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,390
I'm an actress every man in this country loves

764
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,800
and a star everyone looks up to.

765
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:00,510
So, dating someone like me might be a burden to a regular person.

766
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:05,230
I understand why you feel burdened.

767
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,470
But Oppa, we met each other when we were young and pure.

768
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,160
Don't think of me as a top celebrity.

769
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,490
Just think of me as a kid next door.

770
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:21,100
You'd feel better about it, then.

771
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,460
Do Ra, it's not like that.

772
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,530
I don't want to date you.

773
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,790
I don't like you.

774
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,640
How many times do I have to tell you?

775
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,100
Why don't you listen to me? Why do you only talk about how you feel?

776
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,490
   

777
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,990
Yes, President Gong. Hello.

778
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,990
This evening?

779
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:02,810
Of course. Sounds good. I'm free.

780
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:07,600
At Lazzoni, a French restaurant in Cheongdam, at seven o'clock?

781
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,280
Yes.

782
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,920
See you later, then.

783
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,270
Oppa!

784
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,850
Let me ask you one last time.

785
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,940
President Gong wants to see me this evening.

786
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,470
I won't see him if you don't want me to even a little bit.

787
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,050
Do as you'd like.

788
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,490
Why would you ask me that?

789
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,910
Yes. They say the brave men get the beauties.

790
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,860
Yes, it's a good thing I called.

791
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,180
She must be no longer upset now.

792
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,330
What do I do tonight?

793
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:57,160
How should I move her?

794
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,840
Yes!

795
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,660
I'll have this one.

796
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,880
The one with the biggest gem.

797
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,950
Yes, I'll relay the message right now.

798
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,130
Okay, thank you.

799
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,630
Curly-haired director.

800
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:28,720
I'm going to the French restaurant right now.

801
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,340
I'm really going, okay?

802
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:38,020
Oppa, this is your last chance to stop me.

803
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,110
I'll really leave if you don't stop me now.

804
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,830
Ms. Park, why do you keep doing this?

805
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,990
It has nothing to do with me wherever you go.

806
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,050
Go if you want to. Don't go if you don't want to.

807
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,070
Stop asking me.

808
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,150
Do as you'd like.

809
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,710
Okay, then.

810
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:07,340
Instead, don't regret that you didn't stop me.

811
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,020
 I suppose President Gong could easily seduce any woman. 

812
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,690
 But he's a womanizer. 

813
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,640
 He's exclusively after new female actors. 

814
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,740
 Yes, Yoon Hee. 

815
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,560
 The same hotel? 

816
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,250
 Okay, I'll be right there. Wait for me. 

817
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,880
But why President Gong?

818
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,730
It shouldn't be a womanizer, at least.

819
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,720
Gosh, no, no.

820
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,010
I shouldn't care who she sees. She's not a kid.

821
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,190
She can manage things herself.

822
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:55,040
By the way, does she know we're shooting at 6 a.m. tomorrow?

823
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,500
I think I forgot to tell her earlier.

824
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:09,490
 Ms. Park, you know we're shooting at 6 a.m. tomorrow, right? 

825
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,960
   

826
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,790
Did she not hear the alert?

827
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,080
 Ms. Park, you know we're shooting in Paju tomorrow, too, right? 

828
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,960
   

829
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,470
What is she doing that she's not checking texts?

830
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,210
What's more important than the shoot?

831
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,250
 Ms. Park, you have many scenes tomorrow. 

832
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,200
 Make sure to memorize the lines. 

833
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,890
   

834
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,750
What if she's drinking again?

835
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,610
What if something goes wrong with the shoot tomorrow?

836
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,300
There are so many scenes to shoot tomorrow.

837
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,060
I'm so sorry about my mother last time.

838
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,160
You must've felt very hurt.

839
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,550
Thank you so much for forgiving me and coming out tonight.

840
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,150
Of course.

841
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,830
Forget everything my mother said.

842
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,990
She's usually not like that.

843
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,600
Anyway, I swear that won't happen again.

844
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,770
 What am I doing here right now? 

845
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,220
 Why did I come here? 

846
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,230
I noticed that you liked musicals last time.

847
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,800
Should we go to New York to see a musical after "Straightforward Romance" ends?

848
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,330
Pardon?

849
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,930
Well, President Gong...

850
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,130
Look at the time.

851
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:59,310
I think I need to go because I have an early shoot tomorrow.

852
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,150
Really?

853
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,900
Should I push back tomorrow's shoot for you?

854
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,420
Pardon?

855
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,790
No, no, no. It's okay.

856
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,550
You don't have to do that. I'll get going now.

857
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,570
Hold on a moment.

858
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:29,050
Do Ra, this is how I feel.

859
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,250
Please take this.

860
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:35,150
I want to start seeing you officially.

861
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,450
President Gong, why are you doing this?

862
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,930
You're making me feel so uncomfortable.

863
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,690
Uncomfortable?

864
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,320
Yes.

865
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,320
I came here today because we had an awkward incident last time.

866
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,200
So, I wanted to straighten things out since you called me.

867
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,780
I thought you came because you felt positive toward me.

868
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,140
I think you're too good for me, President Gong.

869
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,560
You should find someone better than me.

870
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,030
I shouldn't have come here tonight.

871
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:23,230
I'm sorry for giving you the wrong impression.

872
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,620
I don't feel the same way.

873
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,390
Ms. Park,

874
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,880
don't go.

875
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,480
Please talk to me a little longer.

876
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,800
What are you doing?

877
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,720
Ms. Park, I have sincere feelings for you.

878
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,820
Please date me just once. I really am a good person.

879
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,540
I can assure you that I'll be good to you.

880
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,030
So give me just one chance.

881
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,300
And don't worry about my mother.

882
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,900
I promise you.

883
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,040
Why are you doing this?

884
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,920
I said no already.

885
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,370
I said I don't want to!

886
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,870
Why don't you like me?

887
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,370
I said I liked you!

888
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,890
President Gong.

889
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,340
Is it because I'm a mistress' son?

890
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,500
Is it because I don't own the company?

891
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,310
Why don't you like me?

892
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,220
Are you looking down on me, too?

893
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,050
I'm v-very sorry.

894
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,420
I'll get going now.

895
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,960
What am I doing here?

896
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,050
Am I crazy?

897
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,790
Oppa?

898
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,730
Oppa. It's Pil Sung, right?

899
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,400
Oppa, please take me away for now.

900
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
What's wrong? Did something happen?

901
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,200
Oppa, hurry. Let's run away from here.

902
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,660
Okay, let's go.

903
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,250
Hyungnim!

904
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,350
Hyung!

905
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,550
Gong Jin Taek hyungnim!

906
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:12,090
Gosh. Jin Dan, what's wrong?

907
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,360
How much did you have to drink?

908
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,370
Hyung!

909
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:18,610
Hyungnim!

910
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,510
Gong Jin Taek hyungnim!

911
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,230
Jin Dan, you shouldn't have gotten so drunk.

912
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:25,380
What's wrong with you?

913
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:32,100
Jin Dan, you look very drunk.

914
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,300
- Go inside and rest. 
 - Yes!

915
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,700
I am very drunk.

916
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,330
Yes, I'm drunk.

917
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:48,410
Because I didn't think I could talk to you while sober.

918
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:51,040
So, I got drunk on purpose.

919
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,140
Hyung,

920
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,320
are you Father's only son?

921
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,620
I, Gong Jin Dan...

922
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,060
am his son, too.

923
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,420
Mom, am I someone else's son?

924
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,510
Am I not my father's son? Am I not?

925
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,230
You must be out of your mind.

926
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,620
What are you talking about?

927
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,300
Go upstairs now. Hurry.

928
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,980
I'm his son, too.

929
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,810
But why am I not treated like one?

930
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,210
Hyung,

931
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,670
why don't you give me what Father told you to give?

932
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:38,630
This is why people keep looking down on me.

933
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,480
How much longer will you do this?

934
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,970
Until when?

935
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,950
If you keep doing this, I...

936
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,360
I'll sue you, Hyung.

937
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,540
I'll sue you!

938
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,310
Gosh, you're crazy. You're crazy.

939
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,470
Chairman Gong, I'm sorry.

940
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:01,390
My gosh. Go upstairs now. Hurry.

941
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,510
Why are you apologizing?

942
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,290
I'll say what I want to say, too!

943
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:07,730
Be quiet. Go.

944
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:16,260
Auntie, go to bed now.

945
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,490
He's saying that because he's drunk.

946
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,740
It's not because he's drunk.

947
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,430
He's not wrong at all.

948
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,240
What a dysfunctional family this is.

949
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,720
They say a family falls apart when the wrong woman comes in.

950
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,380
Gosh, unbelievable...

951
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,670
Drink this.

952
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,950
Okay. Thank you.

953
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,730
Gosh, I can relax now.

954
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,180
Tell me.

955
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,980
You said you were meeting President Gong tonight.

956
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,280
What happened?

957
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,000
I met President Gong because...

958
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,170
you kept rejecting me.

959
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:19,660
I wanted to make you feel jealous. So I met him out of spite.

960
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,700
But I think I made a mistake.

961
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,360
I think I made a mistake.

962
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,900
Why did you have to do that?

963
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,930
I don't know. It's all your fault.

964
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,760
You need to fix this.

965
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,180
It's Park Do Ra.

966
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,580
No, it can't be.

967
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,400
No, I think it's her.

968
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,880
Unni, you're Park Do Ra, right?

969
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,230
- Let us take a photo. 
 - She's not Park Do Ra.

970
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:41,330
- I'm a fan. 
 - Unni.

971
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,750
Huh? It's Bi Bi.

972
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:47,280
- What? Unni! 
 - Unni!

973
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,110
I'm really a fan!

974
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,410
Unni!

975
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:56,200
Don't go! Unni!

976
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,190
I'm really a fan!

977
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:02,780
I'm a fan!

978
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:35,080


979
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:45,070
♫  I turn my head  ♫

980
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,360
   

981
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:54,030
♫  But it's you in the end  ♫

982
01:05:54,030 --> 01:06:01,270
♫  Even if I close my eyes and cover my mouth  ♫

983
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:06,930
♫  It's impossible to fool you  ♫

984
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:13,780
♫  Even if the world stops me, could it be stopped?  ♫

985
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,930
♫  We'll meet after all  ♫

986
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,170
♫  As if the moonlight  ♫

987
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,770
 Give it to Jin Dan right now. 

988
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,370
 Angel Investment is Jin Dan's. Why are you holding onto it? 

989
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,200
 I'll consider you my mother and care for you for the rest of my life. 

990
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,890
 What are you doing at my house? 

991
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:33,050
 Look into Soo Yeon's past. 

992
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,040
 Her past before she married Jin Taek. 

993
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,670
 My heart. Please stop racing. 

994
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,820
 You can't do this. Stop thinking about Park Do Ra. 

995
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,820
 I'll still like you even if I like you all on my own. 

996
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,580
 I'll just head straight toward you. 

997
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,090
 I can't explain everything, but we aren't meant to be.
