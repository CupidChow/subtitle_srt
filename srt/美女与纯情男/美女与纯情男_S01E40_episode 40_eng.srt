1
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,345
Honey.

2
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,335
   

3
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,905
Do you know who I thought of...

4
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,855
the moment the accident happened?

5
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:58,780
Who?

6
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:05,025
It wasn't Auntie or Jin Dan.

7
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:09,435
I thought of Pil Sung.

8
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:16,195
He's the only person... who'd be by Ma Ri's side.

9
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:21,765
Honey, what do you mean by that?

10
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:27,295
Pil Sung is Ma Ri's brother.

11
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:30,235
He's your son.

12
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:34,365
If he's your son, he's my son, too.

13
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,825
Honey.

14
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:45,875
What are you thinking right now? By chance, are you...

15
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:50,045
I'm still thinking, too.

16
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:54,155
I'll think about it more and let you know.

17
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:58,050
I'll go take a shower.

18
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,465


19
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:06,725
What's he thinking?

20
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:09,255
No, that makes no sense.

21
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,665
That can't happen.

22
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,745
What did you just say?

23
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:21,605
Are you saying Ms. Kim has been...

24
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,555
seeing you because of money?

25
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:29,715
How dare you play ignorant?

26
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:33,565
I will never let this slide.

27
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:39,085
I'll investigate thoroughly where you took the money from and gave it to Kim Ji Yeong.

28
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:45,875
I'll let you find out what happens when you embezzle.

29
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,535
Just wait and see.

30
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,880
Sure.

31
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,165
Go ahead and do that.

32
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:53,915
Do it right now. I'm curious, too.

33
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,925
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

34
00:02:56,925 --> 00:03:01,405
What's this? You really didn't give her that money?

35
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,345
Where did she get so much money if it wasn't you?

36
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:08,990
So, Ms. Kim has been...

37
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:13,265
seeing you because of money all this time,

38
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:17,785
but she wanted to end things by giving you this money.

39
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,845
That's what you're saying, right?

40
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:26,085
Do you two think I'm an idiot or something?

41
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:31,545
Hey, you think you could fool me like this?

42
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,385
I'll get to the bottom of this.

43
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:38,515
And I'm warning you right now.

44
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:41,685
Don't try to come between Kim Ji Yeong and me.

45
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,495
You got that?

46
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:49,745
Anyway, you said this wasn't from you.

47
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:53,645
I'll take this money with me.

48
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,485
Aigoo.

49
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,155
You said you had something to tell me.

50
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,825
What is it?

51
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:12,195
Grandma,

52
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:16,485
I took out 300 million from your account and used it.

53
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:21,675
You told me to use it however I wanted, but I thought you should know.

54
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,740
So I'm reporting to you.

55
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:27,025
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you first.

56
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:31,585
Ji Yeong, why would you be sorry?

57
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:34,595
I said it's all yours.

58
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:37,645
I'm sure you used it for a reason.

59
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,915
You don't have to report to me.

60
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:45,665
Grandma, aren't you curious about what I used it on?

61
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,075
Huh?

62
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,455
What did you use it on?

63
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,365
I guess I'm a little curious.

64
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:57,945
I paid back President Gong with that money.

65
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:03,005
Have you really been seeing President Gong or whatever

66
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,305
because of money all this time?

67
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,965
I was just guessing you were.

68
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:11,455
But it was true.

69
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,955
Yes, Grandma.

70
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:18,395
I dated him because he paid off Ahjumma's private loan.

71
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:22,485
But it just didn't feel right, so I paid him back.

72
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:26,745
Yes, well done. Well done.

73
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,935
You need to pay off money like that quickly.

74
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:36,405
Otherwise, you get taken advantage of for the rest of your life.

75
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:40,465
You can't live a low life like that.

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,535
Well done. Well done.

77
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:49,905
I'm so relieved to hear you say that, Grandma.

78
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:51,525
Goodness...

79
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:54,245
Grandma,

80
00:05:55,375 --> 00:06:00,205
I'll work hard and pay you back everything.

81
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:06,235
Gosh, I told you not to worry about that.

82
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,895
But you still need to make a lot of money.

83
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,535
Okay, Grandma.

84
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:20,695
I'll make a lot of money and give you everything. Everything.

85
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:23,745
Gosh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

86
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:27,475
Aigoo, sweetheart. My sweetheart.

87
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,165
Don't be sick, Grandma.

88
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:33,035
Okay. Let's be healthy.

89
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:37,725
Aigoo, my sweetheart.

90
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:38,955
   

91
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:47,985
   

92
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,835
   

93
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,605
Yes, Grandma.

94
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:56,235
 Director, I need to see you. 

95
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:59,705
 There's a reason we need to see each other. 

96
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:05,925
Grandma... is that true?

97
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,855
Prasident Gong paid off President Baek's private loan?

98
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,645
Yes.

99
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:18,595
For lending money to that meanie stepmother,

100
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:21,535
he demanded to date Ji Yeong.

101
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:28,735
That's why my sweet Ji Yeong was forced to date that scoundrel.

102
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,435
It breaks my heart whenever I think about that.

103
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:39,895
Director, Ji Yeong has no feelings for him.

104
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:45,155
I've never seen Ji Yeong smile even once while seeing him.

105
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:52,100
Director, you know why I'm telling you this,

106
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,920
right?

107
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:55,375
Pardon?

108
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:58,065
Well, yes.

109
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:02,735
Thank you so much for telling me, ma'am.

110
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:08,915
She must've suffered a lot. This is a relief.

111
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:18,120
By the way, you don't seem that happy about it for some reason.

112
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:23,485
No, I'm happy. Of course I am.

113
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,735
Grandma, should we make bibimguksu?

114
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:37,375
With radish kimchi?

115
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,305
Grandma, are you still sleeping?

116
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:50,465
If you sleep in the late afternoon, you can't sleep later at night—

117
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:55,495
Where did she go?

118
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,185
Grandma!

119
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:03,395
Grandma!

120
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,935
What happened?

121
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:08,575
She was definitely sleeping earlier.

122
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:20,425
Grandma, where are you right now?

123
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,225
What did you say? In front of the house?

124
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:30,565
She's about to run outside because she's surprised.

125
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:32,465
My gosh.

126
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:38,505
Wait, what are you doing here, Director?

127
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,485
Grandma, what happened?

128
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:46,685
I thought you were sleeping in the room.

129
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:52,255
I suggested to him that we get Americano together.

130
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:55,295
You should've told me you were doing that, then.

131
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,195
I almost had a heart attack thinking you were missing.

132
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,775
That's what the phone is for.

133
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:06,135
You put a chain on me like this. Why do you worry?

134
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:10,015
Ji Yeong, here are housewarming gifts.

135
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:14,785
I hope everything goes well living here.

136
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:17,995
Thank you.

137
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:23,415
Ji Yeong, will you just stand out here like this?

138
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:30,765
Director, why don't you eat kongguksu* with us inside? 
  (Soybean noodles) 

139
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,870
You bought me an Americano today.

140
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,230
I should return the favor somehow.

141
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:44,425
I'll take a rain check today, Grandma.

142
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:47,180
I'll come back when I get a chance next time.

143
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:50,195
That's too bad, then.

144
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:52,535
Go inside, Grandma. I'll leave now.

145
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:56,235
Okay, Director. Get home safely.

146
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,555
Goodbye.

147
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:34,585
Grandma, you told the Director all that?

148
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:37,055
Why would you say something like that to him?

149
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:39,365
What's the big deal, exactly?

150
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:45,525
He must think you're a terrible person who dumped him for another man.

151
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,325
It wasn't because you didn't like him.

152
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:51,835
You had a reason to do that, and he should know, too.

153
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,845
You're so unbelievable, Grandma.

154
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:59,885
By the way, I think he changed a bit.

155
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,135
What do you mean by that?

156
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:08,075
I thought he'd be so happy if I told him you paid the money back

157
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,445
and freed yourself from that bastard.

158
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:16,655
But he was only a tiny bit happy.

159
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:23,075
I think he was very hurt by you.

160
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:28,505
That's why... you shouldn't have told him that.

161
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:31,315
Nothing is going on between us anymore.

162
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:35,575
You dated that bastard even though you secretly liked the Director.

163
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:38,905
How could I do nothing while knowing that?

164
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:41,175
I had to correct things.

165
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,630
Ji Yeong,

166
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,060
it's not too late to be good to Director.

167
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:55,685
Looks like he still has some feelings for you, too.

168
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,195
He's just a little upset. Okay?

169
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:05,865
So, you'd better hang onto him before another girl takes him away.

170
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,005
Ease his disappointment little by little.

171
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:12,725
No, Grandma.

172
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,935
I don't have the right to like him.

173
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,455
Aigoo...

174
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,865
My goodness...

175
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,490
Yes.

176
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:29,375
Even I think you did the wrong thing.

177
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:34,675
I know it was because of the money, but you were with someone else.

178
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:39,310
But still, Ji Yeong...

179
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:45,275
reflect on what you did and be better from now on.

180
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:49,505
I'm sure he'll feel better, too.

181
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,490
Grandma...

182
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:58,345
I have no right. I can't do that to him.

183
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:01,705
He needs to find someone nice instead of me.

184
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:07,085
So don't tell me stuff like that anymore.

185
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:10,465
J-Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong...

186
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:16,315
Aigoo, I feel so sorry for her.

187
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:38,705
 For lending money to that meanie stepmother, 

188
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:43,835
 he demanded to date Ji Yeong, apparently. 

189
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:51,855
 That's why my sweet Ji Yeong was forced to date that scoundrel. 

190
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,895
And I had no idea.

191
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,315
What's with that guy?

192
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,415
Excuse me, Ahjussi.

193
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:46,235
Come out. Come out.

194
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:49,465
Ahjussi, Ahjussi, come here.

195
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,435
You're that ahjussi, aren't you?

196
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,355
 J-Jin Dan. 

197
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:05,475
Seriously. What's with you?

198
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:07,665
What are you doing here?

199
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,015
Why are you here?

200
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:12,625
I was looking for a place nearby.

201
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,155
I wasn't sure if it was this way or that way.

202
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,675
Why did you hide when you ran into me, then?

203
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,565
What? I didn't hide.

204
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:25,505
I was going to go that way, but I came because you called me.

205
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,975
I'm sorry if it looked that way.

206
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:36,105
Stay away from this place if you don't want to be mistaken again.

207
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:39,365
I won't forgive you if I catch you doing this again.

208
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,685
I'll call the police.

209
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:45,830
There are CCTVs everywhere here. Okay?

210
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,055
Aren't you going to answer?

211
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,375
O-Okay.

212
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,845
Seriously. Everything is annoying me this morning.

213
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,455
Leave!

214
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:12,665
Aren't you leaving?

215
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:28,015
Mom, why was that insurance man lurking around our house?

216
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,725
What? Who?

217
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,885
What's your relationship with him?

218
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,765
W-What do you mean? Nothing is going on.

219
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:40,275
Why was he peeping at me in front of our house?

220
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,505
Are you sure nothing is going on?

221
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:42,865
I'm telling you.

222
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:45,035
 Mom, you'd better not see him from now on. 

223
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:46,935
Don't sign up for his insurance, either.

224
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:50,385
He really bothers me, okay?

225
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:51,685
Okay, I won't.

226
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:56,365
But he travels a lot because he sells insurance.

227
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:58,625
That's how he probably ended up at our house.

228
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,505
So don't worry about him.

229
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,975
Okay, bye.

230
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,505
Sang Gu, are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

231
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:16,735
Why were you lurking in front of our house?

232
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:19,375
Are you determined to ruin Jin Dan's life?

233
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,915
Why are you doing this?

234
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:24,885
Ae Gyo, why did you raise him as such a brat?

235
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:28,865
I'm old enough to be his father, but he treated me so rudely.

236
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,645
I was really upset.

237
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,095
I'm still his father.

238
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,565
Someone might hear you. Are you crazy?

239
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,175
It wasn't just anyone.

240
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:43,235
I was treated like that by my son. It makes me so upset.

241
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:48,825
Sang Gu, he's been upset since his adoption got canceled recently.

242
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:52,615
You can't expect him to treat you nicely when you get caught acting weird.

243
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:54,695
His adoption was canceled? Why?

244
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:56,535
I don't know.

245
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:59,145
You don't have to know all that.

246
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:02,555
Anyway, don't go anywhere near Jin Dan anymore.

247
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,295
His adoption was canceled.

248
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:07,295
What if Chairman Gong found out you were his birth father?

249
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,825
We'd be done for.

250
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:12,475
Okay. I'll be careful not to get caught from now on.

251
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:15,325
Are you saying you'd keep peeping at Jin Dan?

252
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:18,275
How could I not see my son?

253
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:22,235
Hearing he's my son, I can't stop thinking about him.

254
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:24,275
I miss him, and I want to hug him.

255
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,360
What are you saying?

256
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,195
You must've lost your mind.

257
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:31,365
Sang Gu, get it together!

258
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:40,055
I came to apologize for everything that has been going on.

259
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:57,255
Both of our families went through a lot recently.

260
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,045
Because I felt betrayed by my wife,

261
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:05,545
I gave the innocent Pil Sung a hard time.

262
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,060
And...

263
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,690
I even gave you a hard time, President Go and Seon Yeong.

264
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:16,355
I've been so petty.

265
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:22,475
When you two came to my office,

266
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:25,935
I finally realized that...

267
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,060
I did something seriously wrong.

268
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:34,945
I sincerely apologize for what I did then.

269
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:42,485
Don't mention it. You made Pil Sung the CEO of Go Go Entertainment.

270
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:51,025
We're actually grateful that you approved his abilities.

271
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:57,700
I'm so grateful that you acknowledged Ma Ri as Pil Sung's little sister.

272
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,315
Really, thank you so much.

273
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:05,315
No, not at all.

274
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:10,215
Pil Sung deeply cares about Ma Ri.

275
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:17,705
We're grateful to you for acknowledging Pil Sung as Ma Ri's brother.

276
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:23,435
Ma Ri has a big brother now, and the two of them get along so well.

277
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:26,595
It makes me so happy.

278
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:36,055
I hope our families get along as one family from now on.

279
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:40,045
We share a child together.

280
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:43,625
Of course. Of course.

281
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,035
We should treat each other as a family from now on.

282
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:50,935
I decided to become friends with Ma Ri,

283
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:56,275
but I really think of her as my granddaughter.

284
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:01,105
Thank you so much.

285
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:28,752
What's going on?

286
00:22:28,752 --> 00:22:34,667
The chairman of APP Group wants us to consider them family.

287
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,832
He said we share a child together.

288
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:39,932
And he thanked us for raising Pil Sung well.

289
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:43,222
You can tell how generous he is.

290
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:46,902
No wonder he's able to lead a big company like that.

291
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:50,092
He's on another level than normal people like us.

292
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:52,087
Mom, catch your breathe while talking.

293
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,877
You'll suffocate.

294
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:59,612
Isn't Chairman Gong a true gentleman?

295
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,442
He forgave his wife without divorcing her.

296
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:06,752
And he even acknowledged her son, Pil Sung, as Ma Ri's brother.

297
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,572
I think differently of him now.

298
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,862
He really is extraordinary.

299
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:15,362
I know. He even visited us.

300
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:18,102
I do feel grateful.

301
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:19,847
Honey,

302
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:27,617
I think he came because he wants you and Soo Yeon to get along again.

303
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:29,677
Yes, Seon Yeong.

304
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:33,237
You should make up with Seon Yeon, too.

305
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:35,582
Although it'd be hard to go back to the way it was.

306
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:39,382
And Chairman Gong likes your shikhye*.
  (Korean dessert drink) 

307
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:42,952
Make yakbab*, too, and take them over. 
  (Sweet rice with nuts and jujubes) 

308
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:46,862
Yes, I'll think about it.

309
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:56,012
What important matter did you want to talk about? Even asking me to come here.

310
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,182
Earlier today,

311
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:02,182
I stopped by Seon Yeong's house.

312
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:07,862
Y-You were at Seon Yeong's house?

313
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:10,612
Why did you do that without telling me?

314
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:16,442
I need to adopt Pil Sung as my son.

315
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,452
Honey.

316
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:23,322
Why are you so shocked? I told you.

317
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:26,442
If he's your son, he's my son, too.

318
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:30,392
Did you tell Seon Yeong's family that, by chance?

319
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:33,432
I wouldn't be so careless.

320
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:36,292
I just checked their reaction this time.

321
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:40,202
I need to know what they think of us

322
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:43,262
so I can bring up the adoption later.

323
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:48,372
It looks like they're a lot less upset with you, too.

324
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:53,572
I think they think of Pil Sung as Ma Ri's brother, too.

325
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:58,682
Honey, but it still doesn't feel right.

326
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:01,632
I've thought about this a lot, too.

327
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:04,262
I'm not just saying this lightly.

328
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:07,452
As you know,

329
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:11,142
I've always liked Pil Sung.

330
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,607
I found him to be...

331
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,792
reliable since he was in high school.

332
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:21,742
I liked him so much that...

333
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:27,607
I wanted him to be with Ma Ri without knowing he was her brother.

334
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,372
Honey,

335
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:35,832
I want Pil Sung so badly.

336
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:40,092
B-But we don't know what Seon Yeong would say.

337
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:44,752
I don't want to hurt her even more.

338
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,582
Honey,

339
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,432
this isn't a bad thing.

340
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:52,402
We aren't taking him from them.

341
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:54,512
Our families will become one.

342
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:58,212
It's a great thing for both families.

343
00:25:58,212 --> 00:25:59,892
Honey,

344
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:03,872
I'll take care of everything.

345
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:06,822
Just promise me that...

346
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:10,282
you'll be on my side, no matter what.

347
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:15,602
Pil Sung is the only one who would protect Ma Ri.

348
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:23,412
All right.

349
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,452
I'll do that.

350
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:41,422
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

351
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:45,582
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

352
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:48,932
What's going on?

353
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:53,492
She won't answer my calls, and she won't read my messages, either.

354
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:58,242
By chance, did she block me?

355
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:00,752
This woman...

356
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,082
What's with her?

357
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:08,642
Secretary Jo, find out Kim Ji Yeong's schedule.

358
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:12,622
I'm so sorry for causing a commotion during our first shoot.

359
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:15,562
I think it happened because I was so nervous.

360
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:18,502
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

361
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:23,192
I'll work harder and do my best from now on.

362
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,422
I'm so sorry.

363
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:28,902
 It's okay. It's okay. 

364
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:30,472
 It's okay. 

365
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:34,332
Let's think that the worst is over with.

366
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:36,482
Let's keep moving forward.

367
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:39,112
Let's create a masterpiece that will shock the world!

368
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:40,572
"Seoul Lady," fighting!

369
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:42,962
 Fighting! 

370
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,462
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting.

371
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:50,692
I'll go talk to the film crew.

372
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,052
Have a seat here, Director.

373
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,292
You seem like a totally different person today, Ji Yeong.

374
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:57,252
Your style, facial expressions, and the way you talk, too.

375
00:27:57,252 --> 00:28:00,512
You're totally different from Kim Ji Yeong in "House of Roses."

376
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,252
I agree. You've completely become Bun Hong.

377
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:06,032
You're totally a Seoul Lady now.

378
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,942
Thank you.

379
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:12,512
Ji Yeong, you must've gone through a lot.

380
00:28:12,512 --> 00:28:15,712
 Eat as much as you'd like and order more. 

381
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:18,902
- Eat this and cheer up. 
 - Thank you.

382
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:26,542
- Isn't it tasty? 
 - Yes, it's so tasty.

383
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:29,072
Eating this cheers me up.

384
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:34,322
It must've been difficult because of the heat.

385
00:28:34,322 --> 00:28:36,452
Not at all.

386
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:39,462
I really liked the camera angle last time.

387
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:51,242
 Oppa came such a long way. 

388
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:54,392
 He was a cute assistant director then. 

389
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:57,932
 But now, he has become a really cool director. 

390
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:09,202
Assistant Director, I need to go home because of my grandma.

391
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:12,682
- Please don't be mad if you don't see me later. 
 - Okay.

392
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:15,952
I'll explain it to the Director.

393
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:27,222
Ji Yeong, you won't answer my calls, and you ignore my messages.

394
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:29,267
What are you trying to do?

395
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:33,872
Are you done because you paid me 300 million?

396
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:38,232
President Gong, I have nothing to say to you.

397
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:42,922
Do you think I'm a toy?

398
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:46,992
You leeched off me when you needed money.

399
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:49,892
But you're dumping me now because you got money somewhere?

400
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:52,862
Do you think I'm a bag of trash?

401
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:56,432
I explained myself enough already.

402
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:59,922
I dated you thinking you broke up with that woman.

403
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:04,352
I never would've dated you if I knew you had a fiancée.

404
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:08,332
I told you I ended everything because of you.

405
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:12,412
Ji Yeong, let's not do this, please.

406
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,792
We're over.

407
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,752
Why are you doing this?

408
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:21,722
We're over?

409
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,302
Is it over if you say it is?

410
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,432
I'm not done with you, I said.

411
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:30,632
- It's not over yet, then. It isn't. 
 - Let go of me.

412
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:32,712
Would you let go if you were me?

413
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:36,982
Let's talk more somewhere quiet.

414
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:40,542
Let go, I said!

415
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:44,512
Let go of her.

416
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:48,332
Ji Yeong said no.

417
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:50,062
How dare you butt in?

418
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:52,262
Why do you keep butting in?

419
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,852
Director!

420
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,432
Why are you doing this now...

421
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,542
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Hey.

422
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:10,102
Where are you going after hitting me?

423
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,752
What happened to your face, Jin Dan?

424
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,082
Did you get into a fight?

425
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:31,272
Goodness. Of course not.

426
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,852
He's not a little kid or anything.

427
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:35,732
He ran into a glass door.

428
00:31:35,732 --> 00:31:37,322
I do that sometimes, too.

429
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:39,132
Glass doors are so dangerous.

430
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,782
Even birds run into them and die.

431
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:45,272
Chairman Gong, what important announcement do you have for everyone?

432
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:48,472
Jin Dan is here now. Tell us.

433
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:54,142
It's regarding the adoption.

434
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:59,952
Are you reconsidering it?

435
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,452
Yes, what else can you do?

436
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,592
I'm glad you're doing this.

437
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:07,172
I'm not adopting Jin Dan,

438
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:11,092
but we need someone to protect Ma Ri and the company.

439
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:13,492
So, I decided to adopt someone else.

440
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:15,692
What do you mean?

441
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:20,142
There's no other Gong but Jin Dan. Who are you trying to adopt?

442
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:24,932
I want to adopt Go Pil Sung, Ma Ri's brother.

443
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:27,712
- As long as Pil Sung and his family agree. 
 - What—

444
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,222
What did you say?

445
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:32,612
Hyung, what are you talking about?

446
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:34,992
Did you say, "Go Pil Sung" just now?

447
00:32:34,992 --> 00:32:39,032
Chairman Gong, are you in your right mind?

448
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:40,772
What would the adoption mean?

449
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:44,782
It means we'll give someone all the power we have.

450
00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:47,922
It's not even Jin Dan, but a strange from Go family?

451
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:52,292
Will you give Soo Yeon's illegitimate child everything we have?

452
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:55,752
He's not a stranger. He's Ma Ri's older brother.

453
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:59,522
I decided after considering everything.

454
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,442
Our family is going down now.

455
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,122
Do whatever you want!

456
00:33:06,122 --> 00:33:10,122
Give APP Group to a Go or Choi! Do whatever!

457
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:14,652
Aigoo, aigoo... aigoo... aigoo, aigoo...

458
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,772
Gosh, my head. My head...

459
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:19,262
Auntie.

460
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:33,012
What?

461
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:36,002
Adopt Go Pil Sung?

462
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:40,052
What kind of bullshit is this?

463
00:33:47,222 --> 00:33:49,182
What are you looking at?

464
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,702
What the hell are you looking at!

465
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:02,862
Hey, Gong Jin Taek!

466
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:05,112
Come out, Gong Jin Taek!

467
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,472
Gong Jin Taek!

468
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:12,622
Jin Dan, what are you doing?

469
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:16,012
Go to bed if you got drunk.

470
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:20,522
Hey, Gong Jin Taek. Are you the only son of Gong Dae Gil?

471
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:23,572
I'm also Gong Dae Gil's son, my father.

472
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:27,522
What gives you the right to look down on me?

473
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:30,772
Is it because my mom was his mistress? Huh?

474
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:35,852
I'm a Gong, but how could you adopt Go Pil Sung as your son?

475
00:34:35,852 --> 00:34:38,212
Am I inferior to him?

476
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,062
I'm your brother.

477
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:42,832
I'm a brother who shares blood with you!

478
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:48,352
Gosh, why are you doing this? Come on.

479
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:55,092
Have you ever looked at me kindly since I was a kid?

480
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:58,782
I followed you around because I liked you.

481
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:02,642
How could you look down on me since then?

482
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,492
Hey, Gong Jin Taek. You can't do this.

483
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:10,642
My father, Chairman Gong Dae Gil, is watching us from heaven right now!

484
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,522
Don't do this. That's enough, Jin Dan.

485
00:35:13,522 --> 00:35:15,542
Mom.

486
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:19,082
Why did you have to be his mistress?

487
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:25,992
Why didn't you have me with a penniless man instead?

488
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:30,782
I would've felt less lonely if I had grown up in a poor family!

489
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:33,662
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

490
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:37,457
Let's go upstairs now, Jin Dan.

491
00:35:37,457 --> 00:35:38,997
Let's go.

492
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:44,912
Mom... What the hell is this?

493
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:47,202
- I'm so lonely, Mom. 
 - Chairman Gong,

494
00:35:47,202 --> 00:35:50,002
you can't do this.

495
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:53,582
I know Jin Dan isn't good enough,

496
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:57,502
but he's your brother. Your brother.

497
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:37,322
Honey,

498
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:40,632
you should reconsider it.

499
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:47,022
We shouldn't hurt someone else to make us feel better.

500
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:51,202
I think we're forcing it too much.

501
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:14,412
Ji Yeong, we'll start shooting as soon as Gang Bin arrives.

502
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:16,002
Let's run the lines in the meantime.

503
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,912
Okay, Director.

504
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,422
Why do you keep following me?

505
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,892
Do you own all the paths here, Bun Hong?

506
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:33,222
I have the right to walk on this path, too.

507
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:36,552
I'm just going my way. Don't mind me.

508
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:39,672
I know you were following me just now.

509
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:42,712
I said I wasn't.

510
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:52,102
I'll cut your head off if you follow me one more time.

511
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:03,552
Director, you're not supposed to laugh.

512
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:05,242
I'm sorry.

513
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,842
I thought you sounded so cute.

514
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:11,262
You're the one who laughed first.

515
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:13,612
When did I do that?

516
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,852
I...

517
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:21,542
I'll prepare for the shoot now.

518
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,522
Gosh!

519
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:31,352
You didn't fall because of your oppa, right?

520
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:35,262
Your head would've split open without me.

521
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:40,412
Ji Yeong, you need your oppa, right?

522
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:50,072
I-I'm fine, okay?

523
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:05,662
Park Do Ra, come to your senses.

524
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:08,902
You can't be like this.

525
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:13,472
Don't smile at Oppa.

526
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:16,212
Don't feel excited looking at him.

527
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:34,761
 Mom. 

528
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,311
 Why did you have to be his mistress? 

529
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:45,321
 Why didn't you have me with a penniless man instead? 

530
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:50,291
 I would've felt less lonely if I had grown up in a poor family! 

531
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:55,241
How...

532
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:59,201
How could he do this to Jin Dan?

533
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,851
Sang Gu, it's me.

534
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:11,431
 Ae Gyo, are you crying? Why are you crying? 

535
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:15,101
-  What's going on? What happened?  
 - Sang Gu,

536
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:18,331
what do I do with Jin Dan?

537
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:22,516
What? Is that true?

538
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:25,596
So, did he cry, too?

539
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:29,220
To be honest, Jin Dan and I

540
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,140
used to tiptoe around that house so much.

541
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,476
Until he was a high school student,

542
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:39,896
we couldn't go near the main house and lived in the annex.

543
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:43,186
They didn't even put Jin Dan in the family registry.

544
00:40:43,186 --> 00:40:46,136
He was Hong Jin Dan, not Gong Jin Dan.

545
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:50,026
- What? What did you say? Hong Jin Dan? 
 - Yes.

546
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:52,726
Right before Chairman Gong Dae Gil passed,

547
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:56,936
they registered him as Gong Jin Dan and his son.

548
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:00,966
You know the Angel Investment he's the CEO of?

549
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:06,786
Chairman Gong Dae Gil gave it to Jin Dan in his will,

550
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:11,886
but he barely managed to get that recently, too.

551
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:17,556
You have no idea how much we've been looked down on.

552
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:21,026
Do they think this is the Joseon era or something?

553
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:22,896
Same with the adoption, too.

554
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:25,096
We aren't the ones who asked for it.

555
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:27,866
They were the ones who wanted to do it.

556
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:32,496
Just because he broke off the arranged marriage, they canceled everything immediately.

557
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:35,166
And they treat Jin Dan like a sinner.

558
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,326
And now, what?

559
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:39,636
He wants to adopt Ma Ri's half-brother,

560
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:43,546
his wife's illegitimate son, who's not even a Gong.

561
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:46,366
Imagine how hurt Jin Dan must've felt.

562
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:48,816
Imagine how painful it must've been.

563
00:41:48,816 --> 00:41:53,016
What kind of people are they? They're terrible people.

564
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:56,036
This is all because of Gong Ma Ri.

565
00:41:56,036 --> 00:42:01,540
Honestly, everyone knows she isn't normal because she's slow in the head.

566
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,856
Isn't it obvious that Jin Dan should be the successor of APP Group?

567
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:10,146
But just because she's Gong Jin Taek's daughter, she gets in Jin Dan's way.

568
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:13,216
Now, she's dragging his half-brother in

569
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:16,666
to turn Jin Dan into the second fiddle.

570
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:21,880
You're saying Jin Dan is always the second fiddle

571
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,850
because of the slow girl, right?

572
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:30,216
He can't get acknowledged because he's the mistress' son.

573
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:34,546
I feel so sorry for my Jin Dan.

574
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:37,236
My heart aches.

575
00:42:38,046 --> 00:42:39,396
You're right.

576
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:44,196
Jin Dan is the only Gong in that family if it wasn't for the daughter.

577
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:50,206
 APP Group would be... Jin Dan's 

578
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:53,336
 if it wasn't for their daughter. 

579
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,046
Ahjumma, what's all this?

580
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,956
Ji Yeong, I came to live with you.

581
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,136
Please forgive me just once, Ji Yeong.

582
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:09,566
- Ahjumma! 
 - Yes, yes. As you said,

583
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:13,556
you can feel uncomfortable with me because you don't have your memory yet.

584
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:16,926
Isn't that more the reason for us to live together, then?

585
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:19,646
Isn't that why you also set up a room for Do Jun?

586
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:22,436
Because you want him to visit often and become close.

587
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:25,726
So, let me stay here, Ji Yeong.

588
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:27,586
I promise I'll be good to you.

589
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:30,166
That old lady... No.

590
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,786
I mean, I'll be good to your grandmother, too.

591
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:39,186
And I'll stay with her and care for her when you're at work, Ji Yeong.

592
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,016
Ji Yeong.

593
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:44,516
Mom, what's wrong with you?

594
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,196
She wants to live like this for now.

595
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:49,956
It's not like she'd cut ties with you. Go now.

596
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:51,716
Hold on, hold on!

597
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:53,846
Ji Yeong, Ji Yeong.

598
00:43:53,846 --> 00:43:57,046
You said your dad asked you to take good care of your brothers and me.

599
00:43:57,046 --> 00:43:59,106
You said you remember that.

600
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:02,456
How could you do this to me, then? How?

601
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,906
I can't leave! I won't! I won't!

602
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:06,716
 What? 

603
00:44:06,716 --> 00:44:10,036
What load of crap is this?

604
00:44:10,036 --> 00:44:12,256
You meanie. Get out of here immediately.

605
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:13,586
Get up! Get out of here now.

606
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:17,866
Seriously, how could you! Geez!

607
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:21,836
- Get out! Get out! 
 - Okay, okay! I'm leaving!

608
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:24,836
- Okay, stop! Stop! 
 - What are you trying to take now?

609
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:28,506
Get out! Get out, I said! Get out!

610
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,306
I know she has no memory yet, but still.

611
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:38,106
How could she do this to me?

612
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:42,186
Do Sik, I really don't want to live.

613
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:45,806
My daughter doesn't treat me like a mom.

614
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:49,796
What's the point of living like this? What's the point?

615
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:10,566
Ji Yeong.

616
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,626
Oppa.

617
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,706
Mom did a lot of terrible things to you.

618
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,006
I know she gave you a very hard time, too.

619
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:23,156
Of course, I know all that.

620
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,246
But she's still our mom.

621
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,196
Oppa.

622
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,966
She cried a lot after you died.

623
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:37,476
She regretted not treating you better, too.

624
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,376
But her life is sad, too.

625
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:47,216
It must've been tough to raise the three of us after Dad died.

626
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,186
So, Ji Yeong...

627
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,426
- Oppa. 
 - Please forgive Mom for one last time.

628
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:03,706
I beg you like this. Please forgive her just once, Ji Yeong.

629
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:06,096
Oppa, get up.

630
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,536
- Don't do this, Oppa. Get up. 
 - Ji Yeong...

631
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:12,566
- Oppa, get up! 
 - Geum Dong, you came.

632
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:14,816
Yes, I'm here.

633
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:20,206
By the way, you said you'll leave to look for your sister, Dong Dong.

634
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:22,296
Why did you come alone?

635
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:23,676
D-Dong Dong?

636
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:27,236
Yes, your sister, Dong Dong.

637
00:46:27,236 --> 00:46:29,466
You haven't found her yet?

638
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,276
Grandma.

639
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,976
Aigoo.

640
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,636
Aigoo, Dong Dong.

641
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,406
Do Jun, you're able to protect me already.

642
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:47,776
Why do you say you can't, then?

643
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:50,156
What do you mean?

644
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:51,376
Don't you remember?

645
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:54,176
You saved me when we first met, too.

646
00:46:54,176 --> 00:46:59,096
And you stopped a stranger from asking me my phone number.

647
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:03,296
And you lifted me up whenever my legs got tired.

648
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:12,496
By chance, did you say that because you couldn't just say no?

649
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,566
It's not like that.

650
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:20,316
Tell me if you'd like us to date or not. Just answer that.

651
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,510
I'd like it.

652
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,980
What's the problem, then?

653
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:28,806
I told you that I'm not good enough.

654
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,050
Do Jun,

655
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:37,626
to be honest, I'm the one who isn't good enough.

656
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:44,896
I act foolishly often because I hurt my head from the accident.

657
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,086
Is that why you don't think you could stay with me?

658
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,416
Ma Ri,

659
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,346
if only I could,

660
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,806
I want to stay with you forever.

661
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,976
Do Jun, do you mean it?

662
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,516
Yes, I mean it.

663
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,346
If so...

664
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,336
stay by my side forever from now on.

665
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,616
Could you do that?

666
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,606
Okay, I will.

667
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,116
If so,

668
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:38,260
this is our first day as a couple.

669
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,750
♫  All the beginnings  ♫

670
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,396
Okay.

671
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,946
Do Jun, I've always wanted to be like someone in love in TV dramas

672
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:55,726
and say, "This is our first day," so badly.

673
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:59,046
Do Jun, thank you so much for making my dream come true.

674
00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:11,646
♫  You shine brighter than the star  ♫

675
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,906
Were you that thirsty, Myeong Dong?

676
00:49:25,906 --> 00:49:28,996
You're always pretty, no matter what you do.

677
00:49:28,996 --> 00:49:30,706
Do Sik,

678
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,580
how much longer do we have to date secretly?

679
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:39,536
Let's not be like this and come out as a couple.

680
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:42,126
C-Come out?

681
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:43,966
Think about it.

682
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:48,146
We just need to like each other. Why do we need permission at our age?

683
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:50,506
I'll take care of my family.

684
00:49:50,506 --> 00:49:52,716
You be responsible for your family.

685
00:49:52,716 --> 00:49:54,106
You can do that, right?

686
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:58,196
Of course, I can do that.

687
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:06,746
I can't tell if I'm single or have a boyfriend these days.

688
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:08,556
Myeong Dong, how could you say that?

689
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:11,376
Your boyfriend is right here in front of you.

690
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,166
How could you be single?

691
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:14,786
So what if I have a boyfriend?

692
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:18,166
I can't even tell anyone you're my boyfriend.

693
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,846
I'm sorry.

694
00:50:22,846 --> 00:50:26,656
As you know, my family is going through stuff right now.

695
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,886
Could you wait just a little longer?

696
00:50:28,886 --> 00:50:30,126
For how long, exactly?

697
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:32,186
When will your family stop having dramas?

698
00:50:32,186 --> 00:50:34,106
By the time I turn 50, maybe?

699
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:37,496
Do Sik, you're unbelievable.

700
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,866
Myeong Dong. Myeong...

701
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,686
Ji Yeong.

702
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,146
Please talk to me, Ji Yeong.

703
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,646
Talk about what?

704
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:16,036
I told you I have nothing to say to you.

705
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:18,546
Ji Yeong.

706
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,836
We're over.

707
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:23,006
We have no reason to see each other.

708
00:51:23,006 --> 00:51:24,616
Why do you keep doing this?

709
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:27,096
We're over?

710
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:29,456
We have no reason to see each other?

711
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:32,596
Kim Ji Yeong, you can't do this.

712
00:51:32,596 --> 00:51:37,206
You fed me dumpling soup and shook my heart recently.

713
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:40,146
Why are you suddenly doing this?

714
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:41,786
Be honest with me.

715
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:46,516
You're doing this because of Go Pil Sung. Aren't you?

716
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:48,566
Think whatever you want.

717
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:51,296
You have nothing to do with me anymore.

718
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,666
Right.

719
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,296
Also, don't ever show up in front of my house.

720
00:51:57,296 --> 00:52:00,486
If you show up again, I'll report you to the police.

721
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:02,420
What?

722
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,066
What did you say? Report?

723
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:07,846
Hey, am I a criminal? Why would you report me?

724
00:52:07,846 --> 00:52:10,286
Is it a crime to like you?

725
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:18,786
My engagement and adoption were canceled because of you.

726
00:52:18,786 --> 00:52:21,136
What did you say just now?

727
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:28,946
Yes, this is all because of Go Pil Sung.

728
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:33,150
He stole my woman and took my spot as an adoptive son, too.

729
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:36,136
I won't forgive that bastard.

730
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:41,666
I'll kill that Go Pil Sung bastard.

731
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:55,026
Let's see.

732
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:05,716
Okay, keep going.

733
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,736
Wow, this was all the money I had.

734
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:12,376
I thought I'd have fun since I had nothing to lose.

735
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,936
But look. I won a million won.

736
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,866
I would've made tens of millions if only I had more today.

737
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:22,506
What a shame. What a shame.

738
00:53:22,506 --> 00:53:25,796
I have the skills, but not a bullet.

739
00:53:25,796 --> 00:53:27,566
Is there a way to get some money?

740
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:30,716
I'm sure I'd win big if I had some.

741
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,016
 I heard you told President Gong you'll pay him 300 million back. 

742
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:38,436
 Where did you get that money? 

743
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,876
 Grandma gave it to me. 

744
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:47,986
She got Ji Yeong an apartment, and she gave her 300 million, too.

745
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:52,526
Ji Yeong's grandma must be way richer than she looks.

746
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:03,856
Aigoo! You were here, too, Do Jun. I'm glad.

747
00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:06,106
Yes, Noona invited me for dinner.

748
00:54:06,106 --> 00:54:10,416
I see. Ji Yeong, take this.

749
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,856
W-What's this?

750
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:15,406
I know you like tangerines.

751
00:54:15,406 --> 00:54:18,076
The greenhouse tangerine from the fruit shop looked tasty.

752
00:54:18,076 --> 00:54:19,616
So, I brought some for you.

753
00:54:19,616 --> 00:54:22,436
It's sweet. Give some to your grandma, too.

754
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:25,196
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

755
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:26,736
Hey, hey. Hand me the grapes.

756
00:54:26,736 --> 00:54:30,906
I'll wash them because Do Jun likes them, okay?

757
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:34,026
What's going on? The voice sounds familiar.

758
00:54:34,026 --> 00:54:38,476
Grandma, I bought some fruit. I brought some for you.

759
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,646
I got you apples, tangerines, and grapes.

760
00:54:40,646 --> 00:54:42,106
You're Dong Dong, right?

761
00:54:42,106 --> 00:54:44,446
It's Dong Dong. Yes, Dong Dong.

762
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:47,196
Aigoo, Dong Dong is back.

763
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:49,186
You're finally back.

764
00:54:50,006 --> 00:54:52,276
I've been looking for you everywhere.

765
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:55,966
What took you so long to come back?

766
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,176
Grandma.

767
00:54:58,176 --> 00:55:00,906
Grandma, who's Dong Dong?

768
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:05,446
Ji Yeong, Do Jun, this is your aunt. Your aunt.

769
00:55:05,446 --> 00:55:07,506
My daughter, Dong Dong.

770
00:55:07,506 --> 00:55:10,616
- Dong Dong? 
 - Dong Dong. Dong Dong.

771
00:55:10,616 --> 00:55:15,046
Aigoo, what took you so long to come back?

772
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:18,646
By the way, why do you look so awful?

773
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:23,216
Come inside my room, Dong Dong. Come on in. Hurry.

774
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:29,266
You can't go anywhere anymore.

775
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:32,246
Noona, what's going on?

776
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:36,176
I don't know, either.

777
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:39,926
Looks like she thinks Mom is her daughter.

778
00:55:39,926 --> 00:55:44,316
Gosh, Dong Dong. My daughter, Dong Dong.

779
00:55:48,276 --> 00:55:50,936
Grandma, what are you doing?

780
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:53,206
This ahjumma isn't Aunt.

781
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:55,816
Come to your senses, Grandma.

782
00:55:55,816 --> 00:56:00,846
Ji Yeong, you can't call your aunt that. What's with you?

783
00:56:00,846 --> 00:56:04,716
She always loved you so much.

784
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:09,276
Dong Dong, don't go anywhere anymore.

785
00:56:09,276 --> 00:56:13,406
Let's live here from now on, okay?

786
00:56:13,406 --> 00:56:18,776
What? H-Here? Live here together?

787
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,276
- Yes, yes. 
 - Yes, Mom. I won't go anywhere.

788
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:24,226
I won't go anywhere. I'll live with you, Mom!

789
00:56:24,226 --> 00:56:26,456
- Don't go anywhere. 
 - I'll live with you.

790
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:29,236
- Yes, Mom. Let's live together. 
 - My Dong Dong...

791
00:56:29,236 --> 00:56:33,206
- I'll live here with you. 
 - Dong Dong...

792
00:56:33,206 --> 00:56:35,366
Let's live together.

793
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,356
Do Jun!

794
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:03,366
- Hand me that. 
 - Here!

795
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:07,726
Do Jun, drop me off in front of the office today?

796
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:09,086
Aren't you going home?

797
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:10,986
I have a date with Oppa today.

798
00:57:10,986 --> 00:57:16,476
So, drop me off near the pasta restaurant in front of the office and go home.

799
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,276
Should I pick you up afterward?

800
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:20,766
Oppa will drive me home.

801
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:23,526
Go home and study or rest.

802
00:57:23,526 --> 00:57:26,186
I'll call you when I'm done.

803
00:57:26,186 --> 00:57:27,576
Okay.

804
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:30,916
Make sure to call me afterward.

805
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:32,236
Of course, I will.

806
00:57:32,236 --> 00:57:35,826
I'll report to you since you're my boyfriend now.

807
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:37,676
You don't have to go that far.

808
00:57:37,676 --> 00:57:41,076
No, I will. I want to.

809
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:44,016
Okay, do whatever you want. Let's go.

810
00:57:55,596 --> 00:57:58,156
I didn't have two servings.

811
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,036
The emotions are important in this scene. We won't have many takes.

812
00:58:20,036 --> 00:58:23,286
- Tell the production team to control the area well. 
 - Okay.

813
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:30,186
We need to rehearse. Is Gang Bin not here yet?

814
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:33,136
He'll be here in 30 minutes because he's stuck in traffic.

815
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:34,426
Is that so?

816
00:58:35,236 --> 00:58:37,696
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Yes.

817
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:40,396
Gang Bin is running late. Let's run the lines with me.

818
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:42,296
Okay.

819
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:52,796
Bun Hong, why didn't you tell me?

820
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:54,896
Why did you deceive me?

821
00:58:55,996 --> 00:59:00,976
Do you know how it feels to watch you without knowing anything?

822
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:04,296
Stop liking me.

823
00:59:05,656 --> 00:59:08,326
I don't like you, Jin Hyeok.

824
00:59:08,326 --> 00:59:12,756
If I did, you'd have a hard time.

825
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:15,116
So, stop liking me.

826
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:19,226
Don't lie.

827
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:21,396
I know you like me, too.

828
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:25,586
I don't. I said I don't like you.

829
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,216
I don't care if you don't like me.

830
00:59:32,896 --> 00:59:34,976
I like you a lot.

831
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:39,106
That's why I want to protect you.

832
00:59:40,006 --> 00:59:44,886
I want you to lean on me and no longer...

833
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:48,756
go through hardships and heartaches.

834
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:56,906
Director.

835
00:59:57,906 --> 01:00:01,216
That line wasn't in the script.

836
01:00:01,216 --> 01:00:02,716
No.

837
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:09,336
But I thought I'd regret it if I didn't tell you now.

838
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:16,286
I know I can't be forgiven for what I did to you back then.

839
01:00:17,266 --> 01:00:21,416
But I've done good things, too.

840
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:27,566
We have more good memories than bad.

841
01:00:27,566 --> 01:00:30,616
You'll realize it once you get your memory back.

842
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:35,876
So, trust me one more time and let me show you.

843
01:00:42,486 --> 01:00:44,106
No.

844
01:00:46,326 --> 01:00:48,326
I don't want to do that.

845
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:50,956
I don't want to get my memory back

846
01:00:50,956 --> 01:00:54,016
and I no longer want to date anyone.

847
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:57,086
I just want to finish this project as Kim Ji Yeong.

848
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:00,096
I don't want to think about anything but the project.

849
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:03,676
So, please keep that in mind, Director.

850
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:05,186
Ji Yeong.

851
01:01:05,186 --> 01:01:06,706
I...

852
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:12,166
I'm not interested in seeing you just because I broke up with President Gong.

853
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,666
And you also said...

854
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:18,886
you want me to forget about my old memories and live as Kim Ji Yeong.

855
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:23,606
I'll just live as Kim Ji Yeong.

856
01:01:23,606 --> 01:01:28,526
You should forget about me and find someone nice.

857
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,806
That's what I want.

858
01:01:33,266 --> 01:01:36,036
I can't let you have that.

859
01:01:36,036 --> 01:01:40,456
I can't date anyone but you, Ji Yeong.

860
01:01:40,456 --> 01:01:44,296
Why can't you? Why does it have to be that way?

861
01:01:45,526 --> 01:01:47,976
This is why I don't like you.

862
01:01:48,856 --> 01:01:52,000
Why are you so foolish and senseless?

863
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:54,436
Why do you like someone like me?

864
01:01:54,436 --> 01:01:56,750
Forget about someone like me.

865
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:02,276
I'll never get my memory back, and I'll never go back to you.

866
01:02:02,276 --> 01:02:04,606
Please stop waiting for me.

867
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:27,826
Yes, Ma Ri.

868
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:30,766
 Oppa, I'm done with the art class and on my way there. 

869
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:32,316
How about you?

870
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,786
I just finished shooting, and I'm at the office.

871
01:02:34,786 --> 01:02:38,106
Then, let's meet at the pasta restaurant in front of the office.

872
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:39,556
I'll meet you there.

873
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,076
Okay.

874
01:02:41,076 --> 01:02:44,086
What did you want to tell me about, by the way?

875
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:49,376
I'll tell you in person.

876
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:51,396
You'll be surprised to hear it.

877
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,926
I'm dying to know, but I'll wait.

878
01:02:53,926 --> 01:02:56,186
Because you'll tell me in person.

879
01:02:56,186 --> 01:02:58,616
Okay. Travel safely.

880
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:13,230


881
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,916
Oppa!

882
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,156
Ma Ri, wait there! I'll come to you!

883
01:03:29,156 --> 01:03:30,566
What?

884
01:03:32,636 --> 01:03:34,556
No, Ma Ri!

885
01:03:54,236 --> 01:03:55,866
Oppa.

886
01:03:57,756 --> 01:03:59,646
Oppa!

887
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:04,396
Was it a hit-and-run? Did you see the license plate?

888
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:05,936
O-Oppa...

889
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:07,926
He must be injured badly.

890
01:04:07,926 --> 01:04:09,486
Oppa.

891
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,686
Open your eyes, Oppa.

892
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,266
Oppa...

893
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:19,106
Oppa, don't die. Oppa!

894
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,176
Oppa, it's me.

895
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:24,426
It's me, Do Ra.

896
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:26,686
Oh, no...

897
01:04:26,686 --> 01:04:29,666
Help him!

898
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:32,506
Help him!

899
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:35,816
Oppa! Oppa, it's me, Do Ra!

900
01:04:35,816 --> 01:04:39,396
I'm Do Ra, Oppa! I'm Do Ra.

901
01:04:39,396 --> 01:04:42,626
Oppa, I'm Do Ra. Open your eyes.

902
01:04:43,586 --> 01:04:45,176
Oppa!

903
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,436
   

904
01:04:50,436 --> 01:04:54,266
♫  Tear us apart  ♫

905
01:04:54,266 --> 01:05:00,686
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

906
01:05:00,686 --> 01:05:11,786
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

907
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:18,546
♫  One love  ♫

908
01:05:22,546 --> 01:05:26,086
 What happened to Pil Sung? How badly was he hurt? 

909
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:28,706
 I don't know. He's in surgery right now. 

910
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:31,186
 Our house was turned upside down. Ma Ri almost died. 

911
01:05:31,186 --> 01:05:33,456
 What happened to her half-brother? Is he dead? 

912
01:05:33,456 --> 01:05:35,626
 That means he could actually die. 

913
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:37,596
 What did you say? A burner car? 

914
01:05:37,596 --> 01:05:39,386
 Someone intended to kill him? 

915
01:05:39,386 --> 01:05:42,936
 You mean something could go wrong? No, right? 

916
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:45,936
 No, no! 

917
01:05:45,936 --> 01:05:48,296
 Please let him live. 

918
01:05:48,296 --> 01:05:51,656
 Please let him live, please...
