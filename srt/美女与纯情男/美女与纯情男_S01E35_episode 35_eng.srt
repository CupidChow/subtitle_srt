1
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:52,074
Hey, get them out of here. 
    

2
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:55,684
 What? What are you doing? 

3
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,384
Let go!

4
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,144
Let go of her!

5
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:07,514
Let go!

6
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:09,354
Let go of her!

7
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,954
Stop it!

8
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,904
- Ji Yeong! 
 - Ji Yeong!

9
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,604
Get rid of the reporters first!

10
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:30,154
You can't photograph!

11
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:31,834
Let's go.

12
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:46,194
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

13
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:47,924
Yes, I'm okay.

14
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:50,304
How about you? Are you okay?

15
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,164
I'm okay.

16
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:04,174
Yes, what is it?

17
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:05,794
Chairman, we have a problem.

18
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,994
The articles about the protest are flooding in.

19
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:17,034
   

20
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:29,404
 How could they shut down the set without a warning when the drama is about to air? 

21
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:31,474
 This can't happen. 

22
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:35,094
 I beg you. 

23
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:37,314
 Please let us enter the set. 

24
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:40,234
 We want to act. 

25
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:45,904
 And we can't shoot without Director Go Pil Sung. 

26
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:51,814
 We will fight until our demands are met. 

27
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:59,894
There are more articles because an actor got injured while protesting.

28
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,294
An actor got injured?

29
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:02,774
Yes.

30
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,784
Are they seriously injured?

31
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:10,864
She didn't have to be sent to the ER, but the reporters are making a big deal about this matter.

32
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:14,334
Tell the security company not to touch anyone.

33
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,104
Got it.

34
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:19,914
By the way, Chairman...

35
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,844
What is it now?

36
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:24,964
I thought you should know about this.

37
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,854
What's this?

38
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:34,004
She joined the protest, too?

39
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:39,904
Yes. There's a rumor that you might get divorced in the financial circle

40
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,114
and people are boycotting APP Group products on social media.

41
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,974
What?

42
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:52,074
President Gong removed Ms. Jang from the protest and put her in the conference room.

43
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,564
How could you do this?

44
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,884
How could you trap me in here?

45
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:11,474
What the hell are you up to?

46
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,534
We're not divorced yet.

47
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:16,104
You're still the wife of the APP Group's chairman.

48
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:19,384
How dare you protest in front of the company like that?

49
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,234
The reporters photographed you, and there are articles about it.

50
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:25,164
You're the one who started this.

51
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,054
You should be regretting your action. But what are you doing instead?

52
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,944
I wanted to be regretful, too.

53
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:32,414
But you're the one who turned me into this.

54
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,204
What?

55
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:37,154
I said I'd do whatever you want me to do,

56
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:40,014
but I asked you not to touch Go Go Entertainment and Pil Sung.

57
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:43,564
What did Pil Sung do wrong that you're harassing him like this?

58
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:49,604
If you keep this up, you should know this.

59
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:51,444
I will fight until the end.

60
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:55,734
And I'll never get divorced quietly.

61
00:04:56,744 --> 00:04:58,344
What did you say?

62
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,674
Honey! Honey, calm down.

63
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,634
Pil Sung would suffer more if you go.

64
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,634
Why should I tolerate this?

65
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:15,984
Pil Sung was treated unjustly, and he's protesting right now.

66
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,944
How could I sit still as a parent?

67
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,834
I don't care anymore.

68
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,374
Honey, Honey!

69
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:25,224
Honey, hold on! Wait for me!

70
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:29,934
Honey! Gosh, Honey! Wait for me!

71
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:42,414
Chairman, Director Go's parents want to see you.

72
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,964
Tell them to leave.

73
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:51,394
Do you think I wanted to come here?

74
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,034
You're the one who made us come here.

75
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:55,924
You can't do this without an appointment.

76
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:58,554
Move! How dare you touch me?

77
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:01,244
Secretary Kim, wait outside.

78
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,444
Did we do something wrong?

79
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:10,084
Did Pil Sung do something wrong?

80
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:12,904
We've been hurt more greatly than you.

81
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,714
Your wife is the one who's at fault.

82
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:17,164
Why should we suffer instead?

83
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:24,164
All we did was do our best to raise Pil Sung, who was abandoned as a baby.

84
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:27,494
Pil Sung didn't know anything, either.

85
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:33,104
He was shocked to find out your wife was his birth mother and he struggled a lot.

86
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:38,304
But why are you hurting him so much like this?

87
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:43,714
We wouldn't have let him join this company if we had known this would happen.

88
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:51,934
All Pil Sung did was work hard ever since he joined Go Go Entertainment.

89
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:55,094
You... You really can't do this.

90
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:58,634
The power and money you have.

91
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,614
Are you supposed to wield them like this?

92
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:03,604
Are they for destroying weak people?

93
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:05,634
Honey, let's just go.

94
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,854
Step down, President Gong Jin Dan!

95
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:31,164
 Step down! Step down! 

96
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,364
Stop trying to replace the director!

97
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,844
 Stop, stop! 

98
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:37,984
Bring "House of Roses" back!

99
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:41,214
 - Bring it back! Bring it back!  
 - Honey, what do we do about Pil Sung...

100
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,094
My goodness.

101
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:47,664
You can't cry when he's fighting with all his might.

102
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:50,134
He might see you. Let's go.

103
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,484
Stop trying to replace the director!

104
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,854
 Stop! Stop! 

105
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,064
Excuse me, Hyung.

106
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,814
Bring "House of Roses" back!

107
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:04,154
Mom, Father, what's going on?

108
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:06,334
Why are you here?

109
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,364
What do you mean, why?

110
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,754
It was even on the news. How could we not come?

111
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,864
Are you okay?

112
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:19,404
I'm okay. I'll figure things out somehow. Don't worry.

113
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,634
Okay. Don't overdo it.

114
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:27,774
You can't get hurt, Pil Sung.

115
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,934
Pil Sung, cheer up and win, okay?

116
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:33,404
We're all rooting for you.

117
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,284
Go back now.

118
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:37,094
Okay. See you both later.

119
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:40,314
- Okay. 
 - Be careful.

120
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,154
 Bring "House of Roses" back! 

121
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,574
 Bring it back! Bring it back! 

122
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:48,124
 Stop keeping us out of our set! 

123
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,444
 Stop! Stop! 

124
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,904
 Step down, President Gong Jin Dan! 

125
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:55,714
 Step down! Step down! 

126
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:58,154
 Stop trying to replace the director! 

127
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,894
- Honey, what do we do? 
 - Seriously.

128
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,604
Don't cry. Pil Sung can see you.

129
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:09,864
 We wouldn't have let him join this company if we had known this would happen. 

130
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:11,964
 You really can't do this. 

131
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:15,504
 The power and money you have. 

132
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,494
 Are you supposed to wield them like this? 

133
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:20,874
 Are they for destroying weak people? 

134
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:33,624
Stop keeping us out of our set!

135
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:36,224
 Stop! Stop! 

136
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:38,304
Bring "House of Roses" back!

137
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:40,894
 Bring it back! Bring it back! 

138
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:44,014
They opened up the set for us.

139
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:47,234
They said we can shoot now. We won!

140
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:49,724
How about Director Go's dismissal?

141
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:53,134
That has been canceled, too!

142
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:04,734
Thank you, everyone!

143
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,314
It's all thanks to you!

144
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:11,614
I'll have a fresh start, thanks to your support!

145
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,604
I say, "House of Roses," you say, "let's go!"

146
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,904
- House of Roses! 
  - Let's go! 

147
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:19,544
- House of Roses! 
  - Let's go! 

148
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,484
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:43,084
I let my personal matters cause problems.

150
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:47,584
The director, writer, actors, and staff members.

151
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:54,774
I apologize to you once again.

152
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,944
You went through a lot, too.

153
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:08,894
It couldn't have been easy for you to fight with us.

154
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:12,274
You helped us greatly. Thank you.

155
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,184
Not at all.

156
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:19,394
I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you and let you go through this.

157
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:25,904
I'll do my best so the last episodes of "House of Roses" go well.

158
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:35,304
You let us overcome this crisis safely.

159
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:41,614
To respond to your trust in me, I'll do my best until we finish the drama.

160
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,814
Thank you so much!

161
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:49,354
Well done, Director Go.

162
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:54,504
If you had given up and left, I would've hated you for it.

163
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:59,684
We're grateful that you stayed without giving up while feeling the pressure.

164
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,634
I'm proud of you, Director Go!

165
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:07,444
I was worried you'd quit out of anger, too.

166
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:10,754
You have to admit how responsible and gutsy Director Go is.

167
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,524
Why should I quit?

168
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,524
I'll never quit until we finish "House of Roses."

169
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:19,474
I'll be with you until the end!

170
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:25,564
This meal is on me, everyone.

171
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:29,364
Feel free to eat as much as you'd like!

172
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:34,834
Now, now. What are you doing? Let's grill some meat.

173
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,884
- Help yourself. 
 - Eat as much as you'd like.

174
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,654
Thank you. Feel free to get more food.

175
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,134
Thank you.

176
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,614
Thank you for the meal.

177
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,804
Thank you so much for being on our side.

178
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:49,644
I'll grill delicious meat for you.

179
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:58,434
Whoa.

180
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,454
Enjoy.

181
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:08,014
It's even tastier because you gave it to me. So tasty.

182
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,314
Here, have some, Writer.

183
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:16,564
It's tastier with different fixings.

184
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:25,384
He certainly knows how to eat.

185
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,314
Ji Yeong, help yourself.

186
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,094
You worked so hard today.

187
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:42,284
Not at all. Don't mention it.

188
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,954
Go ahead and eat. Thank you.

189
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:49,404
Help yourselves.

190
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,684
 So tasty. 

191
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,264
 - Do you need anything else? 
 - Yes. 

192
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,884
 - We'd like more of this. 
 - Okay. 

193
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:09,854
 Ji Yeong, where are you? 

194
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,684
 We're having a team lunch. 

195
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:24,744
 Three more plates of pork belly, please. 

196
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,014
 Come out right now. This is urgent. 

197
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:29,684
 Otherwise, I'll barge in there. 

198
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:31,954
Let me know if you want anything else.

199
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:35,214
 It's so tasty. So tasty. 

200
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:41,194
I'm sorry, but I need to go home right now.

201
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,454
Okay, get home safely.

202
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,170
   

203
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,804
Ji Yeong.

204
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,664
Why are you leaving already?

205
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:03,784
The thing is...

206
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:08,114
Something urgent came up at home.

207
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:10,584
Is it Grandmother? I'll drive you, then.

208
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:13,834
No, no. It's not.

209
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,614
You got injured. I can't let you leave alone.

210
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:19,134
- Let's go. 
 - No, it's okay.

211
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,614
I'm really okay.

212
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:24,644
I called a taxi.

213
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:27,154
And you're the main event today.

214
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:30,444
It won't make sense for you to leave.

215
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:36,984
The writer, actors, and staff members came here to comfort and congratulate you.

216
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:40,390
Are you sure you're okay, Ji Yeong?

217
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:43,894
You and your family are doing well, right?

218
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:47,374
There isn't anything going on, right?

219
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:54,604
Yes.

220
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,874
I'm okay.

221
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:07,064
Ji Yeong, you're Do Ra.

222
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:13,074
But it's tough for me that I have to wait since you haven't gotten your memory back.

223
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,794
How long will you push me away?

224
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:21,354
Will you do this forever if you don't get your memory back?

225
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:25,334
How long will you make me wait?

226
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,214
Well...

227
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:36,844
Director...

228
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:42,394
Yes, tell me.

229
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:45,134
Something's going on, right, Ji Yeong?

230
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:56,854
It's nothing.

231
00:16:57,494 --> 00:17:00,330
I'm just sorry I'm leaving early.

232
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:03,394
I'll get going now.

233
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,554
Ji Yeong,

234
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,984
I was so disappointed in you today.

235
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:32,904
Pardon?

236
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:36,664
It was ridiculous that you demanded I step down,

237
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:40,224
but how could you join those goons for a meal, too?

238
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:44,964
It's because it was a team lunch.

239
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,614
Looks like you keep forgetting.

240
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:52,304
You're my girlfriend now.

241
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:59,194
But you protested with those goons for your boyfriend to step down. How does that make sense?

242
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:02,514
You can't do that to me. I'm your boyfriend.

243
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:10,694
I'm indeed seeing you,

244
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:18,334
but President Gong, this is my work.

245
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:22,074
Everyone on "House of Roses" acts together.

246
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,734
How could I remove myself from it?

247
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:28,354
Please respect my work, too.

248
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:34,274
And I thought what happened was unjust, too.

249
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:36,094
What did you say?

250
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:42,304
So? Are you defending Go Pil Sung in front of me?

251
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:46,814
How could you defend your ex instead of me?

252
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:49,274
No, it's not like that.

253
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:50,854
Whatever.

254
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:56,024
Don't ever defend him in front of me again.

255
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:59,694
Defending your ex in front of me isn't right.

256
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:01,364
Okay?

257
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,534
Okay.

258
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:09,454
Go ahead and eat.

259
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:12,324
What? Is it not good? Do you want something else?

260
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:17,124
No... it's tasty.

261
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,084
Eat this, too.

262
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,914
- Get home safely. 
 - Okay.

263
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,654
You're on my side, okay?

264
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:33,244
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

265
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,524
Sleep tight.

266
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,354
Good night.

267
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:54,824
Ji Yeong.

268
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:01,534
Why were you with President Gong?

269
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:05,574
You said something urgent came up at home.

270
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:08,434
Did you have to see him urgently?

271
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,634
Yes.

272
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,644
I did.

273
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:20,574
Why would you meet President Gong?

274
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:24,354
He and I agreed to date officially.

275
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:30,004
President Gong is my boyfriend.

276
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:38,150
What are you talking about right now?

277
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:41,274
You don't like President Gong.

278
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,304
I'm the one you like.

279
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:50,244
I no longer like you. I decided to like President Gong.

280
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,974
You don't like him, but you decided to like him?

281
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:56,154
N-No...

282
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,464
I-I like him.

283
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:01,614
I said that by accident.

284
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,864
So, Director,

285
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:12,154
please don't come to my house late at night anymore.

286
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,680
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

287
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,864
I'll see you on set.

288
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:19,954
Get home safely.

289
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,584
Grandmother.

290
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:39,414
Director, that bitch is out of her mind.

291
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:48,684
Looks like she started an affair with some man recently.

292
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:51,414
But you know...

293
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:56,954
that you're the one my Ji Yeong likes.

294
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:59,394
Yes, I know, too.

295
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:03,104
By the way, do you know why she's doing that?

296
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:06,074
I don't know why, either.

297
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:11,424
It happened out of nowhere overnight.

298
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,824
Director, please give me a bit of time.

299
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:20,874
I'll find out why she's doing this.

300
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:26,854
So, Director, you can't change your mind until then.

301
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:30,644
Okay. I'll never change my mind.

302
00:22:32,814 --> 00:22:36,034
We're allies.

303
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,074
Okay.

304
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,634
That little leech.

305
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:49,024
Why won't he let go of Ji Yeong?

306
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:51,714
What do I do with him?

307
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:55,114
That Grandma. Seriously.

308
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:18,758
 I like you so much, but I might get my memory back 

309
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:23,348
 and end up blaming you 

310
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:26,618
 and hating you. 

311
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:30,288
 I'm afraid I'd hurt again. 

312
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:36,908
Ji Yeong definitely still likes me.

313
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:40,118
But why?

314
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:45,498
 I no longer like you. I decided to like President Gong. 

315
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:49,458
 You don't like him, but you decided to like him? 

316
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,938
 N-No... 

317
00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:53,768
 I-I like him. 

318
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,898
 I said that by accident. 

319
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:01,938
There's definitely something going on.

320
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,778
Something...

321
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:22,338
Director Go?

322
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:25,998
Director Go, we need to talk.

323
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:34,968
Why did you come so early this morning after coming last night, too?

324
00:24:34,968 --> 00:24:36,578
Why do you keep tempting Ji Yeong?

325
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:38,368
You broke up a long time ago.

326
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:41,038
Why are you doing this?

327
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:47,228
You forced Ji Yeong to see President Gong, didn't you?

328
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:50,298
You sent her to a nightclub last time.

329
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:53,668
Why did you send her to President Gong this time?

330
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,628
Did you take money from him, by chance?

331
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,458
Money?

332
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,538
Money? What money?

333
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:03,428
What are you talking about right now?

334
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:08,178
I can't believe this. You think you can just say anything?

335
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:10,908
And things are back to normal now.

336
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:14,288
Ji Yeong and President Gong used to like each other.

337
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:18,118
They were going to get engaged.

338
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:25,448
By the way, what gives you the right to argue about it?

339
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:28,908
Seriously. I can't believe how ridiculous this is.

340
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:34,708
You tortured her for money when she used to be Do Ra, too.

341
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:37,498
She wouldn't do this unless it's for money.

342
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:39,488
The reason doesn't matter.

343
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:42,808
What gives you the right to argue about it right now?

344
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,268
What's your relationship with Ji Yeong?

345
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:50,458
Do you have an ulterior motive for your actor, by chance?

346
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:53,208
This goes against the work ethics.

347
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,048
Director Go, stop being interested in Ji Yeong.

348
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:58,618
Otherwise, I'll complain about it.

349
00:25:58,618 --> 00:26:03,278
I'll say the director is using his power to harass an actor, okay?

350
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,578
And...

351
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:09,028
And here it is.

352
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:12,378
It's the...

353
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:17,118
50 million won you paid the nightclub.

354
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,888
Looks like you feel entitled because of that.

355
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:25,238
I added 500,000 won for interest, too.

356
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:27,768
This makes us even now.

357
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:30,118
Don't tempt Ji Yeong from now on.

358
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:32,858
I definitely paid you back, okay?

359
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:39,778
Wow, I was just going to leave, but the more I think, the more I get angry.

360
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:43,078
Hey, Go Pil Sung, don't you have any conscience?

361
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:49,428
If it wasn't for you, Do Ra would've married President Gong and she would've been happy all this time.

362
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:52,628
She wouldn't have died if you left her alone.

363
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:56,198
Look how she came back in that state.

364
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,258
This is all your fault. Your fault.

365
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:04,908
Go Pil Sung, if you have an ounce of conscience,

366
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:08,438
if you care about Ji Yeong sincerely,

367
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:12,868
stop lurking around her going forward, okay?

368
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:14,828
Seriously.

369
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:16,738
I beg you, okay?

370
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:19,158
Gosh, seriously...

371
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:32,648
Where did President Baek get this money?

372
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:37,208
Was it really for money?

373
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,118
No way.

374
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:45,068
How could anyone...

375
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:54,098
Noona, you used to like this mango cake a lot.

376
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:55,918
Try some.

377
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:58,878
Mango cake?

378
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,618
This used to be my favorite?

379
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,498
I've never had this before.

380
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:06,618
Really? Try it, Noona.

381
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:16,708
This is so good.

382
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,108
It's melting in my mouth.

383
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:21,308
Why could it be so good?

384
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:23,568
I knew you'd like it.

385
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,190
Thank you, Do Jun.

386
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,410
It's really tasty.

387
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:39,548
Noona, here's some pocket money for you.

388
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:44,958
- Pocket money? 
 - You used to give me a lot of pocket money.

389
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,378
I'm not giving you that much.

390
00:28:46,378 --> 00:28:48,888
Why would you give me pocket money?

391
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:51,868
I should be giving it to you as your older sister.

392
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:54,338
Do Jun, just wait a bit.

393
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:57,298
I'll make money and give you a lot of pocket money.

394
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:59,258
No, Noona.

395
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:03,288
I'll no longer accept pocket money from you.

396
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:05,198
I'm grown up now.

397
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,948
I'll return everything you've given me from now on.

398
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,968
So, please take it, Noona.

399
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:18,218
I really want to give you pocket money.

400
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,898
Okay, Do Jun.

401
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,608
I'll take it.

402
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:33,398
You...

403
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:37,888
might feel uncomfortable with me because you have no memory,

404
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:41,710
but you're still my older sister.

405
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,818
So, please feel comfortable with me.

406
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,728
You're cute.

407
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:56,268
Yes, you used to say "My baby" to me all the time.

408
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:59,168
- I used to say that to you? 
 - Yes.

409
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,658
Hey, I can't say that just yet.

410
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:08,178
Go ahead and eat.

411
00:30:08,178 --> 00:30:09,528
- It's so tasty. 
 - Yes.

412
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:11,578
Hey, what's with you two?

413
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:14,658
Are you eating a cake without us?

414
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,738
Mom, yell at them.

415
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:19,108
They never include me for anything.

416
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,718
Really?

417
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:25,708
Ji Yeong and Do Jun, how dare you leave out my son, Geum Dong?

418
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,908
Grandma, come have a seat.

419
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:30,088
Okay.

420
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,888
Mom, how could you?

421
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:34,838
Grandma, what would you like? What can I get you?

422
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:37,168
- Come on, Hyung. 
 - This is enough.

423
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:43,258
Madam Jang, this is the divorce paper Chairman Gong sent.

424
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:46,138
Yes, Attorney Kang.

425
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,808
I'll read it and get back to you.

426
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,118
I'll sign it then.

427
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:53,518
Okay. Please let me know.

428
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,228
I'll get going now, then.

429
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:15,848
   

430
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,708
President Gong, what's going on?

431
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:34,018
President Jang, you were dismissed as the CEO of Go Go Entertainment today.

432
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,668
What did you say?

433
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:42,988
Jin Dan, I was dismissed? What do you mean?

434
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:48,068
We decided to dismiss you during the board meeting just now.

435
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:53,118
Starting today, I'll be the temporary CEO here.

436
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:57,058
So please leave the office.

437
00:31:57,578 --> 00:32:00,158
What gives you the right to dismiss me?

438
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:03,778
What are you doing? Remove everything in here.

439
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,268
What are you doing!

440
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:07,558
You'd better stop immediately.

441
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,218
Soo Yeon, argue about it with Jin Taek instead.

442
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:18,378
The order was issued by Chairman Gong, the largest shareholder of Go Go Entertainment.

443
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:23,588
Don't touch a thing until I come back.

444
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,788
Understand?

445
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:33,928
All right.

446
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:37,828
President Jang was dismissed today.

447
00:32:37,828 --> 00:32:43,178
I, Gong Jin Dan, will be Go Go Entertainment's temporary CEO.

448
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:46,718
I'm planning to work hard for Go Go Entertainment.

449
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:51,148
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

450
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,110
   

451
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:05,908
How could you do this, Honey?

452
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,708
You can leave, Secretary Kim.

453
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:18,608
Talk to me through Attorney Kang from now on.

454
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:21,918
What is there for us to talk about?

455
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,798
I don't ever want to see you.

456
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,218
Please leave.

457
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:30,808
Jin Taek, how could you fire me from Go Go Entertainment?

458
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,168
I said I don't want anything else.

459
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:35,350
I asked you to let me just have Go Go.

460
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,910
How could you do this to me?

461
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:42,158
Why? Is it because of Go Pil Sung?

462
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:44,658
Because you want to keep your son next to you?

463
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:48,188
Will you see him openly every day now?

464
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:51,498
- Honey! 
 - I'm sorry, but that can't happen.

465
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:53,618
I won't tolerate it.

466
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,298
I let "House of Roses" continue for various reasons,

467
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,978
but I'll shut Go Go Entertainment down after the drama ends.

468
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:04,878
I made Jin Dan the temporary CEO for now. Keep that in mind and leave.

469
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:09,788
Get ready to divorce, as we discussed.

470
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:15,118
You think I'd back down like this?

471
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:20,518
If you keep doing this, I won't agree to your conditions!

472
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,688
What did you say? Do you have any conscience?

473
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:26,248
You think I'd just leave you be?

474
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:30,128
Stop! Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

475
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:31,548
Ma Ri!

476
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:33,728
- Ma Ri, are you okay? 
 - Don't fight!

477
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,388
- Stop fighting! 
 - Ma Ri!

478
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:37,858
- Ma Ri. 
 - Ma Ri, calm down!

479
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:39,438
Ma Ri.

480
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:40,918
Ma Ri.

481
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:48,768
Gong Ma Ri, what's that suitcase for?

482
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,778
I won't live here anymore.

483
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:52,808
I won't live with you, Dad.

484
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:55,908
Ma Ri, what are you talking about?

485
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:58,528
I hurt my head, but I know what's bad.

486
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:01,888
Mom was wrong and bad at first, but you're worse now.

487
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:04,538
So, I don't want to live with you right now.

488
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:06,168
I'm 28 years old now.

489
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:08,418
I can choose how I want to live.

490
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:11,128
So I'll live with Mom!

491
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:13,908
What are you talking about?

492
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:18,738
You mean you'll live with that bitch instead of Dad?

493
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:20,408
Stop insulting my mom!

494
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:22,668
- Ma Ri. 
 - Ma Ri, what's wrong with you?

495
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:24,758
How could you leave your dad behind?

496
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:27,468
- Yeojudaek, hold onto her. 
 - Okay.

497
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:30,028
Let go! Let go, I said!

498
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,648
- Take her to her room. 
 - Okay.

499
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:33,858
I hate you, Dad!

500
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:35,908
I want to go to Mom. Why won't you let me?

501
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:38,088
I want to live with Mom!

502
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:40,418
- Ma Ri! 
 - Let go of me!

503
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:44,008
I hate you! I hate you, Dad!

504
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,208
What's happening to this family?

505
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:52,068
Look what happens when you choose the wrong woman.

506
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,488
 What will you do with Ma Ri after you get divorced? 

507
00:36:05,828 --> 00:36:08,138
What do you mean by that?

508
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:11,788
It hurts me to say this, too,

509
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:15,108
but Ma Ri is different than normal kids.

510
00:36:15,688 --> 00:36:18,928
She's only 12 years old mentally.

511
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:24,560
You shouldn't lock her in her room when she only cares about her mom.

512
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,128
I know you love Ma Ri dearly,

513
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:33,438
but you should send her to her mom.

514
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:37,368
- That would be better for her, too. 
 - Auntie.

515
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:40,628
Soo Yeon took care of Ma Ri since she was young.

516
00:36:40,628 --> 00:36:46,248
Soo Yeon got her treated in the US when she got injured, too.

517
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:49,310
Will you keep locking her up in her room?

518
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,798
Just let her go to her mom.

519
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:01,520
And Jin Taek,

520
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:07,558
think seriously about what I'm about to tell you.

521
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:14,248
Who would be by your side after Ma Ri leaves?

522
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:19,518
It'd be difficult to get remarried and have a fresh start now.

523
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:23,848
Even if you did, it'd take too long to

524
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:26,818
have a baby and raise it.

525
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:35,278
Since we're on the topic, how about you adopt Jin Dan as your son?

526
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:37,368
Adopt him?

527
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,708
What are you talking about out of the blue?

528
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,388
Just think about it.

529
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:44,628
It's not out of the blue.

530
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:48,308
Son? Not just anyone but Jin Dan?

531
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,618
Come on, Auntie.

532
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:55,728
I like him, but the fact that he's the mistress' son always bothered me.

533
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:58,808
But he's still a son of the Gong family.

534
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:03,168
If he becomes your son,

535
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:07,368
Tae Hee's family would like him even more.

536
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,778
Our family would be in better shape, too.

537
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:11,540
Auntie, but still.

538
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,208
How could I adopt my brother?

539
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:19,438
People used to do it a long time ago, but the world has changed.

540
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:21,338
How old are you right now?

541
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:25,158
Don't just disregard me and think about it.

542
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,530
What did you say?

543
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,080
You want me to become Hyung's adopted son?

544
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,688
Yes.

545
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:40,338
You're the only one we have now.

546
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:44,498
When will your brother remarry and have a child?

547
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:47,638
It'd be better if he adopted you as his son.

548
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:51,678
But still, how could we do that?

549
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:53,858
Jin Dan is my son.

550
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:57,548
I don't know what Chairman Gong would think,

551
00:38:57,548 --> 00:39:01,268
but I think he'd do it for the family.

552
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:07,598
So if he agrees to do it, you should agree to do it for the family.

553
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:11,388
Becoming his adopted son wouldn't hurt you, either.

554
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:13,228
What would our family do otherwise?

555
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:18,258
If Ma Ri joins her mom, Chairman Gong would have no one left.

556
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:22,408
You're the only one left, Jin Dan.

557
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:28,308
Yes, I understand, Auntie.

558
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:31,108
We have to do that for the Gong family.

559
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:34,358
I can't just satisfy my greed.

560
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:39,768
Jin Dan, let's do that if your hyung agrees to.

561
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:42,638
Mom.

562
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:53,868
Mom, but still. How could I become his son?

563
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,408
Gosh, how embarrassing.

564
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:56,978
That's not important right now.

565
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:02,228
If you become his adopted son, you'd own APP Group.

566
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:09,728
If he adopts you, he'd give you everything instead of splitting things with Ma Ri's husband.

567
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,018
Jin Dan, you won't stop being my son because of it.

568
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:16,418
Let's do that, Jin Dan.

569
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:19,358
How did Aunt come up with that idea?

570
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:21,508
She must be a genius.

571
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:24,458
Isn't she so wise?

572
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,715
My gosh. What's going on?

573
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:38,135
My Jin Dan will be the owner of APP Group?

574
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,645
Gosh, is this a dream or reality?

575
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:46,925
Chairman Gong better decide to adopt him soon.

576
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:51,335
   

577
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,655
Hey, Sang Gu. It's me.

578
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:59,065
What did you say? You're where?

579
00:41:08,395 --> 00:41:10,115
Ae Gyo.

580
00:41:14,445 --> 00:41:16,295
Sang Gu.

581
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,105
How did you know I was here?

582
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:31,035
What's wrong with you?

583
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:34,385
Hey. Get out of my house immediately!

584
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,245
Cut! Okay!

585
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,475
We'll do a bust shot for Yeon Du.

586
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,285
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

587
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,415
I'm okay.

588
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:48,635
What? How dare she hit Ji Yeong?

589
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,365
You can hit me harder.

590
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,475
Why would she hit her so hard?

591
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,035
I'm really okay.

592
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:57,675
Bong Soo, that Na Bi—

593
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:01,765
Gong Hyung, don't talk to me from now on.

594
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:05,065
I hate people like you.

595
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,955
Hello, hello.

596
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,575
- Hello, hello. 
 - Hello.

597
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,675
Cha Bong Soo, what's with him?

598
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,075
Let's start the bust shot for Yeon Du.

599
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,605
This is unbelievable.

600
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,755
Is everyone ignoring me?

601
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:50,365
Don't worry about that so much.

602
00:42:50,365 --> 00:42:53,135
Don't they know they have jobs because of me?

603
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:56,245
How dare they act like I don't exist?

604
00:42:56,245 --> 00:42:57,695
Chief,

605
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,215
what do you do, exactly?

606
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,435
I'm the CEO of Go Go Entertainment.

607
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:09,905
If I showed up, the director and everyone else should greet me, at least. No?

608
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:14,815
I'm the one who pays them and lets them shoot the drama.

609
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,235
How dare they ignore me?

610
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:19,055
I'm sorry. I won't let that happen again.

611
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,615
This is all because of Go Pil Sung!

612
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:25,645
Everyone looks down on me because the director does!

613
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:29,965
Manage Go Pil Sung properly from now on.

614
00:43:29,965 --> 00:43:33,575
Otherwise, I'll get you fired first.

615
00:43:33,575 --> 00:43:36,875
Also, bring me the script.

616
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,285
This is no good. I need to look through it.

617
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,755
Yes, here it is.

618
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:58,035
This. Omit the part where Na Bi slaps Kim Ji Yeong.

619
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,115
Bullshit.

620
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:03,025
How could women slap each other?

621
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:07,995
No slapping is allowed in the drama I produce. Got it?

622
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:12,175
And tell them to remove Cha Bong Soo.

623
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:15,465
Kill him in a car accident or make him study abroad.

624
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:18,390
CEO, Cha Bong Soo is the lead.

625
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,930
They can't do that.

626
00:44:19,935 --> 00:44:21,235
What?

627
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:27,395
Fire him if I say so. Why would you argue?

628
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:31,265
Him... The one with a ponytail. Park Ji Su.

629
00:44:31,265 --> 00:44:33,915
He can become the lead.

630
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:38,245
Tell the writer to fix the script and reshoot starting Episode 12.

631
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,185
Got that?

632
00:44:40,185 --> 00:44:41,785
Chief,

633
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,360
what did you say?

634
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,790
Send the male lead abroad?

635
00:44:46,795 --> 00:44:50,705
Yes. Or kill him off in a car accident.

636
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:53,205
President Gong really said that, right?

637
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:54,705
Yes.

638
00:44:55,665 --> 00:44:57,925
Gosh, seriously.

639
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,665
Geez.

640
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:03,735
What kind of script is this?

641
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:08,095
She's been getting paid that much for this crap?

642
00:45:08,095 --> 00:45:13,085
Wow, I could write better with my foot.

643
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:19,145
Yes, I'm glad you're here.

644
00:45:20,105 --> 00:45:22,855
I have a lot to discuss with you, too.

645
00:45:22,855 --> 00:45:28,315
You ordered us to omit the scene where Ms. Kim gets slapped at the end of Episode 12, correct?

646
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:31,365
Yes. Get rid of that scene.

647
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:36,325
It's too coarse for women to slap each other in a fight.

648
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:41,005
Look, the K-contents are being exported globally.

649
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:45,785
If foreigners saw it, they'd think we're so coarse.

650
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,705
Hold on, Director Go.

651
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:54,005
Coarse? Did you call me coarse just now?

652
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:56,565
I'm not calling you coarse.

653
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:59,065
The content of the script is.

654
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:00,415
That's the same thing.

655
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:04,545
And... is it true you wanted Cha Bong Soo removed, too?

656
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:08,785
Yes, it's true. He needs to be out for the sake of the story.

657
00:46:08,785 --> 00:46:14,015
Wow, I've never met anyone so ignorant in my life.

658
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,035
W-What did you say? Ignorant?

659
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:22,535
Yes, I called you ignorant because you are, you idiot.

660
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:24,045
Wow.

661
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,335
A woman like this is the writer?

662
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:33,275
Did you read even a line of the script properly?

663
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:35,615
Do you know anything about drama?

664
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:38,275
Cha Bong Soo is the male lead until Episode 11.

665
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:40,465
You suddenly want his character killed?

666
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,685
No idiot would say such a thing.

667
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:44,085
How dare you throw a tantrum?

668
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:46,025
Listen to you.

669
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:49,175
Tantrum? How dare you speak that way?

670
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:53,285
If you speak rudely again, I'll replace you!

671
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:56,675
Go ahead. Replace me. Replace me!

672
00:46:56,675 --> 00:46:58,925
I can make a living without this drama, okay?

673
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:04,945
If I let my script get butchered, I'd no longer be Kim Oh Gyeong!

674
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:07,605
Who abuses their power like this these days?

675
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:10,725
Even a nouveau riche isn't as bad as you. You idiot.

676
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:13,445
Writer, please calm down.

677
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:16,205
How could someone so ignorant be a writer?

678
00:47:16,205 --> 00:47:17,925
President Gong!

679
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:20,255
What are you trying to pull?

680
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:24,325
Everyone has their role in the drama, yet you tell us to remove certain people?

681
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:27,045
Why are you telling the writer what to do?

682
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,545
Why are you telling the director what to do?

683
00:47:30,545 --> 00:47:33,715
- Follow basic manners. 
 - What?

684
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:35,015
Basic?

685
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:38,365
Are you saying I don't understand basic manners?

686
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:41,955
You work for Go Go Entertainment. Listen to the CEO!

687
00:47:41,955 --> 00:47:44,595
That's basic manners!

688
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,355
I can't do that.

689
00:47:46,355 --> 00:47:48,805
I'll follow Writer Kim's script.

690
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:50,495
Let's go, Writer Kim.

691
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:53,525
My blood pressure is rising. You idiot!

692
00:47:55,425 --> 00:47:57,595
Okay, fine.

693
00:47:57,595 --> 00:48:00,415
Hey! I'll fire all of you.

694
00:48:00,415 --> 00:48:04,265
Go Pil Sung! Kim Oh Gyeong! I'll fire all of you!

695
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,485
- Stop fighting! Stop fighting! 
 - Ma Ri! Calm down!

696
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:20,375
- Go away! Go away! Go away! 
 - Calm down, Ma Ri. Calm down.

697
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:24,375
Ma Ri, what's wrong? What's wrong?

698
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:28,275
Go away! I don't want to! I'm scared!

699
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:31,395
Ma Ri, Ma Ri.

700
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:34,175
- I need to see Mom. Where's she? 
 - Ma Ri!

701
00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:38,085
Mom! Dad is... Mom!

702
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:41,145
Mom! Mom!

703
00:48:41,145 --> 00:48:43,225
- Gosh. 
 - Ma Ri.

704
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,035
Mom! Mom!

705
00:48:48,035 --> 00:48:51,265
Where's Mom?

706
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,495
What did you say? Ma Ri did?

707
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:55,955
 Yes, Chairman Gong wants you here now. 

708
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:57,815
 She's in trouble. 

709
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:00,035
Okay, I'll be right there.

710
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:20,385
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

711
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:25,885
Yes. It's a psychological disorder that people like Ma Ri

712
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:30,545
who's been through a serious accident or trauma.

713
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:37,225
I suspect she was under serious stress or shock recently.

714
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,495
Since she's bringing back the memory of the accident.

715
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:45,075
Therefore, she absolutely needs to rest.

716
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:49,965
If her condition worsens, she won't be able to do everyday tasks.

717
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,205
Please keep that in mind.

718
00:49:54,115 --> 00:50:00,575
Since she felt relaxed with Madam Jang around, she took the shot, and we can communicate with her, too.

719
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:05,215
Please stay with her for now, Madam Jang.

720
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:08,145
Okay, I will.

721
00:50:08,145 --> 00:50:10,135
I'll do that.

722
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:15,525
I'll take Ma Ri with me.

723
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:17,875
At least temporarily until she feels better.

724
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:21,495
Yes, you need to stay with her. What else can we do?

725
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:23,965
Who says you can take Ma Ri?

726
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:25,695
You can't do that.

727
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,915
Not even temporarily.

728
00:50:27,915 --> 00:50:32,035
Will we let her be, then? Keep her sedated?

729
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:36,425
What if her condition worsens as Dr. Kim said

730
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:40,315
and not be able to do everyday tasks anymore?

731
00:50:40,315 --> 00:50:42,325
What did you say?

732
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:44,885
You don't understand.

733
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:48,245
Ma Ri was in great pain at the hospital then.

734
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:53,915
She was in serious pain until she recovered. You don't know any of that.

735
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:57,505
But he said she might go back to that state.

736
00:50:57,505 --> 00:50:59,015
I can't let that happen.

737
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:02,325
I can't let Ma Ri go through such pain again.

738
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:07,605
Honey... let me take Ma Ri with me. Please?

739
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:10,345
But that can never happen.

740
00:51:10,345 --> 00:51:12,465
You'd move back in.

741
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,075
Stay with Ma Ri until she calms down.

742
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:21,105
Chairman Gong, what are you talking about?

743
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,565
Will you get back with her because of Ma Ri?

744
00:51:26,565 --> 00:51:30,725
No, we'll get divorced. Why would I do that?

745
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,215
I can never let you have Ma Ri.

746
00:51:35,215 --> 00:51:36,885
Not even for a day.

747
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:42,255
So, you move back in and bring her back to normal if you have any conscience.

748
00:51:47,055 --> 00:51:52,655
Isn't it your fault that Ma Ri's in that state?

749
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:57,645
What are you so proud of that you hold your head up high?

750
00:51:57,645 --> 00:52:02,535
My goodness. How could you be so shameless?

751
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:21,455
Mom, but still. How could he let her stay here?

752
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:24,545
I know. She's so unbelievably low.

753
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:28,775
Jin Dan, what if they end up getting back together?

754
00:52:28,775 --> 00:52:32,935
Come on. Hyung isn't that easy of a person.

755
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:37,315
I wish they both left somewhere far away.

756
00:52:37,315 --> 00:52:39,725
Gosh, I feel so uneasy.

757
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:46,375
Chairman Gong, my heart aches for Ma Ri, too.

758
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:51,275
But whenever this happens, my heart sinks.

759
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:55,185
What would happen to our company and family?

760
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,435
I'm so worried.

761
00:52:59,225 --> 00:53:04,495
Have you thought about what I said?

762
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:10,525
Auntie, right now, I wish I could

763
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:16,765
leave everything with Jin Dan and go somewhere, too.

764
00:53:16,765 --> 00:53:19,545
But this isn't such a simple matter.

765
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:22,685
Why don't you meet someone new, then?

766
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:27,005
I'm so sick of women.

767
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:29,735
Even someone I liked is like that.

768
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:33,655
A forced relationship wouldn't work.

769
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:41,165
That's why I think adopting Jin Dan is the best option for us.

770
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:46,045
He's about to marry into Ilyoo Foods, too.

771
00:53:46,045 --> 00:53:49,585
He's managing Angel Investment okay, too.

772
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:51,825
Most of all, he's related to us.

773
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:58,085
Isn't he much better than a stranger? Don't you think?

774
00:53:58,085 --> 00:53:59,915
Yes.

775
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:04,165
I'll think about it a bit more.

776
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:11,465
Have you thought about becoming his adopted son?

777
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:13,005
Speak up now if you don't want to.

778
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:14,445
Don't change your mind later.

779
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:17,115
Gosh, what do you mean? No, Auntie.

780
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:22,345
We decided to go with your decision, no matter what.

781
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:24,455
Right, Jin Dan?

782
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,135
Yes.

783
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:28,905
Really?

784
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:34,275
Seeing Ma Ri like that... made me think Jin Dan

785
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:39,885
should become the adopted son and lead this family.

786
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,755
What choice do I have?

787
00:54:41,755 --> 00:54:45,545
I should sacrifice for the family.

788
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:49,965
Yes, the family and company come first for me, too.

789
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:52,235
Yes, of course.

790
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:57,025
You won't be separated from your mother because you'd be adopted.

791
00:54:58,205 --> 00:55:01,725
I need to get back to the office now.

792
00:55:12,195 --> 00:55:14,095
 The phone is powered off. 

793
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:16,675
She won't even answer her phone.

794
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:21,005
Ma Ri must be really sick.

795
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,175
We're home.

796
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,975
- Hey. 
 - We're home.

797
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:27,785
Pil Sung, you're back, too.

798
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:29,645
Yes. We ran into each other in front of the house.

799
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:33,405
Pil Sung, Seon Yeong,

800
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:37,235
I ran into Yeojudaek while I was out grocery shopping.

801
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:39,715
Ma Ri is very sick, apparently.

802
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:44,835
She's much more sick than last time. Things are very serious.

803
00:55:44,835 --> 00:55:48,695
She can't even drink water. She throws up everything.

804
00:55:48,695 --> 00:55:51,825
- Ma Ri? 
 - Why? What's wrong?

805
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:57,695
According to Yeojudaek, she was shocked by something.

806
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,535
She freaks out about the doctor coming and she refuses to take a shot, either.

807
00:56:02,535 --> 00:56:06,775
The whole house is upside down, apparently.

808
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:09,235
What if something serious happens to Ma Ri?

809
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:10,925
Gosh, seriously.

810
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:14,075
 The phone is powered off. 

811
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:18,235
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep... 

812
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:21,875
   

813
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:38,095
 Y-Yes, Pil Sung. 

814
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:42,695
Is Ma Ri very sick?

815
00:56:47,145 --> 00:56:49,305
Yes.

816
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:52,485
She has post-traumatic stress disorder.

817
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:55,495
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

818
00:56:57,025 --> 00:56:58,905
It's all my fault.

819
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:01,845
 She was hurt because of me. 

820
00:57:02,855 --> 00:57:07,175
Could you let me talk to her if she's nearby?

821
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:11,625
She was sedated, and she's sleeping now.

822
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:16,715
She struggles too much without it.

823
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:21,145
Why won't you take her to the hospital, then?

824
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:24,915
It means she's struggling mentally.

825
00:57:24,915 --> 00:57:27,395
It might be serious and urgent.

826
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:30,575
Yes, we know, too.

827
00:57:33,005 --> 00:57:36,775
Because of the car accident, Ma Ri...

828
00:57:36,775 --> 00:57:42,335
went through many difficult surgeries that even adults struggle with.

829
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:48,555
She must've taken so many shots while being hospitalized, too.

830
00:57:49,615 --> 00:57:54,915
 She hates being in a hospital. So the family doctor comes here instead. 

831
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:57,935
I see.

832
00:57:59,545 --> 00:58:02,605
 By the way, Pil Sung, 

833
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:06,985
I feel bad saying stuff like this,

834
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:11,005
but whenever Ma Ri wakes up,

835
00:58:11,005 --> 00:58:15,125
she keeps looking for you. She misses you.

836
00:58:16,675 --> 00:58:19,825
- Me? 
  - Yes. 

837
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:23,805
 I'd like to let her see you if we can go out, 

838
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:28,285
but she's not in the condition to go out right now.

839
00:58:29,675 --> 00:58:34,455
Pil Sung, what do we do with Ma Ri?

840
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:05,945
Yes.

841
00:59:16,305 --> 00:59:18,665
What are you doing here?

842
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:22,035
I heard Ma Ri was sick.

843
00:59:22,035 --> 00:59:24,395
That's why I'm here.

844
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:28,445
How does that concern you in any way?

845
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:33,865
- I'm sorry. 
 - I thought I told you not to see her.

846
00:59:33,865 --> 00:59:36,445
But you dared to come here?

847
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:38,015
Leave immediately.

848
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:40,395
Don't ever come around here.

849
00:59:54,805 --> 00:59:57,195
How's Ma Ri doing?

850
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,985
Is she still the same?

851
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:01,745
She can't even drink water.

852
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:04,865
You should convince her to go to the hospital.

853
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:08,325
Something serious might happen to her.

854
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:25,195
Ma Ri, look. I got you all of your favorites.

855
01:00:25,195 --> 01:00:28,535
Look, all of your favorites are here.

856
01:00:28,535 --> 01:00:32,635
Ma Ri, do you want the custard pudding?

857
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:35,935
How about the strawberry cake?

858
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:44,165
Ma Ri, you need to eat something. This is really bad.

859
01:00:44,165 --> 01:00:48,875
If you keep doing this, you need to go to the hospital.

860
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,895
No, I won't go to the hospital.

861
01:00:50,895 --> 01:00:53,065
I even hate the smell.

862
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:56,515
Get out, Dad. Get out if you'll force me to the hospital.

863
01:00:56,515 --> 01:00:59,665
- I hate you, Dad! 
 - Okay, Ma Ri.

864
01:00:59,665 --> 01:01:02,675
Calm down. We won't go to the hospital, okay?

865
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:04,145
Yes, Ma Ri. I'm sorry.

866
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:06,245
I won't tell you to go to the hospital.

867
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,015
I won't ever say that again.

868
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:13,305
Ma Ri, drink some water, at least.

869
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:15,205
You need to drink water, at least.

870
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,985
Honey, pass the water.

871
01:01:16,985 --> 01:01:18,655
Okay.

872
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:20,355
Here.

873
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:24,365
Drink it.

874
01:01:24,365 --> 01:01:27,485
Let's drink just a bit. Good girl.

875
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:34,435
Drink it and have some cake, too. Okay?

876
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:37,495
- Ma Ri. 
 - Ma Ri.

877
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:39,515
Oh, no. You can't drink water?

878
01:01:39,515 --> 01:01:42,245
What are you trying to do?

879
01:01:43,175 --> 01:01:47,975
Dad, I want to drink it, too.

880
01:01:47,975 --> 01:01:52,065
But I can't swallow it.

881
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:55,865
What?

882
01:01:55,865 --> 01:02:01,125
I want to drink water and feel better, too.

883
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:04,115
But I can't help myself.

884
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:06,255
That's why...

885
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,575
It hurts so much here.

886
01:02:12,715 --> 01:02:14,555
Dad,

887
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:20,085
I miss Oppa so much.

888
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:24,135
Can't you tell him to come over?

889
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:41,635
   

890
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:48,255
Yes, this is Go Pil Sung.

891
01:02:48,255 --> 01:02:51,235
Where are you right now?

892
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:53,315
I'm on my way home.

893
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:55,765
Ma Ri is...

894
01:02:56,975 --> 01:02:58,455
very sick.

895
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:00,995
She wants to see you.

896
01:03:01,515 --> 01:03:04,905
Could you come here?

897
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:06,825
I beg you.

898
01:03:23,985 --> 01:03:26,445
The Chairman went home early.

899
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:31,385
Yes, I know that.

900
01:03:31,385 --> 01:03:34,305
You can leave, Secretary Kim.

901
01:03:41,715 --> 01:03:44,535
 You're the only one we have now. 

902
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:50,605
 When will your brother remarry and have a child? 

903
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:53,525
 It'd be better if he adopted you as his son. 

904
01:04:04,665 --> 01:04:05,915
   

905
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:15,725
Yes, this will be my seat in the future.

906
01:04:15,725 --> 01:04:18,275
Gong Jin Dan's seat.

907
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:38,835
Hey, Director Go.

908
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:41,730
How dare you come in here?

909
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:51,790


910
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:55,855
   

911
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:59,375
♫  Why did I fall in love?  ♫

912
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:04,805
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫

913
01:05:04,805 --> 01:05:10,645
♫  I've already fallen for you  ♫

914
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:16,455
♫  I'm not able to free myself anymore  ♫

915
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:21,405
♫  But we're drifting apart  ♫

916
01:05:27,175 --> 01:05:28,605
 Hyung suddenly wants to see me. 

917
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,855
 I think he'll talk about adopting me. 

918
01:05:30,855 --> 01:05:33,065
 Mom, should I really become his son? 

919
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:36,055
 Thanks to the drama produced by Go Go Entertainment, 

920
01:05:36,055 --> 01:05:39,675
 "House of Roses," APP Group's image is improving, too. 

921
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:41,105
 You think I don't know what you're scheming? 

922
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:46,225
 Are you trying to secure a position using slow Ma Ri? 

923
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,625
 Watch your mouth. 

924
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:51,625
 Ji Yeong fell for another man. 

925
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:54,125
 Please forget her now. 

926
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,505
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Don't date President Gong. 

927
01:05:56,505 --> 01:05:58,255
 He's not a good person for you. 

928
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:01,605
 You'll understand why I said that once you get your memory back. 

929
01:06:01,605 --> 01:06:03,815
 Ji Yeong! 

930
01:06:03,815 --> 01:06:08,500
♫  I shouldn't have given you my heart at all  ♫
