1
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:49,615
What is it? Ask me anything. 
    

2
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:54,420
Director, am I Park Do Ra?

3
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,498
What?

4
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:13,128
Did you also know I was Park Do Ra by chance?

5
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:15,828
Ji...

6
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,188
Ji Yeong.

7
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:25,488
You didn't, right?

8
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:28,168
You didn't know, right?

9
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:31,238
Tell me you didn't know.

10
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:34,978
You didn't know I was Park Do Ra.

11
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:41,678
Do Ra,

12
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,878
what happened?

13
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,688
How did you know?

14
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:55,368
Director, you really knew I was Park Do Ra.

15
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,198
But why...

16
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:01,418
Why did you play ignorant all this time?

17
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:05,688
Why didn't you tell me I was Park Do Ra?

18
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:08,778
- Why? 
 - Do Ra.

19
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,678
Is your memory back?

20
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:15,428
Do you remember everything?

21
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,718
I don't have my memory back.

22
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:22,918
President Baek told me I was Park Do Ra.

23
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:25,938
What would've happened if she didn't recognize me?

24
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:29,298
I almost lived my whole life without knowing my family.

25
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:33,008
How could you fool me just because I had no memory?

26
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:38,098
Do Ra. I mean, Ji Yeong, let me explain everything.

27
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:39,998
I'll tell you everything.

28
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:41,628
I...

29
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:45,738
I thought there was no way you knew.

30
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:49,178
But how could you...

31
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:52,558
How could you...

32
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:56,918
Ji Yeong, I didn't know at first, either. I couldn't even imagine it.

33
00:02:56,918 --> 00:03:00,398
But I kept feeling like you were Do Ra.

34
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:02,028
I thought I was strange.

35
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:05,748
I thought I went crazy missing her too much.

36
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:08,488
But when you got injured and got hospitalized,

37
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,178
I saw the star tattoo on your ankle.

38
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:14,948
That was a matching tattoo I got with Do Ra.

39
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:20,058
When I saw that, I became sure that you were Do Ra.

40
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:22,518
So, I did a maternity test with you and President Baek's DNA—

41
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,738
I was injured a long time ago.

42
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,658
How could you not tell me all this time, then?

43
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:33,128
How could you do this to me?

44
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:36,958
How could you make a fool out of me?

45
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,688
At first, I wanted to... tell you who you were at first.

46
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,558
I wanted your memory to return.

47
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,648
But seeing you passing out at the hotel...

48
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,548
and being in pain after remembering the old memory,

49
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:55,618
I couldn't tell you.

50
00:03:56,188 --> 00:04:00,788
That's why I just wanted you to live as Kim Ji Yeong.

51
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:05,278
You were in so much pain that you chose death.

52
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,468
I didn't want you to get that pain back. So, for you—

53
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:12,378
Don't make such a ridiculous excuse that you did it for me!

54
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:16,768
How dare you decide how my life should be?

55
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,778
Without knowing who I was, I grabbed my mom's hair and fought her.

56
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,188
I swore at my mom...

57
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:28,058
and I walked past my brother without recognizing him.

58
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,108
Is that how it should be?

59
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,378
Would I be happy living like that?

60
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:35,858
Did you think that was normal?

61
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,348
Ji Yeong...

62
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,328
Do you...

63
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:48,388
Do you know how I felt coming here?

64
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,398
I thought there was no way you knew.

65
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:56,488
I never even imagined you might've fooled me.

66
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:59,368
No matter what anyone said, I...

67
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:03,378
trusted you, Director.

68
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:10,758
But... was it all a lie?

69
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:17,498
I didn't know you were such a bad man.

70
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:24,048
I didn't know you'd try to control someone's life.

71
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:32,218
Ji Yeong, I never fooled you...

72
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,328
or lied to you.

73
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:37,798
I was just waiting for your memory to be back.

74
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,868
Let's break up.

75
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,748
I can't be with someone like you.

76
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:47,418
- Ji Yeong. 
 - Don't call my name!

77
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:51,518
You've been fooling me all this time. How could you call my name?

78
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,498
Ji Yeong, hold on.

79
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:05,858
Listen to me just one second.

80
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:10,708
I'm so scared of you right now.

81
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:14,768
I don't even want to see your face right now.

82
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,488
Don't follow me.

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:28,930


84
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,238
You.

85
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:45,108
Hey! You bastard.

86
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:47,198
You should fall into the sewer and die.

87
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:52,178
Hey, why did you hide Do Ra in your house? For what purpose?

88
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,368
I frequented your house when my daughter was right in front of me.

89
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:57,498
How could you not tell me?

90
00:06:57,498 --> 00:07:02,298
How could you just sit and watch when I was fighting Do Ra, you bastard?

91
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,308
You should be punished! How are you a human?

92
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:07,968
How are you a human? You bastard! Tell me!

93
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,068
Tell me!

94
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:18,818
When Do Ra died, I cried so much missing her that my eyes were so sore.

95
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:23,328
Do you know how many times I went to the seaside many times to die and join her?

96
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:27,488
But you've been hiding her in your house.

97
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,038
How could you not tell me? How could you not? You bastard!

98
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,048
What kind of person are you? What kind of person are you?

99
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:36,288
Don't you know why I did that?

100
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,688
Don't you know why Do Ra died?

101
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:42,978
Don't you know why she threw herself into the ocean?

102
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,568
Did you forget all that by chance?

103
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:50,178
She lived through hell because of you when she was alive!

104
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,008
What?

105
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,548
What did you say?

106
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:56,018
That's why I didn't tell you.

107
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,948
That's why I couldn't tell you!

108
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,298
Listen to me carefully.

109
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:16,498
If you tell anyone Do Ra is Ji Yeong, that'd be the end of both of us.

110
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:22,128
And if you try anything to be with Do Ra, I'll kill you.

111
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:26,818
I'll set your house on fire, okay?

112
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:30,278
You bastard. Bastard...

113
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:32,258
Bastard!

114
00:08:44,218 --> 00:08:48,138
Looks like Pil Sung left to meet the tenant lady.

115
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:52,568
What if he tries to bring her back again?

116
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:54,468
No way.

117
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:58,248
She won't come back if she has any senses.

118
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:02,498
Aren't you and Mother going too far?

119
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:06,438
I don't exactly approve of her as Pil Sung's girlfriend,

120
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:10,388
but how could you kick her out like that? Try to think of Pil Sung, too.

121
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:14,298
Don't blame him even if he tries to bring her back.

122
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,448
What are you talking about?

123
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:19,138
It's over once you move out.

124
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,918
Pil Sung, you came.

125
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:28,618
Yes. I'm going upstairs.

126
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:39,468
The tenant has an awful temper.

127
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:44,638
She must've yelled at him... because we kicked her out.

128
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:47,268
That's why he looks so unhappy.

129
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:51,098
How could you kick out a lady from the countryside with nowhere to go?

130
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:54,348
You need to provide an exit when you kick out even a mouse.

131
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:58,338
Maybe she got angry and broke up with him.

132
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,858
Do you think she did?

133
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:03,368
That'd be fantastic, then.

134
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:06,148
You two did go too far.

135
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,268
You can't do that while Pil Sung is gone.

136
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:12,508
He should be celebrating being awarded. Look at him now.

137
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,928
I didn't know the Director was that kind of a person.

138
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:29,038
How could he do this to me out of all people?

139
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,308
He's always been like that.

140
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:38,488
Seriously. Don't cry over someone like him.

141
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:42,318
He ruined your life before, and now he separated you and me.

142
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:46,378
We were fighting each other without even recognizing each other.

143
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:50,498
But he didn't say a word seeing that. He's such a bastard.

144
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:53,478
By the way, I heard his family treated you poorly.

145
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,098
Thinking about that just breaks my heart. Seriously.

146
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:59,678
Don't get involved with him from now on.

147
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,978
Do Ra, forget about that bastard.

148
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:11,218
Just count on me and live a good life.

149
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,938
 Do Ra! Do Ra. 

150
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:18,128
I got us dumplings.

151
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:29,958
Do Ra, do you remember these dumplings?

152
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:32,998
No.

153
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:37,478
I don't remember, but they're tasty.

154
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:40,648
You used to love these dumplings.

155
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,488
Really?

156
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:51,248
Do Ra, I promise I'll be good to you.

157
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,258
Why do this while eating dumplings?

158
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:58,328
Do Ra might get an upset stomach.

159
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:02,308
Do Ra, I was a very immature brother before.

160
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,818
I used to spend all the money you made.

161
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:07,198
I thought money just came naturally.

162
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:12,828
But now that I tried making money after you died, I realized how hard it was.

163
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:17,028
How did you do all that hard work alone, Do Ra?

164
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,198
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,218
What the hell is wrong with you while eating dumplings?

166
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:30,548
Okay. I swear I'll behave myself.

167
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,338
Mom, let's invite Do Jun and have a party tomorrow.

168
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:36,378
What? Aigoo, yes. Let's do that.

169
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:39,488
Do Jun would come if we told him we found Do Ra.

170
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:43,098
He needs to know his sister's alive, too.

171
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:46,988
Seriously. It's a secret to everyone, but our family needs to know.

172
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:50,798
- Yes, indeed. 
 - Who's Do Jun?

173
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:53,028
He's your younger brother.

174
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:56,878
You don't remember Do Jun, either. What do we do?

175
00:12:56,878 --> 00:13:00,088
He liked you and looked up to you a lot.

176
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:03,478
When you were kids, you cared for Do Jun

177
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,978
whenever I was at work.

178
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:08,648
You even paid for his education abroad once you made money.

179
00:13:08,648 --> 00:13:11,558
You used to love him more than anyone.

180
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:15,128
He liked you even more than he liked me.

181
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,508
Really?

182
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:20,208
Why does he not live with you, then?

183
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,388
The thing is...

184
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:27,268
I lost all the money you made and...

185
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,308
he thinks that's why you died.

186
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:34,968
So, he left, saying he'd cut ties with me.

187
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,058
Really?

188
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:45,028
Please do everything according to this.

189
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,268
Why are you here again?

190
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:56,408
Here.

191
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:03,078
Mr. Gong, isn't it embarrassing to stand here with flowers every day?

192
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,278
As long as you accept me, I can endure humiliation like this.

193
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,778
I'll bring flowers every day until you're no longer angry.

194
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:14,478
So, if you worry about my humiliation,

195
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,528
please forgive me soon. Okay?

196
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:17,938
Okay?

197
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,368
Here.

198
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,318
Why am I here again?

199
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,818
I must be really crazy.

200
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,398
Roll down the window.

201
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:15,318
Roll down the window, I said.

202
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:17,908
 You've got to be kidding me. 

203
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,068
 It's that old lady. 

204
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,868
Yes, hello.

205
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:26,168
What now?

206
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,778
Are you here to see our tenant?

207
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,698
- No. 
 - What do you mean, no?

208
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,348
Young man, don't come here again.

209
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:37,328
She moved out. She doesn't live here.

210
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:40,628
So, go home and tell your mom not to come here, either.

211
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,618
She moved? Where?

212
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,568
How would I know that?

213
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,098
Do we need to know that, too?

214
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:50,848
Young man, please come to your senses.

215
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:54,648
What are you doing when you have someone far better?

216
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,588
Geez.

217
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,008
How embarrassing.

218
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,728
Why did she have to talk to me?

219
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:11,978
So embarrassing. Gosh...

220
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:31,418
♫  Have fun dancing  ♫

221
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:34,508
 Mom, I'll make a lot of money, buy you a house, 

222
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:37,208
 and buy tasty food for Oppa and Do Jun. 

223
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,428
 So, don't cry from now on. 

224
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,538
 Thank you, Do Ra. Thank you. 

225
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:43,298
 We made it now. 

226
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,428
 We made it! We made it. 

227
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:50,598
 Take good care of Mom, Oppa, and Do Jun. 

228
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,830
 Please. 

229
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:58,008
 Dad... 

230
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,028
 Dad... 

231
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:04,528
 Dad! No, Dad! 

232
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:09,758
 Don't go, Dad! Dad! No! 

233
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:13,358
Dad! Dad!

234
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,818
What's wrong, Do Ra?

235
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:20,118
Do Ra, did you have a nightmare?

236
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,758
A-Ahjumma,

237
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,318
you really must be my mom.

238
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,528
Yes, Do Ra.

239
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:36,318
I'm your mom. I said I was your mom.

240
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:45,118
- Mom... 
 - Yes, Do Ra.

241
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:48,898
Yes, yes. Do Ra.

242
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:56,408
Do Ra, is your memory back? Do you recognize us?

243
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:59,238
No.

244
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:03,668
I can't tell if it was a dream or a memory,

245
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:10,098
but I said I'd pass the audition and buy Mom a house.

246
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,918
And my dad was covered in blood...

247
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:19,658
and asked me to take good care of Mom and the rest of the family as he passed away.

248
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,988
Did he really?

249
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,548
Yes.

250
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:31,288
He got into a car accident and died in the ER.

251
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:35,928
Yes, your dad loved you and cherished you so much.

252
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,798
Gosh, Do Ra. Aigoo...

253
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,948
Aigoo, Do Ra. Yes.

254
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:47,848
Aigoo, my baby. Aigoo, Do Ra.

255
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,068
Yes.

256
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,848
Next weekend?

257
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:11,618
We'll make a reservation somewhere and let you know.

258
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,258
Yes, yes. See you.

259
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,038
Did you just hear from Tae Hee's parents?

260
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,808
- They still want to have an in-laws' gathering? 
 - Yes.

261
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:24,038
Chairman Gong, Chairman Gong, I just got a call regarding Jin Dan's in-laws' gathering.

262
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,718
Where do you think we should do it?

263
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:30,708
Tae Hee was so disappointed in Jin Dan that day.

264
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,328
Does she still want to have an in-laws' gathering?

265
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:37,278
I don't think Tae Hee told her parents that

266
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:40,538
Jin Dan had a fight over a woman that day.

267
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:44,558
My goodness. Tae Hee is very thoughtful.

268
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,218
Jin Dan said he visited her... every day with flowers to apologize.

269
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:55,608
Looks like Tae Hee was moved and forgave him.

270
00:19:55,608 --> 00:20:00,988
Are you sure he's no longer seeing the woman who lives in Pil Sung's house?

271
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:02,368
Of course.

272
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:08,648
I guess he's been helping her out of pity and softened up toward her for a moment.

273
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,798
But he said nothing happened, and there was nothing going on with her.

274
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,958
He promised that it wouldn't happen again.

275
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,218
Anyway, this is great.

276
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:20,728
Someone generous like her needs to be our daughter-in-law.

277
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:23,828
Yes. This is why I like Tae Hee.

278
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:28,058
I suppose Tae Hee likes Jin Dan a lot.

279
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,898
How's Flower Hotel?

280
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,948
Their Chinese restaurant is pretty good.

281
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,198
Their food is nice, too.

282
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,088
Yes, that sounds good.

283
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:39,668
I'll call the secretary's office and make a reservation.

284
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:41,918
I'll leave for work, then.

285
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,088
- Have a nice day. 
 - See you, Honey.

286
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:46,698
See you, Chairman.

287
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,600
   

288
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,738
Where is that jerk Go Pil Sung hiding Kim Ji Yeong?

289
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,778
Should I investigate again?

290
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,798
No, Jin Dan.

291
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,028
You shouldn't worry about those people.

292
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,108
   

293
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,868
Yes, Mom.

294
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,908
What? Tae Hee's parents did?

295
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:23,138
I made a reservation at Flower Hotel's Chinese restaurant for next Saturday.

296
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,838
Keep that in mind.

297
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:28,398
Okay. But Tae Hee didn't say anything to me.

298
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:31,158
 That's how thoughtful she is. 

299
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:34,888
I was really moved by her this time.

300
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:39,168
She didn't tell her parents about what happened, and she wants to marry you.

301
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:41,178
 Isn't she such a catch? 

302
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,358
Yes, she is.

303
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:51,238
- I did it! 
 - Good job!

304
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,278
Hang tight.

305
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,018
Yes, Hyung. It's me.

306
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:10,918
What are you talking about?

307
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:14,418
You found who?

308
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:19,278
What are you talking about right now?

309
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:28,408
Okay, I'll be right there.

310
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,033
Do Jun, what's wrong?

311
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,603
Is something wrong? Are you sick?

312
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:43,218
Ma Ri, something urgent came up.

313
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:46,168
I'm sorry. I think I need to go home.

314
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,658
Okay, go ahead.

315
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,128
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

316
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:51,778
Okay.

317
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:58,138
   

318
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:12,317
But... if she's Noona, why did her face change so much?

319
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:19,597
When she fell into the ocean, some old lady in the countryside saved her.

320
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:22,457
And she went through a whole body reconstruction.

321
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:24,647
That's why her face changed.

322
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:27,307
Her face changed, but she's alive.

323
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:29,217
Isn't that such a relief?

324
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:33,527
Yes, if it wasn't for that old lady, we never would've seen her again.

325
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:37,467
I'm so thankful for that lady.

326
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,627
She saved Noona.

327
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,247
But...

328
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:46,207
is she really Noona?

329
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,207
Yes, it's really her.

330
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:51,677
She really is your sister.

331
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:54,977
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

332
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:57,867
I don't know if it's a dream or a memory,

333
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:01,517
but I remember giving a child a piggyback ride.

334
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:06,807
You used to give me a piggyback ride all the time.

335
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:15,017
To be honest, when I first saw you at the broadcasting station, I got a weird feeling.

336
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:17,127
I had a dream about Noona that day, too.

337
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:19,857
Really? Did you, really?

338
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:27,947
I'm sorry... that I don't remember.

339
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:33,617
I'm your sister, but I don't even recognize you.

340
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:37,617
I still find Ahjumma and Oppa unfamiliar, too.

341
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:40,167
I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

342
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:43,857
But they call me "Do Ra." I'm not used to that, either.

343
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,947
It feels strange.

344
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:50,007
I still have no idea what's going on.

345
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:54,077
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

346
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,827
It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry.

347
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:58,597
Don't be sorry.

348
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,197
It's okay you don't remember.

349
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:03,367
Everything must be still unfamiliar, including names.

350
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,647
You don't have to call me "Mom."

351
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:11,217
I'm just thankful that you came back alive.

352
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:16,607
You don't have to call me "Oppa," either. You don't have to remember.

353
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:19,727
And if "Do Ra" is uncomfortable, I'll call you "Ji Yeong."

354
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,937
So, just be by our side.

355
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:28,607
Yes, I'll call you "Ji Yeong," too.

356
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:32,687
Let's give us time and take things slow, Do Ra...

357
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:35,787
I mean, Ji Yeong. Ji Yeong.

358
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,327
Noona.

359
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:43,667
Thank you.

360
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:46,257
Thank you.

361
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:50,287
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

362
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,100
   

363
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:03,737
Is that true?

364
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:06,837
Kim Ji Yeong moved out of your house?

365
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:08,467
That's great.

366
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,037
But didn't Pil Sung say anything?

367
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,467
Of course, he did.

368
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,967
He got angry that we kicked her out while he was gone.

369
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:21,227
But maybe they fought over that matter.

370
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:25,217
He won't eat or make eye contact with us.

371
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:28,477
It's so upsetting.

372
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:31,067
I hope they stop seeing each other now.

373
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,717
So what if she moved out?

374
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,787
They'll keep seeing each other at work.

375
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,017
But you're the CEO.

376
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:41,047
How could he still cast her when the CEO is against it?

377
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:43,697
The writer is obsessed with Kim Ji Yeong

378
00:26:43,697 --> 00:26:45,857
She insisted on it.

379
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:50,227
The shooting hasn't started yet. Let's wait and see.

380
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:10,677
It was too sudden last time.

381
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:13,547
And you were still raw and upset then.

382
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:16,387
So, I couldn't say everything I wanted to say.

383
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,307
Go ahead, then.

384
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:29,067
When you... passed out at the hotel,

385
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:32,267
you said you remembered a nightmare that might've happened.

386
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:35,197
And you said you don't want to get the memory back,

387
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,187
and you were afraid to find out the past.

388
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,057
You remember that, right?

389
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:42,957
I do.

390
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:46,597
When you were Do Ra,

391
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:52,697
you must've chosen death because you were in immense pain.

392
00:27:54,597 --> 00:27:57,417
You must've done that for a reason.

393
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:02,667
Seeing you shaking in my arms,

394
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:08,047
it felt like my heart was being torn into pieces.

395
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:10,137
Why are you saying that now?

396
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:11,777
Ji Yeong,

397
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,947
Do Ra told me in the past...

398
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:19,057
that her mom thinks of her as a money-making machine.

399
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,257
You said you were suffering so much because of her...

400
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:25,037
and you wanted to die.

401
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:31,587
That's why I didn't tell you... and President Baek that you were Park Do Ra.

402
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,177
Ji Yeong,

403
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:43,037
even if I went back in time, I would've made the same decision.

404
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:47,087
I still want you to live as Kim Ji Yeong.

405
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:51,787
What'd happen to you if people found out you were Park Do Ra?

406
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:56,557
I don't want you to be in pain, Ji Yeong.

407
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,887
It's okay if you decide not to see me.

408
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:03,467
I don't mind if you...

409
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:06,177
go far away and never see me again.

410
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,187
Ji Yeong,

411
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:15,477
go somewhere no one knows you... and live as Kim Ji Yeong.

412
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,027
Stay away from President Baek.

413
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:20,867
I beg you.

414
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:27,707
President Baek is my mom who gave birth to me.

415
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:34,737
But how could you still criticize her in front of me?

416
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:39,217
Not only that, you want me to leave her behind?

417
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:43,987
Then, let me ask you something, too.

418
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:49,737
Director, can you abandon your mother?

419
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:59,797
I... can't forgive you.

420
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:03,607
So, don't call me out to tell me stuff like this again.

421
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:06,827
It's over between us.

422
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:16,537
Once you get your memory back,

423
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:22,377
you'll understand... my true intentions.

424
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,877
I don't know what they are,

425
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:32,277
but I can't understand you, who tried to separate a family.

426
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:34,857
I don't think I could forgive you, either.

427
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:26,777
Eating together like this makes us look like a real family, right?

428
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,617
I know.

429
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,757
What is it?

430
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:38,207
Is the food not to your liking?

431
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:42,287
Here, try some of this.

432
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:45,757
You used to like hard boiled tofu.

433
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,767
It's tasty.

434
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:04,877
What's wrong, Ji Yeong? D-Did something happen?

435
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:09,417
Ji Yeong, tell me what's going on. I'll take care of it.

436
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:13,867
I...

437
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:19,467
broke up with Director Go.

438
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,857
Really? Good, good.

439
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,677
I'm so glad you did. He's no good.

440
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:29,157
I must've been enemies with his family in my previous life.

441
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:35,827
If so, did you leave the project, too?

442
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,697
It won't be good to work together after breaking up.

443
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:42,077
What do you mean? Why would she quit?

444
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:45,927
She had to break up with him but still needs to work.

445
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,377
Come on.

446
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:50,387
Ji Yeong, work is separate.

447
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,017
Getting work like that is nearly impossible.

448
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:57,077
You're a newbie without experience. Who'd cast you?

449
00:32:57,077 --> 00:33:01,767
So keep working, but get over the personal feelings, okay?

450
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:04,057
Mom, what are you talking about?

451
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:06,127
Ji Yeong can't act.

452
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,917
What if people found out she was Do Ra?

453
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:12,277
They'd criticize her for getting back into acting after coming back alive.

454
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:14,187
What are you talking about?

455
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:15,617
What?

456
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:23,157
It's probably because I don't remember the bad things I experienced as Park Do Ra,

457
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,377
but I've been living as Kim Ji Yeong.

458
00:33:26,377 --> 00:33:28,907
I only have memories as Kim Ji Yeong.

459
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:33,677
To be honest, I'm confused to suddenly learn that I'm Park Do Ra.

460
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,407
I still can't believe it.

461
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:42,287
But I can't just do nothing and go recluse.

462
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:46,637
I want to live doing what I want to do.

463
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:50,127
Yes, you really are Park Do Ra.

464
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:55,497
And I want to work and help you guys.

465
00:33:55,497 --> 00:34:00,467
I mean, look at this. You can't all live as a family.

466
00:34:01,117 --> 00:34:05,047
I'll work hard, make a lot of money,

467
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:10,407
and let you move to a big and nice place, get Do Jun back,

468
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:13,967
and return the favor to my grandma, too.

469
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:17,807
To do that, I need to become a successful actor.

470
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,127
Just hearing that makes me tear up.

471
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:25,107
Yes, you really are my baby. My baby.

472
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:30,257
But still, I don't think you should go back into acting.

473
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:32,997
Why don't you reconsider it, Ji Yeong?

474
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:35,307
Ouch, Mom.

475
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,387
I have no memory now,

476
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,837
so I can't deny the accusation of prostitution and explain myself.

477
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:44,597
so I can't deny the accusation of prostitution and explain myself.

478
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:49,997
But once I get my memory back... and I'm able to explain myself,

479
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:54,927
I'll be able to tell people who I am, then.

480
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,907
Yes, yes, Do Ra.

481
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,377
I'll work hard.

482
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:09,897
In my dream, my father asked me... to take good care of Mom, Do Sik, and Do Jun.

483
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:13,867
I promised my father.

484
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:16,087
I told him not to worry.

485
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:18,577
- Do Ra. 
 - Do Ra.

486
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,617
Director Go!

487
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:38,097
Ji Yeong told me that you two broke up.

488
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:39,477
Yes, that's the right thing to do.

489
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:42,377
Things are finally back to normal.

490
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:45,337
But you won't resent her for it and...

491
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:49,347
say you'd fire her from the project, right?

492
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:55,427
Ms. Kim auditioned for the role and got cast properly.

493
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:58,857
Why would I fire her when she did nothing wrong?

494
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,757
That won't happen. You don't have to worry.

495
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,277
Right, Director Go?

496
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:06,017
Okay, I'll believe that and leave.

497
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:08,767
- Thank you. 
 - Hold on.

498
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:14,467
- What? 
 - Since you're here, I'll tell you something, too.

499
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,577
What is it?

500
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,667
Before Do Ra died,

501
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:23,287
she told me... that she suffered a lot because of you.

502
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:25,917
That she often wanted to die because of you.

503
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:30,927
That she lived as a money-making machine doing work she didn't want to do.

504
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:33,477
She was in a lot of pain.

505
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:37,397
That's why I wanted her to live as Ji Yeong.

506
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:42,037
I didn't want her to remember such pain.

507
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:45,247
What are you saying?

508
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,397
So, don't ever do that to her again...

509
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:51,127
after she miraculously came back.

510
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:56,957
Don't ever abuse her again by turning her... into a money-making machine.

511
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:59,647
What? Abuse?

512
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,247
You think you could just say whatever?

513
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:06,677
You've lost her once already.

514
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:09,267
Please let her be happy now.

515
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:12,337
Don't let her shed a single tear.

516
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:15,657
Care for her as a mother should.

517
00:37:15,657 --> 00:37:19,117
Do you think I'm like a mean stepmother?

518
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:20,807
I'm her biological mother.

519
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:25,507
No one cares about her more than I do in this world.

520
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:30,247
I let her go because she wanted to go.

521
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:33,127
Otherwise, I never would've let her go.

522
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:38,877
But I'll keep my eyes peeled... to see how you treat Do Ra.

523
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,887
Are you serious? What do you mean you'd watch?

524
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,347
Does he think he's Do Ra's mom?

525
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:50,497
Is he for real? What's he saying, exactly?

526
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:52,307
He's kind of scary, though.

527
00:37:52,307 --> 00:37:54,047
Is he for real?

528
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:57,547
I can't believe it. I can't even talk.

529
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:16,947
 Yes, Do Ra managed to come back alive. 

530
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:20,397
 I won't make the same mistake again. Never. 

531
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:23,967
 I'll turn her into a top actor again 

532
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:29,027
 and I'll finally... lead my life properly. 

533
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:47,008
Pardon? Are you serious?

534
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:49,949
The DNA test said Ji Yeong was Do Ra?

535
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:52,019
People might hear you!

536
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:54,721
No wonder!

537
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:59,592
I got strange feelings from her often. It was because she was Do Ra.

538
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,787
I went bankrupt after Do Ra died,

539
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:04,998
but I trusted you like a son. You know, right?

540
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:06,542
Of course.

541
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:11,522
So, Jae Dong, let's be co-CEOs.

542
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:14,712
I'm still Park Do Ra's—

543
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:18,162
Ji Yeong's mom. I can't just sit still doing nothing.

544
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,202
Yeah, right, right.

545
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:23,122
Yes, you really are my family.

546
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:28,025
If so, how about we split the profit 50-50, then?

547
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:31,075
Yes, s-sure. Sounds good.

548
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:36,675
Jae Dong, like in the old days... I mean,

549
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:40,315
I'll work even harder than I did before.

550
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:45,955
Let's make Ji Yeong a star together again.

551
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:50,165
Instead, you have to keep it a secret. You know, right?

552
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:54,195
Yes, I know. If people find out, Do Ra...

553
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:57,395
I swear I'll take this to the grave, President Baek.

554
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,645
Really? Yes, Jae Dong.

555
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:04,225
Thank you.

556
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:12,195
Good day.

557
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:20,175
Seriously.

558
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:23,495
Do I have to keep seeing that jerk like this now?

559
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:27,575
Geez, why did Soo Yeon have to have her office here?

560
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:30,495
What a way to start the morning.

561
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,065
What?

562
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:39,875
Isn't that Kim Ji Yeong?

563
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,560
   

564
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:58,045
What?

565
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:00,705
Why is Kim Ji Yeong going to Go Go Entertainment?

566
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:04,815
Did Go Pil Sung hire his girlfriend?

567
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,965
Are you serious right now?

568
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,045
   

569
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:11,605
   

570
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:14,350
   

571
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,185
Go Pil Sung.

572
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:20,965
Did he seriously cast his girlfriend?

573
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:25,705
What's he trying to do?

574
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,635
I can't believe this.

575
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:32,035
I'm Cha Bong Soo, who's playing Cha Gil Soo in "House of Roses."

576
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:40,255
I'm Kim Na Bi, who's playing Kim Soo Yeong in "House of Roses."

577
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:53,715
I'm Kim Ji Yeong, who's playing Lee Yeon Doo in "House of Roses."

578
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:56,035
I'm in your care.

579
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,085
I'm Park Jin Soo, who's playing Kang Jin Sang.

580
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:08,065
We have a great cast for the drama.

581
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:09,835
It's satisfying just seeing you.

582
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:13,920
I feel like it'd be a huge success.

583
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,688
I just need to do well now. I'm in your care.

584
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:21,530
The script is great.

585
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,795
And I get to work with great actors. I'm excited, too.

586
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:29,825
I'll do my best to bring a good result.

587
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,615
I was about to visit your office.

588
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:46,633
- But we run into each other here. 
 - How can I help you?

589
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:49,238
You know Angel Investment invested in Go Go Entertainment, right?

590
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:52,024
- I'm one of the stockholders. 
 - So?

591
00:42:52,024 --> 00:42:55,596
Ms. Kim Ji Yeong... needs to be removed.

592
00:42:57,205 --> 00:43:00,795
- What did you say? 
 - You've been pretending to be sensible.

593
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:03,705
But you cast your girlfriend?

594
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:06,315
You think this place is for love affairs?

595
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:09,355
You think I invested for you to have a relationship?

596
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:15,155
I heard you received an international award, too.

597
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:18,825
An award like that comes with social responsibility.

598
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:23,915
What if people found out you cast your girlfriend?

599
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:26,275
It'd become a huge issue.

600
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:30,595
So, you'd better fire Kim Ji Yeong immediately.

601
00:43:30,595 --> 00:43:34,855
Ms. Kim auditioned and was cast properly.

602
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:38,255
And I know you're an investor,

603
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:41,315
but casting is up to me, the director.

604
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:42,955
Well, then.

605
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:49,265
Wow.

606
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,545
That asshole...

607
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,935
Is he out of his mind?

608
00:43:53,935 --> 00:43:58,450
He's got nothing. Why does he think he can do that?

609
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,440
   

610
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:04,615
Soo Yeon.

611
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:08,075
Jin Dan, why are you barging in without knocking?

612
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:11,225
Go Pil Sung and Kim Ji Yeong are in a relationship.

613
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:12,885
You know.

614
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:16,445
And this is Go Go Entertainment's first project.

615
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,675
Is it okay to cast so carelessly?

616
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:24,105
Kim Ji Yeong is a newbie who has only done one mini-series.

617
00:44:24,105 --> 00:44:27,335
This is a 30-billion won project. You think the director

618
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:31,945
can just cast someone based on his personal feelings?

619
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:34,385
There's no need to go on.

620
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:38,615
Replace Ms. Kim with someone who's well-known.

621
00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:41,335
Wouldn't it make the drama more fun to watch?

622
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:43,055
Jin Dan,

623
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:49,885
I know you invested in my company, but this is beyond your power.

624
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:52,595
We can manage casting ourselves.

625
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:56,135
I think I have the right to speak up as an investor.

626
00:44:56,135 --> 00:45:00,175
If you don't replace Kim Ji Yeong, I'll withdraw the investment.

627
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:04,065
And this will definitely become an issue.

628
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:10,015
Since I made myself clear, I believe you'll take care of things, Presdient.

629
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,015
I'll leave now, then.

630
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:26,515
- President Jang. 
 - Yes, Director Go.

631
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,385
This isn't working.

632
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:31,085
We need to replace Kim Ji Yeong.

633
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:36,335
We already discussed this, President Jang.

634
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:40,075
We're already facing what I feared.

635
00:45:40,075 --> 00:45:45,725
An investor found out about you and Kim Ji Yeong and wants his money back.

636
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:51,685
We cast fairly regardless of personal feelings, but people won't think that.

637
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:55,625
It is true that you two are dating.

638
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:59,725
They'll say you already cast Kim Ji Yeong, and the audition was just for a show.

639
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:03,035
If this becomes an issue at all,

640
00:46:03,035 --> 00:46:06,075
the company's image would get seriously damaged, too.

641
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:10,475
- So, replace Kim Ji Yeong— 
 - Kim Ji Yeong and I broke up.

642
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:15,025
W-What did you say? Is that true?

643
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:18,545
Yes, so you don't have to worry about that.

644
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:21,825
We won't get criticized for it.

645
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:27,925
My gosh.

646
00:46:27,925 --> 00:46:30,455
They broke up?

647
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:35,035
Is that true, Soo Yeon?

648
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:39,585
Pil Sung and Ms. Kim really broke up?

649
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:44,105
Oh, okay, then.

650
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:48,985
Pil Sung and the tenant broke up?

651
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:50,815
Yes.

652
00:46:50,815 --> 00:46:54,785
I suppose Pil Sung's casting her became an issue at work.

653
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:57,655
Since it might be an issue if they were together.

654
00:46:57,655 --> 00:47:02,625
But he said it won't be a problem since they broke up.

655
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:08,195
Maybe they're pretending they broke up because of the casting.

656
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:13,895
Come on, Mother. You know Pil Sung doesn't cheat like that.

657
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,105
I suppose.

658
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:18,045
Anyway, this is great. This is great.

659
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:21,125
I feel like I lost an achy tooth.

660
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:25,265
By the way, you should thank me for this.

661
00:47:25,265 --> 00:47:32,855
Gosh. Since we're on the topic, I feel kind of bad about that.

662
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:35,955
I think we might've gone too far.

663
00:47:35,955 --> 00:47:37,675
Gosh, come on.

664
00:47:37,675 --> 00:47:41,785
You think she would've given up on Pil Sung if we didn't do that?

665
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:45,915
And it would've been a serious issue if she didn't give up.

666
00:47:45,915 --> 00:47:48,715
You know, President Gong, your friend's son?

667
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:50,735
He was here again.

668
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,705
- Really? 
 - I'm telling you.

669
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:59,655
So, I told him to never come back because she moved out.

670
00:47:59,655 --> 00:48:01,085
Gosh.

671
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:06,255
Pil Sung and the tenant might've broken up because of President Gong.

672
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:09,505
Gosh, that can't be.

673
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,335
You might be surprised later.

674
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:15,345
Wait and see if I was wrong.

675
00:48:23,765 --> 00:48:26,635
- I'm home. 
 - Soo Yeon.

676
00:48:26,635 --> 00:48:28,965
What happened to Ms. Kim's matter?

677
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:31,785
Did you talk to Director Go and the writer?

678
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:37,855
Were you waiting for me to ask me that?

679
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:42,515
Soo Yeon, did you notice...

680
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:47,655
you're way too generous with Director Go?

681
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:49,385
W-What did you say?

682
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:54,255
Because he's your friend's son, you give him endless amounts of money,

683
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:57,615
and Director Go cast a woman with no experience

684
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:01,675
for a major project just because she's his girlfriend.

685
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:05,395
Because you get your personal feelings involved,

686
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:08,245
Director Go is doing whatever he wants, too.

687
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,145
Director Go and Ms. Kim apparently broke up.

688
00:49:11,145 --> 00:49:13,595
There's nothing going on between them anymore.

689
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:17,065
So, what you just said doesn't make sense.

690
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:21,005
I-Is that true?

691
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:37,365
Aigoo, aigoo!

692
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:42,165
What's the important thing you need to tell me?

693
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:46,925
You left something when you moved out in a rush.

694
00:50:46,925 --> 00:50:48,335
Pardon?

695
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:51,175
What is it?

696
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,535
It's your cutting board.

697
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:57,115
Pardon?

698
00:50:57,115 --> 00:51:02,385
Is this what you needed to talk about urgently?

699
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:11,315
I thought I made a mistake during the table read or misinterpreted the character.

700
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:13,035
I got all nervous.

701
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:15,455
But you came all the way here to give me the silly cutting board?

702
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:20,385
Silly cutting board? I didn't know you treated objects so poorly.

703
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:23,905
This cutting board helped your cooking a lot.

704
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:27,165
It'd be so disappointed to be called "silly."

705
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:30,555
And it's a sturdy and strong cutting board.

706
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:33,525
I thought it might've been made by an artisan.

707
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:38,435
And I worried... this might've been precious to you.

708
00:51:38,435 --> 00:51:42,825
I worried you might be thinking about it all night, leaving it behind.

709
00:51:42,825 --> 00:51:45,075
I contemplated if I should bring it or not.

710
00:51:45,075 --> 00:51:49,505
Director, I bought it for 3,000 won at Chamiso.

711
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:52,735
If you like it so much, you can keep it.

712
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,445
Hold on.

713
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:58,965
Ji Yeong,

714
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:03,925
even if someone said something to you regarding the casting, don't pay attention to it.

715
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,755
don't pay attention to it.

716
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:10,265
Because you were cast fair and square through the audition.

717
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:12,205
Don't get discouraged.

718
00:52:12,205 --> 00:52:14,315
Be confident.

719
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:17,395
Director.

720
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:21,405
The cutting board was just an excuse.

721
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,695
I just wanted to tell you that.

722
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,505
Thank you, Director.

723
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:38,915
I'll work hard so I don't cause you inconvenience.

724
00:52:40,195 --> 00:52:42,245
Get home safely, then.

725
00:52:43,265 --> 00:52:45,765
Ji Yeong, let me tell you one more thing.

726
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:52,265
I'll always be waiting for you.

727
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:56,585
Don't forget that I'm by your side.

728
00:53:01,275 --> 00:53:04,835
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

729
00:53:15,815 --> 00:53:18,172
   

730
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:21,818
I didn't ask you to come for any other reasons.

731
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:24,838
We'll start shooting the drama next week.

732
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:30,908
But since you have no experience, the CEO and other people are very worried.

733
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:34,728
So, I wanted to do a table read separately. That's why I asked you to come.

734
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,148
Yes, Writer.

735
00:53:36,148 --> 00:53:39,328
Let's start with Scene No. 7 in Episode 1 first, then.

736
00:53:40,038 --> 00:53:41,638
Hello!

737
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:42,878
Hello, hello.

738
00:53:42,878 --> 00:53:44,328
Aigoo, aigoo...

739
00:53:44,328 --> 00:53:47,238
Aigoo, Director, excuse me.

740
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:51,428
Ms. Writer, I'm the CEO of Bbaek Entertainment, Kim Ji Yeong is with.

741
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,818
I'm Baek Mi Ja.

742
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:56,688
Ms. Writer, I've been your fan.

743
00:53:56,688 --> 00:53:59,192
Your script is so entertaining this time, too.

744
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:02,877
Please take good care of our Kim Ji Yeong. All right, then.

745
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:04,957
- By chance... 
 - Yes?

746
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:10,668
were you the CEO of the agency for Park Do Ra?

747
00:54:13,778 --> 00:54:17,298
You're actress Park Do Ra's mother. Right?

748
00:54:18,328 --> 00:54:21,018
- How do you know me... 
 - My gosh...

749
00:54:21,018 --> 00:54:25,868
I was so heartbroken after what happened to Park Do Ra.

750
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:28,408
President Baek, be brave.

751
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:30,518
I hope you succeed.

752
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:31,928
Thank you!

753
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:34,418
Thank you, Ms. Writer...

754
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:36,348
Although my Do Ra is no longer in this world,

755
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:40,928
I'll make sure to make actress Kim Ji Yeong into the second Park Do Ra.

756
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:44,458
I leave Kim Ji Yeong in your care. All right, then...

757
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:46,288
Ms. Kim, call me when you're done.

758
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:48,018
Thank you. Excuse me.

759
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,142
Excuse me, Director.

760
00:54:49,142 --> 00:54:52,012
Work hard now...

761
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,038
Okay, let's begin now.

762
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,638
My heart races whenever Do Ra comes up.

763
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:11,728
I have to live like this for the rest of my life. What do I do...

764
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:17,198
Oh, right. This is the APP building.

765
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:19,148
That's why President Gong Jin Dan is here.

766
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:22,508
Gosh, I totally forgot!

767
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:29,858
No one should find out about Do Ra being alive.

768
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:32,438
But especially that Gong Jin Dan.

769
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:35,808
Hey, Baek Mi Ja, be careful. Be very careful.

770
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:42,128
Ji Yeong did such a great job during the audition last time.

771
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:43,758
But what's with her now?

772
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,938
Gosh, I just don't know.

773
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:48,218
What do we do if she keeps doing this?

774
00:55:48,988 --> 00:55:51,018
We picked her because she did well during the audition.

775
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,918
I'll be sure to direct her well so she captures the vibe.

776
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:55,858
Please don't worry, Ms. Writer.

777
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:57,688
All right.

778
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,358
Then, I'll leave it in your hands.

779
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:01,928
Yes.

780
00:56:22,398 --> 00:56:24,538
Director, I'm sorry.

781
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:26,948
I did such a terrible job today, right?

782
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:31,368
I was so nervous, so I made so many mistakes.

783
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:34,268
You're a new actress, Ji Yeong. Of course, you're nervous.

784
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:35,898
It's okay.

785
00:56:35,898 --> 00:56:38,518
But the shooting is coming up soon.

786
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:42,568
I'm so scared that I'll be terrible at it.

787
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:49,188
Ji Yeong, I cast you, knowing full well that you could pull it off.

788
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:51,588
So, don't worry.

789
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:54,138
Do you really think so?

790
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:55,698
Of course.

791
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:57,598
You can do this, Ji Yeong.

792
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:59,968
I always have faith in you, Ji Yeong.

793
00:57:01,108 --> 00:57:04,338
Talk to me if you have any problems.

794
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:10,548
And I'm always by your side and I'll be waiting for you.

795
00:57:10,548 --> 00:57:12,508
Don't forget that.

796
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:22,598
Director...

797
00:57:23,098 --> 00:57:27,918
Please treat me as an actor you're working with.

798
00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:32,668
If you're so sweet to like this, how could I work with you?

799
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:37,708
I wish you'd only say what's necessary for work.

800
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:45,058
Director, thank you for today.

801
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:48,298
I'll get going now.

802
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:54,718
Bye now, Director.

803
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:07,788
   

804
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:15,898
Director Go, over here.

805
00:58:17,258 --> 00:58:18,998
Have a seat.

806
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:26,428
- This is Director Go Pil Sung. 
 - I know.

807
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:29,428
You're the director who received the Juniper Award, right?

808
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:32,868
It's an honor for me to meet you like this.

809
00:58:32,868 --> 00:58:35,048
Yes. Hello.

810
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:40,348
This is the daughter of Director Choi of Choi Hospital. She's Dr. Choi Mi Na.

811
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:44,298
I really enjoyed "Don't Lie to Me."

812
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:47,538
Thank you for enjoying it.

813
00:58:49,528 --> 00:58:51,398
Oh, no.

814
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:56,018
I wanted to have dinner with you, but I have some things to sign off in a rush. So, I have to go.

815
00:58:56,018 --> 00:58:59,398
Enjoy your lunch together. I've placed the order already.

816
00:58:59,398 --> 00:59:02,938
And you two are the same age, so you can relax.

817
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:04,898
You can just be friends.

818
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:06,758
Bye, Mi Na.

819
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:23,508
I wonder how things are going with those two.

820
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:29,788
Director Go, already back?

821
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:36,288
President, did you set up the lunch on purpose?

822
00:59:36,288 --> 00:59:40,978
I really like Mi Na. I've known her since young, so I know her well.

823
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:44,268
I thought she'd suit you well.

824
00:59:44,268 --> 00:59:47,638
President Jang, I feel uncomfortable about these arrangements.

825
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:49,828
Please don't do this.

826
00:59:50,448 --> 00:59:53,958
Oh, I... I just thought Pil Sung... no...

827
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,038
I've known you since you were young...

828
00:59:57,038 --> 01:00:02,068
I feel like you're my son. So, I just wanted to find you a good woman.

829
01:00:03,268 --> 01:00:06,728
I'm grateful that you think of me like your son.

830
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,978
But I hope this doesn't happen again.

831
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:12,678
I'm not interested in seeing anyone at the moment.

832
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:22,808
I wonder if he's not over Kim Ji Yeong yet...

833
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:28,018
I was too rash.

834
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:31,898
They're good.

835
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:36,188
Hey, Pil Sung, you're home.

836
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:38,238
Did you eat dinner?

837
01:00:38,238 --> 01:00:40,418
Did you ask President Jang, Mom?

838
01:00:40,418 --> 01:00:42,898
To set me up with a woman?

839
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:46,208
How could you do that without even asking me?

840
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,218
What are you talking about?

841
01:00:48,218 --> 01:00:50,268
What woman?

842
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:52,748
I didn't know.

843
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:55,378
Then, the CEO did that on her own?

844
01:00:55,378 --> 01:00:57,328
Without even asking you?

845
01:00:57,328 --> 01:01:00,308
What? Did you ask her to look for a woman for Pil Sung?

846
01:01:00,308 --> 01:01:03,998
Gosh, no. I had no idea.

847
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:07,228
Soo Yeon really set you up on a blind date?

848
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,268
Mom, please, I beg you.

849
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:11,870
Please don't arrange those meetings!

850
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:15,148
Wait... hey...

851
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:22,098
Seon Yeong, what is all this about?

852
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:23,528
Are you sure you didn't ask her?

853
01:01:23,528 --> 01:01:26,778
No, I didn't, Mother!

854
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:29,258
You know the Choi Hospital, too.

855
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:32,418
It's Director Choi's only daughter, and she's a doctor.

856
01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:35,418
She's kind and has a great personality. So...

857
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:40,108
But Soo Yeong, why didn't you say anything to me?

858
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:45,298
Pil Sung got so angry as soon as he got home, so I was so shocked.

859
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:47,498
Oh, I mean...

860
01:01:47,498 --> 01:01:53,618
You know, I said I'd take care of finding a woman for Pil Sung last time.

861
01:01:53,618 --> 01:01:58,218
I mean... but still, you should've told me in advance.

862
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,938
How could I not know about my son's blind date as his mother?

863
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:03,908
And to hear it from my son later on. Does that make sense?

864
01:02:03,908 --> 01:02:11,018
I mean... I just... knew Pil Sung ever since he was a baby and thought of him as a son.

865
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:16,828
Soo Yeon, I know how you feel, but...

866
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:20,228
Pil Sung is my son, not yours, right?

867
01:02:20,228 --> 01:02:23,338
Yeah. Yes, right, Seon Yeong.

868
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:28,858
Sorry. I'll be sure to ask you first. Okay?

869
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:30,508
Okay.

870
01:02:30,508 --> 01:02:33,978
Anyway, thanks for thinking of him.

871
01:02:35,508 --> 01:02:39,408
What did she say? Did she really set him up on a date?

872
01:02:39,408 --> 01:02:40,788
Yes.

873
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:46,818
So, she didn't tell you before and set him up on a blind date like that?

874
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:53,178
I mean, I'm grateful that she cares for Pil Sung and treats him well.

875
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:57,648
But she set him up without even telling you?

876
01:02:58,678 --> 01:03:01,288
She hired him by paying him a high salary.

877
01:03:01,288 --> 01:03:04,418
Does she think he's her son or something?

878
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,338
Seon Yeong, you'd better watch out.

879
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:08,988
She'll take your son away at this rate.

880
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,988
Gosh, Mother...

881
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,208
What do you mean...

882
01:03:20,638 --> 01:03:22,868
Pil Sung isn't here.

883
01:03:23,478 --> 01:03:24,958
Ma Ri.

884
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,428
What brings you here?

885
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,628
I wanted to put flowers for Pil Sung in his office.

886
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:32,698
- Isn't it pretty? 
 - What? You won't put some for my office?

887
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:34,968
Mom, next time for you.

888
01:03:34,968 --> 01:03:36,848
So, where is Pil Sung?

889
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:39,188
He said he was going to inspect the set.

890
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:43,268
A set? Like a house and stuff you see on dramas?

891
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:44,288
Yeah.

892
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:46,738
Mom, let's go. I'm so curious.

893
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:49,928
I really wanted to see those places.

894
01:03:49,928 --> 01:03:51,728
Shall we?

895
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:24,338
Look at Oppa.

896
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,088
Pil Sung, no!

897
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:36,048
Oppa! Mom!

898
01:04:36,048 --> 01:04:38,578
No! Help! Hurry!

899
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:41,068
Mom! Are you okay, Mom?

900
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:43,468
Please help us!

901
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:45,048
Please help!

902
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,488
- Are you okay? 
 - Mom! Mom!

903
01:04:47,488 --> 01:04:49,108
Mom, oh, no...

904
01:04:49,108 --> 01:04:51,638
- Please help! 
 - Director!

905
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:54,378
- Pil Sung! 
 - Go Pil Sung!

906
01:04:54,378 --> 01:04:56,898
Pil Sung! Pil Sung!

907
01:04:56,898 --> 01:04:59,038
Pil Sung, are you okay?

908
01:04:59,038 --> 01:05:01,098
What happened?

909
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:04,238
Mom, I'm okay, but the CEO...

910
01:05:05,418 --> 01:05:07,828
Oh, my! Soo Yeon!

911
01:05:07,828 --> 01:05:09,118
Soo Yeon!

912
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:11,618
Soo Yeon, open your eyes!

913
01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:14,358
Ma Ri, what happened?

914
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:18,088
A wall fell on her on the set

915
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:21,838
and Mom tried to protect Pil Sung, and this is what happened.

916
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,828
My mom won't wake up, no matter how much I try to wake her.

917
01:05:24,828 --> 01:05:28,268
What? She was trying to protect Pil Sung?

918
01:05:29,188 --> 01:05:30,478
No...

919
01:05:30,478 --> 01:05:32,228
No, not my Pil Sung!

920
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,468
Pil Sung!

921
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:45,778


922
01:05:45,778 --> 01:05:48,770
   

923
01:05:49,568 --> 01:05:51,908
♫  And tell you  ♫

924
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:57,228
♫  I shout out your name  ♫

925
01:05:57,228 --> 01:05:59,568
♫  My love  ♫

926
01:05:59,568 --> 01:06:04,678
♫  My last tears you won't get to see  ♫

927
01:06:04,678 --> 01:06:10,198
♫  I'll hold you tightly and let you go  ♫

928
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:15,528
♫  I call for you again  ♫

929
01:06:15,528 --> 01:06:17,788
♫  My love  ♫

930
01:06:17,788 --> 01:06:20,988
♫  I say, "I love you," but you can't  ♫

931
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:22,438
 Park Do Ra wasn't involved in prostitution. 

932
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:23,998
 What do you mean she wasn't? 

933
01:06:23,998 --> 01:06:26,308
 Everyone still comes up if you search online. 

934
01:06:26,308 --> 01:06:27,558
 50 million won? 

935
01:06:27,558 --> 01:06:30,518
 I'll never settle before you pay me 50 million won. 

936
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:31,778
 Follow the law! 

937
01:06:31,778 --> 01:06:33,938
 If you say you'd do it, 

938
01:06:33,938 --> 01:06:36,118
 there is something that'll pay you 30 million won. 

939
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:38,418
 If there is such a thing, I should do it right away. 

940
01:06:38,418 --> 01:06:39,588
 We have a problem. 

941
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:42,268
 I don't think we can work with Kim Ji Yeong. 

942
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:44,348
 Ji Yeong is about to get fired because of you, President. 

943
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:46,008
 They're about to cancel her contract. 

944
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:49,688
 Did you already forget what Do Ra had to go through because of you? 

945
01:06:49,688 --> 01:06:51,948
 Are you even a mom?
