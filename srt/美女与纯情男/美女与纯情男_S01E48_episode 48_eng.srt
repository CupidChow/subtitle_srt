1
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,680
   

2
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,650
Baby chick.

3
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,680
Chirp, chirp.

4
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:06,180


5
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,810
Park Do Ra.

6
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,310
Do Ra.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,950
You never smiled at me like that.

8
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,800
But why are you smiling so brightly at Go Pil Sung?

9
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm struggling so much I could die right now.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,160
But why won't you hold my hand?

11
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,750
Why?

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,530
I ended up this way because of you.

13
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,350
If only I married Tae Hee,

14
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,230
I wouldn't have hit rock bottom like this.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,410
I lost everything because of you.

16
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,320
Park Do Ra...

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,600
you're holding someone else's hand

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,350
instead of mine and laughing right now?

19
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,180
Huh?

20
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,530
Y-You mean, he's on the run right now?

21
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,110
Yes, the police are after Gong Jin Dan right now.

22
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,720
Imagine how shocked the Chairman must be.

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,130
Someone who's not even a Gong took over the company and even embezzled the company's money.

24
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,600
Also, your friend, President Gong's mom, was kicked out of the house.

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,420
Ma Ri said the whole house was flipped upside down.

26
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,890
- I-If he gets caught, will he go to jail? 
 - Yeah.

27
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,500
Of course. You hear about people going to jail for embezzlement often.

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
My goodness...

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,380
Is Jin Sang Gu running away with Jin Jin Dan, then?

30
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,190
- I can't get a hold of him, either. 
 - Of course, that must be what's going on.

31
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,590
Since they're father and son,

32
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,000
the three of them are on the run together as a family.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,190
I need to receive the rent payment somehow.

34
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,750
What should I do?

35
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,080
I'll get it, no matter what.

36
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,820
 Grandma, Ahjumma, we're here! 

37
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,330
 Mom and Dad are here, too. 

38
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,120
- My gosh. 
 - Hey...

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Honey, stop eating and go out.

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,980
Open the door.

41
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,820
So, Chairman, what brings your whole family here at this hour?

42
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,970
If you had come a little sooner, you could've had soybean noodles with us.

43
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,820
- Have you had lunch yet? 
 - Yes.

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,100
What made you come...

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,780
all the way to our house?

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,810
Dad, hurry up and tell them.

47
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,820
What's the good news?

48
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,750
I can tell from Ma Ri's face.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,130
Pil Sung became my adoptive son today.

50
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,290
The family court made the decision.

51
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,640
What did you say?

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,450
Adoptive son?

53
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,330
I thought it was all canceled.

54
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,020
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,320
Hyeon Cheol, what's with you?

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,700
Chairman, how could you do this?

57
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,420
You asked us to let you adopt him, but you backed out because there was an issue.

58
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,810
You're now doing this without telling us anything?

59
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,110
What are you doing with someone else's child?

60
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,620
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,500
It's true I hesitated because of Ms. Park Do Ra.

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,300
I put it on hold and reconsidered it for the company,

63
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,720
but I never canceled it.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,830
Please don't get me wrong like that.

65
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,880
My faith and feelings for Pil Sung never changed.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,800
I mean it.

67
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,580
Ahjussi, can you forgive my dad just once?

68
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,100
Please let Pil Sung be my brother.

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,680
I could become your daughter, too, then.

70
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,170
I'll be a good daughter to you from now on. And...

71
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,740
I'll call you "Dad."

72
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,310
So, please let Pil Sung be my brother.

73
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,700
- Dad. 
 - What?

74
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,550
- What do you... 
 - My goodness.

75
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,230
Hyeon Cheol, you've always said you wanted a cute daughter.

76
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,220
Your dream came true.

77
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,700
For free, too.

78
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,160
Please forgive my dad just once.

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,810
Please.

80
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,160
Dad!

81
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,570
Aigoo, aigoo. Hyeon Cheol.

82
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,630
Your sweet daughter is begging you.

83
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,530
You should listen to her.

84
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,360
Gosh, seriously...

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,930
Go ahead and answer her.

86
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,910
She's begging you.

87
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,220
Our cute Ma Ri.

88
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,470
We used to do this.

89
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,960
   

90
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,990
Yes, Chairman.

91
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,180
Go to Go Go Entertainment and back to work tomorrow.

92
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,750
Pardon?

93
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,680
What do you mean by that?

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,750
I haven't processed your resignation letter yet.

95
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,090
So, return to your position.

96
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,980
See you tomorrow.

97
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,230
Well, okay. I will, Chairman.

98
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,880
Yes.

99
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,300
What is it, Oppa? What's going on?

100
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,940
The Chairman said he hasn't processed my resignation letter yet.

101
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,330
He says to return to work at Go Go Entertainment tomorrow.

102
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,060
Really?

103
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,420
Congratulations, Oppa.

104
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm so happy for you. Seriously.

105
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,660
- You scared me. 
 - Seriously.

106
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,230
Enough is enough.

107
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,370
You hug and hold hands every chance you get. I can't stand it.

108
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,090
Come on. We didn't do it all the time.

109
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,400
No, Do Ra is right.

110
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,100
- We weren't like that. 
 - Right.

111
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,260
Should I tell you when you did it, then?

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,650
Congratulations, Pil Sung.

113
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,640
I've felt guilty for some reason.

114
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,440
I felt bad whenever I saw you doing the dishes and kneading since you left the company.

115
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,510
- This is great, Hyung. 
 - Thank you.

116
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,610
By the way, what do we do?

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,570
How will you make the kalguksu dough starting tomorrow?

118
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,160
Grandmother said you need to knead it a lot so it tastes chewy.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,180
Who will do that now?

120
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,200
What's he saying?

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,890
Geez.

122
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,160
You're worrying about that now? I can knead it.

123
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,900
I don't know how he won all those awards.

124
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,910
What?

125
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,050
He's really no fun.

126
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,450
Yes, Father.

127
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,600
Pil Sung, Chairman Gong was here just now.

128
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,660
Your adoption went through today, apparently.

129
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,950
Just keep that in mind.

130
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,690
Father.

131
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,500
All of us are okay.

132
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,970
I believe you can do well.

133
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,390
Don't forget we're always cheering for you.

134
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,260
Thank you, Father.

135
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,060
 

136
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,990
Hello, Ms. Lee.

137
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes, hello.

138
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,760
Have fun with your friends today, Grandma.

139
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,250
Okay, don't worry.

140
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,020
- Get going now. 
 - See you later.

141
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,310
Okay. Let's go in.

142
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,710
Let's go.

143
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,250
Do Jun.

144
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,030
Gong Ma Ri.

145
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,980
Since when did you follow me?

146
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,310
Since you left home.

147
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,870
What?

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,920
Why are you doing this?

149
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
I told you.

150
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,510
I miss you every day.

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Ma Ri, I told you many times that you can't do this.

152
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,470
Why can't I?

153
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,720
You really didn't miss me at all?

154
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,070
Did we really use to like each other?

155
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,950
We broke up.

156
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,190
I know we used to like each other, but we can't see each other since we broke up.

157
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,940
We didn't break up.

158
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,680
We were forced to break up.

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,420
But a breakup is still a breakup.

160
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,650
Do Jun,

161
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,130
let's just get back together.

162
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,310
Gong Ma Ri.

163
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,160
Don't you know why we broke up?

164
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,130
I do. It's because of your mom.

165
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,920
But why should we break up because of her?

166
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,020
Ma Ri,

167
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,780
you're making this so difficult.

168
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,960
So, please don't come to see me.

169
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,130
You can't change anything this way.

170
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,370
So, hold back even if you miss me

171
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,080
and just forget about me.

172
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,030
Forget?

173
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,670
How could I forget?

174
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,380
Can you forget about me?

175
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,460
Tell me if you know how.

176
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,180
I...

177
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,200
I don't know how to forget you, Do Jun.

178
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,610
What did you say?

179
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,220
Ma Ri followed Mr. Park today, too?

180
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,760
Yes.

181
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,900
I sent the photos of her to your phone.

182
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,910
Okay, please continue to keep an eye on her.

183
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,670
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,880
Hey...

185
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,900
Gong Ma Ri.

186
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,500
I heard you keep peeping at Do Jun and following him.

187
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,120
What's wrong with you?

188
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,100
Do Jun says he doesn't like you.

189
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,620
It's not because he doesn't like me.

190
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,260
It's because of you and Dad.

191
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,730
It's because you said he and his mom were scammers.

192
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,410
Mom, Do Jun isn't like that.

193
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,960
He didn't plot with his mom to do that to me.

194
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,370
I know he's not that kind of a person, too.

195
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
But Ma Ri,

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,710
the parents of the person you date are important, too.

197
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,400
His mom used you to take money from you.

198
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,700
How could we let you see Do Jun?

199
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,540
Do Jun's mom is bad, but not Do Jun.

200
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,240
Ma Ri—

201
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,530
So, isn't he allowed to fall in love and get married because of his mom?

202
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,200
What did he do to deserve this?

203
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,120
If he could've chosen his mom, he wouldn't have wanted a mom like her, either.

204
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,710
Yes, that's true, but-

205
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,560
Mom...

206
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,040
I like Do Jun so much.

207
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,460
So, try talking to him in person.

208
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,620
Apologize for firing him as a driver

209
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,070
and apologize that Dad screamed at him, too.

210
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,030
And...

211
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,700
tell him to see me again.

212
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,340
Please? Mom.

213
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,900
Why are you doing this?

214
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,250
Why are you doing this, Ma Ri?

215
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,620
   

216
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,220
   

217
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,890
Yes.

218
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,220
   

219
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,120
Yes, welcome.

220
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,280
Have a seat.

221
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,010
I thought Ma Ri moved on from Do Jun.

222
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,710
I suppose she couldn't get over him

223
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,320
and visited your business and home almost every day.

224
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,900
So,

225
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,900
I wanted to discuss what to do with

226
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,720
Ma Ri and Do Jun from now on.

227
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,220
To be honest, both my wife and I...

228
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,780
had a good impression of Do Jun at first.

229
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,440
He's nice, polite, and hardworking.

230
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,760
But what your mother did last time...

231
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm not able to understand it at all.

232
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,590
How am I supposed to let those two see each other?

233
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,110
I feel very bad about what happened, too.

234
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,700
Do Jun likes Ma Ri, but because of what Mom did,

235
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,150
he's rejecting her against his will.

236
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,500
Chairman,

237
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,630
if it's because of my mom, please don't worry and let them be together.

238
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,780
Because of what happened, my siblings and I

239
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,830
cut ties with her.

240
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,260
We don't even see each other anymore.

241
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,010
But if you're still worried,

242
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,460
I'll stop talking to Do Jun, too.

243
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,020
So, please let them be together.

244
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,390
I beg you, Chairman.

245
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,860
Who is it?

246
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,110
 Do Jun, it's me! Open the door. Hurry. 

247
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,920
Gong Ma Ri?

248
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,540
Hey, Ma Ri...

249
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,950
- Do Jun. 
 - Ma Ri, what's wrong? Is something wrong?

250
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,900
Do Jun, we're allowed to see each other now.

251
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,070
My dad is letting us.

252
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,950
So, don't try to break up with me anymore.

253
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,770
You promised to protect me forever. Keep that promise.

254
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,950
Ma Ri.

255
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,220
I'm so sick of running away.

256
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,630
All I get to eat is a piece of bread.

257
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,070
No human should be doing this.

258
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,140
   

259
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,510
Jackson, it's me.

260
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,510
Sorry, I couldn't make it last time.

261
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,040
I just need more time here.

262
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,510
Are you on what I've asked for?

263
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,090
Stay on it.

264
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,290
 Mr. Gong, you're in deep trouble. 

265
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,010
 The shell company, Spring, is now under Interpol investigation. 

266
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,360
 They know that it's yours. 

267
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,320
- What?
 - Don't drag me into this. 

268
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,680
 Sorry, I'm out of this. 

269
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,030
Jackson, Jackson!

270
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,320
What the heck?

271
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,500
What's going on?

272
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,700
Then,

273
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,720
is the paper company in Hong Kong gone, too?

274
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,010
   

275
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,690
Mom.

276
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,070
Mom.

277
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,890
Mom!

278
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,250
Help yourself, Mom.

279
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,810
I know you like flounder sashimi.

280
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,140
It's tasty.

281
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,940
You should have some, too. You like it, too.

282
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,480
I feel alive to finally see you like this.

283
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,290
Do you know how much I worried?

284
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,500
Why would you worry?

285
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,810
Worry about yourself.

286
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,260
Why aren't you eating? I know you like this, too.

287
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,490
I'm eating. Eat as much as you want, Mom.

288
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,420
When are you going to Hong Kong?

289
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,300
- Haven't you found the ship to Hong Kong yet? 
 - What?

290
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,840
I have.

291
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,940
I'm leaving tonight.

292
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,290
That's why I wanted to see you.

293
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,850
Because we can't see each other for a while.

294
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,380
What? You're leaving tonight?

295
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,640
Taking care of things in Hong Kong might take a long time, Mom.

296
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,930
They say no news is good news.

297
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,630
Don't worry, even if you can't reach me, okay?

298
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,970
And...

299
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,580
sell this when you need to, Mom.

300
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,450
This cost a hundred million won.

301
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,250
You can't sell it for less than 50 million, okay?

302
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,620
Why are you doing this?

303
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,480
You're acting like you'd never come back.

304
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,300
It's because...

305
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,620
it might take a very long time.

306
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,850
All of my accounts were frozen.

307
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,810
It might be difficult for me to send you money.

308
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,460
So, don't worry even if you don't hear from me. Okay?

309
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,690
Don't cry.

310
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,150
Be healthy and well.

311
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,810
Okay?

312
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,270
Okay.

313
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,000
Instead, you have to have me come, too.

314
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,230
You need to contact me quickly, okay?

315
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,200
It's so hard to survive each day.

316
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,410
I can't be without you.

317
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,500
Mom.

318
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,580
Please don't say you can't be without me.

319
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,490
What are you, a child?

320
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,510
Are you a kindergartener?

321
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,040
How can I leave if you keep acting like this?

322
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,990
Okay.

323
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,800
Why are you crying, then?

324
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,330
It's because you're upset.

325
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,080
You need to be brave so I can leave easily.

326
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,110
Okay.

327
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,910
I'll be brave and be well.

328
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,380
So, don't worry about me.

329
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,150
Eat. Stop crying.

330
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,190
Don't cry.

331
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
What? We're already here.

332
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,240
I know.

333
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,830
Should we circle around one more time?

334
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,530
Hey.

335
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,910
You're going back to work tomorrow.

336
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,180
Go now. It's late.

337
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,710
I should also go to bed early so I can sell kalguksu tomorrow.

338
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,010
Okay, then.

339
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,410
My baby chick, you did well today, too.

340
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,940
Sleep well.

341
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,750
You, too.

342
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,740
Chirp, chirp.

343
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,830
You say, "chirp, chirp," even when I didn't ask you.

344
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,130
I must've gotten it from you.

345
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,500
It comes out automatically now.

346
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,300
How will you make the kalguksu dough without me tomorrow?

347
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,310
I'm worried to death.

348
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,960
Seriously. Why would you worry about the kalguksu dough?

349
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,270
We'll take care of everything.

350
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,480
Don't worry, okay?

351
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,660
Go inside now.

352
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,430
You go in first.

353
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,350
We're in front of my place.

354
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,740
I need to see you go first, so I feel relieved.

355
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,490
Okay. I'll go, then.

356
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,590
♫  Please always stay by my side  ♫

357
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,510
♫  We'll only have happy days  ♫

358
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,360
Bye.

359
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,620
♫  I'll give you everything  ♫

360
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,270
Sleep well.

361
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,380
You, too, Oppa.

362
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,140
 Park Do Ra! 

363
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,640
Talk to me for a moment.

364
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,570
I have nothing to say.

365
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:34,870
Park Do Ra, I get it.

366
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,070
You don't need to talk.

367
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,070
How about you... eat with me instead?

368
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,800
No.

369
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,560
I don't want to.

370
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,800
So, please leave.

371
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,080
If then, please...

372
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,160
hold my hand one last time.

373
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,430
Are you crazy?

374
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,570
- Please stop now! I beg you! 
 - Hey!

375
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,730
I said this is the last time.

376
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,170
Is it that hard to hold my hand for the last time?

377
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,250
Let's eat instead, then.

378
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,300
Let's have just one meal.

379
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,780
Let go.

380
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,080
Let go! Let go!

381
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,900
Let go!

382
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,310
Let go!

383
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,990
Do Ra. Do Ra!

384
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,520
Do Ra...

385
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,310
Do Ra.

386
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,180
Where am I?

387
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,210
Where are we going?

388
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,120
Stop the car.

389
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,270
Stop the car! Stop the car!

390
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,760
Stop screaming!

391
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,720
I'm not trying to do anything to you.

392
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:55,240
Before I die, I want to have a tea with you

393
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,010
and tell you what I never got to tell you.

394
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,420
I just want to have a meal with you.

395
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,660
You're crazy.

396
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,810
You're crazy!

397
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,980
Yes, I'm crazy.

398
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,080
So, when I asked you to hold my hand once,

399
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,780
you should've just held it!

400
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,100
Do you think my hands are dirty?

401
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,300
You hold Go Pil Sung's hand all the time. Why don't you hold my hand?

402
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,460
You eat with Go Pil Sung and smile at him all the time.

403
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,870
Why won't you do that for me?

404
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,890
Did I ask you to do it a hundred times?

405
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,940
Just once.

406
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,030
I asked you to do it just once for the last time!

407
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,570
I don't want to.

408
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,860
I don't want to! I said I don't want to!

409
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,650
Really?

410
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,740
You hate it that much?

411
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,190
Okay, that's great.

412
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,500
It would've been boring to travel to the netherworld alone.

413
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,400
Let's go together to the netherworld.

414
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,830
What are you doing right now?

415
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,490
Stop the car!

416
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,740
Stop the car!

417
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,490
Stop the car! Stop the car!

418
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,080
Stop the car!

419
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,920
Stop the car!

420
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,900
Park Do Ra.

421
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,090
Park Do Ra.

422
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,250
Park Do Ra.

423
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,310
Do Ra.

424
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,860
Park Do Ra. Do Ra.

425
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,370
Do Ra.

426
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,260
Park Do Ra.

427
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,530
Do Ra.

428
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,030
Park Do Ra! Do Ra!

429
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,750
Park Do Ra.

430
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,200
Do Ra.

431
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,740
Do Ra...

432
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,830
Park Do Ra.

433
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,900
 What are you up to, Do Ra? 

434
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,610
   

435
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,040
Is she asleep?

436
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,560
 Sleeping beauty. 

437
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,820
 Good night, my baby chick. 

438
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,840
 Have a sweet dream. 

439
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,930
Let's stop there.

440
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,110
Let's turn around there.

441
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,060
- Honey. 
 - Yes?

442
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,250
Isn't that a car?

443
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,620
- What? 
 - Honey, look.

444
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,180
There must've been an accident.

445
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,880
- Be careful, Honey. 
 - It's okay.

446
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,710
Honey, Honey, look!

447
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,070
Someone's dead.

448
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,680
Don't go.

449
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,970
Hold on!

450
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,420
- Don't go, I said. 
 - My goodness.

451
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,900
Be careful!

452
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,920
Are you okay?

453
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,300
Please wake up.

454
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,550
She's alive!

455
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,410
- She's alive! 
 - Is she?

456
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,980
Call 911, Honey!

457
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,350
- Are you okay? 
 - Hold on.

458
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,310
- Hurry! 
 - Okay!

459
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,310
Are you okay?

460
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,090
Aigoo, aigoo. Give me that, Mother.

461
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,670
Aigoo, leave it.

462
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,650
I'll do it. I'll do it. Let me.

463
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,910
Is Ji Yeong still in bed?

464
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,060
She said she was on a date with the director last night.

465
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,530
But she never came home.

466
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:09,400
Play ignorant when she gets home.

467
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,280
You'd embarrass Ji Yeong.

468
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,880
Well, is that true?

469
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,920
Of course, it is.

470
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,380
I think they took their relationship to another level last night.

471
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,930
Come on, don't be silly.

472
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,520
She should've called you so you don't have to worry. It's strange.

473
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,120
I suppose.

474
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,460
She's not answering.

475
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,880
Really?

476
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,640
Just leave her alone.

477
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,490
How come you're so clueless, Geum Dong?

478
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,970
Don't interrupt them.

479
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,830
Let me answer this real quick.

480
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,180
Hello?

481
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,660
 Is this Park Do Ra's guardian? 

482
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,500
Yes, this is. Who's calling?

483
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,650
What did you say?

484
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,810
Hey, welcome.

485
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,550
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

486
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,150
I'll call you "Pil Sung" from now on.

487
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,230
You're my son now.

488
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,400
I can call you casually, right?

489
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,280
Yes, Chairman. Please be casual.

490
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,770
Treat me casually as a father from now on, too.

491
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,750
Okay, I will.

492
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,560
And...

493
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,660
this is a secret from Soo Yeon.

494
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,170
I actually wanted a son.

495
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,640
But now...

496
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,970
I have a dependable and handsome son now.

497
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,360
I'm so moved and happy right now.

498
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,330
I'm in your care from now on.

499
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,690
I'm in your care, too, sir.

500
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,890
Let's have a meal with Ms. Park Do Ra sometime.

501
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,500
Okay. Sounds great.

502
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,390
I'll plan it sometime.

503
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,900
Thank you, Chairman.

504
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,890
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

505
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,500
We've been waiting for you to come back.

506
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,740
I'm so glad you're back.

507
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,660
Gosh, don't be like this.

508
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,890
Director Go... I mean, President Go, thank you for coming back.

509
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,970
I was going to switch my job if you didn't return this month.

510
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,630
You've all been through so much.

511
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,820
Let's work hard together starting today!

512
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,450
 Fighting! 

513
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,190
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

514
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,150
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep... 

515
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,120
   

516
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,140
Why can't I reach Do Ra?

517
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,070
She hasn't checked my messages, either.

518
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,980
Nothing happened, right?

519
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,620
Yes, Do Sik.

520
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,400
 Hyung... 

521
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,090
 Hyung... 

522
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,000
 Do Ra... 

523
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,500
 Do Ra... 

524
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,610
Do Sik, what's going on?

525
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,480
Tell me what's going on.

526
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,740
- What about Do Ra? 
 -  Do Ra got into an accident. 

527
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,700
What?

528
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,250
   

529
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,980
Do Sik.

530
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,160
What happened?

531
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,880
Why did Do Ra get into an accident? Why?

532
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,480
I don't know. They're investigating.

533
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,680
They say Do Ra was in a burner car.

534
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,600
They don't know who the driver was.

535
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,840
And they don't know why she was in that car.

536
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,470
We don't know anything yet.

537
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,950
What do we do, Hyung?

538
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,790
Burner car?

539
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,080
What are you talking about?

540
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,050
Are you Ms. Park's guardian, by chance?

541
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,030
Yes, I'm her brother.

542
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,970
Hello, I'm with the police.

543
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,580
By chance,

544
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,200
do you know this person?

545
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,450
Yes, I do.

546
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,130
His name is Gong Jin Dan.

547
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,580
He's the CEO of Angel Investment.

548
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,960
Yes.

549
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,510
The CCTV in front of the elevator showed he kidnapped Ms. Park in front of her place.

550
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,380
We confirmed him leaving Ms. Park after the accident and running away, too.

551
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,240
- Gong Jin Dan? 
 - Yes.

552
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,300
Hyung, I should kill him.

553
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,890
- I'll kill the bastard. 
 - Do Sik.

554
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,930
Why is he doing this to Do Ra again?

555
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,170
- Do Sik. 
 - I'll kill him.

556
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,200
Calm down. Calm down.

557
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,980
Calm down.

558
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,760
Here's my business card.

559
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,750
Please call me if anything happens.

560
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,880
- I'll help as much as I can. 
 - Okay, I will.

561
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,140
Doctor, how did the surgery go? Did it go well?

562
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,020
Thankfully, she will live.

563
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,380
- Thank you. 
 - But...

564
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,080
she had multiple fractures.

565
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,430
I'm not sure if she could walk again.

566
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,940
I can't guarantee she can.

567
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,440
Pardon?

568
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,830
Doctor, what do you mean by that?

569
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,670
Do you mean she can't walk?

570
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,940
That's not true, right? I heard you wrong, right?

571
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,440
We'll keep an eye on her.

572
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,510
Hyung, what did he say?

573
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,260
Why can't Do Ra walk? Why can't she?

574
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,740
I'll kill that bastard.

575
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,860
- I'll kill him! 
 - Do Sik!

576
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,960
Get it together.

577
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,510
That'd never happen to Do Ra.

578
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,380
Do Ra will walk. So, don't...

579
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,770
think she can't walk again, okay?

580
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,180
Hyung...

581
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,820
What do we do with Do Ra?

582
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,670
Can't be...

583
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,290
No, there's no way.

584
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,540
No.

585
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,420
No...

586
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,130
No.

587
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,000
 Do Ra, 

588
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,160
don't worry.

589
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,350
I'll be by your side.

590
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,900
Nothing...

591
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,640
will happen to you.

592
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,620
   

593
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,560
   

594
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,670
   

595
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,500
The garlic looks tasty, doesn't it, Mother?

596
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,110
- Yes, it does— 
 - Mom! Unni!

597
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,140
- This is bad! This is so bad! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

598
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,980
Did someone die? What's the fuss about?

599
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:46,620
Mom, Gong Jin Dan kidnapped Park Do Ra and got into a car accident.

600
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:52,000
The injury was so serious that... she might not be able to walk again!

601
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,340
S-She won't be able to walk?

602
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,540
What do you mean, Aunt?

603
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,370
Everyone is freaking out about this right now.

604
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,110
Have a look.

605
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,050
My goodness.

606
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,540
My goodness. Aigoo...

607
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,180
What's going on...

608
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,100
Honey, Honey.

609
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,000
Have a look at this. Something terrible happened.

610
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,510
What do you mean, "terrible"?

611
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,450
Read this article.

612
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,900
"APP Group's successor Gong Jin Dan kidnapped Park Do Ra.

613
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,510
Fled after the car accident"?

614
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,400
What are they talking about?

615
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,910
Ma Ri's uncle recently—

616
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,230
Who's Ma Ri's uncle, exactly?

617
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,700
I-I know. President Gong...

618
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,610
kidnapped Park Do Ra and got into a car accident.

619
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,600
He left the injured Park Do Ra and ran away on his own.

620
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,290
So, she can't even move right now, apparently.

621
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,590
W-What did you say?

622
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,610
He's on the run for embezzlement right now.

623
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,880
If he did this, too, that means...

624
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,140
he's guilty of attempted murder, right?

625
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,530
Chairman Gong,

626
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,300
people think he's the younger son of our family.

627
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,790
Will the company be okay?

628
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,850
I'll meet with the board of directors and discuss this.

629
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,550
I'll go right now.

630
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,710
Do Ra.

631
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,750
Do Ra, we're in the general ward now.

632
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,650
Oppa.

633
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,240
Oppa, where's...

634
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,910
Grandma, by the way?

635
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,470
She's with Do Jun.

636
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,780
We couldn't tell her about you because she would've worried.

637
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,710
Good job.

638
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,660
She'd get upset if she found out.

639
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,020
Raise the bed for me, Oppa.

640
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,370
Okay.

641
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,620
Oppa, I feel strange.

642
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,170
What?

643
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,020
I don't feel my legs at all.

644
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,140
I can't move my toes or legs at all.

645
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,250
What's wrong with my legs?

646
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,540
Do Ra.

647
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,270
Do Ra...

648
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,340
W-What's wrong?

649
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,590
Why are you crying?

650
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,830
Pil Sung.

651
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,800
Why don't you tell me?

652
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,090
What's wrong with me?

653
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,740
By chance, will I...

654
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:52,760
not be able to walk?

655
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,640
What's wrong with me?

656
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,290
Do Ra.

657
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,430
What?

658
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,430
Why can't either of you talk?

659
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,190
What's wrong with my legs?

660
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,880
Why can't I feel them at all?

661
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,250
What... What...

662
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,860
What's wrong with my legs, Oppa?

663
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,150
What's wrong with my legs?

664
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,500
Oppa, what's wrong with my legs?

665
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,020
- Do Ra. 
 - Please answer me. Oppa!

666
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,230
Oppa, hold on.

667
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,750
Hold on. Hold on. Something's not right.

668
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,080
Here's your coffee, gentlemen.

669
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,050
Here you go.

670
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,370
Thank you.

671
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,800
Did you read the article on Park Do Ra?

672
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,440
I heard she can't walk because of some psycho.

673
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,660
Do Ra can't walk?

674
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,400
But that psycho is apparently...

675
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,890
the younger son of APP Group.

676
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,880
APP Group?

677
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,670
My gosh, Gong Jin Dan?

678
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,730
Excuse me.

679
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,960
I-Is that really true?

680
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,750
Y-You said my daughter Do Ra can't walk.

681
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,760
"My daughter, Do Ra?" Geez.

682
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,260
What's she saying?

683
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,980
Ahjumma, if your daughter is Park Do Ra, my daughter is Angelina Jolie.

684
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,230
Cut the crap. Is what you said really true?

685
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,900
Cops! Cops are here!

686
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,850
Arrest everyone in here!

687
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,310
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

688
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,970
I-I didn't gamble.

689
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,610
I only made coffee and ramen.

690
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,910
Let go! I need to go to my daughter!

691
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,420
No! I need to go to my daughter!

692
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:21,010
Hyung. What do we do with Noona now?

693
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,060
Do Jun.

694
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,580
Let's make sure she gets up, no matter what.

695
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,780
To do that, we can never cry in front of her.

696
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,890
You know what I mean, right?

697
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,330
Okay.

698
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,350
Take good care of Grandma.

699
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,110
Go now.

700
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,930
Okay.

701
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,470
I'll go.

702
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,550
Hello?

703
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,250
Yes, I'm Baek Mi Ja's son.

704
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,020
What did you say?

705
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,400
Do Sik, Do Ra really can't walk? Is that true?

706
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,090
What do we do? What do we do with Do Ra?

707
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,980
What are you doing in there if you're so worried about Do Ra?

708
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,470
Do Sik, let me get out of here. I need to get out!

709
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,810
So, I can care for Do Ra and make porridge for her.

710
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:37,670
Hurry, Do Sik. Get me out of here.

711
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:40,060
What right do you have?

712
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,140
It's your fault.

713
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,400
If only you didn't make Do Ra available to Gong Jin Dan, she wouldn't have gotten injured.

714
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,980
This never would've happened!

715
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,290
Do you understand, Baek Mi Ja?

716
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,880
Do Sik!

717
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,460
I told you!

718
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,710
Park Do Ra, Park Do Jun, and Park Do Sik don't have a mother named Baek Mi Ja.

719
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,800
We're strangers.

720
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,650
Please...

721
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,950
Please don't come to us or contact us.

722
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,180
Do Sik! Hey!

723
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,750
What happened to you, Do Sik?

724
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,720
Get me out of here.

725
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,840
I need to get out!

726
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,480
I need to care for Do Ra.

727
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,680
Do Sik, don't go!

728
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,000
Get me out of here, Do Sik...

729
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Do Sik!

730
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,910
You like my proposal?

731
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,600
Yes, after reading your proposal,

732
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,630
just like the blind man, Shim*, my eyes were opened wide. 
  (Referring to Korean folktale) 

733
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,650
Really?

734
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:10,410
If I may ask, what aspect of my proposal did you like?

735
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:14,480
"A story about a genius doctor who time-traveled during the Second Manchu Invasion."

736
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,780
The logline drew me in already.

737
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,320
I guarantee this will get made.

738
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,640
I know it's far from perfect.

739
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,050
Thank you so much for thinking so highly of it.

740
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,610
I promise I'll work hard from now on.

741
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:36,340
By the way, how about you work on this with me?

742
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,650
Pardon?

743
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:42,540
I think I'd regret it forever if I let go of this.

744
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,850
Writer Go, let's work on this together.

745
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,050
- D-Do you mean it? 
 - Of course, I do.

746
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,240
Say no if another director wants it.

747
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,800
You have let me direct this. I put dibs on it.

748
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,670
Okay?

749
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,300
Thank you! Thank you, Director!

750
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,900
I'm sorry. I was so grateful.

751
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,770
- Thank you. 
 - No, it's okay.

752
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,540
It's not like I'm taken or anything.

753
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,800
Pardon?

754
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,470
You're crazy. You're crazy.

755
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,300
Why did I hold his hand then?

756
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:37,160
By the way, what did he mean, he's not taken?

757
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,320
Was he trying to tell me he doesn't have a girlfriend?

758
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,630
Go Myeong Dong, wake up.

759
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,960
What are you thinking?

760
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,040
That's not important right now.

761
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,690
I'll finally...

762
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:55,110
I'll finally debut with a mini-series!

763
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,830
Is this a dream or reality?

764
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,130
What do I do?

765
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:26,160
Do Ra, I got you your favorite flowers and a cake.

766
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,870
Here you go.

767
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,220
Would you like some hot tea?

768
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,150
Or coffee?

769
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:42,480
Do Ra, let's eat this cake and go for a walk.

770
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,050
And let's start physical therapy.

771
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,500
- Oppa. 
 - Do Ra.

772
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,800
I looked up cases that are similar to yours.

773
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,890
A lot of people walked again.

774
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,910
I'm not talking about some miracles.

775
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,720
They got up again through physical therapy.

776
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,950
So, we should work hard on physical therapy.

777
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,290
I need to tell you something, Oppa.

778
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,100
Yes, tell me. Tell me anything.

779
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,820
Don't ever come here again, Oppa.

780
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,620
What?

781
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,740
I don't like you anymore.

782
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,160
I don't ever want to see you again.

783
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,410
So, you should stop coming here.

784
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,420
Do Ra, how...

785
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,680
could I live without you?

786
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,840
That's not possible.

787
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,020
I can't make that happen.

788
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,390
Don't be so ridiculous.

789
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,840
Oppa, do you think I'm joking right now?

790
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,070
Do Ra,

791
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,700
I know you're suffering.

792
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,110
But you can't say stuff like that.

793
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,700
Oppa,

794
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,970
try thinking from my perspective.

795
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,330
Would you want to see me if you were in my situation?

796
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,600
Would you want me to see you not being able to walk?

797
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,700
I'm already suffering so much now.

798
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,980
Seeing you like this makes me suffer more.

799
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,730
It's so painful that it's driving me crazy.

800
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,960
Do Ra, don't do this.

801
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,820
I don't care how you look at all.

802
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,820
It doesn't matter.

803
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,930
But you need to walk.

804
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,650
That needs to happen.

805
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,210
So, I'm suggesting we work together.

806
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,950
So, Do Ra,

807
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,000
please don't do this.

808
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,020
No, no, no, no!

809
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,900
I hate you! Please go away!

810
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,200
Go away, I said!

811
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,760
- What's wrong, Do Ra? 
 - Please leave, Oppa.

812
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,060
Leave.

813
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,820
What's wrong?

814
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,370
Oppa, get Pil Sung Oppa out of here.

815
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,940
I don't want to see him.

816
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,890
Please tell him to leave.

817
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,460
Please get him out of here.

818
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,630
Tell him to get out of here!

819
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,630
Please tell him to leave.

820
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,120
♫  Because I want to see you  ♫

821
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,980
♫  I suddenly miss you  ♫

822
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:47,670
♫  I hurt multiple times a day  ♫

823
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:54,850
♫  My bruised heart is filled with you  ♫

824
00:58:54,850 --> 00:59:02,660
♫  I can't do anything else  ♫

825
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:07,380
♫  Love is so difficult, so difficult  ♫

826
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,760
♫  It hurts a lot  ♫

827
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:19,990
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

828
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,290
   

829
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,910
   

830
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:33,870
   

831
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:38,440
   

832
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,400
Apologize to Park Do Ra!

833
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,250
 Apologize! Apologize! 

834
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,940
Save Park Do Ra!

835
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,650
 Save her! Save her! 

836
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,280
Apologize to Park Do Ra!

837
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,160
 Apologize! Apologize! 

838
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,660
Save Park Do Ra!

839
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,630
 Save her! Save her! 

840
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,150
Apologize to Park Do Ra!

841
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,210
 Apologize! Apologize! 

842
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,490
It's dangerous here, Chairman.

843
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,560
Let us go this way.

844
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,120
Apologize to Park Do Ra!

845
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,870
 Apologize! Apologize! 

846
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,530
Save Park Do Ra!

847
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:06,270
 Save her! Save her! 

848
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,910
Apologize to Park Do Ra!

849
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:12,100
 

850
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,730
 - Do Ra. 
 - I'll kill him. 

851
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,920
Do Ra, what's wrong? What's going on?

852
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,250
I'll kill him.

853
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,610
I'll kill that bastard.

854
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:56,860
Not only did he kill me, he disabled me. I'll kill him.

855
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,750
-I'll kill him! 
 - Do Ra.

856
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,430
- I'll kill him! 
 - Do Ra, calm down.

857
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,680
I don't need you!

858
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,400
I want you gone, too!

859
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,020
I don't need you, either! Please leave!

860
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,900
- Leave! 
 - Okay.

861
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,870
I...

862
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,560
I'll take revenge on that bastard.

863
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,600
I'll kill him.

864
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,660
I'll do it.

865
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,780
I'll do it.

866
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,000
I'll kill him for you.

867
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,080
No, Oppa. No, Oppa.

868
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,960
Oppa. No, Oppa!

869
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,070
Oppa! Oppa, don't do it!

870
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,270
Oppa, don't do it!

871
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,290
Oppa!

872
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,580
Oppa...

873
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:52,020
Oppa! Pil Sung Oppa!

874
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,010
Oppa!

875
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,850
Do Ra!

876
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,410
- Do Ra. 
 - Oppa.

877
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,730
Oppa, stop Pil Sung Oppa.

878
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,850
Tell him not to take revenge.

879
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:07,380
Go ahead and stop him right now!

880
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,300
Chairman,

881
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,380
I have a favor to ask you.

882
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,270
Favor?

883
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:21,000
Okay, ask me anything.

884
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,990
What will my Jin Dan do?

885
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,560
My poor baby.

886
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,450
   

887
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,730
Yes, it's me, Chairman Gong.

888
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,440
What's this about?

889
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,190
To your office right now?

890
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,130
Okay, Chairman Gong.

891
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,500
What's the important matter he needs to discuss?

892
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,880
What's this?

893
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,020
Ae Gyo,

894
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,420
you read the articles on your son, right?

895
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:04,630
Embezzlement of Angel Investment's fund, the slush fund,

896
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:08,430
attempted killing of Park Do Ra, and he framed her for prostitution, too.

897
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,100
People protest in front of the APP Group building these days.

898
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:19,580
If Jin Dan gets arrested, how would that make my company look?

899
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,980
And how would that make my family look?

900
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:27,250
So, take this money and...

901
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,180
leave the country with Jin Dan.

902
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,500
I-It's money?

903
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,750
Is this money?

904
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,400
Take this and leave with Jin Dan immediately.

905
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,150
Immediately.

906
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,040
Thank you.

907
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,690
Thank you, Jin Taek.

908
01:03:55,690 --> 01:04:00,190
I'll never forget your favor.

909
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:33,610


910
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,440
Mom.

911
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,210
Jin Dan, are you okay?

912
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,060
Why do you look like this?

913
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,560
I'm okay.

914
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,060
By the way, you said we have money to leave together?

915
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,200
Where did you get that much money?

916
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,300
Here's the money.

917
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,760
Your brother gave it to me.

918
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,310
He gave you this money?

919
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:06,130
Yes. He said the family and company would look bad if you get arrested.

920
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,750
He told us to leave the country, no matter what.

921
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,890
He said you attempted to kill Park Do Ra, too.

922
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,810
That's not true, right, Jin Dan?

923
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,230
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Do you think I'm crazy?

924
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,490
Gong Jin Dan!

925
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,490
Mom.

926
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,250
Did you bring him with you?

927
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,120
What are you talking about?

928
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,210
Shit.

929
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,710
So, this money was a bait?

930
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,770
What? Bait?

931
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,410
Mom, run.

932
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,880
Mom, run!

933
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,100
Gong Jin Dan!

934
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,930
   

935
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:54,130
♫  Even if the fate tears us apart  ♫

936
01:05:54,130 --> 01:06:00,500
♫  Don't let go of my hand you're holding tightly  ♫

937
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:12,290
♫  The shiny stars of this love don't fade  ♫

938
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,480
♫  One love  ♫
