1
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:50,118
Ma Ri, 
    

2
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:55,638
Pil Sung...

3
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:59,078
is your brother.

4
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:02,038
Your biological brother.

5
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:06,688
Biological brother?

6
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:09,118
What does that mean?

7
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,748
What do you mean by that?

8
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:18,358
It means I gave birth to you and Pil Sung, too.

9
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,548
So, Pil Sung is your biological brother.

10
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,158
You and Pil Sung are brother and sister.

11
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:24,878
That's why it can't work.

12
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,798
You understand...

13
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,788
what I'm saying, right?

14
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:36,058
You gave birth to me and Pil Sung, too?

15
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,568
Mom, what are you talking about?

16
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:42,358
Pil Sung's mom is Seon Yeong.

17
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:47,698
And if he were my brother, he should live with us. Why does he live separately?

18
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:52,888
Mom, do you hate that I like him that much?

19
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,718
Why would you make up such a ridiculous lie?

20
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:57,558
Did you think I'd give up if you told such a lie?

21
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,038
Why do you treat me like a fool?

22
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,288
I'm not a fool! I'm not a fool!

23
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,138
Ma Ri, don't get excited, Ma Ri.

24
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:06,788
Listen to me carefully.

25
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:13,818
So, Mom gave birth to Pil Sung and...

26
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:17,958
gave him to Seon Yeong.

27
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:21,748
That's how he became Seon Yeong's son.

28
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:27,918
You gave birth to a baby and gave him to someone else?

29
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:30,308
How could you give your baby to someone?

30
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,598
Mom, why do you keep saying weird stuff?

31
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,898
To be honest...

32
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:41,128
To be honest,

33
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,878
I...

34
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,268
I...

35
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:54,918
abandoned Pil Sung in front of...

36
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,988
Seon Yeong's house.

37
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,268
I did.

38
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,778
You...

39
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:08,408
abandoned Pil Sung?

40
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,498
Does Dad know, too?

41
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:14,978
Or did you do that without his permission?

42
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:21,798
Pil Sung's dad is someone else.

43
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,918
It's not my dad?

44
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,658
When I was studying in the US before I married Dad,

45
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:38,758
there was a man I had loved.

46
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,458
But...

47
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:43,158
he...

48
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:48,558
died in an accident in the mountains.

49
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:55,088
I returned to Korea because I was sad and couldn't endure it alone

50
00:03:56,718 --> 00:04:00,888
and met your dad.

51
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:03,558
But I wasn't...

52
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,838
interested in getting married.

53
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,778
Because the person I loved had died recently.

54
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:15,318
If so, why did you marry Dad?

55
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:20,128
My family was...

56
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,588
so poor then.

57
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:27,458
Grandpa had to enter the assemblyman election,

58
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,528
but we were about to go bankrupt.

59
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,738
But...

60
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:36,458
your dad's family offered to help us. So, we agreed to marry.

61
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,288
That's when...

62
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:43,578
That's when... I realized I was pregnant.

63
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:51,068
Ma Ri, there were situations I can't explain to you.

64
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:54,918
You probably won't understand. I...

65
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:58,938
tried to save Grandpa and my family—

66
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,798
I don't know! I don't get it!

67
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:05,118
I don't understand what you're talking about at all!

68
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,948
Ma Ri, Ma Ri...

69
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,788
Ma Ri...

70
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:16,448
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,908
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

72
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:29,488
My poor Ma Ri...

74
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:33,608
We live in the same house. What's wrong with driving together?

75
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,898
I told her to join me. I did.

76
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,808
Have you been blaming her for that?

77
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:40,208
Why wouldn't we?

78
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:44,508
The whole neighborhood is talking about how you drive together every day.

79
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:48,638
The unmarried man and woman are driving together all the time.

80
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:51,478
Of course, our neighbors would find it strange.

81
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:57,198
That's why I asked her to be careful about it.

82
00:05:57,198 --> 00:06:00,568
I'm sorry. I'll never ride his car from now on.

83
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,458
Sorry?

84
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,898
Why would you be sorry?

85
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,228
Mom and Grandma, don't yell at Ji Yeong from now on.

86
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:13,168
She'd feel uncomfortable taking my car if you criticized her.

87
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:17,778
I like Ji Yeong. That's why I want to drive with her.

88
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,588
What? What did you say?

89
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,288
What are you talking about right now?

90
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:26,198
Are your ears plugged or something?

91
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,798
Pil Sung says he likes this lady.

92
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:31,848
That's why they've been driving together.

93
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:35,018
Aigoo, aigoo. My goodness.

94
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:38,328
You really are unbelievable.

95
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:42,578
Excuse me, Miss. When I asked you if you were dating before,

96
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:45,018
you said no with your eyes wide open.

97
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:48,138
But have you been driving together secretly

98
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:50,668
and seeing each other? Have you?

99
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:52,908
No, we aren't dating.

100
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:57,068
I don't have a relationship like that with him. Don't be mistaken.

101
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,568
Grandma, what are you talking about?

102
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:05,408
So, you and Mom told Ji Yeong not to like me?

103
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,578
Is that why you've been avoiding me, saying you don't like me?

104
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:14,968
Why didn't you say so, then? Why didn't you?

105
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,808
What's wrong with you, Director?

106
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:19,698
You're making me look bad by doing this.

107
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,348
I'll go inside now.

108
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:27,998
Grandmother, Landlady, we aren't dating, okay?

109
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:29,998
Ji Yeong!

110
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:31,908
You...

111
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:36,488
Have you been doing all this because you're after her?

112
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:46,068
I'm still pursuing Ji Yeong on my own.

113
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:49,428
So, please don't say anything to her.

114
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,928
What? "Still"?

115
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:58,788
A-Are you saying you'd date our tenant or something?

116
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:03,958
Of course, I want to as long as she says yes.

117
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:08,888
Since I found out she's been avoiding me because of you and Grandma,

118
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,998
I'll persuade her somehow and make things work.

119
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:16,008
So, just keep that in mind.

120
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,628
Oh, my.

121
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:25,048
Honey, Mother, what did he say just now?

122
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,378
What did I hear just now?

123
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:30,568
Seriously, are your ears still plugged?

124
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:35,498
He's saying he'd keep chasing the tenant around.

125
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:39,648
My goodness. You've been coddling him so much

126
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:43,128
saying, "My Dae Chung. My Pil Sung."

127
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:46,318
Aigoo, aigoo. Look at yourself.

128
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,258
Your effort is about to go to waste.

129
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:51,098
Mom, please.

130
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:59,598
Grandmother and Landlady asked me to be careful.

131
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:03,638
But the Director is saying he likes me.

132
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:09,128
How am I supposed to face his family now?

133
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,788
 Miss, are you in there? 

134
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,618
 - Let's talk for a second.  
 - Gosh.

135
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,008
It's the landlady.

136
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,728
O-Okay.

137
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,208
May we come in for a second?

138
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,870
Y-Yes.

139
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,798
Would you like something to drink?

140
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:42,258
N-No, it's okay.

141
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:54,188
Miss, you just said you weren't dating Pil Sung.

142
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:57,008
You really aren't dating, are you?

143
00:09:57,008 --> 00:10:00,318
No, we aren't.

144
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:04,998
I mistakenly thought you seduced Pil Sung.

145
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:08,138
I'm so sorry I thought that.

146
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,298
I apologize.

147
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:21,258
It looks like Pil Sung likes you.

148
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:25,238
I'm ashamed to say this, but please don't fall for him.

149
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,878
Please don't date him even if he asked you.

150
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,578
I'm begging you like this.

151
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:39,418
Pil Sung is all I have.

152
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:45,768
It's not because he's my son. He's... sweet, proper, smart,

153
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:49,558
and he's never inferior to anyone...

154
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:54,758
Gosh, why am I saying all this to you?

155
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:00,928
I understand what you mean.

156
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:06,008
There's nothing going on between us. So don't worry.

157
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:14,188
Ji Yeong, I feel so relieved that you're saying that. Thank you.

158
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:20,798
I heard you won't be working with Pil Sung soon.

159
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:26,888
It'd be awkward to see each other living here when the project ends.

160
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:30,138
So, tell us anytime if you find a place to move.

161
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:32,408
We'll let you move out.

162
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:37,628
Okay.

163
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:49,160


164
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,988
 The customer is not available at the moment... 

165
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:16,908
 Ji Yeong, are you not answering because you're angry? 

166
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:18,868
 Please come out. 

167
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,908
 We have a lot to talk about. 

168
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,288
 We need to resolve misunderstanding, too. 

169
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:27,498
 The breeze is nice and cool right now. 

170
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,198
 Let's take a walk together. Come out. 

171
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,220
&nbsp;

172
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:03,759
Where and how is my Do Jun living?

173
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:13,148
I need to become successful and get Do Jun back.

174
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:17,308
Do Sik, sit down over here.

175
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:25,098
Do Sik, did you really break up with the old woman? Did you really?

176
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:28,758
I said we did. We broke up. How many times do you have to ask?

177
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:33,098
Do Sik, stop goofing around and look for Do Jun.

178
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,268
You're his brother. Aren't you worried?

179
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:36,768
How can you sleep at night?

180
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:39,718
Mom, I keep in touch with him, and we see each other, too.

181
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,068
What kind of person do you think I am?

182
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,508
Seriously.

183
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:44,888
What?

184
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:49,098
You've been seeing Do Jun?

185
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,568
Why didn't you tell me anything, then?

186
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:53,838
You should've told me if you were doing that.

187
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:59,528
You know how much I miss him. How could you do this? How?

188
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:03,788
Well, I was going to tell you eventually, too.

189
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:07,268
But still!

190
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,928
Call him and tell him to come right now.

191
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:11,858
Do it right now. Hurry!

192
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:16,928
But Do Jun doesn't want to see you yet.

193
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,318
What?

194
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:21,458
Did Do Jun say that?

195
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,748
That's why I didn't tell you. So you don't get hurt.

196
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,788
Just let me talk to him on the phone.

197
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:32,108
I want to hear his voice.

198
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:35,938
Okay.

199
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:47,018
Hey, Do Jun. It's Hyung.

200
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,098
 Hey, Hyung. What made you call so late? 

201
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,908
Do Jun! Do—

202
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:56,408
To be honest, Mom wants to talk to you.

203
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:59,728
Please talk to her for me just once, okay?

204
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:04,278
Do Jun, Do Jun. It's Mom.

205
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,488
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

206
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:12,868
So, can't you live with us now? Please?

207
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:17,918
You know how much I miss you, Do Jun.

208
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:23,088
D-Do Jun, don't hang up! Do Jun?

209
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,318
See? He doesn't want to.

210
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:30,318
Call him later. Give him some time.

211
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:34,918
How's he doing? How is he feeding himself?

212
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:40,208
He looks very healthy and clean-cut.

213
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,468
I think he's doing very well.

214
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:43,938
- Is that true? 
 - Yes.

215
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:48,998
He told us not to worry about him and to be well since he's doing fine.

216
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:56,368
Do Ra, Do Jun...

217
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:01,978
One is dead, and I don't know how the other one's doing.

218
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,818
I'll...

219
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:09,340
I'll get back on my feet somehow.

220
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,810
I'll become successful and get Do Jun back.

221
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:18,318
- Seriously... 
 - That's enough now. Stop.

222
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:33,478
 Is it tasty? 

223
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:36,078
 Yes. It's so, so tasty. 

224
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:40,798
 But why didn't you get ice cream, Noona? 

225
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:44,088
 I don't like ice cream. It's too cold. 

226
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:46,508
 Oh, I see. 

227
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,418
 Are your legs tired? 

228
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:51,938
 Should I carry you, Do Jun? 

229
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,848
 Yes, carry me. 

230
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:02,818
 You need to study hard, Do Jun. 

231
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:08,268
 I'll make a lot of money and let you study abroad, okay? 

232
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,848
 Okay, Noona. 

233
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:12,548
 - Do Jun! 
 - Noona! 

234
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,168
 Hey, what's going on? What's this? 

235
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,168
 You said you couldn't come because you had to study. 

236
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,878
 I wanted to surprise you like this. 

237
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:26,878
 Aigoo, aigoo, my baby. I missed you so much. 

238
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:33,128
 Do Jun, you know who I'm working so hard for, right? 

239
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:40,688
Noona... I'm a fool.

240
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:47,398
I learned you liked ice cream when I got older.

241
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:17,478
No, no, you can't do that...

242
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:19,398
Oppa...

243
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,808
The baby was crying because he was scared.

244
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,888
That shouldn't be...

245
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:26,568
How could she do that?

246
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:30,628
How could she do that?

247
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,418
Ma Ri, what's going on?

248
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,648
I don't like you, Mom.

249
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:07,238
I hate you, Mom.

250
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:11,078
I can't forgive you, Mom.

251
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:16,048
I'll hate you until I die.

252
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,178
I'm scared of you, Mom.

253
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:24,378
I hate you so much!

254
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,418
Ma Ri.

255
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,938
Ma... Ma Ri!

256
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:30,938
- Ma Ri! 
 - Ma Ri!

257
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,848
Ma Ri! Ma Ri!

258
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:37,198
- Ma Ri! Ma Ri! Ma Ri! 
 - Ma Ri.

259
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:40,968
- What do we do? 
 - Ma Ri! Ma Ri!

260
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,478
It looks like she was in shock about something.

261
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:58,278
I gave her a tranquilizer. She'll be calm now.

262
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,618
You should keep an eye on her for a while.

263
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,908
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

264
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,938
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,548
I feel so bad for you, Honey.

266
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:48,148
You know Ma Ri is different than other young ladies.

267
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:51,828
Of course, she did something she shouldn't have done

268
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:55,628
and she intruded on Seon Yeong's family.

269
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:58,968
But you went too far.

270
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,028
How could you slap her face like that?

271
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,618
You got so emotional, too.

272
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:10,168
We have never hit her before.

273
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,728
But she got slapped like that.

274
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:17,278
By her mom, not just anyone else.

275
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:19,378
I could see why she's like that.

276
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:28,868
But I'm sure Ma Ri will be okay.

277
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:31,178
Don't worry so much.

278
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:33,308
I'll be back after the meeting.

279
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:39,038
Call me if something happens to Ma Ri immediately, okay?

280
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:42,368
I'll be right back.

281
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,930
When did you get up, Ma Ri?

282
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,610
You should've called me.

283
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,110
Are you feeling better?

284
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:43,083
Ma Ri, I made beef porridge, your favorite.

285
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,023
Eat this a bit.

286
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:47,200
I know you're hungry. Please?

287
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:51,323
I looked it up on the internet yesterday.

288
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:55,273
Three-day-old babies are...

289
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,783
this small.

290
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,150
This is how small they are.

291
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:04,563
They're smaller than my Chichi.

292
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:10,093
How were you able to abandon such a small baby?

293
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:14,123
Ma Ri.

294
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:17,133
I can't even abandon my Chichi.

295
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:22,773
When I lost Lulu, I was so upset I couldn't sleep.

296
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:27,013
How could you abandon your baby,

297
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:30,143
Oppa, who was that tiny?

298
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:33,663
What did you say?

299
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:41,675
And... after abandoning such a small baby,

300
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:46,825
how could you be all right and eat just fine,

301
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:51,595
dress in pretty clothes, go on trips,

302
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:57,705
have fun with your friends, and live like that?

303
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:02,105
Ma Ri, please...

304
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:08,022
I don't understand anything you told me.

305
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:11,205
It was because of Grandpa?

306
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:16,155
It was to help your struggling family?

307
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:19,955
How could that be a reason to abandon your baby?

308
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:25,335
You should've abandoned adults, not your baby.

309
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:33,765
Adults can walk around on their own and find food,

310
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:42,352
but babies can't live unless someone cares for them or gives them milk.

311
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:45,265
They die.

312
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:50,295
Mom, you're such a bad person.

313
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:52,085
Get out, Mom.

314
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:55,725
Get out of my room! I can't stand the sight of you!

315
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:01,335
What's going on? What's wrong, Ma Ri?

316
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,385
Why are you yelling at your mom?

317
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:06,795
Yes, Ma Ri. Why did you get so angry?

318
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:11,625
You can't treat Mom like that, no matter how angry you are.

319
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,465
Get out. Get out!

320
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,885
I want to be alone!

321
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:18,555
Gosh, okay, okay.

322
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:21,755
- Let's go out, Aunt. 
 - Aigoo.

323
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,565
Ma Ri,

324
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:47,715
it's Mom's fault.

325
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:53,655
It's true I did an unforgivable thing.

326
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,535
Ma Ri?

327
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,035
I'm sorry.

328
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:07,515
It's my fault.

329
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:11,515
I'm so sorry.

330
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:22,245
Mom, Oppa is the one who's been wronged by you.

331
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:28,065
You should be begging him for forgiveness. Why do this to me?

332
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,905
Go apologize to Pil Sung.

333
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:38,515
I'm sorry.

334
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:44,895
I'm sorry, Ma Ri. I'm sorry.

335
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,765
I...

336
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:55,325
like you so much that...

337
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:59,815
I want to understand you,

338
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:07,045
but no matter how much I think, I can't understand you.

339
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:13,245
I'm so upset that I keep crying.

340
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:22,795
I keep thinking about a baby crying in a basket.

341
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:28,065
I feel so bad for Pil Sung.

342
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:33,795
I feel so sorry for Pil Sung.

343
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,725
   

344
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:59,245
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting.

345
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:11,535
Ji Yeong, why do you keep avoiding me?

346
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:13,615
When did I avoid you?

347
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:15,605
You didn't answer my call and text last night.

348
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:18,765
I texted you so we could carpool together this morning.

349
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:21,245
You came to work early to avoid me today, didn't you?

350
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:23,875
And you hid in the prop storage room when I came.

351
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,925
You see Jae Dong, but why avoid me?

352
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:28,325
Do you like me or him?

353
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,565
What are you saying?

354
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:35,945
I can't believe I'm hearing this now.

355
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:42,325
People might hear you saying all this nonsense.

356
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:47,305
Fine. Let's talk somewhere quiet.

357
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:49,615
Follow me quietly.

358
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,865
Director, why do you keep saying nonsense?

359
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,865
I never said nonsense.

360
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:06,795
I've never been so truthful in my whole life.

361
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:12,675
So, you were truthful when you told your mother and grandmother that you liked me?

362
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,475
That's what you call nonsense.

363
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:18,665
How does saying that to them make me look?

364
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:21,245
So what if you were being truthful alone?

365
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:23,015
Ji Yeong,

366
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,855
I know you like me, too.

367
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:31,965
I know your heart is leaning toward me, too.

368
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,115
But why do you keep pushing me away?

369
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:41,875
If it's because of my mom and my family, don't worry.

370
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:45,385
I'll take care of that myself.

371
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,655
So, let's stop wasting time having conflicts

372
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:51,715
and let's just see each other.

373
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,715
I really...

374
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:57,935
like you, Ji Yeong.

375
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,195
Okay.

376
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:10,755
Everything you said is true.

377
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:13,425
I like you, too.

378
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:17,665
But everything the elders said is true.

379
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:21,555
Someone like me doesn't suit you.

380
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:25,215
Your parents are completely devoted to you.

381
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:29,065
You'll be a terrible son to fall for me like this.

382
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:35,035
So, you'd better come to your senses now

383
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:39,295
and find a woman who's on the same level as you.

384
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:50,115
Ji Yeong, you are... the coolest woman in the world to me.

385
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:52,785
I mean it.

386
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:01,965
You can't do this at work.

387
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:04,655
People might see us.

388
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,135
Let everyone see. Everyone.

389
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:13,155
What's so bad about people in love hugging?

390
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:15,735
We love each other.

391
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:19,275
Ji Yeong,

392
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:26,745
we confirmed each other's feelings by taking many detours.

393
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:32,805
Don't think about anything else and...

394
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:36,215
just trust me. Only me.

395
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:41,895
Can I really do that?

396
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:43,785
Of course.

397
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:49,395
You just need to stay right by my side.

398
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:55,555
My heart for you will not change.

399
00:32:55,555 --> 00:33:02,035
♫  Without trying so hard and just the way I am  ♫

400
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:06,855
♫  You see me as I am  ♫

401
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:10,195
You mean it, right?

402
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:15,365
You won't betray me later, will you?

403
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:24,645
I'll never... let go of your hands.

404
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:26,455
Never.

405
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:31,755
I'll always be by your side.

406
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:36,755
♫  I want to love you  ♫

407
00:33:56,005 --> 00:34:01,255
Ma Ri, I can't do anything if you're like this.

408
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:06,305
I only took care of urgent stuff because I was worried about you.

409
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,325
So...

410
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:13,735
could you stop being...

411
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:17,685
angry at Mom for slapping you?

412
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:24,455
To be honest, what you did at Pil Sung's

413
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:28,355
was indeed your fault, you know.

414
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:30,515
Right?

415
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:32,205
Ma Ri.

416
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,505
Dad.

417
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,725
Why did you marry Mom?

418
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,155
What do you mean why?

419
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:52,805
I married her because I liked her a lot.

420
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,685
Do you still...

421
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:01,325
love her?

422
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:05,815
Of course I do.

423
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:11,745
I love you and Mom the most in this world.

424
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,645
Ma Ri,

425
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:20,195
that's why...

426
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,775
I want you and Mom to...

427
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:27,805
make up now.

428
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:32,735
Because the two people I love the most are like this,

429
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:35,565
it gets me so upset.

430
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:42,015
Mom is so bad.

431
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:45,475
I hate Mom.

432
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:52,485
Yes, yes. Okay, Ma Ri.

433
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,935
Mom is bad!

434
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:57,775
She's very bad.

435
00:35:57,775 --> 00:36:01,485
She made you upset like this.

436
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,475
Let's stop, okay?

437
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:13,635
 It's okay, Ma Ri. Ma Ri... 

438
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:31,451
Do you...

439
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,441
recognize me?

440
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:38,081
I've been waiting for you.

441
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:41,981
I knew we'd...

442
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,711
end up this way.

443
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,471
Cut! Okay!

444
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:01,851
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you!

445
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:03,781
Thank you for everything, everyone!

446
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,011
Thank you!

447
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:11,031
Thank you so much for doing your best until our last shoot!

448
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:16,031
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you!

449
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:17,631
Well done.

450
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:20,191
And we have good news!

451
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:28,561
"Don't Lie To Me" will be on the streaming service LaPlex while it's on air!

452
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,101
"Don't Lie To Me" is premiering next week! Let's hit it big!

453
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:33,711
Let's go!

454
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:35,721
Thank you. Thank you.

455
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,611
Thank you. Thank you.

456
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:47,409
Hold on, hold on.

457
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,229
What are you doing, CEO?

458
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:54,559
It looks prettier this way. Why hide your pretty shoulder?

459
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,489
You need to know your strengths and take advantage of them.

460
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:59,399
That's what you do in this field.

461
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:03,169
Do Do, I explained how important a casting director is.

462
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:04,969
You understand, right?

463
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,139
Yes, I know, too.

464
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:09,119
Yes, I'm glad you know.

465
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,979
You're completely useless if you don't seize the opportunity in this field.

466
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:18,289
You just need to do what I tell you to do, okay?

467
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,879
Okay.

468
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:25,689
The meal is to your liking, right?

469
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:28,919
Let me pour you a glass.

470
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,869
Do Do, pour him a glass. Go ahead.

471
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,809
Pardon?

472
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:41,679
CEO Baek, no one expects actresses to pour drinks these days.

473
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,369
You don't have to do that.

474
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:47,199
Pouring you a drink won't hurt her or anything.

475
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,439
Do Do, pour him a glass. What are you doing?

476
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:57,219
This is how shy Do Do is.

477
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,299
Let me pour you some.

478
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:01,789
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

479
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,909
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

480
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:07,899
Director, please call me if a good part comes up.

481
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:09,179
Okay.

482
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:14,109
Do Do is pretty, but she's good at acting, singing,

483
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,909
and she's funny. She's multi-talented.

484
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:19,559
Are you good at singing, too?

485
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,169
Of course. Would you like to hear her singing?

486
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:26,349
How about we do karaoke for the second round?

487
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,609
Okay.

488
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:34,879
Hey, Do Do! You can't just leave like this.

489
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,779
The atmosphere is great right now.

490
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:41,379
CEO Baek, I don't want to become an actor by doing this.

491
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,189
- What? 
 - I hate having meetings like this.

492
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:45,809
I'll just audition instead.

493
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:49,749
Do Do, you got rejected from another audition.

494
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:52,609
How will you be cast with the bit of talent you have?

495
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,249
I'll work harder. I can just do that instead.

496
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:55,949
I can just do that instead.

497
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:57,469
Work hard?

498
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,119
Who doesn't work hard in this field?

499
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,379
Do you think working hard is enough?

500
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:04,609
Everyone works hard. Everyone.

501
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:08,599
You have to make impressions on people like this, too.

502
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,489
Do you think it's easy to become a top celebrity? You think it's easy?

503
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:14,369
My professor said you just need to be talented.

504
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:18,809
Hey, we're doing this because you aren't talented. You aren't good enough.

505
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,949
You think I'm doing this just for myself?

506
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:23,559
But I still don't want to do it this way!

507
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,199
Hey, Do Do!

508
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,569
You can't leave like that! Do you know how much I spent on alcohol?

509
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,859
My gosh.

510
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,899
The breeze is cool.

511
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,779
The ice cream is sweet.

512
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,179
There's the moon shining on us in the sky, too.

513
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:14,639
It's nice to walk holding hands like this, right?

514
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,459
Isn't it obvious?

515
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,029
Since this happened,

516
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:31,179
we might as well walk holding hands like this

517
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:34,689
tomorrow, the day after, and the day after.

518
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:38,389
Of course.

519
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:41,339
That's the kind of relationship we have now.

520
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,359
Well, why are you all sitting like that?

521
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,709
Are you still waiting for Pil Sung?

522
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,809
You can just call him.

523
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,389
This is no good.

524
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,749
I'll call him and ask him where he is and if they're together.

525
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:10,959
Don't do that, I said.

526
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,989
I'm home.

527
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,289
Hey, Pil Sung! You...

528
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:19,569
Go Pil Sung.

529
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:23,619
Go Pil Sung, what are you doing right now?

530
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:28,209
You're holding hands in front of us. Is this a protest?

531
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:32,699
Miss! Why are you holding my son's hand?

532
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,889
Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Aunt.

533
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:45,749
I'll be seeing Ji Yeong officially starting today.

534
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:51,649
So, please treat me as my girlfriend from now on.

535
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:54,129
What? Girlfriend?

536
00:42:54,129 --> 00:42:56,899
Who said she could be your girlfriend?

537
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:01,039
Miss, what are you doing right now?

538
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,779
You said nothing is going on between you two. You said not to worry.

539
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:08,119
How could you stab us in the back like this?

540
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:17,089
Ma'am,

541
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:21,309
I'm sorry I couldn't keep the promise.

542
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:26,209
I tried not to like him, but it didn't work.

543
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:30,469
I'll be so good to the Director and the rest of the family, too.

544
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:34,379
I'll do my best to be liked by you.

545
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:39,539
And I'll work hard to become good enough for Director.

546
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,249
Please... Please give me a chance.

547
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,379
Give you a chance?

548
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:48,619
What do you mean give you a chance?

549
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:53,009
You little... You're so shameless, aren't you?

550
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,159
There's no need to talk more.

551
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:58,329
Miss, please move out immediately.

552
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:01,609
Move out right now. I don't want to see you.

553
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:05,529
Mom, you don't have the right to do that.

554
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:08,939
The room is for the tenant, Ji Yeong, during the contract period.

555
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,379
What?

556
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:12,949
Ji Yeong, how long is your contract?

557
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:15,149
Well, two years.

558
00:44:15,149 --> 00:44:18,449
You have the power for two years.

559
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:23,699
So, you don't have to move out, no matter what my mom says, okay?

560
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:29,619
Director, why would you say that? You're upsetting her.

561
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:32,779
Calm down, Director. Don't do it.

562
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:36,819
Okay. I won't do it since you don't want me to.

563
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,349
Grandmother, Landlady, Ahjussi, and Myeong Dong.

564
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:50,199
It's getting late. I'll get going now.

565
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:53,109
Anyway, I hope we get along.

566
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,809
Thank you in advance.

567
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,799
Have a good night, then.

568
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:59,899
- Let me walk you over. Let's go. 
 - Okay.

569
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,659
- Hey... 
 - Hey, hey!

570
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:07,939
- Honey. 
 - Unni, are you okay?

571
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:12,679
- Honey. 
 - Aigoo.

572
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:23,179
My heart is still pounding, and my legs are shaky, too.

573
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,119
I feel so bad for the landlady.

574
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:30,499
Looks like everyone is in shock because of me.

575
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:32,369
What do I do?

576
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:35,469
It's okay, Ji Yeong.

577
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,119
You did a great job today.

578
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,239
Just keep doing what you did.

579
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,169
Just trust me, okay?

580
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,339
Okay.

581
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:49,819
I'll only trust you from now on, okay?

582
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:54,049
What a good girl you are.

583
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,919
Ji Yeong, what's going on?

584
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:35,679
Something amazing happened. I wanted to tell you about it first.

585
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,979
Since you're my boyfriend now.

586
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:44,679
Of course. I should hear about it first if something good happened to you.

587
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,099
What is it?

588
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,949
I just heard from CEO Jae Dong.

589
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:54,309
Don't be shocked and listen.

590
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,239
I...

591
00:46:56,919 --> 00:47:01,129
was cast as the lead actor in the mini-series!

592
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:03,249
- Really? 
 - Yes!

593
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:05,999
Congratulations, Ji Yeong!

594
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:08,799
Are you okay?

595
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:12,439
My goodness.

596
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:16,089
Ji Yeong, I need to go to work now. I'll call you when I get off work.

597
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:19,179
- Let's celebrate this evening, okay? 
 - Okay.

598
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:39,049
My gosh, what did I see just now?

599
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:42,289
We have our eyes wide open and

600
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,359
they're flipping out in the front yard like that?

601
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:54,939
 My brother, Pil Sung. 

602
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:59,599
 Thank you so much for becoming such a cool adult. 

603
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,679
 I'll be a good younger sister from now on. 

604
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:10,979
 Starting now, I'll be on your side, no matter what. 

605
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:18,919
Ji Yeong, I felt disappointed earlier, to be honest.

606
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:20,819
Pardon?

607
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,109
Why?

608
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,519
How could you forget about me?

609
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:27,329
Am I that easy to forget?

610
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:33,009
Well, I'm sorry. I've been kind of out of it these days.

611
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:39,389
 So, is she saying she forgot about me because she's been busy? 

612
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:46,009
Ji Yeong, this is our last meal together, right?

613
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:49,179
You made a decision already, right?

614
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,609
About you becoming my girlfriend.

615
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:55,839
Well, CEO Gong, I'm very grateful.

616
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,969
You thought so positively of me and forgave me about the jacket.

617
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:04,069
I'm so grateful for many things.

618
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:09,659
But I'll have to refuse to become your girlfriend.

619
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:11,439
I'm sorry.

620
00:49:11,439 --> 00:49:13,299
Why?

621
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:16,239
Do you mean you don't have any feelings for me?

622
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,699
Why did you say you'd think about it last time?

623
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:25,689
I was caught off guard because you asked while we were eating

624
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:30,249
and if I said no when I was supposed to buy you dinner to compensate you for the jacket,

625
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:33,399
it would've made us feel uncomfortable while eating.

626
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,949
You've got to be kidding me.

627
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:40,109
After dragging it out and testing the water?

628
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:42,299
Are you kidding me right now?

629
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:45,439
And I should be rejecting you.

630
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:47,849
You think you can reject me?

631
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:54,049
I'm sorry.

632
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:58,759
Thank you for everything all this time.

633
00:49:58,759 --> 00:50:01,589
I'll get going now, then.

634
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:21,689
What's going on right now?

635
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:27,601
What did she do to me just now?

636
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:37,911
Yes, come in.

637
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:42,571
Ms. Hong, Ms. Kim Tae Hee sent flowers.

638
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:44,981
My gosh, Tae Hee did?

639
00:50:44,981 --> 00:50:47,681
- Yes. I'll put them here. 
 - Okay.

640
00:50:49,711 --> 00:50:51,511
My gosh.

641
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:54,681
It smells so good.

642
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:57,761
By the way, what's with the flowers all of a sudden?

643
00:51:01,201 --> 00:51:06,721
Gosh, Tae Hee. I was just about to call after receiving flowers.

644
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:08,131
What are these for all of a sudden?

645
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:12,931
I was going to meet Jin Dan today, but he said you were very sick today.

646
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:14,601
 I wanted you to recover looking at the flowers. 

647
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:18,071
 Did come back from the hospital with Jin Dan? 

648
00:51:18,071 --> 00:51:20,621
Huh? H-Hospital?

649
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:23,571
 Gosh, what's she talking about? 

650
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:28,111
Mother, are you feeling very sick?

651
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:31,161
No, no. It's just the flu.

652
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:33,201
Thank you so much, Tae Hee.

653
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:35,231
I'll be in touch.

654
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:41,101
Jin Dan, that punk. He lied to Tae Hee that I was sick.

655
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,971
What's going on?

656
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,951
My gosh, maybe he has another woman.

657
00:51:57,641 --> 00:51:59,621
Secretary Jo, it's me.

658
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:02,101
Kim Ji Yeong?

659
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:07,321
You mean Jin Dan is seeing someone pathetic like her? 
    

660
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:12,601
Ms. Hong, I'd get fired if CEO Gong found out I did this.

661
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:15,031
Don't worry about that, Secretary Jo.

662
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,891
You think I'd put you in that position?

663
00:52:18,691 --> 00:52:20,211
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

664
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:23,331
Good work, Secretary Jo. You can leave now.

665
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:30,351
He has a fiancee.

666
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,601
Jin Dan, that punk is out of his mind.

667
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,491
Gosh, why does she live here?

668
00:52:39,491 --> 00:52:41,911
What's going on?

669
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:45,941
Seon Yeong! Kim Seon Yeong! Come out!

670
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:50,261
My gosh!

671
00:52:50,261 --> 00:52:52,001
Ae Gyo!

672
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:57,051
What's going on, Ae Gyo? What's wrong? Why are you so upset?

673
00:52:57,051 --> 00:52:59,601
Seon Yeong, does someone named Kim Ji Yeong live in your house?

674
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:01,211
Do you know that girl?

675
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,791
Kim Ji Yeong?

676
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:04,831
You mean our tenant?

677
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,111
Why are you looking for her?

678
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:08,611
What? Tenant?

679
00:53:08,611 --> 00:53:10,751
You mean for that rental unit?

680
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:12,611
Y-Yes.

681
00:53:13,171 --> 00:53:15,901
Hey! Kim Ji Yeong! Come out!

682
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,831
Come out, Kim Ji Yeong!

683
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:27,561
Who are you? I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

684
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,851
Y-You...

685
00:53:35,451 --> 00:53:37,451
My gosh.

686
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:40,301
I-It's you.

687
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,091
It's you!

688
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:46,511
Hey! You bitch!

689
00:53:46,511 --> 00:53:48,491
You gold digger! You bitch!

690
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,171
How dare you stick around Jin Dan?

691
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:54,581
What are you trying to get from him? You beggar!

692
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:57,251
What are you doing?

693
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:59,641
Who's your son, anyway?

694
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:02,261
- Let go of me! 
 - Just talk instead, Ae Gyo. Please!

695
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:04,301
Don't do this.

696
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:10,971
You bitch! Jin Dan has a fiancee, too. A fiancee.

697
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:13,761
How dare you try to seduce him?

698
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:17,331
Why would a young woman like you act like a gold digger?

699
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:19,111
G-Gold digger?

700
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:20,901
Seduce?

701
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:24,131
I didn't do that!

702
00:54:24,131 --> 00:54:25,941
What are you talking about?

703
00:54:25,941 --> 00:54:28,051
Hey! You want this, right?

704
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:32,261
You attached yourself to Jin Dan to get money from him, right?

705
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:34,051
Fine! Take this and get lost.

706
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:35,771
Take this money and get lost!

707
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:39,231
You'd better not meet Jin Dan again.

708
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:41,701
I'll kill you then, okay?

709
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,401
Ji Yeong!

710
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:48,721
Ji Yeong.

711
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:53,551
Ahjumma.

712
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:55,821
What are you doing right now?

713
00:54:55,821 --> 00:54:59,831
Gosh, Pil Sung. Why are you defending her?

714
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:05,361
S-She seduced my Jin Dan, who's engaged.

715
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:08,181
Get out of here if you'll say nonsense like that!

716
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:09,991
Right now!

717
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:14,451
Get out, Ae Gyo. Let's talk outside.

718
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:22,001
Ji Yeong.

719
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:24,221
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

720
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,931
It's okay.

721
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:37,781
Ae Gyo, did she really seduce your son? Are you sure?

722
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:41,891
I'm telling you. Why would I come here otherwise?

723
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:44,491
By the way, what's wrong with Pil Sung?

724
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,241
Why would he defend that bitch?

725
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,851
Was he seduced by her, too, by chance?

726
00:55:48,851 --> 00:55:51,721
He didn't. Why would you say that?

727
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:55,241
Hey. Kick her out of your house, okay?

728
00:55:58,061 --> 00:56:00,151
What's she talking about?

729
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:04,941
What does our tenant have to do with her son?

730
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:08,941
My gosh.

731
00:56:17,991 --> 00:56:21,451
Ji Yeong, drink some warm water.

732
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:32,791
Are you feeling better?

733
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:40,260
What happened, Ji Yeong?

734
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:43,571
Did you meet CEO Gong by chance?

735
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,821
You know, too.

736
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:53,311
I promised to buy him five meals instead of compensating him for the jacket.

737
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:56,201
There was just one meal left.

738
00:56:56,201 --> 00:57:00,221
So, I had the last meal with him today.

739
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,361
Was she...

740
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,371
doing that because you ate with him?

741
00:57:05,371 --> 00:57:07,621
I don't know.

742
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:11,281
CEO Gong wanted to go out with me, but I said no.

743
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:15,471
So, I thought I wouldn't have to be involved with CEO Gong anymore.

744
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:19,591
I had no idea something like this would happen.

745
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:25,121
Director, nothing happened between him and me.

746
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:27,381
I swear.

747
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:30,571
Yes, Ji Yeong.

748
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:34,561
I believe everything you said.

749
00:57:34,561 --> 00:57:36,411
Don't worry.

750
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:51,751
My gosh, what's going on?

751
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:55,511
So, our tenant was seeing Pil Sung

752
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:58,611
and she was seeing your friend's son, too?

753
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:01,061
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

754
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,191
I can't talk because I'm so flabbergasted.

755
00:58:04,191 --> 00:58:07,921
It can't be. There must be a misunderstanding.

756
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,071
Ji Yeong wouldn't do something like that.

757
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:13,761
Come on! You can't tell just based on her looks.

758
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:18,371
She has an innocent face,

759
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:23,111
but she seduced a rich man like him. She's a serious gold digger.

760
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:29,011
Pil Sung lost his mind because a gold digger like her seduced him.

761
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:35,081
Hey! Pil Sung. You can't date her.

762
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:41,281
I was going to tolerate it, but that bitch is really bad news.

763
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:45,151
Grandma, how could you talk like that?

764
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:48,821
There's nothing going on between her and that woman's son. Nothing happened.

765
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:51,001
So, please don't get the wrong idea.

766
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:53,231
What do you mean by "wrong idea"?

767
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:56,231
You think Ae Gyo did that for no reason?

768
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:59,891
Gosh, I really don't have good feelings about her.

769
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:05,021
I won't say much. You'd better break up with her.

770
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:08,711
Ji Yeong has nothing to do with that man.

771
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:13,071
They did meet a few times, but they only ate together due to a situation.

772
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:17,831
So, believe me, and don't get funny ideas.

773
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:23,391
What do you mean by "a situation"?

774
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:26,620
Why would she eat with an engaged man?

775
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:32,641
Why do we keep getting gold diggers in that rental unit?

776
00:59:32,641 --> 00:59:38,391
Seon Yeong, we can't have female tenants there anymore.

777
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:50,340
CEO Gong.

778
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:54,721
Why did he ask Ji Yeong to buy him meals when he was engaged?

779
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:56,371
What?

780
00:59:56,371 --> 00:59:59,001
He asked her to be his girlfriend?

781
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:02,107
That bastard.

782
01:00:02,107 --> 01:00:05,297
What was he thinking when he said that?

783
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,737
You crazy bastard! Are you crazy?

784
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:12,447
Why would you meet that pathetic girl and lie to Tae Hee?

785
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:14,167
She's a total country bumpkin.

786
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:16,277
How could you fall for someone like her?

787
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:18,867
How embarrassing! What an embarrassment!

788
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:20,507
Mom!

789
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:24,117
- Did you see Ji Yeong? 
 - Yes, I did!

790
01:00:24,117 --> 01:00:26,847
Do you know how humiliated I was in front of Seon Yeong?

791
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:31,697
Why did you have to date a country bumpkin who lives in my friend's rental unit?

792
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:35,017
Mom, what did you do to Ji Yeong? Huh?

793
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:37,187
I taught her a thing or two. Why?

794
01:00:37,187 --> 01:00:40,587
- I said I'd kill her if she saw you one more time. 
 - Mom!

795
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:43,247
And you... I don't know how she seduced you.

796
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:45,297
But how could you fall for a girl like that?

797
01:00:45,297 --> 01:00:48,477
Gosh, you idiot. You'd better end it before Tae Hee finds out.

798
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:50,747
Mom!

799
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:55,037
Twenty. So this is one million won.

800
01:00:55,037 --> 01:00:57,997
Hyeon Cheol, how much is all this in total?

801
01:00:57,997 --> 01:01:00,407
Don't talk to me. You're confusing me.

802
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,977
Hold on.

803
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:07,497
This is one bill shy of a million, so...

804
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:12,837
- It's 9,950,000 won in total. 
 - What?

805
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,907
Looks like she was going to give her 10 million won.

806
01:01:15,907 --> 01:01:20,267
She couldn't have tried to give her 9,950,000 won.

807
01:01:20,267 --> 01:01:23,997
It flew away somewhere in the front yard.

808
01:01:23,997 --> 01:01:30,407
By the way, isn't 10 million too little for a chaebol family?

809
01:01:30,407 --> 01:01:34,597
And what do we do with all this money?

810
01:01:34,597 --> 01:01:37,297
What else? We should give it to its owner.

811
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:39,087
What?

812
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:42,377
You and I picked all this up.

813
01:01:42,377 --> 01:01:44,017
What are you saying?

814
01:01:44,017 --> 01:01:46,487
Seriously, Mom.

815
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:54,827
Take this.

816
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:57,057
What's this?

817
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:00,897
It's the money CEO Gong's mom threw at you.

818
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:04,527
I collected it. It's 9,950,000 won.

819
01:02:04,527 --> 01:02:10,407
I think she threw 10 million won, but a 50,000 won bill is missing.

820
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:13,287
I didn't take it. Don't get the wrong idea.

821
01:02:13,287 --> 01:02:16,727
You can look for it in the front yard later.

822
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,207
What are you doing? Take it.

823
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:23,097
Why would I take it? I don't need it.

824
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:27,947
Should I put it in the trash? Or should I keep it?

825
01:02:27,947 --> 01:02:33,186
This is your money. It's up to you whether you keep it or not.

826
01:02:33,747 --> 01:02:38,707
Miss, why do you live like that at such a young age?

827
01:02:38,707 --> 01:02:41,147
Aigoo...

828
01:02:41,147 --> 01:02:45,237
How dare you try to seduce a man who belongs to someone else?

829
01:02:52,997 --> 01:02:58,737
Ma'am... I never did such a thing.

830
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:10,187
   

831
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:15,231
Yes.

832
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:18,871
 I'm in front of your house. Let's meet up for a moment. 

833
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:27,161
Ji Yeong.

834
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:30,291
I heard you met my mom.

835
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:34,861
Did she do or say something rude to you?

836
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:36,281
If so, I apologize on her behalf.

837
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:42,841
I didn't want to talk to you or ever see you again,

838
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:45,821
but I came out to give this to you.

839
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:48,441
Take this with you.

840
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:51,961
Your mother threw this money at me.

841
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:56,711
I've never been slapped with bills before.

842
01:03:56,711 --> 01:04:00,981
Although I don't know what I did to deserve it.

843
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:04,981
Tell me. There's nothing going on between you and me.

844
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:08,011
Tell your mom properly.

845
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:12,151
That there's nothing going on between us.

846
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:14,021
Hold on, Ji Yeong.

847
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:16,271
What are you doing? Let go.

848
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:20,201
Ji Yeong, I like you.

849
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:22,811
I can't end things like this.

850
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:26,731
Please reconsider me just once more.

851
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:31,051
CEO Gong, are you out of your mind?

852
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:33,621
I heard you have a fiancee.

853
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,601
Why are you doing this to me, then?

854
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:38,361
If you say you like me,

855
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:40,471
I'll break up with her.

856
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:41,961
What are you saying?

857
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,121
CEO Gong, you're no good.

858
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:49,811
I'm not interested in dating you, even a tiny bit.

859
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:54,581
And I really hate that you're like this.

860
01:04:54,581 --> 01:04:56,661
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong.

861
01:04:56,661 --> 01:05:01,831
Looks like you don't know who I am yet.

862
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:06,201
If you date me, you can get anything you want.

863
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:10,011
You don't have to live in a crappy place like that.

864
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:13,551
A house, car, purses, and clothes.

865
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:17,881
I'll give you everything. Everything.

866
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:22,411
I'm that kind of a person.

867
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:25,191
I don't need any of that stuff.

868
01:05:25,191 --> 01:05:29,621
And I already like someone. Don't ever come to see me again.

869
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:32,191
Hey, I said I like you!

870
01:05:32,191 --> 01:05:34,911
Let go of me! Let go, I said!

871
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:36,791
So, answer me.

872
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,911
Say you like me, too!

873
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:41,961
CEO Gong Jin Dan!

874
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:59,930


875
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:03,060
   

876
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:06,571
♫  It's so tough  ♫

877
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:12,761
♫  I'd feel better if I could see you the way you are  ♫

878
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:17,501
♫  Love is so difficult, so difficult  ♫

879
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:20,911
♫  It hurts a lot  ♫

880
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:29,961
♫  I gave my everything, but it's still not enough  ♫

881
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:38,101
 Mom, I want to share what I have with Oppa. 

882
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,911
 How can we share what we have with Oppa? 

883
01:06:40,911 --> 01:06:43,591
 What? You want to start a drama production company? 

884
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:45,681
 I've been dreaming about this for years. 

885
01:06:45,681 --> 01:06:48,571
 I want to finally start it now. Could you help me? 

886
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:53,201
 I won't lose the one I love because of lack of power and money again. 

887
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:55,101
 Never again.
