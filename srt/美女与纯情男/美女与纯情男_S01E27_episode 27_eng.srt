1
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,700
   

2
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:59,770


3
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,570
Oh, my gosh!

4
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,310
Gosh, what are you doing right now?

5
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,320
 Let me see! 

6
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,200
What are you doing?

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,980
What are you doing right now?

8
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,340
You're Do Ra.

9
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,890
You really are... Do Ra!

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,930
What did you say?

11
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,400
Yes...

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,390
I've been feeling strange whenever I see you.

13
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,100
So much so that I thought I was crazy.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
Anyway, anyway, I felt really strange. But...

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,830
it is because you are Do Ra.

16
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,640
Because you are my daughter, Do Ra. Do Ra...

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,570
What did you say I was, Ahjumma?

18
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,240
I'm your daughter, Park Do Ra?

19
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,880
Ahjumma! Please come to your senses!

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,930
I know you're drunk, but how could you think I'm your daughter?

21
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,510
No...

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,330
Do Ra, I...

23
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,430
I-I'm your mom.

24
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,530
Do Ra, I'm your mom! I'm your mom, Do Ra!

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,730
Do Ra, I'm your mom!

26
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,880
What's wrong with you?

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,830
Just go home and get some sleep if you're drunk.

28
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,880
Why are you throwing a drunken fit?

29
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,040
Do Ra! Do Ra!

30
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,500
She's definitely my Do Ra. She's my Do Ra.

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,130
But...

32
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,040
But she's Kim Ji Yeong, the country bumpkin.

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,990
How could she be Do Ra?

34
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,400
She's not my Do Ra.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,210
I don't know. What's going on? What's going on?

36
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,340
W-What's going on?

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,620
That lady really is crazy.

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,390
What a strange thing that was.

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,280
 I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. 

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,620
 You're Do Ra. 

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,050
 You really are... Do Ra! 

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,300
I mean, it was her son last time.

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,440
Now, the mother lifted my shirt off and stuff.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,180
Why is that family doing this to me?

45
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,540
Do I really look like Park Do Ra?

46
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,440
   

47
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,840
Park Do Ra was so pretty.

48
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,360
She's different than me. What's wrong with them?

49
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,630
Yes, Grandma. It's me.

50
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,750
Yes, Ji Yeong.

51
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,560
 Grandma, I'm your granddaughter, right? 

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,340
Of course you are. Why would you ask such a thing?

53
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,520
Some lady said I was her daughter earlier.

54
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,310
What?

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,620
W-What did you say?

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,240
Where are you right now?

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
 Is that crazy woman still there? 

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,830
How dare she claim my granddaughter?

59
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,180
I'll go to Seoul and pluck all of her hair out.

60
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,160
It's okay, Grandma. The crazy lady is gone.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,400
So I'm definitely your granddaughter, right?

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,810
 I'm telling you. 

63
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,490
You're Lee Soon Jeong's only granddaughter.

64
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,160
Yes, Grandma.

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm your only granddaughter.

66
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,170
 Ji Yeong, 

67
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,910
ever since your Mom and Dad died together in a car accident,

68
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,830
I've been living for nothing but you.

69
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,100
 If you run into that crazy woman again, kick her shin, okay? 

70
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,640
 kick her shin, okay? 

71
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,720
Okay, Grandma. Don't worry.

72
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,330
I think she talked nonsense because she was drunk.

73
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,170
Yes, Grandma.

74
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,470
I'll call you later.

75
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,200
Okay.

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,290
Yes, she said crazy stuff because she was drunk.

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,610
   

78
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,050
- Director. 
  - Ji Yeong. 

79
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,820
I arrived in Paris safely.

80
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,680
 What a relief. 

81
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,630
 How's Paris? 

82
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,540
It's nice, except that you aren't here.

83
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,350
Director, stop flattering me with those embarrassing comments.

84
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,710
 I wasn't flattering you. I meant it. 

85
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,780
Anyway, let's visit Paris together once we finish filming.

86
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,510
Sounds good. I've been wanting to go somewhere cool like that.

87
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,430
By the way, Director, you look like a Parisienne since you're there.

88
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,630
 You look cooler. 

89
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,440
Thank you.

90
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,870
Baby chick.

91
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,320
 Pardon? 

92
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,260
Chirp, chirp.

93
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,790
Hang up for now. Let's talk later.

94
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,280
He's so silly.

95
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,880
Why is he doing that all the way in Paris?

96
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,240
He's so goofy.

97
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,150
Pil Sung! Pil Sung! Show me the trophy! The trophy.

98
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,330
Pil Sung, show it to us, too!

99
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,960
 Here. 

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,050
Pil Sung, the trophy is very elegant since it's French.

101
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,710
Pil Sung, you're so cool!

102
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,860
Don't just leave it somewhere. Make sure to bring it back.

103
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,410
- I will. 
  - Congratulations, my son, Pil Sung! 

104
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,370
Do well and come back safely!

105
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,220
- When are you coming back, Pil Sung? 
 - I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

106
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,680
Who are you talking to? Is it your girlfriend?

107
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,430
Hyung, do you want to talk to my family?

108
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,210
- Okay. 
  - It's Cha Bong Soo! 

109
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,960
Hello, this is Cha Bong Soo.

110
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,860
Mom, Mom, Mom, it's Cha Bong Soo.

111
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,950
- Cha Bong Soo. 
 - Hello.

112
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,220
.

113
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,400
   

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,800
My gosh.

115
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,330
This is great!

116
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,950
Soo Yeon.

117
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,550
Seon Yeong, my gosh! Congrats!

118
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:37,250
Have a seat. Have a seat. I was reading about Pil Sung winning the award.

119
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,530
Were you? Thank you.

120
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,820
He won such a huge award.

121
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,420
I don't even know what's happening.

122
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,110
I feel like I'm dreaming.

123
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,680
It's because you raised him well.

124
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,490
I even felt nervous and proud reading the article.

125
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,380
Thank you.

126
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,050
Right, Soo Yeon, Pil Sung's Aunt said

127
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:07,130
you were unbelievably generous with the terms of the contract.

128
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,810
Are you sure that's okay?

129
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,480
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,330
I set the terms like that since he deserves it.

131
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,570
I'm the one who's honored to work with a great director like him.

132
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,390
Thank you so much for thinking highly of him.

133
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,690
I hope he does well.

134
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,180
I'm worried he'd disappoint you after being paid so much.

135
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,550
Come on, why would you worry about that?

136
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,860
He'll do well.

137
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,040
Look at him now. He won an international award. How impressive is that?

138
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,680
Soo Yeon, thank you so much.

139
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,050
I'll be returning the favor for the rest of my life.

140
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,710
I'm not sure how,

141
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,110
but I'll make sure you never run out of your favorite kimchi.

142
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,340
I want to carry you on my back every day.

143
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,460
Carry me? We're too old to do that. You'd break your back.

144
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,250
What?

145
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,180
Do Jun! Do Jun!

146
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,870
Gong Ma Ri, can't you knock?

147
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,370
Sorry. I was so moved just now.

148
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,420
I forgot because I wanted to brag about it.

149
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,260
Do Jun, do you know the Juniper Awards?

150
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,710
Pil Sung Oppa won that award.

151
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,850
He won a Juniper Award?

152
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,970
Yes, the Best Director Award.

153
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,210
Wow, that's a very prestigious award. He's really impressive.

154
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,260
Right? Isn't my oppa so amazing?

155
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,020
He really turned out well.

156
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,350
By the way, are you sure you only like him as an oppa?

157
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,190
Huh? What do you mean by that?

158
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,670
It looks like you still like him a lot.

159
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,360
No, Oppa and I can't be. We can never do that.

160
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,610
No? Why not? Why can't you?

161
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,140
It's because...

162
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,520
The thing is...

163
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,010
I don't know. I don't know. It's a secret.

164
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,240
I can't tell you that, no matter how close we are.

165
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,400
Fine. I understand.

166
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,330
By the way, what's all this, Do Jun?

167
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,740
I wanted to enter an architecture competition. The prize money is pretty generous.

168
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,230
Architecture competition? Do you know how to do stuff like that?

169
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,150
To be honest, I studied architecture before I came here.

170
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,030
Oh, I see.

171
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,720
I thought these little things were toys.

172
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,310
They aren't toys. You can't touch them.

173
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,210
Wow. Park Do Jun, you're so cool.

174
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,010
Not at all.

175
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,130
Do you want to see?

176
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,210
 Let me see! 

177
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,040
 What are you doing? 

178
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,910
 What are you doing right now? 

179
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,280
No, how could she be Do Ra? Just look at her.

180
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,020
How could that country bumpkin be our Do Ra?

181
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,740
Gosh, it makes no sense.

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,460
But how could she have the same triangle-shaped birthmarks?

183
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,870
That's not so common.

184
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,140
My gosh. Let me see. Let me see.

185
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,010
Did you eat walnuts?

186
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,610
Bi Bi gave me a walnut pie. So I just took one bite.

187
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,100
I only ate a tiny bit.

188
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,140
Seriously! Let me see!

189
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,520
My gosh, it's all over. All over.

190
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,630
I told you not to eat walnuts.

191
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,490
I said even a speck of walnuts will make you flare up like this.

192
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,180
We can't shoot anymore. You little...

193
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,740
Gosh, what do we do now?

194
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,840
Yes, Do Ra was allergic to walnuts.

195
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,140
But if that country bumpkin has a walnut allergy, too...

196
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,700
Like Do Sik said, we didn't even find Do Ra's body.

197
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,620
There's no evidence she died.

198
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,830
♫  The wait is fun and now the air is sweet too  ♫

199
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,740
♫  I love you like this  ♫

200
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,470
Cut!

201
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,630
That was great.

202
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,700
Jae Dong.

203
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,220
CEO Baek, what brings you here? Isn't Do Do done shooting?

204
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,570
Yes, I was nearby and stopped by to see you.

205
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,350
Today's your last shoot, too, right?

206
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,710
Yes, it is.

207
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,230
We don't get to see each other often. We get to meet up like this.

208
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,740
- By the way, did you have lunch? 
 - We're going to eat together once Ji Yeong finishes shooting.

209
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,850
Yes, I love it. Just like you did now...

210
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,690
This is great. I made a sweet potato smoothie to have for lunch,

211
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,510
but I suddenly need to have lunch with someone. Try some.

212
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,920
Thank you so much.

213
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,480
Here.

214
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,080
Wow.

215
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,210
Daebak. It's amazing.

216
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,100
Really? That's great.

217
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,300
Just keep this, then. Share it with your actor.

218
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you so much. We'll enjoy it.

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,940
Don't drink it on your own. Make sure to give some to your actor.

220
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,290
You know, a manager should care for his actor first, right?

221
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,120
Of course. I'll make sure to give it to her.

222
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,830
Okay.

223
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,790
Not at all.

224
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,560
- I'll go, then. 
 - Take care.

225
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,260
Okay, we'll go one more time!

226
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,690
Everything is looking great.

227
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,280
That bastard. Is he drinking all of it? My gosh.

228
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,540
Are you kidding me right now?

229
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,250
Cut! Okay! Nice!

230
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,310
Ji Yeong, you did great.

231
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,730
- You must be hungry. 
 - Yes.

232
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,650
Try some of this.

233
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,170
What's this?

234
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,130
It's a sweet potato smoothie. It's really good. Try it.

235
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,490
It's tasty.

236
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,710
Are there walnuts in here, by chance?

237
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,030
Walnuts?

238
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,990
I'm not sure. Why?

239
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,420
I could taste walnuts a bit.

240
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,660
I'm allergic to walnuts.

241
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,530
Really?

242
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,550
It tastes like it.

243
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,490
It must have walnuts in it.

244
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,620
Hold on, Ji Yeong.

245
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,670
It's too big, right?

246
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,160
- Hey, Jae Dong. 
 - CEO Baek,

247
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,570
are there walnuts in the sweet potato smoothie, by chance?

248
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,910
Yes, I put some in there to make it nutty. Why?

249
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,310
 Ji Yeong is allergic. 

250
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,870
My gosh.

251
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,110
She's allergic to walnuts?

252
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,200
Hey, take her to the hospital. It could be dangerous.

253
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,900
 Okay. I'll call you later. 

254
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
- O-Okay. 
  - Bye. 

255
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,470
My gosh.

256
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,620
She's allergic to walnuts, too?

257
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,440
What's going on? Is she Do Ra?

258
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,430
I mean... her face is so different. How could she be Do Ra?

259
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,830
What's going on?

260
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,800
Oh, my gosh! Why are you doing this to me, Ahjumma?

261
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,980
Ahjumma! Stop right there!

262
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,200
Stop!

263
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,130
She's really out of her mind.

264
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,870
She's out of her mind.

265
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,320
She needs to go see a doctor.

266
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,990
Did I get a bald spot?

267
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,830
Geez.

268
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,700
This is it. This is it.

269
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,550
When will the result come out? Please make it quick.

270
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,680
Okay, I will.

271
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,120
Tae Hee, I just had a meal with that woman.

272
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,020
But that director punched me, saying she was his woman.

273
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,150
Was I supposed to just get punched?

274
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,350
I would've had nothing to say if I were seeing her. But...

275
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,610
there's nothing going on. But he was mistaken—

276
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,370
That's enough.

277
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,130
I could've let it slide if I were the only one who saw the fight.

278
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,900
But it was at a foundation ceremony.

279
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,530
Fighting in front of your fiancee and a crowd is unforgivable to me.

280
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,810
She wasn't even at your level.

281
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,660
You were fighting over someone so ridiculous.

282
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,160
It feels like I was tainted, too.

283
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,690
I don't ever want to see you again.

284
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,550
Tae Hee...

285
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,930
   

286
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,520
So... w-what does this mean?

287
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,760
Does it mean... the two are mother and daughter?

288
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,230
Yes, that's correct.

289
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,140
Are you okay?

290
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,630
Doctor! Doctor! Come here! Hurry! Hurry!

291
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,340
Are you okay?

292
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,350
Mom! Mom! What happened? Are you okay?

293
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,560
- Do Sik. 
 - Yes.

294
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,070
Do Ra is alive. I said Do Ra is alive.

295
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,380
What are you talking about?

296
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,460
Is it because I said the tenant lady looked like Do Ra?

297
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,180
I'll stop saying stuff like that. Please get it together.

298
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,300
- Seriously! 
 - It hurts!

299
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,980
This isn't a dream. It can't be a dream.

300
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,840
Hold on. The test result. The test result.

301
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,460
What test did you get?

302
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,620
Hey, look. Look. I did a DNA test. Look.

303
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
DNA test? What DNA test?

304
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,410
Kim Ji Yeong and I.

305
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,560
I plucked her hair and tested it, and this is the result.

306
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,670
She's really our Do Ra. She is!

307
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,320
I-Is this true, Mom?

308
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,480
Do Ra, Do Ra, let's talk.

309
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,250
Why are you doing this now?

310
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,420
Ahjumma, I think you lost your mind.

311
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,930
Don't come here and go see a doctor instead, okay?

312
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm sorry, but she's not crazy.

313
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,150
It'd just take a moment.

314
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,250
We need to talk about something important.

315
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,480
Let's talk a bit. I beg you.

316
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,040
How important is it, anyway?

317
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,680
What's this?

318
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,200
Why are you showing this to me?

319
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,060
It's a maternity test with you and her DNA.

320
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,700
It says you're mother and daughter.

321
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,620
What did you say?

322
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,780
Are you saying we're mother and daughter right now?

323
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,880
Yes, you really are my daughter.

324
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,410
Do Sik and I kept mistaking you as Do Ra.

325
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,990
So, I plucked your hair to get a DNA test.

326
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,770
That was the only way.

327
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,640
You have triangle-shaped birthmarks on the side of your back, right?

328
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,340
Do Ra had that, too.

329
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,760
And you're allergic to walnuts, right?

330
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,700
Do Ra was allergic to walnuts, too.

331
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,770
You really are my Do Ra.

332
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,710
Ahjumma, although they died in a car accident together,

333
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,230
I had a mother and father.

334
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,360
And my grandmother is alive, too.

335
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,190
How could you be my mom, then?

336
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,660
Birthmarks on the back? A walnut allergy?

337
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,210
Anyone could have those things.

338
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,380
And I don't trust this.

339
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,840
This was fabricated.

340
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,570
Do Ra, do you really not remember anything? Do you not recognize us?

341
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,570
Why are you doing this?

342
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,920
I don't remember anything and...

343
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,390
there's no way someone so coarse is my mom.

344
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,150
- I'll leave now. 
 - No, no!

345
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,720
If you don't believe me, you can get tested with me.

346
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
I beg you. Do it just once.

347
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,400
You never know what it'd say.

348
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,700
   

349
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,620
   

350
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,340
It's you. You're Do Ra.

351
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,670
- Do Ra. 
 - Yes.

352
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,560
Yes, it says you and I are mother and daughter.

353
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,960
Do Ra, you're my daughter.

354
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,890
Do Ra, my daughter. Do Ra...

355
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,260
Do Ra.

356
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,340
L-Let go of me.

357
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,360
No!

358
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,430
I-I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

359
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,080
My grandma is alive, too.

360
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm her granddaughter.

361
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,410
Yes, let's go see that grandmother together, then.

362
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,500
Let's ask her how she became your grandmother,

363
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,400
and how your face changed like this. She must know.

364
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,910
Let's go together. Let's go together.

365
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,560
I don't know about anything.

366
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,910
I don't want to talk to you about anything right now.

367
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,080
Do Ra! Stop Do Ra!

368
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,590
- Do Ra! 
 - Go to her!

369
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,710
Do Ra... Do Ra...

370
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,090
Do Ra! Do Ra! Do Ra! Hold on!

371
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,350
Do Ra! Do Ra!

372
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,850
Do Ra!

373
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,960
What's going on right now?

374
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,600
 If this is true, am I really Park Do Ra? 

375
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,420
 Then, my grandma isn't my grandma? 

376
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,110
 If so, when I almost drowned two years ago, 

377
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,490
 was I switched with Grandma's granddaughter? 

378
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,890
 Was she confused because she has dementia? 

379
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,570
Grandma.

380
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,210
Oh, my! W-What...

381
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,800
What are you doing here without a call?

382
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,580
I came because I wanted to see you.

383
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,520
I suddenly craved your noodles so much.

384
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,940
I'm hungry, Grandma.

385
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,950
Really? Aigoo, my baby.

386
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,870
Wait just a moment.

387
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,030
I'll make you noodles real quick.

388
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:11,033
 Grandma and I look just like each other. 

389
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:14,783
 Why did it say I'm that lady's daughter? 

390
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:20,863
You said you're hungry. Why can't you eat?

391
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:25,133
You're usually crazy about my kalguksu.

392
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:28,313
Here. This is freshly made geotjeori.

393
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:32,613
Start digging in with some of this.

394
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:36,203
Here. Go on.

395
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:47,053
Your kalguksu is definitely the best.

396
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:49,663
The geotjeori is good, too.

397
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:58,923
By the way, why do you look so down?

398
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:03,883
Why do you look so sad and depressed?

399
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:07,643
Are you here because something happened?

400
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:12,633
I'm not sad or depressed at all.

401
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:15,333
I just wanted to see your face.

402
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:21,813
Did you come because you were worried about me, then?

403
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:25,603
I told you not to worry.

404
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:28,243
You can just call me if you're worried.

405
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:31,233
We can just talk on the phone.

406
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,743
Grandma,

407
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:42,533
how was I found two years ago again?

408
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:47,293
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

409
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,073
Just because.

410
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:56,993
I was harvesting clams with the neighbors

411
00:26:56,993 --> 00:27:00,123
and saw you fainted on a rock.

412
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:03,943
That's why I brought you back to life.

413
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:05,963
I was fainted on a rock?

414
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:07,533
Yes.

415
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:12,593
Some said you ran away because you didn't want to live in the countryside.

416
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:16,993
And some said you died in a city somewhere.

417
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:24,083
But I had a feeling you fell while you were walking by the sea.

418
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,893
And just as I suspected,

419
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:32,733
you got swept away by the waves and barely survived.

420
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:35,103
That's why my face changed, right?

421
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,933
And I lost my memory, too.

422
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,163
I'm telling you.

423
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:45,483
Aigoo, you didn't look like a human then.

424
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:49,453
I wasn't sure if you could make it.

425
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:55,703
By the way, why are you suddenly asking about that?

426
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:58,503
It's nothing. It's nothing.

427
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:03,613
I'm frustrated because I can't remember anything.

428
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:06,783
Not a lot, but just a little.

429
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:11,373
Ji Yeong, so what if you don't remember?

430
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:14,373
What matters is that you're alive like this.

431
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,263
Don't you think?

432
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:18,583
Eat.

433
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,863
Go ahead and eat.

434
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:24,263
Okay, I will.

435
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,823
Yes.

436
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,863
My life was ruined like this...

437
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:03,013
because of that Kim Ji Yeong.

438
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,973
That woman.

439
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:10,163
How dare she ruin me like this?

440
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,050
.

441
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:25,213
- My gosh. 
 - Aigoo.

442
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:27,023
What do you think? Doesn't it smell nice?

443
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:30,043
You have to take better care of yourself when you're tired.

444
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:33,423
I brought a set per person.

445
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:36,813
Spray this every day thinking of me.

446
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:43,673
We get to treat ourselves, thanks to you, Ma Ri.

447
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:46,613
My feet feel so nice and soft. Don't you think, Unni?

448
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:51,063
Yes, I know. Thank you, Ma Ri.

449
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:53,783
Don't mention it.

450
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:57,743
By the way, it's getting quite late.

451
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:59,763
Your parents must be worried.

452
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:04,543
They said I can hang out here until late today.

453
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:11,883
By the way, can I sleep over in Grandma's room tonight?

454
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:19,033
I'd like you to, but would your parents allow it?

455
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:23,903
Looks like your mom doesn't like you coming here.

456
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:26,713
She can't say anything even if I come here now.

457
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:31,193
And my dad lets me do anything I want.

458
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:33,413
Is it because this is Pil Sung's house?

459
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:35,993
I feel comfortable, as if I'm home.

460
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:39,183
You're way more fun than my family, too.

461
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:46,023
And I should keep Grandma entertained since we're friends.

462
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:49,423
Yes, thank you.

463
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:54,053
 Aigoo, why am I caring for a child at my age? 

464
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,113
 How long do I have to be friends with her? 

465
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,923
 She's been coming by too often. 

466
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:04,703
 I befriended her because I wanted her as my granddaughter-in-law before, 

467
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:07,893
 but what would be the point now? 

468
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:11,203
 Aigoo, why did she suddenly change her mind? 

469
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,763
 She wants Pil Sung as her brother instead of boyfriend? 

470
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:17,773
 Gosh, how annoying. 

471
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,943
 Kim Ji Yeong! 

472
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:22,483
 Kim Ji Yeong! Come out! 

473
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:23,803
 Kim Ji Yeong! 

474
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:27,283
- Hey, w-what's this noise? 
  - Kim Ji Yeong! 

475
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:30,423
That voice sounds familiar.

476
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,263
 Hey!  

477
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:35,683
 Hey! Kim Ji Yeong! 

478
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,433
  Kim Ji Yeong! 

479
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,403
Gosh, this is...

480
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,453
Who's this?

481
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:45,303
Who's this?

482
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,383
It's my uncle.

483
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:55,183
What's going on?

484
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,313
Hey, Kim Ji Yeong!

485
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:59,833
Come out!

486
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,593
Hey, can't you hear me?

487
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:04,973
Jin Dan, what are you doing here? What's going on?

488
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,573
Ahjumma.

489
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:09,613
Ahjumma, I...

490
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:12,663
I have a lot to say to Kim Ji Yeong.

491
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:16,233
But no matter how much I call her, she won't come out.

492
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,283
Ahjumma, you should call her for me.

493
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:20,413
Kim Ji Yeong!

494
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:25,423
Come out now, Kim Ji Yeong! Hey...

495
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:28,443
Jin Dan! She's not home yet.

496
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:31,203
So, go home now.

497
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:34,053
I'll get you a taxi. Let's go. Let's go.

498
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,893
No, no, no.

499
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:37,733
No, I said.

500
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:43,093
I'll never leave until I see Kim Ji Yeong today.

501
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,473
I'll never leave.

502
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:48,593
Get me a glass of water.

503
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,753
Gosh, hey! Leave now! Come to your senses!

504
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:54,093
I'm screwed now.

505
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:58,283
My life was ruined because of you.

506
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,083
What's with you?

507
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:06,163
How dare you ruin my life?

508
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:10,753
How dare you give me such a hard time?

509
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:16,283
Hey, be responsible for me.

510
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:19,983
Be responsible for me, Kim Ji Yeong!

511
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:25,053
Honey, isn't Ma Ri out too late?

512
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:29,193
She said she'd be home after congratulating them about Pil Sung. She'll be home soon.

513
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:32,473
I thought she didn't like their son anymore.

514
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:35,013
Why is she frequenting their place so much?

515
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,343
Is she hiding honey in their house or something?

516
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:40,593
She doesn't like him as a man but as an older brother.

517
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:43,513
They agreed to be like siblings now.

518
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,733
Gosh, they must be so tired of her.

519
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,613
She's bothering them too much.

520
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:52,533
Call her and tell her to come home. This isn't right.

521
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:56,313
- Okay. 
 - Speak of the devil.

522
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:57,873
Yes, Ma Ri.

523
00:33:57,873 --> 00:34:02,003
 Dad, I'm at Pil Sung's house, and it's a mess. A total mess. 

524
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,563
 I think you should come and take care of this. 

525
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:07,543
Ma Ri, what do you mean? A total mess?

526
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:09,223
 Come right now, I said. 

527
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:12,343
 Uncle came here drunk, and he's causing a scene. 

528
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:16,000
What? Jin Dan's there?

529
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,550
Jin Dan? What about him all of a sudden?

530
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:28,873
I think he's asleep.

531
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:30,573
He's really sleeping.

532
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:32,613
He's snoring, even.

533
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:38,763
Shouldn't we let him sleep inside, then?

534
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:41,193
Hyeon Cheol, carry him on your back.

535
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:44,163
Don't just stand around and do something.

536
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:47,623
How can I carry this tall man? Look how tall...

537
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:50,923
Myeong Dong, bring him a pillow.

538
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,553
A pillow? What for?

539
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:55,143
What if his face gets paralyzed sleeping like this?

540
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,133
We should at least give him a pillow.

541
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,783
Okay.

542
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:02,093
Dad! Dad! Over here. Over here.

543
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:04,973
Gosh, Jin Dan.

544
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:07,783
Why are you lying down here?

545
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:16,193
I'm sorry our family is causing you so much trouble again.

546
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:17,953
I'm so sorry.

547
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,743
Things like this could happen.

548
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,003
Get up. Get up right now.

549
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:26,113
What's wrong, Mom? Let me sleep.

550
00:35:26,113 --> 00:35:30,783
Get up right now. Wake up! Let's go home.

551
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,033
Mom.

552
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,373
I won't go.

553
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:37,023
I can't!

554
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:40,953
I won't leave until I see Kim Ji Yeong.

555
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:43,623
Gosh, you're crazy. You're crazy.

556
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:47,563
Gong Jin Dan, your brother's here, too. Get up.

557
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:53,203
H-Hyung.

558
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:02,873
You bastard.

559
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,953
Gosh, Jin Dan.

560
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:09,093
Mr. Kim, Mr. Oh, take him.

561
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,753
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Seon Yeong.

562
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,243
I'm sorry.

563
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:30,463
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause a scene.

564
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:34,413
I'll apologize for this properly some time.

565
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:37,283
Ma Ri, you should come, too.

566
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:39,423
Okay, Dad.

567
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,913
I'm sorry.

568
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:54,693
Let go! Let go, I said.

569
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:03,053
Mr. Kim, Mr. Oh, thank you.

570
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:15,693
You crazy bastard! You might as well die!

571
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:19,893
You and I should just die! Let's die!

572
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:24,953
Mom...

573
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:29,003
can't you just leave me alone?

574
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:32,183
Please let me...

575
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:34,443
Let me be alone.

576
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:38,283
Jin Dan, you're acting so strange.

577
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:40,583
Why are you doing this?

578
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:46,183
I could understand you if she were worth it at all.

579
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:48,113
But why her?

580
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:51,003
Why do you like someone like her?

581
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:56,143
Is there a reason you have to do this, by chance?

582
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:01,893
- Mom. 
 - Yes, Jin Dan.

583
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:04,343
Tell me everything.

584
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,743
Ji Yeong...

585
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:11,703
looks like Do Ra.

586
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:16,433
W-What did you say? She looks like who?

587
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:21,463
Ji Yeong reminds me of Do Ra.

588
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:23,953
So I keep wanting to see her.

589
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:29,273
I want to be with her instead of Do Ra.

590
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:32,693
Do Ra!

591
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:35,743
Do Ra...

592
00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:37,763
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:40,483
Come back, Do Ra. I'm sorry.

594
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:43,283
Gosh, what do I do with him?

595
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:45,363
What do I do?

596
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:47,933
Geez!

597
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,733
Crazy bastard.

598
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:52,973
Crazy bastard. Crazy bastard.

599
00:38:54,963 --> 00:39:00,303
   

600
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:15,983
   

601
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:21,993
What... is this?

602
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:27,493
How could this be?

603
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:34,453
My grandma really isn't my grandma?

604
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:38,513
If so...

605
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:43,463
Am I really Park Do Ra?

606
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:49,433
What am I supposed to do now?

607
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:57,143
Is she really not my grandma?

608
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,100
Your smell.

609
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:22,846
I love you so much, Grandma.

610
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:27,366
Gosh, let me go. Let me go.

611
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:37,176
So... why did you come here this time?

612
00:40:37,946 --> 00:40:39,996
Something is going on, isn't there?

613
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:43,216
What trouble did you cause?

614
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:46,146
Be honest with me.

615
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:52,356
I came by because I was free and wanted to sleep with you.

616
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:56,676
Should I not come even if I miss you from now on?

617
00:40:56,676 --> 00:40:59,816
- Do you mean it? 
 - Of course, I mean it.

618
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:04,606
Gosh, Ji Yeong. What did I tell you?

619
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:09,126
I told you not to worry about me and get some sleep if you have time.

620
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:11,336
Sleep is medicine.

621
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:14,516
Stop coming here tiring yourself out.

622
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:18,356
I need to see you to feel energized.

623
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:22,506
You're my favorite person in the world.

624
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:28,006
Yes.

625
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:30,716
Yes, my baby.

626
00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:34,316
My Ji Yeong.

627
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:39,486
I love you the most, too.

628
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:55,116
 The phone is powered off. You'll be connected... 

629
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:58,136
- Is she not answering? 
 - Her phone is still off.

630
00:41:58,136 --> 00:42:00,676
She really must be in shock.

631
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:03,186
Do Sik, what do I do with her?

632
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:06,746
Mom, she's been living as Kim Ji Yeong,

633
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:08,956
but you and I suddenly showed up and said she was Park Do Ra.

634
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:11,946
How could she not be in shock?

635
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,836
She probably needs some time to think about it.

636
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,846
It's hard to believe it, I'm sure.

637
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:20,326
Even we feel so confused now.

638
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:25,256
So, let's wait until she calls you first.

639
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:30,076
Okay. That's why I'm desperately waiting for her to call.

640
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:33,496
But I'm about to go crazy just waiting like this.

641
00:42:33,496 --> 00:42:36,276
How did her face change so much?

642
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:38,206
She doesn't recognize me and you, her mother and brother.

643
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,926
Did she have memory loss? What happened to her?

644
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,226
I'm about to go crazy right now.

645
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:47,306
And I need to get her out of that house somehow.

646
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:49,426
But why can't I reach her? Why?

647
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:52,786
I just told you to give her time. Let's just wait.

648
00:42:52,786 --> 00:42:54,256
We found Do Ra.

649
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:57,066
We know where she is now.

650
00:42:59,636 --> 00:43:01,216
Okay.

651
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:04,096
I'll wait another day.

652
00:43:09,976 --> 00:43:12,696
Mom, I'll step out for a second.

653
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:14,076
Where are you going?

654
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:17,196
I'll run some errands...

655
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:19,416
and do some research on Kim Ji Yeong, too.

656
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:22,666
- But where? 
 - Geez, whatever.

657
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,466
My gosh.

658
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:27,016
Aigoo...

659
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:36,836
I thought winning the screenwriting competition would mean I'd become a star writer.

660
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:39,956
But I keep getting rejected over and over again.

661
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:43,716
It's not as easy as I thought.

662
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:48,286
So I felt so frustrated and hopeless,

663
00:43:50,386 --> 00:43:54,736
but seeing your face makes me feel alive.

664
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:56,816
That's good to hear.

665
00:43:56,816 --> 00:44:04,016
Well... by the way, I heard your tenant is an actor now.

666
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,426
Oh, Kim Ji Yeong?

667
00:44:07,426 --> 00:44:11,196
Why are you asking about her, by the way?

668
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:16,496
I ran into her in front of a convenience store recently.

669
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:20,036
She seemed so pure and nice.

670
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:24,986
Right? Doesn't she?

671
00:44:24,986 --> 00:44:28,006
That's why I used to have a great impression of her.

672
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:30,806
But that was all an act. An act.

673
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:33,856
An act? What do you mean?

674
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:37,536
Actually, Pil Sung is dating Ji Yeong right now.

675
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:40,826
So, my family is opposing them really strongly,

676
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:45,806
but it turns out... she seduced an engaged man.

677
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:47,706
Things are even worse now.

678
00:44:47,706 --> 00:44:51,276
So, you mean your tenant was two-timing?

679
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:56,066
Yes. So, that man's mom barged into our house,

680
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:58,936
grabbed Ji Yeong by her hair.

681
00:44:58,936 --> 00:45:01,976
And yesterday, that man came by completely drunk

682
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:05,636
and demanded to see Kim Ji Yeong and made a scene.

683
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:09,746
So, my family is freaking out right now.

684
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:13,496
We're trying to figure out how to kick her out.

685
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:16,266
- Are you serious? 
 - I'm telling you.

686
00:45:16,266 --> 00:45:21,656
She looks so innocent, but she wasn't just switching men, but two-timing.

687
00:45:21,656 --> 00:45:24,356
My family calls her a gold digger now. A gold digger.

688
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:26,666
- Myeong Dong. 
 - Yes?

689
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:30,646
How could you judge someone so harshly?

690
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:35,096
Have you always been like this? I'm very disappointed in you today.

691
00:45:35,096 --> 00:45:37,266
I'll get going now.

692
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:43,196
What's wrong with him?

693
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:45,986
What did I say, exactly?

694
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:51,076
Gosh, is it because I said something about Ji Yeong?

695
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:55,326
What's his relationship with her, exactly?

696
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:03,316
What did you say? Do Ra is dating Pil Sung right now?

697
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:04,716
I'm telling you.

698
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:06,596
That's why they are treating her poorly.

699
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:08,586
What are we supposed to do with her?

700
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:13,256
Gosh. How did she end up with Pil Sung, by the way?

701
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:18,276
Maybe he knew she was Do Ra and put her in that house.

702
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,396
Gosh, if that were true...

703
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:23,556
Gosh, I'm getting the chills. What's his intention?

704
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:25,686
This isn't good, Do Sik. Let's bring her back.

705
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:28,936
How dare they treat her poorly? Let's go.

706
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,226
Yes, let's go get her right now.

707
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:32,776
Let's.

708
00:46:34,116 --> 00:46:37,606
   

709
00:46:54,976 --> 00:46:56,696
Why are you here?

710
00:46:57,486 --> 00:47:00,196
Hyungnim, I'm sorry.

711
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:04,176
I made a mistake because I got so drunk last night.

712
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:09,096
I don't care what kind of woman you date.

713
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:12,046
But you keep switching women all the time.

714
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:14,706
What kind of thing is that to do?

715
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:19,396
Break up with Tae Hee and date the country lady if you like her.

716
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:23,726
Or break up with the country lady if you want to date Tae Hee.

717
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:25,970
You won't do one or the other.

718
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:30,906
What are you doing with two women right now?

719
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:36,006
I'm sorry, Hyung. That won't happen again.

720
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:39,196
I've come to my senses.

721
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:46,616
Your mother gets criticized if you behave that way. Don't you know?

722
00:47:51,446 --> 00:47:53,396
You can leave.

723
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,600
Okay.

724
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,060
   

725
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:14,036
Aigoo, how nice.

726
00:48:14,036 --> 00:48:16,066
The whole house smells like cooking oil.

727
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,866
It feels like we're having a party.

728
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:19,726
Mother, please flip the pancakes for me.

729
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:21,916
Okay, I will.

730
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:24,816
Pil Sung is coming in the afternoon, right?

731
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:26,226
Yes.

732
00:48:26,226 --> 00:48:30,936
We can't just do nothing when he won a huge award.

733
00:48:30,936 --> 00:48:33,876
Might as well make some kimchi stew, too.

734
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:36,916
He must've only had rich food there.

735
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,536
Okay, okay. I will.

736
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:43,196
 Is anyone in there? Hello? 

737
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:45,926
Who's this?

738
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:49,416
- Aigoo.
 - Whoa, what's...

739
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:52,056
What's all this, by the way?

740
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:54,536
Chairman sent them.

741
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:58,426
- Gosh, thank you. 
 - Thank you. Bye.

742
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:00,566
- Thank you. 
 - Seon Yeong.

743
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:04,846
Well, the Chairman sent all this.

744
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:08,896
- I know. Why so much? 
 - Wow.

745
00:49:08,896 --> 00:49:11,026
Hold on.

746
00:49:11,026 --> 00:49:12,806
Who's this?

747
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:14,706
I don't recognize the number.

748
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:16,606
Hello?

749
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:20,056
 Hello? This is Chairman Gong Jin Taek. 

750
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:23,506
Gosh, C-Chairman. Hello, hello.

751
00:49:23,506 --> 00:49:27,216
I sent some things through my driver. Did you receive them?

752
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:29,126
Yes, we just received them.

753
00:49:29,126 --> 00:49:32,426
Why did you send so many things?

754
00:49:32,426 --> 00:49:36,216
Not at all. It's nothing compared to how grateful I feel.

755
00:49:36,216 --> 00:49:38,666
We've been inconveniencing you so much.

756
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:44,366
I'm sorry my family is always causing you trouble, including my brother.

757
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:47,846
No, not at all. We're okay.

758
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:50,346
Thank you so much for being understanding.

759
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:52,136
I'll see you next time, then.

760
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:55,356
Yes, Chairman. Take care. Bye.

761
00:49:55,356 --> 00:49:57,556
Hey, was it Chairman?

762
00:49:57,556 --> 00:50:00,256
Why did he send all this?

763
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:04,396
He must've felt bad because of his brother.

764
00:50:04,396 --> 00:50:06,966
I'm sure he does. Aigoo!

765
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:09,386
He must've been really embarrassed.

766
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,996
By the way, he's so thoughtful.

767
00:50:11,996 --> 00:50:15,196
Look at the cosmetics bags. He sent one for each person.

768
00:50:15,196 --> 00:50:18,406
He's so generous since he's a chairman.

769
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:21,186
I know.

770
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,816
I'll get going now, then.

771
00:50:22,816 --> 00:50:25,106
- See you. 
 - See you.

772
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:28,386
- By the way, Seon Yeong. 
 - Yes?

773
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:31,436
Pil Sung is arriving in a few hours.

774
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:33,306
What do we do with our tenant?

775
00:50:33,306 --> 00:50:36,186
Why is she still here and not moving out?

776
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:39,476
I know. What do we do?

777
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,336
It's not like we can force her out.

778
00:50:42,336 --> 00:50:45,706
Gosh, how upsetting.

779
00:51:04,756 --> 00:51:06,716
Who's there?

780
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:20,606
Miss, you said you'd move out. Why are you still here?

781
00:51:20,606 --> 00:51:24,906
Are you planning to stay until Pil Sung comes back?

782
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:27,766
Will you hide behind his back again?

783
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:30,676
No, it's not that.

784
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:33,166
Something came up recently.

785
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:35,446
What do you mean, something came up?

786
00:51:35,446 --> 00:51:38,396
My daughter-in-law sent you the security deposit since you said you'd move out.

787
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,156
Why aren't you moving out?

788
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:44,096
Look, miss. Even if you try to drag your feet,

789
00:51:44,096 --> 00:51:46,456
there's no way we'd approve you.

790
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:51,016
And since we're on the topic, you can't do this if you have any conscience.

791
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:53,286
You got caught two-timing with another man.

792
00:51:53,286 --> 00:51:58,436
We even saw his mom grabbing your hair here.

793
00:51:58,436 --> 00:52:02,716
How could you audition for Pil Sung's drama after that?

794
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:06,926
I couldn't do what you did if I were you!

795
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:10,896
Grandmother, there's nothing going on between CEO Gong and me.

796
00:52:10,896 --> 00:52:12,956
I really did nothing wrong.

797
00:52:12,956 --> 00:52:16,746
I didn't do anything to be ashamed of.

798
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:19,796
Aigoo, look how shameless you are.

799
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:21,536
Nothing's going on?

800
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:27,116
If so, why would CEO Gong get drunk at night, lie down in our front yard,

801
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:32,696
and scream your name demanding you to be responsible for him?

802
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:34,236
CEO Gong did that?

803
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:38,346
Yes! He caused a huge scene last night.

804
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:43,516
You got caught now. This is for the better.

805
00:52:43,516 --> 00:52:48,186
He apparently can't live without you. So choose him instead.

806
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:50,336
His family is much better off than us.

807
00:52:50,336 --> 00:52:53,786
You'd be all set if you joined his family.

808
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:59,256
So stop switching between two men and leave!

809
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:04,066
Grandmother, I said it's not true. Why don't you believe me?

810
00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:06,256
You're taking it too far.

811
00:53:06,256 --> 00:53:09,226
I know Pil Sung is a precious grandson to you,

812
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:13,406
but I'm also a precious granddaughter to my grandmother, too.

813
00:53:13,406 --> 00:53:17,696
My grandmother would shed bloody tears if she found out you treat me like this.

814
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:19,386
That's why I'm telling you to leave!

815
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:21,256
Before I say all this stuff to you!

816
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:24,786
We wouldn't have to have this talk if you just left!

817
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,746
Fine, I'll leave.

818
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,566
I'll leave, I said!

819
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:30,146
Don't just say it!

820
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:33,296
Move out right now before Pil Sung comes back!

821
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:35,916
And you don't have to say goodbye to us.

822
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,786
None of us want to see you. Just leave. Leave!

823
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:41,756
Okay, fine. I'll move out now.

824
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:45,056
- Let go. 
 - Leave now.

825
00:53:57,036 --> 00:53:59,546
Aigoo, my goodness.

826
00:53:59,546 --> 00:54:03,436
Aigoo, she pretended like she was innocent.

827
00:54:03,436 --> 00:54:07,076
Look how bad her temper is.

828
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:09,976
How dare she scream at her elder?

829
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:13,436
She's so harsh and ignorant.

830
00:54:13,436 --> 00:54:17,586
Mother, were you at the rental unit just now?

831
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:23,896
Yes, I told her to move out now before Pil Sung comes back.

832
00:54:23,896 --> 00:54:26,706
And she said she'll move out right now.

833
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:28,686
Really?

834
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,246
Do Ra.

835
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:40,946
Why are you crying?

836
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:45,066
I heard they treat you poorly. Did they berate you again?

837
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:48,586
You've got to be kidding right now!

838
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:51,986
Mom, calm down. That's not important now.

839
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:57,366
Do Ra, come with me. Come with me.

840
00:54:57,366 --> 00:55:03,826
I don't know how you ended up this way, but you're my daughter, and I'm your mom.

841
00:55:03,826 --> 00:55:06,906
So, let's start living together now.

842
00:55:06,906 --> 00:55:10,886
Why do we have to be separated now that you've come back alive?

843
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:14,106
I can't leave you alone, Do Ra.

844
00:55:15,006 --> 00:55:17,386
Ahjumma...

845
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:23,566
are you really sure you're my mom?

846
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:27,126
Yes, I'm your mom.

847
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:28,806
We took the DNA test together.

848
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:31,496
You checked the result yourself.

849
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:34,246
Do Ra, you are our Do Ra.

850
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:36,526
I recognized you the moment I first saw you.

851
00:55:36,526 --> 00:55:39,566
Why are you here like this when you have Mom and me?

852
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:41,386
Let's go, okay?

853
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:44,986
I'll protect you. I'll be by your side.

854
00:55:44,986 --> 00:55:47,456
Let's go. Let's go.

855
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:51,516
Let's go! Let's go.

856
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:59,096
Come in. Come in. This is our place.

857
00:55:59,096 --> 00:56:00,806
Come on in.

858
00:56:03,546 --> 00:56:05,736
Have a seat, Do Ra.

859
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:12,106
Is this where you and Oppa live?

860
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:14,056
It's kind of shabby, right?

861
00:56:14,056 --> 00:56:16,796
I'm sorry I'm so incompetent.

862
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:22,126
We went bankrupt after you died. That's why.

863
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:28,386
You don't remember, but we used to live in a 100-pyeong apartment in Cheongdam before you died.

864
00:56:32,186 --> 00:56:34,016
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

865
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:38,056
I did the wrong thing. Please forgive me.

866
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:47,666
I invested the money you made,

867
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,796
but I got scammed.

868
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:56,356
I felt so bad, so I tried to fix it without you knowing, but I met the wrong person.

869
00:56:56,356 --> 00:56:58,576
So, I started gambling.

870
00:56:58,576 --> 00:57:03,996
I ended up getting addicted, so I took out a private loan, and lost all of our assets.

871
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:09,236
That's why... we went bankrupt like this. Because of me.

872
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:13,706
But Do Ra, when you died, I wanted to die, too.

873
00:57:13,706 --> 00:57:17,666
So, I went to the seaside where you died multiple times, but...

874
00:57:18,326 --> 00:57:20,996
how could I die leaving Do Sik and Do Jun behind?

875
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:23,076
What would happen to our family if I died, too?

876
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:27,726
So, I couldn't die and was forced to stay alive.

877
00:57:27,726 --> 00:57:32,276
Do Ra, I'll make it up to you...

878
00:57:33,206 --> 00:57:36,306
for how I wronged you for the rest of my life.

879
00:57:37,186 --> 00:57:41,516
Do Ra, look at the photo behind you. That's you.

880
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:47,846
You're all we've thought about ever since you died.

881
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:51,280
We never forgot about you, even for a day.

882
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:59,770


883
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,886
Do Ra...

884
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:05,056
I'm glad you moved out of that house.

885
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:09,246
You can't live in that house. They're our enemies.

886
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:14,036
By the way, how did you end up living in the enemy's house?

887
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:17,166
No, it's so obvious.

888
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:20,716
Pil Sung must've dragged you in, right? That bastard.

889
00:58:20,716 --> 00:58:25,136
He's a total bastard who ruined your life.

890
00:58:25,136 --> 00:58:27,026
What do you mean by that?

891
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:29,576
What makes him a bastard?

892
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:32,496
You ended up dying because of him.

893
00:58:32,496 --> 00:58:34,796
You wouldn't have died if you didn't meet him.

894
00:58:34,796 --> 00:58:37,586
And we wouldn't have gone bankrupt like this.

895
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:40,966
What did he do, exactly?

896
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:47,396
Do Ra, you were supposed to marry someone else.

897
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:51,116
But Go Pil Sung butted in, and your engagement broke off, your ad deals got canceled

898
00:58:51,116 --> 00:58:53,826
and we ended up going bankrupt like this.

899
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:57,046
It's because of him. Because of Go Pil Sung.

900
00:58:57,046 --> 00:59:00,566
I saw articles on Park Do Ra, too.

901
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:06,306
It said she died because of the... gambling debt and prostitution.

902
00:59:06,306 --> 00:59:08,826
Gosh, that's just an article.

903
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:12,696
What do people know? We knew what happened.

904
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:15,576
Gambling debt? You could've worked hard and paid it off.

905
00:59:15,576 --> 00:59:18,209
But Go Pil Sung interfered.

906
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,230
If it wasn't for Go Pil Sung, you would've gotten married and lived well as a top celebrity.

907
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,710
You would've lived in a lap of luxury.

908
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:26,910
There's no way.

909
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,470
Gosh, I knew it.

910
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:32,440
How did he brainwash you, exactly?

911
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,690
Do Ra, listen to me carefully.

912
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,420
Go Pil Sung definitely knew you were Park Do Ra.

913
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,880
He kept you in that house so we don't reunite.

914
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,690
We fought grabbing each other's hair, but he didn't say a word. Remember?

915
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,540
That's how scary he is.

916
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,900
He's a bastard who separated a mother and daughter.

917
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,010
No, Director isn't that kind of a person.

918
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:00,568
Seriously.

919
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,360
This is how clueless she is about him.

920
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,100
If so, you should go and check yourself.

921
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,370
See if he knew you were Park Do Ra or not.

922
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,020
No, he must've not known.

923
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,310
If he did, he wouldn't have separated us like that.

924
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,210
A mother and daughter were fighting in front of him without recognizing each other.

925
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:26,280
How could he just let it happen?

926
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,340
The Director isn't that kind of a person. He definitely isn't!

927
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:38,478
   

928
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,150
Thank you.

929
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,650
- That's heavy. 
 - Don't mention it.

930
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,310
Pil Sung, we had too much rich food.

931
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,160
Let's get kimchi stew and soju.

932
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,570
- Sounds good.
 - I'd love that.

933
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,530
Hyung, Station Director, and Writer, I'm sorry.

934
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,490
I need to hurry back home.

935
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:04,090
Let's have kimchi stew and soju later. Thank you so much.

936
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,070
Hey, hey...

937
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,780
What's with him? He's no fun.

938
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,120
Is he hiding a secret wife at his house?

939
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,000
What's the deal? He's making a widower feel lonely.

940
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,110
I know. Is he hiding a pot of honey at home?

941
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:20,010
Station Director and Writer, let's have soju by ourselves. My treat!

942
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,400
- Sounds good! 
 - Sounds good!

943
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,390
Let's go! Let's go!

944
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,050
What's good in this neighborhood?

945
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:31,600
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

946
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,970
Why can't I reach Ji Yeong?

947
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:36,510
She hasn't responded to my texts since yesterday.

948
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,580
Maybe something's going on.

949
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,670
 Ji Yeong. 

950
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,610
 Ji Yeong! 

951
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,560
Ji—

952
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,700
Ji Yeong.

953
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,120
What?

954
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,860
What happened to her room?

955
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,920
Why is it empty?

956
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,520
Did she move out?

957
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:22,280
But Pil Sung would flip out if he found out Ji Yeong moved out.

958
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,880
Shouldn't we tell him when he comes?

959
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,500
Tell him after the meal.

960
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,630
He won't eat if you tell him before we eat.

961
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,440
Why did you kick her out?

962
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,840
You should've done that after Pil Sung came back.

963
01:02:40,982 --> 01:02:41,942
He's here.

964
01:02:41,942 --> 01:02:46,482
- Pil Sung, you're home. 
 - Mom, Grandma, why is Ji Yeong's place empty?

965
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:48,132
By chance...

966
01:02:48,672 --> 01:02:51,142
you didn't kick her out, did you?

967
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,842
What do you mean, kick her out?

968
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:55,402
She left because she felt guilty.

969
01:02:55,402 --> 01:02:57,612
Guilty about what?

970
01:02:57,612 --> 01:03:00,082
Did you say something to her again?

971
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:04,522
What do you mean? I didn't say anything.

972
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:09,112
CEO Gong showed up drunk a few days ago

973
01:03:09,112 --> 01:03:14,602
and screamed at the top of his lungs demanding her to be responsible for him. You have no idea.

974
01:03:14,602 --> 01:03:20,752
Gosh, it was so humiliating. I can't see my neighbors anymore.

975
01:03:20,752 --> 01:03:22,272
CEO Gong came by again?

976
01:03:22,272 --> 01:03:23,772
Yes.

977
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:29,782
Even Ma Ri's dad, Chairman Gong, came here and took him home.

978
01:03:29,782 --> 01:03:34,342
So, I did say something to her.

979
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:36,862
Things became such a mess.

980
01:03:36,862 --> 01:03:40,482
I'm allowed to say something as an elder.

981
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,292
Grandma!

982
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:45,872
Go Pil Sung, how could you be like this?

983
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:49,672
We made pancakes, japchae, and galbijjim to welcome you back.

984
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:52,712
We've been cooking since this morning to make your favorite dishes.

985
01:03:52,712 --> 01:03:55,132
But you only care about Ji Yeong leaving right now?

986
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:56,802
Don't you care about us?

987
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:59,022
Yes, Pil Sung. Have a seat for now.

988
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:01,402
Let's eat and talk later, okay?

989
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:04,562
Father, when did Ji Yeong leave?

990
01:04:08,172 --> 01:04:12,312
 Director... we need to talk. 

991
01:04:14,222 --> 01:04:16,232
Hey, Pil Sung.

992
01:04:16,882 --> 01:04:18,952
What's wrong with him?

993
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:24,312
Aigoo, aigoo, agioo! Crazy bastard. Crazy bastard.

994
01:04:24,312 --> 01:04:29,272
Gosh, how could he be that crazy about a woman?

995
01:04:35,762 --> 01:04:37,452
Ji Yeong!

996
01:04:40,362 --> 01:04:43,302
What happened? Why couldn't I get a hold of you?

997
01:04:43,302 --> 01:04:45,102
Did something happen?

998
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:48,082
Why did you move out without telling me?

999
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:50,672
Is it because of my mom and grandma?

1000
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:59,252
Director, there's something I want to ask you about.

1001
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:05,352
What is it? Ask me anything.

1002
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:10,022
Director, am I Park Do Ra?

1003
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:17,072
♫  Does love even exist?  ♫

1004
01:05:17,072 --> 01:05:19,162
♫  I gave my whole heart  ♫

1005
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:20,722
What?

1006
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:27,452
Did you also know I was Park Do Ra by chance?

1007
01:05:27,452 --> 01:05:29,072
Ji...

1008
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,502
Ji Yeong.

1009
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:41,792
♫  Because I missed you  ♫

1010
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:44,662
   

1011
01:05:45,522 --> 01:05:52,142
♫  I hurt multiple times a day  ♫

1012
01:05:52,142 --> 01:05:59,312
♫  My bruised heart is filled with you  ♫

1013
01:05:59,312 --> 01:06:06,952
♫  I can't do anything else  ♫

1014
01:06:06,952 --> 01:06:11,982
♫  Love is so difficult, so difficult  ♫

1015
01:06:11,982 --> 01:06:16,082
♫  It's so tough  ♫

1016
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:19,102
 What? Why is Kim Ji Yeong going to Go Go Entertainment? 

1017
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:21,072
 Did he get them to hire his girlfriend? 

1018
01:06:21,072 --> 01:06:24,342
 What's Go Pil Sung doing? How unbelievable. 

1019
01:06:24,342 --> 01:06:28,872
 The investor found out about Kim Ji Yeong and you and wants his money back. 

1020
01:06:28,872 --> 01:06:30,732
 We'll have to replace Kim Ji Yeong. 

1021
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:32,842
 Kim Ji Yeong and I broke up. 

1022
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:37,182
 Forget about him. Just count on me and live happily. 

1023
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:40,552
 Was I wrong to want Do Ra to live as Kim Ji Yeong? 

1024
01:06:40,552 --> 01:06:43,902
 Did I really try to control Ji Yeong's life? 

1025
01:06:43,902 --> 01:06:46,382
 I can't forgive you, Director. 

1026
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:49,582
 Don't call me. We're finished.
