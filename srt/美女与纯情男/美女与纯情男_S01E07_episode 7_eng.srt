1
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,380
But it's so hard for me to humor her, too. 
    

2
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,660
I could see why people call her "Bbakdora." 
  (T/N: Bbakdora - means to go nuts) 

3
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,270
She drives me nuts 12 times a day!

4
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:05,690


5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,230
M-Ms...

6
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,240
Ms. Park Do Ra.

7
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,660
What happened?

8
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,920
Why is Park Do Ra here?

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,180
What do I do?

10
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,530
Geez, you've got to be kidding me.

11
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,440
- Hey, do you think...
  - Excuse me! 

12
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,580
Is Park Do Ra a ghost? Why would she come out of there?

13
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,870
What do you mean, she's here? Come on...

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,830
Ms. Park, hold on.

15
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,380
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

16
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,440
Jae Dong, hold on.

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,160
Jae Dong! Jae Dong, hold on.

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,950
Ms. Park!

19
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,210
Stop!

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,900
Why is he following us? He's got nothing to say after that.

21
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,360
What should I do, Noona? Should I stop the car?

22
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
 - Ms. Park!  
 - Just go.

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,620
- Okay, Noona.
  - Stop! 

24
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,060
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

25
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,410
 - The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...  
 - What do I do now?

26
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,790
What am I going to do now?

27
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,510
You crazy bastard.

28
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,750
 Hyung! Hyung, do you think I wanted to do that? 

29
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,190
 I didn't want you to suffer. You'll suffer less if I humor her. 

30
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,490
  That's why... But it's so hard for me to humor her, too. 

31
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,050
 I could see why people call her "Bbakdora." 

32
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,440
 She drives me nuts 12 times a day! 

33
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,000
Why did you do that? Why?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,470
Why did you do that, you crazy bastard!

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,090
What will I do now? What will I do now?

36
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,160
What will I do now?!

37
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,160
Gosh, Honey, what's wrong with Pil Sung?

38
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,740
Leave him alone. Just pretend you didn't hear it.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,610
Gosh, something must've happened at his work.

40
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,650
Did he make a serious mistake?

41
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,650
Did he get scolded by his superior?

42
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,310
Or is someone bullying him by chance?

43
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,970
It's not that easy to manage a professional life.

44
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,450
You're supposed to experience and endure all sorts of things.

45
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,940
Since he's the youngest assistant director,

46
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,970
he has to worry about the director and actors.

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,670
He won't tell us, but I'm sure he's suffering a lot.

48
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,890
He isn't the only one who suffers.

49
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,000
And he won't always be the youngest one, either.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,860
He'll no longer be the youngest once he's through this.

51
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,520
Geez, how fussy...

52
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,930
Gosh, I'm so upset.

53
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,090
It's not like I could do his job for him.

54
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,740
Joo Hee, are you getting married?

55
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,250
Yes, so stop having feelings for me, and don't contact me.

56
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,000
It'd be bad if my honey found out.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,880
Did you cheat on me when we were together?

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,450
What do you mean, cheat?

59
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,050
You pursued me without my consent.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,050
Why couldn't it be me?

61
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,440
When I proposed to you, you said you didn't want to get married.

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,050
But how could you suddenly get married like this?

63
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,350
Why are you marrying him but not me?

64
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,430
Oppa, he's capable of realizing my dream.

65
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,000
We decided to study abroad together.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,720
I can study abroad, too. My brother is studying in the US.

67
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Joo Hee, why don't you just go with me?

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Are you crazy? He's two years older than me.

69
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,760
You're eight years older than me.

70
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,480
Oppa, please stop being clingy.

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,380
Be well.

72
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,290
Joo Hee, well...

73
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,290
The night breeze is nice.

74
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,440
 Gosh, my goodness. 

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,330
 This sounds just like a romantic comedy. 

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,450
 You and I seem to have something in common. 

77
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,200
 Let's meet every Wednesday. 

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,950
 Friends... 

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,300
 - Okay. 
 - A red rose on Wednesdays! 

80
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,210
Gosh, am I already drunk?

81
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,110
Or am I crazy?

82
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,220
Why am I thinking of that bastard who dumped me, calling it a mistake?

83
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,840
Instead of hating him,

84
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,880
I keep missing him for some reason.

85
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,460
Why?

86
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,840
You little bitch!

87
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,790
How could you destroy my pure heart like that?

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,560
Why? Why him, but not me?

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,640
My gosh.

90
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,880
He must be heartbroken, too.

91
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,800
Fine, leave.

92
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,230
Leave.

93
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,270
He must be hurting a lot.

94
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,260
Geez. What's wrong with him?

95
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,600
Is he trying to die?

96
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,680
No, no!

97
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,030
No!

98
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,080
Hey! Stop!

99
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,210
Hold on!

100
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,960
You can't do that.

101
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,800
L-Look who's here.

102
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,740
What are you doing here right now?

103
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,530
What's wrong?

104
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,110
Joo Hee.

105
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,380
I knew you'd come.

106
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,290
Don't go anywhere anymore.

107
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,430
Stay by my side.

108
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,520
Yes.

109
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,560
I'll be by your side.

110
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,410
   

111
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,730
 What happened? 

112
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,840
 This woman again? Why? Why on earth? 

113
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,840
 Do Sik, why do you live like this? 

114
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,800
 No, now is not the time for this. I need to leave before she wakes up. 

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,050
Gosh, is she out of her mind?

116
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,260
What? Are you running away again?

117
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,420
What are you doing? Let go of me first.

118
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,910
Are you crazy? A psycho?

119
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,980
Why did you tie my ankle with a tie?

120
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,290
I knew you'd be like this again.

121
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,510
The first time might've been a mistake, but not the second time.

122
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,470
Why? Will you call it a mistake again?

123
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,070
Noonim,

124
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me once.

125
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,280
Looks like I made a mistake with you again last night.

126
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,250
I don't remember what happened and why I'm here at all.

127
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,620
Last night, I drank a lot for a personal reason.

128
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,740
I must've been out of my mind.

129
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,940
I don't know what mistake I made with you while drunk,

130
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,190
but please let me go.

131
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,130
Please let me go. Please?

132
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,210
Why are you doing this to me?

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,730
Fine. I don't like you anymore, either.

134
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,680
Leave. Leave, I said!

135
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,480
It's my fault for falling for a bastard like him.

136
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,420
Let's forget him. Let's.

137
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,450
Yes, I should erase a bastard like him from my memory.

138
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,320
Erase. Erase.

139
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
Chairman Gong, Jin Dan, have a good day at work as always.

140
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,330
Have a good day.

141
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,070
- I'll be back, Auntie. 
 - Okay.

142
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,820
Mother.

143
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,210
O-Okay. Bye, Chairman Gong.

144
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,740
Have a good day, Jin Dan.

145
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,940
   

146
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,340
 Yes, Mother. 

147
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,180
Jin Dan, Jin Dan, you heard that earlier, right?

148
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,260
Your brother called me "Mother."

149
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,850
Of course, I did. I was right there.

150
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,820
Jin Dan, I'm so happy that my heart is about to explode.

151
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,850
I know. I can't believe he called you "Mother."

152
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,940
Mom, Mom, Mom. I felt weird and emotional earlier, too.

153
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,900
I think it was worth enduring all this time.

154
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,460
It feels like I've been hiding in the shadows and finally come out in the sun.

155
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,040
Anyway, I'm so happy.

156
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,650
I'm happy that you're happy.

157
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,940
 By the way, Son, 

158
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,020
why is your sister-in-law like that?

159
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,220
She's still refusing to call me "Mother." I hate her so much.

160
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,560
Mom, I'm sure she will eventually.

161
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,040
Hyung calls you "Mother." What can she do?

162
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,760
So, don't have a fight with her for no reason, okay?

163
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,170
 Okay, Son. 

164
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,090
Son, have a good day today, too.

165
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,210
Gosh, are you going somewhere?

166
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,760
Yes, I'll step out for a moment.

167
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,350
What did you say?

168
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,130
"I'll step out for a moment"?

169
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,060
Daughter-in-law, did you talk casually to me just now?

170
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,860
I'll be right back. I have an errand to run.

171
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,260
Daughter-in-law, why are you leaving out the word "Mother"?

172
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,420
Your husband, Chairman Gong, calls me "Mother" politely, too.

173
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,730
Why do you leave it out?

174
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,350
Would it hurt you to call me that?

175
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,640
Would your mouth bleed or something?

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,100
Gosh, okay. Mother, Mother, Mother.

177
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,110
I'll be right back, Mother, Mother, Mother.

178
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,080
Are you happy now?

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,630
My gosh, my gosh. What's with her?

180
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,030
Is she trying to shut me up?

181
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,230
That's how much she doesn't want to acknowledge me as her mother?

182
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,490
Is that so? Just wait and see.

183
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,470
I'll finally teach her a lesson somehow.

184
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,990
I won't tolerate that little brat.

185
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,300
 Why is the Second Grandma doing that to my mom?  
  (T/N: Second - mistress) 

186
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,610
 I won't tolerate her. 

187
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,960
Ms. Park, did you see my text?

188
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,940
I texted you because you didn't answer my call.

189
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,060
You must be very upset because of me.

190
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,680
I hate to see your face. Get out of the way.

191
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I have nothing to say even if I had ten or a hundred mouths.

192
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,880
But I didn't say that because I really hate you or you drove me crazy.

193
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,740
Because you and Mr. Cha don't get along,

194
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,470
the shooting kept getting canceled, and the schedule got messed up.

195
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,350
I just wanted to finish shooting this project without problems—

196
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,190
Is that why you kept switching sides

197
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,840
here and there and acted like a scoundrel?

198
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,940
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,890
So, you do know you acted like a scoundrel.

200
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,150
Yes.

201
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,690
But I did all that only for this project—

202
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,440
What did you say?

203
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,160
You did it for this project?

204
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,340
What kind of scoundrel are you?

205
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,250
I can't work in the same set with a scoundrel like you.

206
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,500
So, you'd better get out of my sight.

207
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,240
Right now!

208
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,820
- Ms. Park. 
 - Please get him out of here!

209
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,780
Please!

210
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,030
Aigoo, Pil Sung. Go Pil Sung.

211
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,900
How did you end up doing that?

212
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,670
You know it's all your fault, Hyung.

213
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,380
You said we can't cancel a shooting. So, you told me to coddle them and humor them.

214
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,010
Geez, you fool. You only remembered that part?

215
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,460
I clearly told you.

216
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,900
Anywhere with a sliding door, a bathroom, or an alleyway.

217
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,280
You need to look around when you're talking in a place like that.

218
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,930
Check if anyone's around over and over again, and be careful, I said.

219
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,790
I swear no one was in the adjacent room when we first went in.

220
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,340
Okay, okay.

221
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,170
I'll be in charge of Park Do Ra from now on.

222
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,000
You be in charge of Cha Bong Soo.

223
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,280
It looked like she was flipping out earlier.

224
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,190
If she says she can't shoot because of you,

225
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,020
we'd be hopeless then.

226
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,610
So, try to stay out of her sight for a while.

227
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,190
Okay?

228
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,600
Okay.

229
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,130
All right.

230
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,950
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

231
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,250
Go Pil Sung.

232
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,750
What did I see just now? Huh?

233
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,230
Auntie.

234
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,880
Let go, Go Pil Sung.

235
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,270
I swear I won't forgive that girl, Park Do Ra.

236
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,550
Auntie, please calm down.

237
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,380
Hey, how could I calm down right now?

238
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,910
I saw how she was treating you with my own eyes.

239
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,060
Wow, she really is a bitch.

240
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,500
When she used to be our tenant, I got her hairpins, hotteok  (sweet pancakes) , and was so nice to her.

241
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,280
Is this how she returns the favor?

242
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,370
How dare she scold you as if you're a dog?

243
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,400
This is no good. I can't just let this slide.

244
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,380
I'll kill her with my own hands.

245
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,990
Auntie, Do Ra doesn't know I'm Go Dae Chung.

246
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,820
What? She doesn't?

247
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,630
Why doesn't she? How could she not?

248
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,740
I changed my name, you know.

249
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,500
But still.

250
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,450
- She really doesn't know? 
 - No.

251
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,790
We know her because we've been seeing her on TV, but she saw me after 15 years.

252
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,360
How could she recognize me? My face changed, too.

253
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,400
And I acted like I didn't know her.

254
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,310
Because I thought it'd be uncomfortable if she found out.

255
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,160
Hey, but still.

256
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,040
What if your mom finds out she treats you like that?

257
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,570
She'll foam up and faint.

258
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,470
This is no good. I can't tolerate it because I'm too mad.

259
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,020
Auntie, I beg you.

260
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,690
Pretend you didn't see her today and just leave.

261
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,500
No one on set knows that Do Ra and I used to live under the same roof.

262
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,000
Auntie, I'm already having a hard time.

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
Please don't make it harder. I beg you.

264
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,900
Gosh, I'm going crazy today.

265
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,120
Geez, I'm so pissed!

266
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,990
Auntie! You can't tell Mom about today, okay?

267
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,690
Whatever!

268
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,610
Geez.

269
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,060
Things are hard enough already, but Auntie found out, too.

270
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,070
Geez, why are things getting so messed up?

271
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,740
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

272
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,370
If I catch a glimpse of you,

273
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,380
I swear I'll kill you!

274
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,770
Cut. NG, NG, NG.

275
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,180
Do Ra, you were way too over the top.

276
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,040
And there's no line that says, "I'll kill you."

277
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,310
- There isn't. 
 - Give me the script.

278
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,160
- Let me check the script. 
 - Suppress the emotions a bit.

279
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,840
Let's take a short break and continue.

280
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,550
Geez...

281
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,740
She's letting out her anger directed at me on the scene.

282
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,340
Gosh, she rarely messes up a scene.

283
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,530
She must be furious and feel so betrayed to mess up the scene like that.

284
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,430
Jae Dong, Jae Dong, hold on.

285
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,540
Who are you? Do I know you?

286
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,030
Please let go.

287
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,590
Why are you doing this now?

288
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,750
Jae Dong, please help me.

289
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,820
Please relay a message to Ms. Park.

290
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,310
Tell her I really, really didn't say that because I hated her.

291
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:35,500
Assistant Director Go Pil Sung, I was behind the sliding door yesterday, too.

292
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,280
You can't do that, Assistant Director.

293
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,800
After hearing what you said about her yesterday,

294
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,730
I felt so hurt that I couldn't sleep all night.

295
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,210
Even I felt that way. Imagine how she must've felt.

296
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,450
I told her not to trust you.

297
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,180
I told her you talk behind her back with Cha Bong Soo,

298
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,400
but she said you'd never do that.

299
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,570
She said you're not like that at all and scolded me instead.

300
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,240
But how could you stab Noona in the back like this?

301
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,060
You shouldn't live like that.

302
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,120
You're a bat.

303
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,880
It might sound like an excuse,

304
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,490
but you understand my position.

305
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm at the bottom of the totem pole here.

306
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,470
I have to do whatever the higher-ups say and satisfy everyone.

307
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,440
I can't complain, and I have to follow orders blindly.

308
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,770
That's my job.

309
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,790
You think I did that because I wanted to?

310
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,450
My job is to humor the actors so we could finish the drama successfully.

311
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,340
That's why it happened.

312
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,480
I didn't do that out of animosity.

313
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,920
You know my position as an employee, too.

314
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,270
Of course, that's...

315
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,860
I don't know. I don't know. Don't tell me stuff like that.

316
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,080
 Park Do Ra used to like tteokbokki. 

317
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,260
 Would this spicy tteokbokki ease her anger? 

318
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,600
Ma'am, please add plenty of sauce, too.

319
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,800
I'll have the fishcake to go, too. Please keep it warm so it doesn't get cold.

320
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,310
Okay.

321
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,890
Hyung, what's all this? 
    

322
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:37,640
Our main investor, Angel Investment's CEO Gong Jin Dan is treating us with hotel-style catering.

323
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,030
Wow...

324
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,720
Did you get something?

325
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,910
Who's that?

326
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,530
What's that? Did President Gong come here himself?

327
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,300
You came, President Gong.

328
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,940
Yes. Thank you for your hard work.

329
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,690
I sent a catering service specifically for you.

330
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,940
I wanted to check if they arrived smoothly and I also wanted to cheer you up.

331
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,030
Everyone was excited about the catering service, anyway.

332
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,060
Thank you so much for being so caring, President Gong.

333
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,090
Thanks to you, the staff and I could cheer up and shoot well today.

334
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,800
Oh, right...

335
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,310
Director—

336
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,024
Leave now. You need to leave quickly.

337
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:36,565
Do Ra, try the shrimp, too.

338
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,304
- Okay. 
 - It's delicious.

339
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:47,944
It really is good.

340
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:50,014
Please enjoy, President.

341
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:53,154
Wow, is it because it's freshly grilled by chefs?

342
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,564
It's really tender and tasty.

343
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:57,464
I'm glad you like it, Director.

344
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:59,554
Help yourself. Fighting.

345
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:02,194
Yes. Fighting!

346
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,094
Aigoo... Try some.

347
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,204
Thank you, Jae Dong.

348
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,454
I don't need to eat stuff like this.

349
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:32,104
Please explain things to Ms. Park, okay?

350
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:36,864
Don't get your hopes up for that. She doesn't forgive people easily once she gets angry.

351
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:43,604
And go inside somewhere she can't see you. Under the car or something.

352
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:47,534
She might flip your plate if she sees you, okay?

353
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:11,784
President Gong, I'm very grateful that you've been so generous,

354
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:16,254
but I'm embarrassed that I'm always taking it without doing anything for you.

355
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,054
I'm not sure if I can keep taking like this.

356
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:19,884
What do you mean you didn't do anything?

357
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:23,564
You're working hard as the female lead of "Straightforward Romance."

358
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,234
And...

359
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:30,414
I wear this tie all the time.

360
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,074
Pardon?

361
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:34,734
Tie? What tie?

362
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,014
This tie.

363
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,934
I thought...

364
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:42,954
you picked this tie for me yourself.

365
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:44,824
I did?

366
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:49,114
 Noonim, I received this month's interest. 

367
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,054
 It's so nice we're both keeping our promises. 

368
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:54,694
You shouldn't have called. I just sent it as I was supposed to.

369
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,804
But I'm grateful you're being so punctual.

370
00:24:57,804 --> 00:25:00,444
Thank you in advance for next month, too.

371
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:05,154
Don't worry about some silly interest, I said.

372
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:08,334
 No, no. I'm not worried at all. 

373
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:11,324
 I'll let you go, then, Noonim. 

374
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:17,264
I paid the largest interest and...

375
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:19,544
I paid Ms. Song back, too.

376
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:24,044
And I sent money to Ms. Ma. Am I done for the month?

377
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,024
Gosh, seriously.

378
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,474
I barely put out the fire with the advance payment for "Straightforward Romance,"

379
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:32,524
but what will I do next month?

380
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:35,754
How did I end up in this mess?

381
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,084
 President Gong treated us to a catering service. It was a premium buffet. 

382
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:51,234
Wow, look how generous President Gong is.

383
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:55,724
Yes, he's definitely interested in Do Ra.

384
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:02,084
Yes, President Gong is the ticket to my survival.

385
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:04,994
If Do Ra and President Gong end up together, having some debt won't be an issue.

386
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:07,394
If Do Ra and President Gong end up together, having some debt won't be an issue.

387
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,244
Hey, Do Ra.

388
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:16,034
Yes, I saw the photo of the catering service President Gong paid for.

389
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,884
It looked like he moved a whole hotel restaurant there.

390
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:22,424
You have to return the favor for this.

391
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:24,964
Tell him you'd buy him dinner, at least.

392
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:28,774
Mom, the tie you gifted President Gong...

393
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:30,974
Did you tell him I picked it, by the way?

394
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,104
Why would you lie about such a thing?

395
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:34,424
A tie?

396
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,464
Did you say you didn't?

397
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,994
Would I say I picked a tie I've never seen before?

398
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:42,074
You should've just said you picked it.

399
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:43,914
Why can't you read the air?

400
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,934
Hey... H-Hello... Hello—

401
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:49,704
Little brat. How dare she hang up on me?

402
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:51,104
My gosh.

403
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:55,684
What if President Gong is disappointed in me?

404
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:06,914
President Gong, you know the tie I gave you...

405
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:12,674
I'm so sorry I lied about Do Ra picking it.

406
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:17,254
Well, did you want to meet to tell me that?

407
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:20,234
To be honest, I was so smitten with you.

408
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:23,874
I just wanted things to work out between you and Do Ra.

409
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:31,024
It did seem like you were slightly interested in her, too, so...

410
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,164
Do you really want me and Do Ra to work out?

411
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:39,774
Of course, I do.

412
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:44,254
Although I picked it myself, as far as showing care, I did it with...

413
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:47,934
a very sincere heart, okay?

414
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:51,544
President Baek... I mean, Mother,

415
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,944
please help me end up with Ms. Park.

416
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:58,244
It's true I'm interested in Ms. Park.

417
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,754
My gosh.

418
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:02,974
Is that true, President Gong?

419
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,484
My gosh.

420
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,964
P-President Gong.

421
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:15,044
Gosh, seriously. My goodness.

422
00:28:17,514 --> 00:28:20,384
My gosh, look at my glowing skin.

423
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:23,184
Is it because I've been taking good care of it?

424
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:25,894
The makeup turned out amazingly today.

425
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,934
Gosh, what's this?

426
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:31,914
My gosh! My gosh! What's this?

427
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:33,704
My gosh, what's this? What's this?

428
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:37,334
My gosh. My gosh, what's this?

429
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:40,034
Gosh, this is gum.

430
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:45,174
Ahjumma! Yeoju-daek Ahjumma!

431
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:48,944
Geez, what's going on?

432
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:52,764
Yes, w-what's wrong, Senior Madam?

433
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,494
What's wrong? What's going on?

434
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:59,294
Auntie, look at this. Look.

435
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:00,994
What's that?

436
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:02,844
It looks like gum.

437
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:05,924
Why was there so much gum...

438
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:08,104
Who did this, anyway?

439
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:11,034
Who else in this house would do something like this?

440
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:13,894
Gong Ma Ri! Gong Ma Ri!

441
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:15,614
Gong Ma Ri.

442
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:20,554
Did you really put gum on Grandmother's chair?

443
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,604
Yes.

444
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,324
Why?

445
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:31,784
Why did you do that?

446
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,524
It was because the Second Grandma stressed Mom out.

447
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,864
She kept calling her "Daughter-in-law, Daughter-in-law."

448
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:41,194
Try to think from her perspective.

449
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:43,104
How would you feel if your friend called you

450
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:46,514
"Daughter-in-law" and forced you to call her "Mother"?

451
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:49,904
I think I'd puke because it's so gross.

452
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:53,414
My gosh, when did I force her?

453
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:57,054
But still, Ma Ri, you can't do stuff like this to an adult.

454
00:29:57,054 --> 00:30:01,314
Yes, Ma Ri. You're too old to pull a prank like this.

455
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:03,204
Gosh, that's enough.

456
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:06,234
It's because she's sick. What's the point of scolding her?

457
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,834
Grandma, I'm not a fool.

458
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,574
Don't treat me like a fool.

459
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,104
What?

460
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,614
And Second Grandma, don't bully my mom from now on.

461
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,574
I can tolerate other things, but not when someone bullies her.

462
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:23,774
You'd better not do it again. I'll put glue instead of gum on the chair.

463
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:27,474
It'd be a super glue. So your butt gets stuck to the chair permanently.

464
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:29,454
Ma Ri. Ma Ri!

465
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:35,234
Aigoo, what do we do?

466
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:47,934
What are you planning to do going forward?

467
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:53,824
Thinking about the future of the Gong family and the company keeps me up at night.

468
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:59,704
Auntie, don't worry so much. I have a plan, too.

469
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:03,574
What's your plan? Yes, tell me. Let's hear it.

470
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:06,054
We just need a good son-in-law.

471
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:08,674
We're looking for someone good for Ma Ri

472
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:11,924
and our family right now.

473
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:15,634
What? What did you say? Son-in-law?

474
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:21,684
So, you want to give this company to someone outside of this family that my father,

475
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:25,224
Oppa, and you have been managing? For three generations?

476
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:27,654
How does that make sense right now?

477
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:29,814
What's wrong with that?

478
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:34,134
We just want Ma Ri to get married and have a child.

479
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:38,804
Would Ma Ri's child have the last name Gong? Will it?

480
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:42,484
Ma Ri's child will be my child, too.

481
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,264
What?

482
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:48,634
Until Ma Ri gets married, has a child,

483
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:52,764
and the child grows up to inherit the company,

484
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:56,534
I'll live a long life in good health.

485
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:59,224
Don't worry so much, Auntie.

486
00:32:00,124 --> 00:32:05,404
I have a meeting. I'll go back to the office and come back.

487
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,724
What?

488
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:12,484
Son-in-law?

489
00:32:13,204 --> 00:32:16,184
What kind of utter nonsense is that?

490
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:23,744
- Hyeon Cheol. 
 - Yes, Mom.

491
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:25,304
What's going on, Hyeon Cheol?

492
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:26,934
Why did you want to meet outside?

493
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:29,054
Did something go wrong?

494
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:32,194
My heart is racing right now.

495
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:34,064
Nothing went wrong, Mom.

496
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:35,914
Let me show you something.

497
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:40,404
Myeong Soo sent me a million won for the dividend. A million won.

498
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:44,884
- My goodness. You got a million won for the dividend? 
 - Yes.

499
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:47,614
I think I invested properly this time. I did.

500
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:52,614
Gosh, Hyeon Cheol. You invested 50 million, but you already got a million?

501
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:53,934
Yes.

502
00:32:53,934 --> 00:33:00,114
You said the used phone business is a piece of cake in Vietnam.

503
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:02,194
It must be true, Hyeon Cheol.

504
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:04,534
I said I was confident this time. I told you.

505
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:06,674
My goodness.

506
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:10,164
You would've earned two million if you invested 100 million.

507
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:12,074
Gosh, what a shame.

508
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:17,694
I should've gotten 100 million from that woman somehow.

509
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:22,204
Mom, Seon Yeong would flip out if she found out about that money.

510
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:25,334
Let's not be greedier, okay?

511
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:27,364
Okay, okay.

512
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:29,424
You're right.

513
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:34,464
Hey, look at this color. Look.

514
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:38,744
It's tasty. It's so tasty.

515
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:41,904
Here.

516
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:47,184
Wow.

517
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:50,144
It was cooked beautifully.

518
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:52,644
Here. Try it. Say, ah.

519
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,794
What do you think, Madam?

520
00:33:56,794 --> 00:34:00,034
- Isn't it obvious? It tastes amazing. 
 - Right?

521
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:03,724
Is it because it's beef tenderloin? It melts in your mouth.

522
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:09,084
- Don't you care about me at all? 
 - My gosh.

523
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:13,104
Here you go, Queen Dowager.

524
00:34:13,104 --> 00:34:15,944
What do you think?

525
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:23,364
Is it because my son bought this with the money he earned?

526
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:25,804
It really tastes amazing.

527
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:30,084
Hey, Myeong Dong. You should eat more, too.

528
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:31,994
Say, ah. Say, ah.

529
00:34:31,994 --> 00:34:34,654
I'm eating.

530
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:40,154
You've been going out in a suit. Have you been working a part-time job?

531
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:41,574
Huh?

532
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:44,824
Yes. I'm telling you.

533
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:47,474
How many times do you have to ask?

534
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:50,644
It's because I'm happy. I'm happy.

535
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:55,454
Do you remember the last time you made money?

536
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:59,554
You haven't gifted me something like this in a while, too.

537
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:02,764
You two are so unbelievable.

538
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:05,684
You're wearing scarves while grilling meat. They'd get smelly.

539
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:09,254
I don't care if it gets smelly.

540
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:15,544
I'll keep it on even when I'm sleeping since my son bought it for me.

541
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:17,954
Me, too. Me, too.

542
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:20,784
I'm home.

543
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:24,644
- Hey, my son. Welcome home. Welcome. 
 - Welcome home.

544
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,684
Pil Sung, get changed and join us.

545
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:29,604
Dad bought beef for us today.

546
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,804
Okay.

547
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,774
Yes, join us soon.

548
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:36,844
Wow...

549
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:51,314
I'll get changed and join you in a bit.

550
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:54,664
Did Park Do Ra lash out on you again?

551
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:56,374
Is that what happened?

552
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:58,854
This is no good.

553
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:02,144
I need to meet up with that Park Do Ra soon.

554
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:06,874
Auntie, why would you meet up with her?

555
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:09,914
Please play ignorant.

556
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:12,594
I'm okay. I'm okay, I said.

557
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,164
Why do you look like this if you're okay?

558
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:21,604
I'm so pissed thinking about what I saw. I haven't had beef in a while,

559
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:26,254
but I couldn't even taste what I was eating, okay?

560
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:30,674
Thinking about what she did to you makes my blood flow backward.

561
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:34,214
How dare she scold you like that in front of everyone?

562
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:35,704
So what if she's a superstar?

563
00:36:35,704 --> 00:36:38,404
How dare she threaten to fire you?

564
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,954
Thinking about how you act servile toward someone like her,

565
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:45,944
makes me so upset I can't live!

566
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:49,704
What are you talking about right now?

567
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,474
- M-Mom. 
 - Unni.

568
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:57,734
Well, what are you talking about?

569
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:03,974
Pil Sung, do you work with Park Do Ra right now?

570
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:08,494
Auntie, you said Park Do Ra scolded him like hell?

571
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:11,244
Gosh, what are you talking about, Auntie?

572
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:14,134
What are you all talking about?

573
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:18,024
Go Pil Sung, won't you tell me the truth?

574
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,584
Aigoo...

575
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:28,634
Honey, here. Have some water and calm down.

576
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:31,364
How could I calm down right now?

577
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:35,854
She said Park Do Ra, that bitch, scolded Pil Sung like he was a dog.

578
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:40,724
He was humiliated and apologized to her in front of everyone.

579
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:43,534
He acted like her servant, she said.

580
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,144
I was exaggerating a bit.

581
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,864
He didn't act like a servant, Unni.

582
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,604
Pil Sung, are you out of your mind?

583
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:54,444
How could you work with her and be humiliated by her?

584
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:58,454
You should've said you couldn't work with her and asked to be transferred to another team.

585
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:03,604
At first, I didn't want to when I heard she was the lead, but...

586
00:38:03,604 --> 00:38:06,124
there was nothing I could've done.

587
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:09,184
Yes, it's not easy to work for a company.

588
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,254
You're expected to do what you're told to.

589
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:14,814
He just started the job recently. What power could he have?

590
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:17,544
He can't ask them to switch teams for him.

591
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:19,874
Yes, yes. Of course not.

592
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:26,644
At least she didn't recognize Pil Sung. That's a relief.

593
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:29,964
Hey. Don't you agree, Hyeon Cheol?

594
00:38:29,964 --> 00:38:33,134
Pardon? Oh, yes.

595
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:35,984
Gosh, I'm so upset.

596
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:38,844
Park Do Ra, that bitch. How dare she?

597
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:43,124
What makes her think she could bully my son?

598
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:49,574
Mom, Do Ra doesn't know who I am. She knows nothing.

599
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:53,834
She's a superstar, and I'm the youngest assistant director on set.

600
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,264
But I made a mistake while working. So...

601
00:38:56,264 --> 00:39:00,954
I should be responsible for the mistake I made.

602
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:05,044
Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Auntie.

603
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:07,114
Don't worry so much.

604
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:11,304
I'll take good care of it. I'm really okay.

605
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:21,384
Gosh, what's going on, anyway?

606
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:22,974
Gosh, my head hurts.

607
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:25,594
Gosh, what a headache. Aigoo...

608
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:29,454
Yes, Unni. What he said makes sense.

609
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:32,474
It's not like he has control over the situation.

610
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:36,864
And they're already halfway through shooting. It'll end soon.

611
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:39,554
They'd never see each other again once this drama ends.

612
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:44,774
Yes, Pil Sung will take care of everything.

613
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:04,254
By the way, I felt kind of bad for Assistant Director Go.

614
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:06,514
Looks like he just did what he was told to.

615
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:11,044
He was humoring Cha Bong Soo, so the shooting goes smoothly.

616
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:14,804
I don't think he said that because he hates you.

617
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:17,514
Don't mention Go Pil Sung with me from now on.

618
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,434
I don't want to hear it.

619
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:24,784
And you'd better not talk to him, either. Understand?

620
00:40:25,534 --> 00:40:27,434
Okay, Noona.

621
00:40:33,754 --> 00:40:36,064
We're here, Noona.

622
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:43,304
You can leave.

623
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:45,964
Pardon? I thought you were drinking.

624
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:47,104
I'll wait here.

625
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,004
No, it's okay. You should go.

626
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:51,844
You said it's your mother's birthday today.

627
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:54,774
Take her the gift in the back.

628
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:56,994
Bye.

629
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:16,894
Yes, President. This is Jae Dong.

630
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:29,234
 But it's so hard for me to humor her, too. 

631
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:31,454
 I could see why people call her "Bbakdora." 

632
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:33,644
 She drives me nuts 12 times a day! 

633
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:37,664
 So we could finish the drama successfully... 

634
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:40,994
But still, he couldn't have played me like that.

635
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:44,994
Bat. Scoundrel.

636
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:47,924
There's no one trustworthy in this world.

637
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:56,674
Are you Ms. Park Do Ra, by chance?

638
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:03,664
Yes.

639
00:42:03,664 --> 00:42:05,594
It really was you, Ms. Park.

640
00:42:05,594 --> 00:42:08,024
I can't believe I ran into you here.

641
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:11,094
- What a coincidence. 
 - President Gong.

642
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:12,894
What brings you here?

643
00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:16,694
I come here sometimes whenever I want to drink alone after work.

644
00:42:17,544 --> 00:42:19,514
Me, too. Me, too.

645
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:24,914
I come whenever I want to drink because it's quiet and private here.

646
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:28,084
Anyway, this is crazy.

647
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:30,234
I can't believe I ran into you here.

648
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:32,684
Are you alone, Do Ra? I am, too.

649
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,974
Should we drink together? It's not easy to run into each other like this.

650
00:42:34,974 --> 00:42:39,464
Sounds good. Since you've been doing so much for me,

651
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:42,124
I really wanted to treat you to a drink.

652
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,264
It's my treat tonight.

653
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:46,484
Really?

654
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:49,304
Wow, I'd be honored.

655
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:55,814
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

656
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:06,394
Drink slowly.

657
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:09,284
You look a bit drunk already.

658
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:10,824
It's okay.

659
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:14,084
You drink, so you get drunk.

660
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,004
Sometimes, you feel like getting drunk.

661
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:21,634
You want to get drunk and forget everything.

662
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:24,334
Don't you ever feel that way?

663
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:26,294
Of course, I do.

664
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:29,654
All sorts of things happen in life.

665
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:34,514
I checked the shooting schedule. It looked pretty intense since it's almost over now.

666
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:36,294
You must be very tired.

667
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:41,594
Work isn't hard.

668
00:43:41,594 --> 00:43:43,954
But people are.

669
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,414
People?

670
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:47,924
People, you said?

671
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:50,814
Is someone giving you a hard time?

672
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:54,424
Who is it? Let me scold them for you.

673
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:57,324
- Really? 
 - Of course.

674
00:43:57,324 --> 00:44:00,094
I'll always be your fan, no matter what.

675
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:03,794
Let me know if anyone's giving you a hard time. I'll...

676
00:44:03,794 --> 00:44:06,894
- take care of everything for you. 
 - Wow...

677
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:11,224
Wow, you're so cool, President Gong.

678
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:14,464
Thank you for saying that.

679
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:16,274
You're the best, President Gong.

680
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:18,574
The best.

681
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:31,704
 What kind of scoundrel are you? 

682
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:36,454
Yes.

683
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:41,004
I should beg her until she feels better.

684
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:43,104
I should even kneel in front of her.

685
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:46,174
It's true I made a mistake.

686
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,234
   

687
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:18,304
This is my place.

688
00:45:18,304 --> 00:45:20,234
When did we get here?

689
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:22,094
Just now.

690
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,204
Let's go. I'll walk you to the door.

691
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,204
No, no, no. I can go on my own.

692
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:28,774
No, no, no. I can go on my own.

693
00:45:28,774 --> 00:45:31,224
Thank you.

694
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:35,204
See? You almost fell.

695
00:45:35,204 --> 00:45:39,054
I'll walk you just to the elevator, then.

696
00:45:39,054 --> 00:45:44,644
Gosh, President Gong, you're so kind.

697
00:45:44,644 --> 00:45:47,776
Thank you.

698
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:50,244
Don't mention it.

699
00:45:50,244 --> 00:45:52,014
It's nothing. Let's go.

700
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:56,864
Okay. I think I'm a bit drunk.

701
00:45:56,864 --> 00:45:58,984
Let's go.

702
00:46:02,784 --> 00:46:05,574
President Gong looks fine.

703
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:09,054
Why did she drink so much and get drunk?

704
00:46:09,954 --> 00:46:12,834
Geez, I won't be able to talk to her tonight.

705
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:17,864
Yes, Yoon Hee.

706
00:46:19,984 --> 00:46:21,654
What did you say?

707
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:25,084
The same hotel?

708
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:29,394
Okay, I'll be right there. Wait for me.

709
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:39,264
Looks like he has a girlfriend.

710
00:46:42,914 --> 00:46:46,004
By the way, why did he drink so late

711
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:50,164
with Park Do Ra when he has a girlfriend?

712
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:57,254
What's this?

713
00:46:57,254 --> 00:47:01,894
Will you leave me after taking it or without taking it?

714
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:10,924
Thank you, Oppa.

715
00:47:10,924 --> 00:47:14,014
Yes, I want to thank you for everything, too.

716
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,674
I wish you all the best.

717
00:47:17,374 --> 00:47:19,574
Don't contact me ever again.

718
00:47:30,204 --> 00:47:31,794
Honey, I'm home.

719
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:34,624
You're home.

720
00:47:34,624 --> 00:47:35,964
What's that?

721
00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:37,684
This?

722
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:43,304
I got it because I was worried after seeing your test result.

723
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:45,674
You should take care of yourself now.

724
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:52,904
Here. Make sure to take it regularly and be careful not to fall.

725
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:56,794
All right, thank you. I'll be sure to take it.

726
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:58,504
Okay.

727
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:06,404
Right, your friend, Seon Yeong... Her son...

728
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:09,824
Was his name Pil Sung?

729
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:14,164
W-What's wrong, Honey?

730
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:15,594
Are you okay?

731
00:48:15,594 --> 00:48:19,934
Yes, I'm okay. It slipped out of my hand.

732
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:25,364
By the way, what about Seong Yeong's son?

733
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:27,644
That's his name. Go Pil Sung.

734
00:48:27,644 --> 00:48:32,094
I just thought of him out of the blue.

735
00:48:32,094 --> 00:48:37,724
I noticed he became a nice young man.

736
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:42,524
I thought it'd been so nice if our Ma Ri had

737
00:48:42,524 --> 00:48:47,434
a brother like that. I suddenly thought that.

738
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:51,344
Honey, you're so silly.

739
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:52,984
Silly, right?

740
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:55,124
I'll get changed real quick.

741
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:16,514
Why did he suddenly bring up Pil Sung?

742
00:49:16,514 --> 00:49:19,864
He wishes Ma Ri had a brother like him?

743
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:22,594
What did he mean by that?

744
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:25,154
By chance...

745
00:49:39,214 --> 00:49:40,734
Dad...

746
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:43,924
- Dad... 
  - Are you senile? 

747
00:49:43,924 --> 00:49:45,834
 Don't you know how much older you are than me? 

748
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:47,854
 Did you lend me that trying to do something with me? 

749
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:50,404
 I'll pay you back even if I have to sell my body. 

750
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,744
 How dare you try to take a smelly old man like him? 

751
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:55,984
 Is this woman serious right now? 

752
00:49:55,984 --> 00:49:57,674
 Gosh, Dad! 

753
00:49:57,674 --> 00:50:00,704
Dad! Dad, don't die. Dad!

754
00:50:00,704 --> 00:50:03,104
Don't die, Dad! Dad!

755
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:04,624
- Dad! 
 - Honey, what's wrong?

756
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:05,934
Dad! Dad!

757
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:07,454
Honey.

758
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,264
Dad...

759
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:15,904
My poor dad.

760
00:50:16,684 --> 00:50:20,814
I feel so bad for my poor dad.

761
00:50:21,824 --> 00:50:23,684
Honey.

762
00:50:25,214 --> 00:50:27,194
Calm down.

763
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,994
You had a dream about Father.

764
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,744
Calm down. Calm down.

765
00:50:33,314 --> 00:50:38,814
That awful family. I never wanted to think about them again.

766
00:50:38,814 --> 00:50:46,244
Even if I pulled out Baek Mi Ja's hair, I wouldn't feel satisfied.

767
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:50,244
That's why I changed the channel whenever Park Do Ra was on TV.

768
00:50:50,244 --> 00:50:54,994
Whenever I saw her, I thought of Baek Mi Ja, that bitch.

769
00:50:56,014 --> 00:51:01,014
What horrible fate connected us with that family that

770
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:07,274
even our Pil Sung had to be humiliated by that bitch's daughter Park Do Ra?

771
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:09,784
They should be begging for our forgiveness,

772
00:51:09,784 --> 00:51:13,474
but she treated Pil Sung like a dog instead?

773
00:51:25,824 --> 00:51:30,634
She's still so upset about it.

774
00:51:33,014 --> 00:51:36,204
She'd better not find out about that money.

775
00:51:38,404 --> 00:51:40,374
What do I do?

776
00:51:51,514 --> 00:51:53,404
Pil Sung,

777
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:58,264
don't think about anything else and work hard at the broadcasting company.

778
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:03,594
You studied so hard to get a job there.

779
00:52:03,594 --> 00:52:08,334
You joined them because you wanted to direct a fun drama.

780
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:12,044
Fortunately, Do Ra doesn't know who you are.

781
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:14,064
Hang in there even though it's tiring.

782
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,534
Yes, I'm glad you said that.

783
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:20,824
But if Park Do Ra continues to bully you,

784
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:23,254
you should tell her who you are then.

785
00:52:23,254 --> 00:52:27,294
She couldn't do anything if she learned you are Go Dae Chung.

786
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:32,314
Just tell her what her mom did, okay?

787
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:37,634
Hey, hey. Why would you go that far?

788
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:41,754
That wasn't Do Ra's fault. It was her mother's fault.

789
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,694
Hyeon Cheol, don't you agree?

790
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:50,184
Oh, yes. You don't have to take it too far.

791
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:55,224
Okay, I'll manage it myself. Don't worry, everyone.

792
00:52:55,224 --> 00:52:58,204
I'm Go  Pil Sung, the former solider of GOP reconnaissance team.

793
00:52:58,204 --> 00:53:00,004
Salute!

794
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,704
Gosh, how cute. How cute.

795
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:03,794
Seriously.

796
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:05,434
Salute.

797
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:07,624
- Yes, my son. 
 - Let's eat now.

798
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:10,304
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

799
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:15,024
- Noona. 
 - Yes?

800
00:53:16,184 --> 00:53:20,544
- What's with those flowers? 
 - President Gong sent you flowers.

801
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:23,294
- President Gong? 
 - Yes.

802
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,164
 Ms. Park, are you feeling okay? 

803
00:53:34,164 --> 00:53:37,274
 Cheer up and have fun looking at these flowers today. 

804
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:40,184
 Fighting. From Gong Jin Dan. 

805
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,434
How does he know you drank last night?

806
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:46,014
Did you drink with him, by chance?

807
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,404
I ran into him at the bar by coincidence.

808
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:51,164
By coincidence?

809
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,014
They're so pretty.

810
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,734
Noona, you got a call.

811
00:53:57,494 --> 00:53:59,314
Oh, here.

812
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:03,064
Yes, President Gong.

813
00:54:03,064 --> 00:54:06,314
Yes, I was just about to call you.

814
00:54:06,314 --> 00:54:08,314
Thank you so much for the flowers.

815
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:10,494
 I wanted to cheer you up today. 

816
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:13,544
I feel so bad that I'm always taking from you.

817
00:54:13,544 --> 00:54:15,124
You helped me last night, too.

818
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:17,184
Treat me to a meal sometime, then.

819
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:19,134
 Yes, I'll treat you. 

820
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,994
 Thank you. 

821
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:26,504
By the way, I didn't make a mistake last night, did I?

822
00:54:27,674 --> 00:54:29,334
Pardon?

823
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:31,974
Gosh, did I?

824
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:35,094
My goodness.

825
00:54:35,094 --> 00:54:36,994
Really?

826
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:42,094
- What's she so happy about? 
 - Oh, no...

827
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:47,484
President Gong Jin Dan sent the catering service yesterday and flowers today.

828
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,974
Isn't he obviously trying to win her over?

829
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:55,974
Looks like it's working on her since he's wealthy and aggressive.

830
00:54:55,974 --> 00:55:00,934
I suppose he could easily seduce any woman.

831
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:04,434
But he's a womanizer.

832
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:07,354
Womanizer?

833
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:12,034
Didn't you know? He's exclusively after new female actors.

834
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:14,654
Whenever good-looking ones show up,

835
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:18,224
he gets them commercial contracts and gifts and steals them away.

836
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:22,304
And he breaks up with them shortly after and makes them cry and stuff.

837
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:25,754
Everyone knows he's a notorious womanizer.

838
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:31,694
What if Park Do Ra gets seduced, dumped, and heartbroken later?

839
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:34,254
Gosh, never mind.

840
00:55:34,254 --> 00:55:35,814
It's none of my business.

841
00:55:35,814 --> 00:55:38,704
I'm not her brother or uncle.

842
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:40,814
Whether she dates Gong Jin Dan or not,

843
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:46,894
I just want her to get along with Cha Bong Soo until this project ends.

844
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:53,584
Hey, hey, Go Pil Sung. Go over there so she doesn't see you.

845
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:59,644
If she says she can't memorize the lines or shoot because of you, I won't be able to handle it.

846
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:01,914
Hurry, hurry.

847
00:56:01,914 --> 00:56:03,654
Go ahead.

848
00:56:11,984 --> 00:56:15,534
Does Do Ra know President Gong is a womanizer?

849
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:19,674
Am I supposed to tell her or not?

850
00:56:19,674 --> 00:56:22,374
Gosh, I'm so torn.

851
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:36,824
Excuse me, Ms. Park.

852
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:42,294
I told you to stay out of my sight.

853
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:51,824
I'll talk to you where you can't see me, then.

854
00:56:52,714 --> 00:56:54,894
What are you doing right now?

855
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:58,614
You know, President Gong...

856
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:01,314
You should look into him before you date him.

857
00:57:01,314 --> 00:57:04,584
Don't rush into dating, no matter how nice he is.

858
00:57:04,584 --> 00:57:06,694
I'm not telling you this as a staff member.

859
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:10,154
I'm telling you personally. Like I'm your older brother.

860
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:13,014
It's because I'm so worried.

861
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,804
How dare you try to trick me?

862
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,614
Older brother?

863
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:25,074
What kind of older brother talks behind his little sister like that?

864
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,994
While switching sides, even?

865
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:32,774
Well, that's...

866
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:38,624
I've seen countless people like you working in this industry for over 15 years.

867
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:42,464
They approach me as if they'd give me anything,

868
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:45,124
but they betray me out of the blue.

869
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:48,644
They say, "I love you, Unni. I'll forever be on your side,"

870
00:57:48,644 --> 00:57:50,994
but if I make a small mistake, they say, "Kill yourself.

871
00:57:50,994 --> 00:57:54,724
I hate you." They make hateful comments and speak ill of me.

872
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:57,254
They even come up with lies.

873
00:57:58,094 --> 00:58:01,474
So I haven't had friends, and I haven't

874
00:58:01,474 --> 00:58:06,234
been affectionate, or trusted anyone.

875
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:09,344
I've been working in this field like that for 15 years.

876
00:58:10,594 --> 00:58:13,054
No matter how lonely and painful,

877
00:58:13,854 --> 00:58:16,444
and no matter how much I missed people,

878
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:20,284
I made sure I wasn't affectionate toward them.

879
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:28,244
- Ms. Park. 
 - But after 15 years, for once,

880
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:33,294
I thought, "I finally met someone decent."

881
00:58:33,294 --> 00:58:35,234
"I could trust this person."

882
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:38,834
"I finally have a good friend."

883
00:58:40,744 --> 00:58:44,144
I really trusted you, Go Pil Sung.

884
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:50,514
But you're the same.

885
00:58:51,414 --> 00:58:55,424
You acted like you were on my side but betrayed me behind my back.

886
00:58:57,294 --> 00:59:01,904
I didn't think you'd do this to me, too.

887
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:11,914
You'd better stay out of my sight.

888
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:14,084
You give me chills.

889
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:32,314
I'm so sorry.

890
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:34,344
I did something very bad.

891
00:59:34,344 --> 00:59:36,094
What can I do to make you feel better?

892
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:37,764
I'll do anything. Just tell me. Please?

893
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:40,144
Director Hong!

894
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:42,144
How many times did I tell you?

895
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:45,894
I said I couldn't shoot when Go Pil Sung was around.

896
00:59:45,894 --> 00:59:49,464
I forget the lines I memorized because he makes me so angry.

897
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:53,204
This bat. This scoundrel. Remove him from the set immediately!

898
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:55,004
Hey!

899
00:59:57,104 --> 01:00:01,284
How dare you tell him to remove him from the set?

900
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:03,994
I refuse to shoot without him.

901
01:00:03,994 --> 01:00:05,494
I can't do it!

902
01:00:05,494 --> 01:00:08,194
Director Hong, I made it clear.

903
01:00:08,194 --> 01:00:11,094
I'll go home if Go Pil Sung leaves.

904
01:00:11,094 --> 01:00:13,024
Go home, then.

905
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:15,344
Quit! Just quit!

906
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:16,854
I can't do this anymore, either.

907
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:18,364
I won't shoot, either.

908
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:22,194
Hey, let's quit shooting today! Quit it!

909
01:00:29,284 --> 01:00:32,954
I'm sorry, Hyung. It's my fault.

910
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:36,534
Are we really canceling the shoot today?

911
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:37,894
Are you crazy?

912
01:00:37,894 --> 01:00:41,324
Do you know how much loss we incur if we cancel today?

913
01:00:41,324 --> 01:00:46,304
Pil Sung, go home and rest for a while.

914
01:00:46,304 --> 01:00:51,074
I'll ask the director if there's a team you can join.

915
01:00:51,074 --> 01:00:54,204
Are you telling me to quit "Straightforward Romance"?

916
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:56,034
What else can we do, then?

917
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:59,744
They're arguing about quitting because of you right now.

918
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:07,864
How about taking a break and going on a trip since you've been working hard?

919
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,674
A trip would be nice.

920
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:13,594
Pil Sung, please save me.

921
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:20,664
Hyung, how could you do this to me?

922
01:01:20,664 --> 01:01:23,424
Don't you know who put me in this mess?

923
01:01:25,774 --> 01:01:28,154
Okay, fine.

924
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:30,034
I'll quit, then.

925
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:33,124
Instead, let's not...

926
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,794
ever see each other after today.

927
01:01:37,664 --> 01:01:41,664
Never see each other? How could you say that?

928
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,974
Pil Sung, take a short break. I'll be in touch.

929
01:01:44,974 --> 01:01:48,164
Pil Sung, I'm sorry!

930
01:01:52,464 --> 01:01:56,144
Yes, I did everything I could.

931
01:01:56,144 --> 01:02:00,254
I can't work on this stupid set anymore. I refuse!

932
01:02:04,414 --> 01:02:05,834
No.

933
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:09,044
Why should I quit?

934
01:02:09,044 --> 01:02:11,604
I worked so hard to get to this point.

935
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,594
I can't put a scratch on my career.

936
01:02:16,684 --> 01:02:18,264
Yes.

937
01:02:18,744 --> 01:02:23,294
This is the only way for me to survive.

938
01:02:24,626 --> 01:02:28,496
   

939
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:37,046


940
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,694
Park Do Ra.

941
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:42,684
Let's talk for a second.

942
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:47,184
Wow, this is unbelievable.

943
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:50,744
Did you call me by my name just now?

944
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:53,184
And you're talking casually, too?

945
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,104
Are you out of your mind?

946
01:02:58,104 --> 01:03:00,884
Do Ra, please help me just once.

947
01:03:01,764 --> 01:03:06,794
Could you think of our old friendship and help me just once?

948
01:03:06,794 --> 01:03:09,864
Go Pil Sung, did you say "old friendship"?

949
01:03:09,864 --> 01:03:12,274
When did we have a friendship?

950
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:14,884
And how dare you call me "Do Ra"?

951
01:03:14,884 --> 01:03:18,044
- Director Hong— 
 - Do Ra, I'm Dae Chung.

952
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:21,234
Dae Chung.

953
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:24,374
Go Dae Chung.

954
01:03:24,374 --> 01:03:27,554
W-What did you say?

955
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,574
Who?

956
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:36,994
♫  It's you in the end  ♫

957
01:03:36,994 --> 01:03:40,134
   

958
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:45,964
♫  The one who made me smile  ♫

959
01:03:45,964 --> 01:03:51,294
♫  At night, when there's no light  ♫

960
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:57,194
♫  You shine even brighter  ♫

961
01:03:57,194 --> 01:04:04,104
♫  Even if you asked me a thousand times  ♫

962
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:11,994
♫  I want nothing but you  ♫

963
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:14,784
 I sent a reporter to Chairman Gong's wedding. 

964
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:17,184
 The bride by Chairman Gong's side was... 

965
01:04:17,184 --> 01:04:20,524
 You little. I'll be sure to do this before I die. I will. 

966
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,154
 You're so devoted to your adopted son, 

967
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:25,974
 but how could you not care if your husband is dying or not? 

968
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:29,264
 As long as Do Ra lets me, I want to be your son-in-law even tomorrow. 

969
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:32,834
 I actually made a huge investment without Do Ra knowing. 

970
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,134
 How much do you need? Feel free to tell me. 

971
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:37,644
 I think we need to evacuate because of the sea level warning. 

972
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:39,214
 Let's head to the wharf! 

973
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:40,864
 I missed the boat. 

974
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:42,584
 I'm on that deserted island. 

975
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:44,094
 There's someone here! 

976
01:04:44,094 --> 01:04:47,374
 - What? Who's this? 
 - Stop! 

977
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:53,004
♫  I still choose you  ♫
