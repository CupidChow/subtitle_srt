1
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,910
   

2
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,620
Assistant Director, I'll get going now.

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,560
Thank you so much. See you tomorrow.

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,630
Yes, get home safely.

5
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,310
By the way, where's the Director?

6
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,540
The Director went home just now.

7
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,720
I see. I'll get going now.

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Okay.

9
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,980
He said we'd carpool together,

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,520
but he went home without letting me know?

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,820
How rude is that?

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,950
   

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,830
Ji Yeong.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,470
Get in, Ji Yeong.

15
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,930
 He was waiting for me. I shouldn't have badmouthed him. 

16
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,560
Gosh, it's okay. I can take the bus.

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,480
We agreed to carpool together this morning.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,430
I was just saying that.

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,380
I don't even know how you do that.

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,660
A-And I'd feel too bad toward you, too.

21
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,870
It's not something you should feel bad about.

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,370
How about you pay me the half of monthly bus fare?

23
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,550
You get to go home comfortably, and I get to save money on gas.

24
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,400
Half of the bus fare?

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,140
I want to save money on gas.

26
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,200
And you said I was your savior for finding you a place and a job.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,070
Don't you want to help me save on gas?

28
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,590
No, no.

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,600
How could you say something like that?

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,300
Whatever. Let's go. Come on.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:23,750


32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,410
Didn't you take the wrong route, Director?

33
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,540
This doesn't look like the way home.

34
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,070
Let's have dinner before we go home.

35
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,860
Dinner?

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,970
Just the two of us?

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,780
You got injured trying to save me yesterday.

38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,310
You saved my life.

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,560
So, I wanted to do something for you.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll treat you to dinner as a thank you tonight.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,840
You filled up my fridge yesterday, too.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,170
That's enough for me.

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,710
I won't feel comfortable doing just that.

44
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,650
I want to treat you to a tasty meal.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,050
Gosh, you'd go bankrupt if I saved your life twice.

46
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,910
I'm really okay, though.

47
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,610
It was nothing. You're embarrassing me.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,610
But still, I need to return the favor.

49
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,560
Don't make me someone so ungrateful.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,940
Well, if you really want to.

51
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,820
Fine.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,320
 How tasty of a meal will he treat me to? 

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,540
- What do you think of this place? 
 - It's amazing.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,690
Well, I mean, I really like it.

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,310
By the way, why are they so good?

56
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,930
The beef started melting as soon as I put it in my mouth.

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,380
It's really amazing.

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,420
This is the best beef I've ever had.

59
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,440
Have some more, Ji Yeong.

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,300
No, no. It's okay, Director—

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,270
No, it's okay.

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,300
Okay.

63
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,210
By the way, why does the food keep coming out?

64
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,540
They brought octopus salad as an appetizer, crab soup afterward,

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,810
and they brought fish and steak.

66
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,630
Is something else coming out, by chance?

67
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,680
There will be a dessert, too.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,550
Gosh, there's more?

69
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,940
Yes, I ordered ice cream.

70
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,850
I know you like ice cream.

71
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,150
How did you know I like ice cream?

72
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,760
Well, most women like ice cream.

73
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,260
Yes, you're right.

74
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,580
I love ice cream so much.

75
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,330
Ji Yeong, I have a question.

76
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,880
Yes, ask me anything.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,870
To be honest, I saw your grandmother briefly yesterday.

78
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,730
Yes, she called me about it.

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,880
Are we shooting there again, by the way?

80
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,600
No. I went back, thinking we might shoot at the beach again,

81
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,020
- but I decided not to add it to the script. 
 - I see.

82
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,900
What did you want to ask me about, then?

83
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,660
I heard you lost your memory from an accident.

84
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,990
Did my grandma tell you that, too?

85
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,650
She told me not to talk about it.

86
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,870
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

87
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,880
Okay. Thank you.

88
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,320
So...

89
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,840
do you not remember anything at all?

90
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,450
No.

91
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,910
If so...

92
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,190
don't you want to get your memory back?

93
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,430
Of course, I want to.

94
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,110
I told Grandma I was okay since I didn't want her to worry,

95
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,060
but I actually really want to get my memory back.

96
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,360
When I woke up after the surgery, I didn't know who I was

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,070
and I didn't even recognize my grandma in front of me.

98
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:54,080
You probably don't know how scary it is not to remember anything.

99
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,420
It felt like standing alone in pitch darkness.

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,680
But getting your memory back might be more painful.

101
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,800
You might remember all the... unfortunate and painful memories.

102
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,500
That might torment you even more.

103
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,710
Do you still want to get it back?

104
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,520
You might be better off not remembering anything.

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,300
No matter how painful it might be, that's still a part of me.

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,480
No matter how painful it might be, that's still a part of me.

107
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,480
It's my life and my previous path.

108
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,090
I feel like I'm living only 50%.

109
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,950
I think I need to get my memory back to live as my whole self.

110
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,410
Ji Yeong, you like flowers, right?

111
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,480
Should I get you flowers?

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,260
No, no, it's okay. Why would you...

113
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,970
Ma'am, I'll take all the flowers here.

114
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,870
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

115
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,800
Well, no, it's okay.

116
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,210
- I'm really okay— 
 - How much are they?

117
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,970
 Director. 

118
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,270
 Driving with you makes my commute less boring. It's nice. 

119
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,640
 Ji Yeong, are you okay? Are you hurt? 

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,190
 What's all this? 

121
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,090
 By chance... 

122
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,820
Go inside.

123
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,670
Okay.

124
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,140
Director, I need to tell you something.

125
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,230
- Tell me something? 
 - Why are you so nice to me?

126
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,540
- It's because— 
 - You can't treat women like this.

127
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,730
Are you this nice to other women, too?

128
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,840
What do you mean—

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,470
You gave me a ride, suggesting carpooling or whatever

130
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,580
and you bought me an expensive steak at a nice restaurant, too.

131
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,590
And you even gave me all these flowers.

132
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,690
You might give me the wrong impression.

133
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,020
The way you treat women is very, very dangerous.

134
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,900
What do you call it? It's considered flirting.

135
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,720
If you do this to me,

136
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,260
I might mistakenly think...

137
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,020
you like me.

138
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,690
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,060
I just thought the flowers were pretty.

140
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,300
And I was thankful you saved me.

141
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,250
From now on, if you're thankful,

142
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,060
just give me a watermelon, say thank you, and be done with it.

143
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,600
No, the flowers are innocent.

144
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,580
I'll take them since you gave them to me.

145
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,880
Anyway, thank you.

146
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,580
 So, to summarize what you said, 

147
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,440
a man hurt the woman he loves greatly and committed an unforgivable sin,

148
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
but she died.

149
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,370
The woman he thought was dead showed up again,

150
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,700
but she lost her memory, and the man fell in love with her again, right?

151
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,910
Is it a plot for a new drama?

152
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,650
I like it. It's good. Keep going.

153
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,630
Let's say she got her memory back

154
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,390
and realized the man loved her again.

155
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,120
What would that be like?

156
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,960
He hurt her and committed an unforgivable sin, but he stayed with her just because she doesn't remember.

157
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,860
She'd want to kill him.

158
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,790
She'd punish him for playing with her.

159
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,570
Is this some kind of a revenge story?

160
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,030
I suppose.

161
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,900
What is that man supposed to do to her, then?

162
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,850
If it's not a revenge story...

163
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,780
If she gets her memory back and forgives him, they can get back together then.

164
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,600
The man has no right to love her until she forgives him.

165
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,840
You're right.

166
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,870
He doesn't have the right to love her.

167
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,310
The title of the drama, "The Right to Love," what do you think?

168
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,530
Gosh, why is it making me sad?

169
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,300
Go Pil Sung, I must be the male lead if you make this drama.

170
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,750
It's okay if she gets her memory back and hates me.

171
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,200
But if she gets her memory back,

172
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,510
I'm afraid she'd be hurting again.

173
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,670
I'm so worried she'd be in pain again. It's driving me crazy.

174
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,030
But she wants to get her memory back.

175
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,680
Even though she'd regret it once she got it back.

176
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,430
She'd be happier not remembering anything.

177
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,110
Pil Sung, you think she'd be tormented again

178
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,560
by getting her memory back, but that's just what you think.

179
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,830
She wants to get herself back.

180
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,390
Even if she's tormented by getting her memory back, that's her choice.

181
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,940
It's not for you to decide.

182
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,850
If you truly love that woman, you need to help her achieve what she wants.

183
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,940
Isn't that what love is?

184
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,950
Helping the other person with what they want.

185
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,290
By the way, is it your story and not a drama plot?

186
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,800
   

187
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,040
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

188
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,880
Enjoy. Don't forget to post the photo.

189
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,960
I want to take one with Bi Bi. The two of us.

190
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,950
- Bong Soo! 
 - Gong Hyung! Aigoo...

191
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,620
You didn't have to do this. You send a coffee truck every time.

192
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,210
It's because I wanted to cheer you up.

193
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,420
We became brothers after fighting like dogs.

194
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,060
I couldn't just do nothing.

195
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,130
Bi Bi, say hello. This is President Gong.

196
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,340
Hello.

197
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,690
- Thanks for working hard. 
 - Not at all.

198
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,800
Director Go must be around.

199
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,870
Director Go! Director Go! Say hello.

200
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,210
This is Director Go.

201
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,590
Hello, thank you so much for your support.

202
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,240
Oh, long time no see.

203
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,190
Right, you're the director now, not the assistant director.

204
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,800
Director Go, I hope the drama becomes a hit.

205
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,790
"Don't Lie to Me." I like the title, too.

206
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,460
- I have a good feeling about it. 
 - Director.

207
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,570
- Thank you. I have to go since I have a lot to prepare. 
 - Okay.

208
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,590
Mr. Cha, we'll start shooting now.

209
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,010
- Me, too? Geez. 
 - Are you going, too?

210
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,700
I'm so sorry, Gong Hyung.

211
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,090
Go ahead. Don't worry about me.

212
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,870
I'll look around a bit and leave.

213
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,570
Call me when you're free. Let's grab a drink.

214
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,270
We should. I'll see you next time.

215
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,180
- Bye. 
 - Let's get going.

216
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,500
Aigoo!

217
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,780
My gosh!

218
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, my gosh!

219
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,930
Gosh, what do I do? I'm sorry!

220
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,300
What do I do? You got coffee on your jacket.

221
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,680
 Be careful! 

222
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,440
Are you okay?

223
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,860
Gosh.

224
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,880
Move. How dare you touch me?

225
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,950
I-It's not that. I wasn't touching.

226
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,940
I was wiping coffee off you. I'm sorry.

227
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,480
Don't get the wrong idea.

228
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,240
What's going on?

229
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Director, I didn't see him here, so I spilled coffee on him.

230
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,570
I'm sorry, President Gong. We'll pay for the dry cleaning.

231
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,630
Gosh, no! I'm the one who did it.

232
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,120
Let me pay you.

233
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,010
How much should I pay you?

234
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,220
It's fine.

235
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,930
I'm okay. Get back to work, Director.

236
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,840
I'll leave now.

237
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,440
What do I do? It looked like an expensive jacket.

238
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,590
He says it's okay. Don't worry about it so much.

239
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,890
It's not like you did it on purpose.

240
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,000
He didn't say anything else, did he?

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,070
Like what? He didn't say anything else.

242
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,230
That's good.

243
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,780
Director, we're all ready!

244
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,080
I'll leave you to it, then.

245
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,660
Okay.

246
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
"That's good"? What does he mean?

247
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,090
How strange.

248
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,920
Why did that country bumpkin look like Do Ra earlier?

249
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,810
And why is my heart racing?

250
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,400
Is it because the set reminded me of her?

251
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,140
Or is it because she touched me?

252
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,380
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

253
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,250
Excuse me, just one moment.

254
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,530
What's with this woman?

255
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,240
What is it?

256
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,980
I'm sorry, President Gong. How much was that jacket?

257
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,490
It looks expensive.

258
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,630
I'll pay you for the jacket instead of dry cleaning if you prefer.

259
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,250
Do you even know how much this cost?

260
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,370
Just tell me how much it is.

261
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,030
I'll pay you after I get my next paycheck.

262
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,150
It's okay.

263
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,670
I'll pay you for the dry cleaning, then. Give me your phone number.

264
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,360
Mr. Oh, let's go.

265
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
Yes, Sir.

266
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,220
I feel so terrible.

267
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,500
Grandma always told me to watch where I was going.

268
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,540
How clumsy.

269
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,920
 Don't work at other restaurants, either. 

270
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,030
 That way, you won't hurt other businesses! 

271
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,140
She looks down on me because I wash dishes?

272
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,850
How do I make a living?

273
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,940
How do I live?

274
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,880
   

275
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,330
Gosh, Tae Hee liked Jin Dan since she was in New York?

276
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,710
My gosh. What a coincidence.

277
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,730
Yes, yes.

278
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,120
Of course. As long as they like each other.

279
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,640
It'd be nice if they dated and got married this year.

280
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,390
Yes.

281
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,070
Okay.

282
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,770
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

283
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,650
Okay, see you.

284
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,890
Auntie, did you just say "marry"?

285
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,790
Looks like they already talked about it.

286
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,810
Gosh, even before an engagement ceremony?

287
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,630
No one has engagement ceremonies these days.

288
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,970
After they date for about a year, they'll get married at the end of this year or next spring.

289
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,810
That's what we decided.

290
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:30,320
Auntie, I've done all sorts of things to get Jin Dan married.

291
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,500
But things didn't work out one way or another.

292
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,450
You're really the best.

293
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,170
Auntie, thank you so much.

294
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:45,180
It's good to get married, but it'd be very helpful to have Ilyoo Foods as our in-laws.

295
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,800
Of course.

296
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,680
Ilyoo Foods would make a trusty shield.

297
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,100
Yes, people would no longer call him "mistress's son," either.

298
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,740
 How could she say the word "mistress" to my face? 

299
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,830
 She makes it so difficult to like her. 

300
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,540
Gosh, here it is.

301
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,700
   

302
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,970
How much is this?

303
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,200
5...

304
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,350
5.6 million?

305
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,990
How could a jacket cost more than 5 million?

306
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,720
How does this make any sense?

307
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,660
Can a designer brand charge that much?

308
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,570
And I ruined a jacket like that?

309
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,600
What do I do?

310
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,240
   

311
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,310
 No matter how painful it might be, that's still a part of me. 

312
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,660
 It's my life... 

313
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,720
 and my previous path. 

314
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,380
 If you truly love that woman, you need to help her achieve what she wants. 

315
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,680
 Isn't that what love is? 

316
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,670
 Helping the other person with what they want. 

317
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,780
 Ji Yeong, let's meet up for a moment. 

318
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,908
 Where are we going? 

319
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:33,698
 We're almost there. Hang in there a bit longer. 

320
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:46,478
Director! I'm here!

321
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:50,088
Why did you want to see me at this hour?

322
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,628
And what's with these bicycles?

323
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:55,078
Ji Yeong, you said you wanted your memory back.

324
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:59,068
Yes, I want to. But...

325
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:02,748
Most people have ridden a bike before.

326
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,128
You never know.

327
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:06,988
You might remember something if you biked in the park.

328
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:10,838
Goodness, you're trying to help me get my memory back, too.

329
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:13,268
Thank you so much.

330
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:17,088
But I've only been living by the sea.

331
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:20,778
Riding a bike in the park won't bring my memory back.

332
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:24,088
And I don't know how to ride a bike.

333
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:25,298
I'm sure you do.

334
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:27,768
I said I can't ride a bike.

335
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:30,628
Just ride it!

336
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:34,108
Director, did you mimic my accent just now?

337
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:36,758
Yes, just ride it.

338
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:43,908
But I don't know how to ride a bike.

339
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:46,798
I'll hold you from behind, Ji Yeong.

340
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,408
Just trust me and try riding it.

341
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:53,138
And you have to bike around on set if something happens.

342
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:56,838
The new staff member better know how to bike, don't you think?

343
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:59,808
I suppose you're right.

344
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:03,238
Let me try riding it, then.

345
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:08,698
Here.

346
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,258
Okay...

347
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:16,998
Aigoo, I'm scared.

348
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,858
It's okay. You can do it.

349
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:21,498
Start pedaling.

350
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:23,828
Hold on.

351
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:26,338
Why is it so shaky?

352
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:27,748
Gosh! You're holding me, right?

353
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:31,358
I'm holding you, Ji Yeong. Just look forward.

354
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:33,348
I'm holding you. Keep pedaling!

355
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:38,228
Okay, I'll pedal hard. Don't let go of me!

356
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:40,228
Gosh!

357
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,088
Nice, nice!

358
00:24:42,088 --> 00:24:44,118
Nice, you're doing great!

359
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:50,458
D-Director, you're holding me, right?

360
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:54,178
W-Why won't you answer me?

361
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:57,848
Director, you're still there, right?

362
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,138
A-Aren't you?

363
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:04,468
Gosh, am I doing this on my own?

364
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:08,598
Aigoo! Director, this isn't what you promised!

365
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,248
I'm about to fall!

366
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:13,598
I'm falling! Gosh!

367
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:25,878
Ji Yeong, are you okay?

368
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,168
Yes.

369
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,378
I'm okay.

370
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:59,288
By the way,

371
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:02,968
since when did I ride on my own?

372
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:05,198
From back there.

373
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:08,468
Gosh, really?

374
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:11,478
I said you know how to bike.

375
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:16,758
By the way, how did you know I knew how to bike?

376
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:20,108
I just thought you would.

377
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:23,798
You'll start remembering things one by one like this.

378
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:26,208
You got one of your memories back just now.

379
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:31,128
Can't believe I knew how to ride a bike.

380
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:33,728
Thank you, Director.

381
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:37,318
By the way, it was so fun riding a bike.

382
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:38,818
Try riding it again, then.

383
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:41,678
- Okay. You need to hold me, okay? 
 - Okay.

384
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:43,388
You can't lie this time.

385
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:45,958
Okay, look forward!

386
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,798
So fun!

387
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,718
My gosh!

388
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:10,328
Gosh, Ma Ri. What brings you here at this hour?

389
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,618
I wanted to eat the cheonggukjang you made

390
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:16,248
and I wanted to see Pil Sung, too.

391
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:20,308
I can't see him if I come later because he would've left for work.

392
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:23,368
He hasn't left for work yet, right?

393
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:26,288
No, he hasn't left yet.

394
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:28,368
Really? I'm so relieved.

395
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:30,938
It's okay if I saw him today, right?

396
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:33,138
There's something I want to give him, too.

397
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:35,708
Here comes Pil Sung. He's here.

398
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:40,698
Oppa, hello! We finally get to see each other.

399
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:43,138
Ma Ri, you came.

400
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:48,048
Pil Sung, chat with Ma Ri over breakfast.

401
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:51,628
She's been wanting to see you all this time.

402
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,378
Me?

403
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,598
Oh, really?

404
00:27:55,598 --> 00:28:00,158
I'm sorry, I need to get going because there's a meeting before filming today.

405
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:03,288
Now? Do you really have to leave now?

406
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:05,988
Yes. See you next time, Ma Ri.

407
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:10,508
Hold on. I need to give you something.

408
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:12,978
- Me? 
 - Yes.

409
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:17,678
This is my present to you.

410
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:19,418
Present?

411
00:28:19,418 --> 00:28:21,698
Yes. Open it.

412
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,758
I'll exchange it if you don't like it.

413
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:28,588
Pil Sung, you should open it even though you're busy.

414
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:31,288
She came here this early for this.

415
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,318
Yes, Pil Sung. Let's have a look.

416
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,940
This is...

417
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,460
This is a Piarang watch.

418
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,750
This costs a fortune!

419
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,070
What? What did you say? A fortune?

420
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,820
Yes.

421
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,080
Ma Ri, I can't accept a present like this.

422
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,000
I appreciate the gesture.

423
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm sorry. See you next time.

424
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,320
- See you later. 
 - Yes, have a nice day, Pil Sung...

425
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,590
Did I do something wrong?

426
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,120
Gosh, Ma Ri.

427
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,520
It's not that.

428
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,240
Let's have a seat first.

429
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,180
Honey, hold on. I think this would be better.

430
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,370
Are you still upset with me?

431
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,750
Honey,

432
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:47,930
can't you just let me handle Ma Ri's business?

433
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,220
Why is Seon Yeong calling at this hour?

434
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,960
Yes, Seon Yeong.

435
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,410
What did you say? Ma Ri is there right now?

436
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,910
 Gosh! 

437
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,520
Ji Yeong, should we listen to music?

438
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,120
There's a song I want you to hear.

439
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,050
Okay.

440
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,080
Sounds good.

441
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Play the song I listened to earlier.

442
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,090
 My gosh, he has a song he wants me to hear? 

443
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,150
 Is it a love song? A marriage proposal song? 

444
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,810
One, two, three, four!

00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,040
 So, don't worry and feel comfortable, okay? 

449
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,830

459
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,730
Isn't it a fun song?

460
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,440
Ji Yeong, have you heard this song or...

461
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,270
has a man sang it for you before?

462
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:07,220
What kind of man would sing a song like this for a woman...

463
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,100
♫  These days, there are so many fakes  ♫

464
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,660
 What's the deal with the Director? 

465
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,570
 I didn't expect a romantic marriage proposal song, 

466
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,610
 but what's with "Eat chicken, chirp, chirp"? 

467
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,890
 Where did he get this idea? 

468
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,680
♫  I won't mind giving you everything  ♫

469
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,000
♫  You're everything to me  ♫

470
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,200
   

471
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,610
Why did he play that song for me?

472
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,860
Yes, what do the lyrics say, exactly?

473
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,490
   

474
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:59,710
My gosh. It's about a man pursuing a woman.

475
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,930
"I'm drawn. I'm drawn."

476
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,650
Does he mean he's drawn to me?

477
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,460
"I'm into it. I'm into it."

478
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,530
What? Does it mean he's into me right now?

479
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,400
Aigoo...

480
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,380
My goodness.

481
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,910
The Director confessed his love for me.

482
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:29,520
But I only focused on "Eat chicken, chirp, chirp" instead.

483
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,320
By the way, he could've just said...

484
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,140
"I like you" like a real man.

485
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,800
How was I supposed to understand what he meant?

486
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,680
I can't understand it unless I was told directly.

487
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,340
What a fool.

488
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,240
What's he doing now?

489
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,050
Why is he looking at me romantically again?

490
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,430
He could've just told me how he felt.

491
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,380
Why is he just looking at me?

492
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,410
 Come here right now. 

493
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,450
Ma Ri, why did you do that?

494
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,510
You can't go to someone's house so early without notice.

495
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,420
Whatever. I'm really upset now. Don't yell at me, too, Dad!

496
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,110
Ma Ri!

497
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,700
Gosh, seriously.

498
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,280
She took a taxi behind Do Jun's back and brought this expensive watch, too.

499
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,850
What if something happened to her?

500
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,330
My gosh, what's this now?

501
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,820
Did she steal it from you to give it to Seon Yeong's son?

502
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,000
Ma Ri needs to be scolded.

503
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,020
She might cause serious trouble at this rate.

504
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,020
I lied about Pil Sung having a girlfriend so she doesn't do this.

505
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,110
To make her give up.

506
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,000
Honey, you should scold her harshly this time.

507
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,260
So, she'd never do this again.

508
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,470
What's going on so early in the morning?

509
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,120
Gosh.

510
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,370
Ma Ri,

511
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,150
I told you. It's dangerous for you to go out on your own.

512
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,380
You have Do Jun. You can't go out alone like that.

513
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,510
And you were carrying an expensive watch, too.

514
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,770
Dad, Oppa doesn't look interested in me at all.

515
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,200
Whenever I gave a present to make a friend,

516
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,260
everyone agreed to be friends with me.

517
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,570
So, I thought Pil Sung would like it, too.

518
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,060
But he didn't even look at the watch and left.

519
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,650
I don't think he likes me because I'm a fool.

520
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,810
It's not like that, Ma Ri.

521
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,370
You're so pretty and lovely.

522
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,590
Can't you help me, then?

523
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,010
So, Pil Sung starts liking me?

524
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,770
You're strong. You can do anything.

525
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,200
Do you like Pil Sung that much?

526
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes, I do. I like him a lot.

527
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,740
I felt electricity the moment I first saw him.

528
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,760
As if something had happened in our previous lives.

529
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,950
So, Dad, please help me.

530
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,610
Please?

531
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,400
Honey, use this money for a while.

532
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,590
Get whatever you need, too.

533
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,480
Gosh, I don't want to owe you like this, Honey.

534
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,390
I feel so bad. I don't know what to say.

535
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,640
It's because I want to give it to you. Because I want to.

536
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,050
Because I want to.

537
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,600
Get some pretty clothes, I said.

538
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,360
And I'm looking for a nice apartment for you, too.

539
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,490
Just wait a bit.

540
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,560
Gosh, thank you so much.

541
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,590
I'm so lucky to have met someone so cool like you.

542
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,700
You're all I have now.

543
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,960
You're all I have. Seriously.

544
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,290
Hey, you thief! How dare you take that money? Give it to me right now!

545
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,040
- Honey! 
 - You crazy bastard.

546
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,930
How dare you give our money to some gold digger?

547
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,050
Let go! Let go! Hey!

548
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,440
Gosh, seriously!

549
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,530
You gold digger! Where are you running to?

550
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,640
How could you...

551
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,500
Mom, I got you melon, your favorite.

552
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,547
She said she doesn't work today. Did she go somewhere?

553
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:04,247
So tired.

554
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:07,627
Mom.

555
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,127
Mom...

556
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:17,857
W-What happened?

557
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:21,367
Why do you look like that? Who did that to you?

558
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,837
Well, it's nothing, Do Sik.

559
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:26,097
What do you mean it's nothing?

560
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:30,647
Did you run into the debt collectors from back then? Did they do that?

561
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:32,447
It's nothing, I said!

562
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:34,917
I'm really okay.

563
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:39,847
Mom, what's going on? Tell me.

564
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,857
Do Sik,

565
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:50,997
I tried washing dishes and cleaning at restaurants.

566
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,817
I tried to do everything as you told me to.

567
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:56,927
But it's not really working.

568
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:01,917
Most places don't hire me because I'm old.

569
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:06,057
I don't know why it's so hard to live.

570
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,357
Mom.

571
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:10,317
Do Sik, I...

572
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:14,277
I can no longer live like this.

573
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,507
So, Do Sik,

574
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:23,147
there isn't much I know how to do.

575
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:27,897
I'm thinking of starting a management company again.

576
00:40:27,897 --> 00:40:30,657
What do you mean? You want to get back into that business?

577
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:34,977
Yes. I made Do Ra a top celebrity.

578
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:38,407
I'll create the next Park Do Ra.

579
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:42,227
I still have plenty of connections at broadcasting stations. I can do it.

580
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:45,117
Do Sik, Do Sik...

581
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:47,757
Do Sik, please help me if you have money.

582
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:50,007
- Please help me— 
 - Gosh!

583
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:51,937
Mom!

584
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:54,787
How could I have any money?

585
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:58,507
Help me.

586
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,407
Put the seat belt on.

587
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,257
Okay.

588
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:32,837
 He cares about my safety so much. 

589
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:36,417
 The Director is so sweet. 

590
00:41:41,577 --> 00:41:46,347
Director, I'll buy you dinner tonight.

591
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:49,867
What would you like to eat?

592
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:52,727
You don't have to, Ji Yeong.

593
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:57,537
My grandma said you go bald if you like free stuff too much.

594
00:41:57,537 --> 00:42:00,887
I'll go bald if I keep getting food for free.

595
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:05,547
Since you helped me yesterday,

596
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:09,327
I'll treat you as a thank you.

597
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,727
Treat me next time, then.

598
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:14,147
I prepared tonight's dinner already.

599
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:19,017
Let's have dinner while enjoying the fresh air outside.

600
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:20,627
Okay.

601
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:26,937
 My gosh, he smiled at me just now again. 

602
00:42:26,937 --> 00:42:28,807
 What is this, then? 

603
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,457
 Is today the day? 

604
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:34,387
 Will he finally profess his love for me? 

605
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,897
 My heart is racing. 

606
00:42:45,577 --> 00:42:47,817
No, don't get up.

607
00:42:48,677 --> 00:42:50,727
Let me give you a hand.

608
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:53,847
You're working too hard on your own.

609
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:55,687
I'm done putting stuff away.

610
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:58,257
I want you to...

611
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:03,207
sit here, drink this tea,

612
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:06,717
and look at the stars and flowers.

613
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:10,507
Be careful. It's hot.

614
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:32,487
Gosh, what did I do to deserve this?

615
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:35,757
He's treating me like a princess.

616
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:41,597
The Director seems to be a romantic and

617
00:43:41,597 --> 00:43:45,097
cool man who treasures women.

618
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:48,897
How could I not like a man like him?

619
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:52,207
I'm falling hopelessly. Hopelessly.

620
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,317
Isn't that a guitar, Director?

621
00:44:03,317 --> 00:44:05,867
Do you know how to play the guitar, too?

622
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:08,637
Yes, I'm not too bad.

623
00:44:08,637 --> 00:44:11,950
 Will he profess his love while singing? 

624
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:16,207
 Oh, my. I'm so embarrassed.

00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,637
Was it okay?

637
00:45:44,637 --> 00:45:48,217
Yes, it was so, so great.

638
00:45:48,217 --> 00:45:53,917
I've never seen such a touching performance in my life.

639
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,287
Thank you.

640
00:45:55,287 --> 00:45:56,987
Have a seat.

641
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:04,137
Ji Yeong,

642
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,107
was there a memory or a thought that came to mind?

643
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:13,977
There was.

644
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,227
What was it?

645
00:46:18,227 --> 00:46:23,477
The night sky, breeze, stars, the scent of flowers,

646
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:26,637
and the pleasant guitar sound.

647
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:34,677
This world is so beautiful and worth living.

648
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:38,267
That's what I thought.

649
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,077
What a romantic night, Director.

650
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,147
Yes.

651
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,587
I'm glad you enjoyed my performance.

652
00:46:54,657 --> 00:46:56,537
Let's get going now.

653
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,747
Already?

654
00:46:58,747 --> 00:47:01,177
Yes, it's getting late.

655
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:12,887
What? This is it?

656
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:18,717
Why isn't he professing his love after coming this far?

657
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,377
Is there another event?

658
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,037
You can sleep if you're tired.

659
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:42,277
I'll let you know when we arrive.

660
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:47,867
No, I'm not tired at all.

661
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,917
 I'm so sleepy. I'm dying here. 

662
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:56,607
 Why did I eat all the meat and ramen? 

663
00:47:56,607 --> 00:48:00,287
 Gosh, I'm so full that I'm falling asleep. 

664
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,177
 When will he profess his love? What's he waiting for? 

665
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,597
 I'm so sleepy. 

666
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,717
You scared me.

667
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,187
W-What's wrong?

668
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:48,927
Director, are you putting a blanket on me so I don't get cold?

669
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:54,417
Yes, it's a bit chilly since it's nighttime.

670
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,057
Why don't you stop doing stuff like this and just cut to the chase?

671
00:49:04,057 --> 00:49:07,977
I'm ready for it now.

672
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:12,657
So, stop dragging it out and...

673
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:15,517
just profess your love.

674
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:18,167
Pardon?

675
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,557
Pro... Profess what?

676
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:26,117
You're making me wait and feel all antsy.

677
00:49:26,117 --> 00:49:30,387
You took me to a campsite, played the guitar, and let me watch the stars.

678
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,527
That's not all. You drive me to work and home every day,

679
00:49:33,527 --> 00:49:35,397
you buy me dinner every night,

680
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:39,227
and you taught me how to ride a bike at the Han River.

681
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:45,990
And now you're putting a blanket on me so I don't get cold.

682
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,977
Why can't you just tell me?

683
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,877
You like me... don't you?

684
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,577
Well, the thing is...

685
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:03,827
Ji Yeong, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.

686
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:06,867
I wanted to go for location hunting and...

687
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:08,777
you said you wanted to get your memory back.

688
00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:12,597
So, I thought visiting different places might help you get your memory back.

689
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:18,837
So, I just wanted to help you like an older brother caring for his younger sister.

690
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:25,080
So, you mean the reason you've been nice to me

691
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,260
wasn't because you liked me?

692
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,637
When did I ask you to be my older brother?

693
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:35,997
When did I ask for your help?

694
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:40,957
Drop me off. Right now!

695
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:51,887
I'll take a taxi home.

696
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:54,127
You can drive home alone.

697
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,167
It's hard to get a taxi at this hour.

698
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:06,817
It's none of your business if I take a taxi or walk.

699
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:09,077
Just keep going where you were going.

700
00:51:09,077 --> 00:51:12,087
How could I just leave you here?

701
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,457
Here's a piece of advice for you, Director.

702
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:21,157
When you don't even like me, you played the guitar, taught me how to ride a bike,

703
00:51:21,157 --> 00:51:26,757
bought me meals, flowers, drove me around all day, every day,

704
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:29,687
and looked at me adoringly.

705
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,277
Don't do stuff like that.

706
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:34,177
Understand?

707
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,347
And you deny it after all that?

708
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:50,687
You can't toy with someone's heart like that.

709
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:54,167
I'm seriously offended!

710
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,167
After flirting so much...

711
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:12,697
and making my heart flutter, he said what?

712
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:15,897
He wanted to help me as an older brother figure?

713
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:18,647
How does that make any sense?

714
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:21,617
Fine, he says he doesn't like me.

715
00:52:21,617 --> 00:52:24,487
What's the point of being in unrequited love?

716
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:27,067
I'm putting an end to this today.

717
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:29,237
It's over. It's over.

718
00:52:31,707 --> 00:52:33,517
Who is it?

719
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,957
 It's me. 

720
00:52:35,957 --> 00:52:38,517
 Please open the door for a moment. 

721
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:42,194
What's this now?

722
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:44,864
What do you want at this hour?

723
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:47,834
 I need to talk to you about something. 

724
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:50,414
 Let's talk for a moment. 

725
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,294
Talk about something?

726
00:52:54,377 --> 00:52:58,744
Will he apologize and profess his love now?

727
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:22,434
What's this?

728
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:26,024
It's tteokbokki.

729
00:53:26,024 --> 00:53:27,404
What?

730
00:53:28,107 --> 00:53:30,084
Tteokbokki?

731
00:53:31,137 --> 00:53:33,784
I know you like tteokbokki.

732
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:35,494
So...

733
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,444
eat this, and don't be mad.

734
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:46,634
I told you not to do stuff like this.

735
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:50,524
Are you flirting with me using tteokbokki now?

736
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:54,474
And you came here drunk. Are you joking right now?

737
00:53:54,474 --> 00:53:57,254
Do you think I'm a joke because I'm a country bumpkin?

738
00:53:58,047 --> 00:54:01,044
I swear I don't think of you that way.

739
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:06,054
There's a reason I have no choice but to do this.

740
00:54:06,054 --> 00:54:08,564
So, Ji Yeong, can we...

741
00:54:09,477 --> 00:54:13,154
get along as friends, at least?

742
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:16,974
I said I don't want to.

743
00:54:16,974 --> 00:54:21,784
I said I don't want to be friends with you, Director!

744
00:54:21,784 --> 00:54:25,604
Take the tteokbokki and leave. You're annoying me.

745
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:44,237
   

746
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:48,284
Welcome.

747
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,924
Hello.

748
00:55:00,104 --> 00:55:01,594
Can I try this on?

749
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,284
Yes, of course.

750
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,984
How pretty.

751
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:21,214
Gosh, what's all this?

752
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:23,444
I got my first paycheck today.

753
00:55:23,444 --> 00:55:26,734
You buy gifts for your family with your first paycheck.

754
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,464
That's why I got you these.

755
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:33,894
You're basically a family if you live under the same roof.

756
00:55:33,894 --> 00:55:36,074
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

757
00:55:36,074 --> 00:55:38,544
Don't feel pressured.

758
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,294
You charge me very low rent, too.

759
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:44,214
This is nothing compared to that.

760
00:55:44,214 --> 00:55:46,514
Is there something for me in there, too?

761
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:49,854
Gosh, of course. This is for you.

762
00:55:49,854 --> 00:55:53,044
This is for Ahjussi. This is for Ahjumma.

763
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:55,704
And here's something for Aunt and Director, too.

764
00:55:55,704 --> 00:55:57,444
My gosh.

765
00:55:57,444 --> 00:56:01,434
Let me see. Look at me. How do I look? Does it suit me?

766
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:02,944
How about me? How about me?

767
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:06,174
Wow, you both look amazing.

768
00:56:06,174 --> 00:56:07,844
You should try it on, too, Ma'am.

769
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:10,204
- Okay. 
 - Hurry up and try it on.

770
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,264
- My gosh, the color is so pretty. 
 - Hey.

771
00:56:12,264 --> 00:56:14,404
That's the perfect size for you.

772
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:19,724
Gosh, you're young, but you have sharp eyes.

773
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,414
Thank you. I'll enjoy wearing it.

774
00:56:22,414 --> 00:56:24,224
You should just get something for your grandmother.

775
00:56:24,224 --> 00:56:26,644
You shouldn't have gotten these for us.

776
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:30,824
I already sent something to Grandma by mail.

777
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:34,114
By the way, aren't you going to work today?

778
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:37,734
I start work in the afternoon today. I'm leaving now.

779
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:40,284
- I see. 
 - I'll get going now, then.

780
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:41,784
Okay, okay.

781
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,734
Thank you so much. We'll enjoy them.

782
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,544
- It's nothing. See you. 
 - Thank you.

783
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:48,004
My goodness...

784
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:52,824
She's so young, but she's polite and grateful.

785
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:55,004
She's unlike the young women these days.

786
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:56,334
I know.

787
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:58,964
She's diligent and clever, too.

788
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:09,274
 There's a reason I have no choice but to do this. 

789
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:12,284
 So, Ji Yeong, can we... 

790
00:57:13,374 --> 00:57:16,804
 get along as friends, at least? 

791
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:20,624
A reason he has no choice but to do this?

792
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:23,834
What does that mean?

793
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:28,244
 Ji Yeong, are you okay? Are you hurt? 

794
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:36,084
Yes, the Director likes me. Very much so.

795
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:40,244
He likes me so much, but there's a reason why he can't.

796
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:44,164
That's why he wants to be friends with me, at least.

797
00:57:46,284 --> 00:57:48,744
I had no idea.

798
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:55,964
By the way, what's the reason he can't like me, anyway?

799
00:58:02,404 --> 00:58:07,074
Is the Director terminally ill?

800
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:10,194
Is he dying?

801
00:58:13,444 --> 00:58:15,914
Where are you, Director?

802
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:17,924
Where are you?

803
00:58:22,694 --> 00:58:24,374
Ji Yeong.

804
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:39,634
Director, over here.

805
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,964
What's wrong, Ji Yeong? Is something going on?

806
00:58:45,964 --> 00:58:48,814
I'm sorry, Director.

807
00:58:48,814 --> 00:58:51,894
I got too worked up last night.

808
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:56,874
I couldn't understand what you were saying.

809
00:58:56,874 --> 00:58:58,624
What did I say?

810
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:02,824
Director, are you...

811
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:09,774
terminally ill or something like that?

812
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:14,214
Is that why you said you didn't like me even though you did?

813
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:17,214
I don't care about stuff like that.

814
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:21,534
I still like you, Director.

815
00:59:25,054 --> 00:59:27,534
I'll be by your side.

816
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:32,394
I'll never leave you alone.

817
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:34,154
Ji Yeong,

818
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:37,744
what are you talking about right now?

819
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:40,994
Who's terminally ill now? Me?

820
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,974
Aren't you, Director?

821
00:59:55,974 --> 01:00:01,124
Ji Yeong, looks like you watched too many appalling melodramas.

822
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,444
So, you're saying...

823
01:00:03,444 --> 01:00:07,854
I was mistaken on my own again?

824
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,654
Okay.

825
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:14,564
I finally understand my place.

826
01:00:14,564 --> 01:00:18,404
Director, I think I get the wrong idea...

827
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:22,214
whenever you're a little nice to me since I'm stupid.

828
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:26,824
So we'd better stop carpooling, too.

829
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:30,874
And make sure not to be nice to me.

830
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:33,134
Just treat me as the newest staff member at work

831
01:00:33,134 --> 01:00:40,574
and the tenant who lives in the rental unit at home.

832
01:00:48,364 --> 01:00:50,204
Mr. Cha.

833
01:00:50,204 --> 01:00:52,834
Gong Hyung! What brings you here?

834
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:56,274
I dropped by to see you since I was in the area.

835
01:00:56,274 --> 01:00:58,704
Really?

836
01:00:58,704 --> 01:01:00,314
Thank you.

837
01:01:00,314 --> 01:01:03,694
My heart is heating up because I'm so moved.

838
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:06,984
I didn't know you cared for me so much.

839
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:10,824
President Gong, call me whenever you need me from now on.

840
01:01:10,824 --> 01:01:14,724
I'll be there whenever and wherever you call me.

841
01:01:14,724 --> 01:01:17,164
- Okay. 
 - Wow.

842
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:19,014
Mr. Cha, the Director wants to see you.

843
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:20,674
Right now?

844
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:24,484
I'm sorry. This is bad timing.

845
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:25,824
It's okay. Get going.

846
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:28,744
I swear I just stopped by since I was in the area.

847
01:01:28,744 --> 01:01:31,334
So, you should go shoot right now.

848
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:33,564
Don't worry about me. Get going.

849
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,014
Really? Okay.

850
01:01:35,014 --> 01:01:38,274
I'll buy you a drink next time, then.

851
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:40,874
- Okay. 
 - Thanks for the food.

852
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,644
Let's go, Yoon Joo.

853
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:55,264
Oh, my.

854
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:57,754
Hello, President.

855
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:00,524
Oh, hi.

856
01:02:03,254 --> 01:02:08,154
I've actually been wanting to see you.

857
01:02:08,154 --> 01:02:12,734
M-Me? You wanted to see me?

858
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,664
You know that jacket I ruined...

859
01:02:16,664 --> 01:02:21,654
I looked it up, and it was more than 5 million won.

860
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,224
You said it was okay,

861
01:02:24,224 --> 01:02:29,164
but ruining such an expensive jacket and pretending it never happened

862
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:32,814
prevented me from sleeping comfortably at night.

863
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:34,294
So?

864
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:40,964
Since I can't afford to compensate you for it...

865
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:45,964
I'd like to compensate you partially, at least.

866
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:52,724
By the way, did you really pay the full price?

867
01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:56,584
Didn't you buy it during a sale or something?

868
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:59,474
I didn't buy it during a sale.

869
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:01,894
Is that so?

870
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:06,014
How much should I pay you to compensate, then?

871
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:09,934
It's okay. I threw it away. Don't worry about it.

872
01:03:10,674 --> 01:03:15,104
You threw away a jacket that cost over 5 million won?

873
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:23,004
I feel too guilty because it was such an expensive jacket.

874
01:03:23,004 --> 01:03:26,904
If you feel so bad, buy me a meal instead.

875
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,704
A meal?

876
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:34,694
By the way, the watch Ma Ri brought yesterday...

877
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:37,954
Does it really cost a fortune?

878
01:03:37,954 --> 01:03:43,514
How could a watch cost as much as a car?

879
01:03:43,514 --> 01:03:46,784
Some watches cost over 100 million, apparently.

880
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:49,434
My goodness...

881
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:52,504
How can you walk around wearing a 100 million won watch?

882
01:03:52,504 --> 01:03:54,034
What if someone cuts your wrist off?

883
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:56,854
Gosh, Mother. Seriously.

884
01:03:58,404 --> 01:04:04,684
By the way, why did we have to return the watch

885
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:07,404
she brought as a present?

886
01:04:07,404 --> 01:04:11,754
Hyeon Cheol can wear it if Pil Sung doesn't want to.

887
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:13,984
- Mother. 
 - What?

888
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,944
 Is anyone home? 

889
01:04:15,944 --> 01:04:17,784
 Anyone home? 

890
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:20,294
It's a man's voice. Who's that?

891
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:22,064
I know. Who's that?

892
01:04:22,064 --> 01:04:24,524
Honey, Honey. He's here.

893
01:04:24,524 --> 01:04:27,134
G-G-Gong Jin Taek. Gong Jin Taek.

894
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:29,244
- What? 
 - Gong Jin Taek.

895
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:32,014
W-Who's here?

896
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:33,674
My gosh.

897
01:04:34,644 --> 01:04:40,724
I know it's impolite, but I came to tell you something.

898
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:43,494
I'm glad you came.

899
01:04:43,494 --> 01:04:45,434
You can come any time.

900
01:04:45,434 --> 01:04:48,454
Our families are friendly with each other.

901
01:04:48,454 --> 01:04:52,684
I heard Ma Ri barged in here and bothered you.

902
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,014
I apologize for that.

903
01:04:56,834 --> 01:05:03,234
As you know, she's still immature due to her injury.

904
01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:05,584
I hope you understand.

905
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:08,554
No, you don't have to apologize.

906
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:11,024
We understand everything.

907
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:15,874
She only sounds childish a bit,

908
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:18,194
but she's polite and cute.

909
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:21,794
We all find her very sweet.

910
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:24,984
I'm so grateful for you saying that.

911
01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:30,014
The reason I came here today is...

912
01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:37,354
because I wanted to get Pil Sung's elders' approval.

913
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:45,734
I've been considering Pil Sung for a long time.

914
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:53,854
   

915
01:05:54,697 --> 01:06:03,787


916
01:06:04,784 --> 01:06:07,804
♫  Saturday afternoon  ♫

917
01:06:07,804 --> 01:06:16,237
♫  Don't hesitate like that and try dancing with me  ♫

918
01:06:17,494 --> 01:06:23,864
♫  I don't want to have a tiring talk today  ♫

919
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:25,944
♫  Dance with me  ♫

920
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:29,894
 The moment Pil Sung marries into that family, he'll become a chaebol's son-in-law. 

921
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:31,754
 How he feels is important. 

922
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:35,834
 If he likes Ma Ri, it'd happen. But if he doesn't, it won't. 

923
01:06:35,834 --> 01:06:39,294
 Is Pil Sung dating the lady in the rental unit, by chance? 

924
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:43,074
 Why is Pil Sung coming out of her room at this early hour? 

925
01:06:43,074 --> 01:06:44,584
 We need to talk. 

926
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,364
 Why did you come out of President Gong's car? 

927
01:06:46,364 --> 01:06:49,444
 Don't eat with him. Don't see him privately, either! 

928
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:53,037
♫  Try dancing with me  ♫
