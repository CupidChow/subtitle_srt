1
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,296
   

2
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,586
Who the hell are you?

3
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:54,576
Who are you, and why did you do that?

4
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,896
A woman died because of you.

5
00:00:56,896 --> 00:01:00,356
She died after suffering an unbelievable amount of shame.

6
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:02,116
Reveal the truth now.

7
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,936
Come clean about what you did!

8
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:08,576
I just took on a part-time job!

9
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:15,696
They said they'd pay me two million per day.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,706
I was just doing a part-time job.

11
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,106
Who hired you to do that?

12
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:27,286
I don't know. I don't know.

13
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:32,486
I didn't know Park Do Ra would end up that way, either.

14
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:37,436
Since there was an article about her prostitution

15
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:40,856
and her death, too,

16
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:46,486
I can't even leave the house or eat because I'm scared.

17
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:48,696
But...

18
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:51,896
I didn't kill her.

19
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:56,606
I was just doing a part-time job. A part-time job.

20
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,296
Ahjussi.

21
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,096
Please still tell the truth.

22
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:17,926
A woman was destroyed brutally because she'd been disgraced, and she died.

23
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:23,426
She can't die disgraced like that.

24
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:28,736
Ahjussi, I beg you.

25
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:34,016
Just say you didn't pay Park Do Ra for sex.

26
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:40,346
Please clear her name so she can rest in heaven.

27
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:43,066
It's so unfair for her.

28
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,076
Please, I beg you.

29
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:49,456
Okay.

30
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:53,106
But please give me a bit of time.

31
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:57,616
People will blame me for everything soon.

32
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:02,016
I need time to prepare for it, too.

33
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:04,566
Okay.

34
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08,866
Ahjussi, you need to keep your promise, then.

35
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,556
Promise.

36
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,886
Do Ra, this isn't right.

37
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:16,726
This isn't right. How are we supposed to live?

38
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:21,136
How is your mom supposed to live?

39
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:23,766
I know you hated me, but...

40
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,756
How could you leave...

41
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:29,016
How could you leave me behind?

42
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:33,106
Do Ra! Do Ra!

43
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:35,946
Do Ra!

44
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:41,326
Do Ra.

45
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,236
Do Ra!

46
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:52,106
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,976
Please...

48
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:01,576
forget about everything that happened here

49
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:05,286
and be at ease, Do Ra.

50
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,276
Do Ra...

51
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,656
Mom, let's go now.

52
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,116
Do Jun, Jae Dong, let's go.

53
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:26,386
Yes, let's have lunch at the soft tofu place down there.

54
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,836
Let's go. Let's go.

55
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:30,736
Let's go. Let's go, Do Jun.

56
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,316
I won't come with you.

57
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,316
From this point on, I will cut ties with you.

58
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:41,556
Hey, what are you talking about?

59
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,406
Do Jun, cut ties with me?

60
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:45,866
How could you say something so scary?

61
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,746
I can't live without you.

62
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,656
The three of us have to be tight since Noona's gone, too.

63
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:57,036
Noona... died because of you.

64
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:02,396
I can't forgive you, Mom.

65
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:08,446
How could you... How could you say that to me?

66
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:12,616
You're tearing me apart now.

67
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:18,406
I think I'd hate you more than now if I stayed with you.

68
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:21,216
Don't look for me.

69
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,826
- Do Jun! Do Jun! 
 - Hey, hey. Be careful, Mom.

70
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,176
- Do Jun! 
 - Hey, Do Jun!

71
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:28,666
Do...

72
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,046
- You're Ms. Baek Mi Ja, correct? 
 - Yes, I am.

73
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:33,616
Who are you?

74
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,606
I'm with the police.

75
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:39,896
- You need to come with us. 
 - Pardon?

76
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,886
Ms. Baek Mi Ja, you're under arrest for embezzlement and fraud.

77
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,626
You have a right to an attorney. You'll get a chance to defend yourself,

78
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,956
reject discriminating questioning, and complain to the court that the arrest was unjust.

79
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,256
Hold on, hold on. Am I going to jail?

80
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,336
- Let's go. 
 - Hold on, hold on! No, no!

81
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,356
- Do Sik, call the lawyer. Call the lawyer. 
 - Mom.

82
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,256
- Mom, Mom! 
 - I don't want to go to jail! I don't want to go to jail!

83
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:04,526
- Do Sik! Do Sik! 
 - Mom! Hold on!

84
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:12,256
You definitely heard that he was paid two million to work part-time?

85
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,406
Yes, I definitely did.

86
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:17,716
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

87
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:19,496
Sir!

88
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,066
Why are you knocking so loudly?

89
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,156
We can't reach the man who lives here.

90
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:28,936
He evacuated in a hurry, saying he was moving abroad.

91
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,906
Abroad? Abroad where?

92
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:32,306
Philippines, did he say?

93
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:34,856
Anyway, he's not coming back.

94
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,576
Hey, hey, hey! Pil Sung! Pil Sung!

95
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,186
Hyung, let's go to the airport now.

96
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,456
Hey, hey. There's nothing we can do.

97
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:47,186
We can't catch him if he goes to the Philippines. There are so many islands there.

98
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:50,526
Hyung, I definitely heard it. He said he was paid two million to do it.

99
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:53,006
That's the truth. So write an article about that—

100
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:56,836
I can't just write about what I heard without any evidence.

101
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:58,286
I want a scoop, too.

102
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:01,116
But he ran away. What can we do?

103
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,516
I feel sorry for Park Do Ra if this is all true.

104
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:10,516
You're so loyal, Pil Sung.

105
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,956
She'd be thankful in heaven if she knew you cared for her so much since you worked together.

106
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,466
She'd be thankful in heaven if she knew you cared for her so much since you worked together.

107
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:20,026
Hey, hey, hey! There's no point in going to the airport!

108
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:23,106
Do Ra, how could you leave me?

109
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:28,426
How am I supposed to go on on my own?

110
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:33,576
Geez, I can't sleep. Stop whining.

111
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:36,346
Seriously, so annoying.

112
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:42,836
Hey, you devoured your daughter alive.

113
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:46,926
- How dare you whine? 
 - Why are you doing this?

114
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,196
I have a kid, too.

115
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:52,850
I could've been a thief, but I won't leech off my kid. You piece of crap!

116
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,420

Is it the national anthem again?

122
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:27,246
You'll end up a singer at this rate.

123

You put a pretty flower on your hair, too.

130
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:51,616
Aigoo, her son died in a car accident

131
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,316
and granddaughter Ji Yeong ran away from home.

132

Since then, she's been on and off like that.

Sometimes, she's normal, too.

134
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:06,316
I feel bad. I hope her granddaughter returns quickly.

Okay, get going, then.

139

Gosh, she must be sane again.

 - Okay.

142
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:55,496
Gosh, when is my Ji Yeong coming back?

143
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:05,046
My gosh, what's that?

144
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,886
What...

145
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:11,166
Is that Ji Yeong?

146
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,026
Ji Yeong! Ji Yeong!

147
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:24,566
- Are you her guardian? 
 - Yes.

148
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,996
Doctor, what happened to Ji Yeong?

149
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:31,496
Please, she can't die.

150
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:35,316
She's the only family I have.

151
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:38,926
Please let her live, at least.

152
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:41,276
Thankfully, she's alive, but—

153
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:42,956
Is she alive?

154
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:44,356
Is that true?

155
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:46,736
But she's in a critical condition.

156
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:51,476
She suffered fractures on all four limbs, multiple fractures on her face,

157
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:55,156
and extensive skin loss. She'll need emergency surgery.

158
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,766
We'll basically have to rebuild her entire body.

159
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:02,646
Entire body? Her whole body?

160
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:05,466
Her face might change after the surgery.

161
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,706
That's how difficult and significant the surgery is.

162
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,376
That's okay.

163
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,626
It's okay to change her whole face.

164
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:17,766
Please just let her be a person again.

165
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:21,026
Doctor, I have money.

166
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:26,486
I have a shop and insurance money from my son's death, too.

167
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,316
It's okay if her face changes.

168
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:32,326
It's okay, so please let her live.

169
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,866
Retractor.

170
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,806
Cutter.

171
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,726
I brought Ms. Gong, Ma'am.

172
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,936
Thank you so much.

173
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:34,246
Ma Ri, I heard you were at the subway station again.

174
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:36,346
Why do you keep doing that?

175
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:40,536
I told you. That Oppa is my destiny.

176
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:42,656
I need to find him and meet him since it's meant to be.

177
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:46,716
I'm sure he'll be back there someday.

178
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:52,246
If it's really meant to be, you'll eventually meet somewhere else.

179
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:55,886
So don't wait out there anymore.

180
00:12:55,886 --> 00:13:01,006
Really? Will we meet anywhere if it's meant to be?

181
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:04,486
Huh? Yes, of course.

182
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,236
How's my Ji Yeong?

183
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:15,036
Ms. Kim's surgery went well.

184
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:19,396
I see. Thank you. Thank you.

185
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:25,266
Aigoo, what happened to you?

186
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,236
Gosh, Ji Yeong.

187
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,896
It's Grandma. Grandma.

188
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:40,796
You're at a hospital.

189
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,596
Who are you?

190
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:46,906
What do you mean?

191
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:50,496
Ji Yeong, I'm your grandma.

192
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,466
How could you not recognize me? Don't you know me?

193
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:02,526
My gosh.

194
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,436
What do we do?

195
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:10,166
Doctor! Doctor! My Ji Yeong is acting weird!

196
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,986
   

197
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:19,226
Ms. Kim was in a serious accident,

198
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,916
and she was in a 20-hour-long surgery.

199
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,906
I think that caused a temporary memory loss.

200
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:30,156
Memory loss? That means all of her memory is gone?

201
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:33,066
When will her memory come back, then?

202
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,216
Sometimes it takes days and sometimes years.

203
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:39,126
Let us keep an eye on her.

204
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,886
Okay.

205
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:48,736
Ji Yeong, do you really not recognize me?

206
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:55,366
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.

207
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:58,826
It's okay since you're alive.

208
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:03,386
I'll teach you everything one by one.

209
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:07,886
You'll eventually remember everything, then.

210
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:10,616
Don't worry, okay?

211
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:13,606
You're still alive.

212
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,806
Gosh, my baby.

213
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,366
My Ji Yeong.

214
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:32,796
   

215
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:35,366
    
 Yes, name.

216
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:43,606
   

217
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,206
Yes, yes.

218
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,616
Your name is Kim Ji Yeong.

219
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,376
And you're 26 years old.

220
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,866
You're my granddaughter, Kim Ji Yeong.

221
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:58,986
Kim Ji Yeong, my only relative in this world.

222
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:04,596
Lee... Lee Soon Jeong's granddaughter, Kim Ji Yeong.

223
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:26,446
 Oppa, I said I liked you. But it was all a lie. 

224
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:30,766
 I was playing with you because I was bored. 

225
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:33,406
 So, forget a terrible person like me. 

226
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,256
 Be happy, Oppa. 

227
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,066
Park Do Ra.

228
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,436
I know this is all a lie.

229
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:49,666
Stop lying like this...

230
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:54,756
and could you please come back now?

231
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:59,396
Which part of the ocean are you lying down in?

232
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:03,286
Could you at least tell me that?

233
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:07,836
I'll come pick you up, then.

234
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,846
If I held your hand when you...

235
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:19,666
came to me then, you wouldn't have died.

236
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:25,196
You came to me wanting to live,

237
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:29,696
but I pushed you over the edge.

238
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:35,996
You wanted me when you were about to die,

239
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,986
but I...

240
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,746
I...

241
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:45,986
I'm sorry.

242
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,226
I'm sorry.

243
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:54,036
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

244
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:00,556
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

245
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:14,686
   

246
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:19,206
We need to pick up side dishes and get going.

247
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:23,556
The customers will start rushing in at the restaurant.

248
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,546
I'm getting rid of manila clams!

249

Is Pil Sung not coming home today, either?

269
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:03,836
No. He's shooting outside of Seoul this time.

270
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,436
Apparently, he won't be back for a week.

271
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:09,106
He hasn't worked at the broadcasting station for that many years.

272
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:13,746
But how did he end up with such a major mini-series?

273
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,946
He's directing a mini-series because the short film

274
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:19,336
he made won an award at an international festival.

275
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,676
Not anyone can do that, Mom.

276
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,316
Is that so?

277
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:27,756
He's been working like a madman since Do Ra died.

278
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:30,046
He's successful now, isn't he?

279
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:31,946
Yes.

280
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,541
So what if he's successful?

281
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,661
I ask him to read my script, but he can't even bother.

282
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:40,711
I hate him so much.

283
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:45,471
Unni, you should talk to him about it.

284
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,191
I asked him to help you out already,

285
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:51,831
but he says it's not about connections. He won't even let me talk.

286
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:56,871
Seon Yeong, you should still talk to him.

287
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,111
Okay.

288
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,911
They say time is medicine.

289
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,921
I suppose they're right.

290
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:10,311
Since he's so focused on his work, right?

291
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,831
You...

292
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,871
Who are you exactly?

293
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,721
Who the hell are you?

294
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:23,271
Why do I feel like everything about you is a sham?

295
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,251
What about me are you so curious about?

296
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:30,381
Why can't you believe me as I am?

297
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:34,231
Fine. I have no choice.

298
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,871
Let's stop seeing each other.

299
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,401
Cut, cut!

300
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,361
The genre of our drama is romantic mystery.

301
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,161
A young chaebol from Seoul fell in love with a country girl,

302
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,621
but she doesn't act like one and is suspicious.

303
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:57,931
So, he doubts her identity and searches for the truth.

304
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:01,101
But your emotions are so dry now.

305
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:02,611
Let's focus and try again.

306
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:05,491
Director Go, this is already the fifth time.

307
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,421
How much more emotional can I be?

308
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:12,571
Director Go, will you go to Cannes with this or something?

309
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:14,671
Okay, let's try again!

310
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:18,711
Why did Go Pil Sung change so much?

311
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:21,821
I wouldn't have done this project if I knew he was so impossible.

312
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:24,071
His head got too big. Lanky bastard.

313
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:27,381
Jae Dong, get me water!

314
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,331
Here.

315
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,631
You look amazing. You're doing great.

316
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:36,451
- Am I okay? 
 - Yes, totally. Wipe the water.

317
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,991
Focus!

318
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:43,451
Okay, one, two. Cue!

319
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:51,071
 What are you all doing here? 

320
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:53,551
- NG! NG! 
 - You scared me.

321
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:56,211
Ma'am, we're filming right now.

322
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,231
Yes, I'm Cha Bong Soo.

323
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:00,301
Can't you guard the set properly?

324
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:02,201
Jae Seob!

325
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:05,341
Yes, yes, Ma'am. It's me, Cha Bong Soo.

326
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,481
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

327
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,801
What are you doing here, Grandma? Let's go. Let's go.

328
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,521
Gosh, what are you doing?

329
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,491
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:24,112
Oh, my, I'm sorry. Let's go.

331
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,262
Seriously! What are you doing?

332
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,711
Okay, okay. Let's go again.

333
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,701
What's going on?

334
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:41,121
Bi Bi is so pretty.

335
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:43,991
Cha Bong Soo is really handsome, too.

336
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,671
He's not greasy in person, either. He's so my type.

337
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,161
Hold on.

338
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:54,411
Ji Yeong, what am I doing here?

339
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:57,241
Grandma, are you back now?

340
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,681
You drive me crazy, Grandma.

341
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:04,001
You caused a scene over there, too.

342
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,891
You always tell me to get it together.

343
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,821
You'd better get it together, too.

344
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,821
Did I go crazy again?

345
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:13,181
Why do I keep doing that?

346
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:16,521
- Hey, let's go home right now. 
 - Okay, okay.

347
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,561
Let's go. Let's go.

348
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:24,571
Gosh, what are you doing? Let's go, I said.

349
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:27,511
The customers are waiting at the restaurant.

350
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:30,251
We can't just be gone like this.

351
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:33,391
How many times did I tell you?

352
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:37,461
Don't look for me even if I went crazy.

353
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:42,021
Just wait for me at the restaurant, I said.

354
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:46,021
Even if I went out, I'd be in the neighborhood.

355
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:51,831
Everyone in the neighborhood brings me back. Let's go.

356
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,221
Okay, okay. Let's go, let's go.

357
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:57,111
- Let's go, I said! 
 - Yes, let's go.

358
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:59,761
Seriously!

359
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:13,501
Gosh, what's this?

360
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:18,211
What? Is the zucchini rotten?

361
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,641
Grandma...

362
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:23,421
my heart is weird.

363
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,441
It keeps racing for some reason.

364
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,131
What?

365
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,351
Your heart is racing?

366
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:34,831
Maybe your heart hurts because of the surgery.

367
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:36,781
Let's see. Are you feeling hot at all?

368
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:39,351
No, it's not that.

369
00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:43,881
I keep thinking about the film set from earlier.

370
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:47,271
I feel all unsettled...

371
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,651
I feel so disturbed.

372
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:51,891
I can't focus on work, either.

373
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:57,381
Gosh, what kind of nonsense is that?

374
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:02,061
What does the drama filming have to do with you?

375
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:07,401
I don't know. My heart keeps racing. What am I supposed to do?

376
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:14,331
Grandma, can we close the restaurant and watch them film?

377
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:17,241
What are you talking about right now?

378
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:19,681
We need to peel onions and garlic.

379
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:22,121
And we need to make kimchi, too.

380
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,671
We have tons of things to do.

381
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:28,501
I can do all that in no time, okay?

382
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:33,901
They don't always shoot a drama in the boonies like this.

383
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:36,891
So... I'll be right back.

384
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,851
Hey, hey, hey! What could you...

385
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:44,851
Seriously. I think she's got some silly ideas in her head.

386
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:48,261
She's looking. She's lost in thoughts.

387
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:50,601
- You call her and she turns around.
- This far away?

388
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,221
No, a little further.

389
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:56,161
Wow, Cha Bong Soo.

390
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,531
He's so handsome.

391
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,201
How could he be real?

392
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,011
Assistant Director, where's the puppy?

393
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,001
The thing is, Director...

394
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,451
What? Are they not here yet?

395
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:12,641
I just got a call. They got into a car accident on the way.

396
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,021
What?

397
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:17,961
- So when are they coming? 
 - In about two hours.

398
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,521
What? Two hours?

399
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm sorry, Director.

400
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,021
I should've told them to leave sooner.

401
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,081
Are you looking for a puppy right now?

402
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:35,891
What kind of puppy? Black, brown, or white?

403
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:38,961
I know a ton of puppies.

404
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:42,171
Aigoo, my babies! Be careful!

405
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:46,011
Okay! Don't worry!

406
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:53,381
Here. Pick one.

407
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:58,411
Thank you. Thank you so much.

408
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:03,331
Tell me if you need anything else.

409
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,321
I have all sorts of things you can imagine.

410
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:10,111
They call me Chief Kim in this town.

411
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,761
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

412
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:17,351
What's the truth you're talking about, exactly?

413
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,451
Cut! Cut! Thank you.

414
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,841
Okay. Geez, the dog hair, the hair, the hair!

415
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:28,651
- Here's the puppy. 
 - Okay.

416
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,901
Well, what's your name?

417
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:34,541
Me? I'm Kim Ji Yeong.

418
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:37,281
Ji Yeong, thank you so much for the white pup.

419
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:40,671
You saved my life today.

420
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,861
Don't mention it.

421
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:49,721
All I did was walk around with a puppy who was doing nothing.

422
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:52,591
Don't even mention it.

423
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:56,891
How did you hear about this restaurant?

424
00:28:56,891 --> 00:29:00,921
My karaoke buddy Byeol said their pasta is amazing.

425
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,941
Really?

426
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,091
Here are your orders.

427
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:10,401
Do Jun.

428
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,711
Ma Ri.

429
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:17,001
Gosh, Do Jun.

430
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,641
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

431
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,721
Driver Kang is quitting?

432
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,231
Yes.

433
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,261
Why all of a sudden?

434
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:29,731
I guess there's a situation at home.

435
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:33,541
He's moving to Jeju, where his son lives.

436
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:38,691
It's hard to find someone to care for Ma Ri securely. What do we do?

437
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:43,361
We should look for one. Try to find someone trustworthy, too.

438
00:29:45,691 --> 00:29:51,591
Right, Honey, remember Do Jun, who saved Ma Ri last time?

439
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,101
That student abroad?

440
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:58,511
Of course. How could I forget him?

441
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:01,471
So... what about him?

442
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:08,091
Ma Ri and I went to a restaurant earlier and saw him working there.

443
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,531
Didn't you stay he was studying in the US?

444
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:15,941
He came back to Korea due to a difficult situation at home.

445
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:21,901
Even on the second look, he's so proper and mature for his age.

446
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:26,411
Honey, I'd like to ask Do Jun.

447
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:28,521
What do you think?

448
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:31,631
That fellow?

449
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:40,231
He's so handsome, but his autograph is so cool, too.

450
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:45,841
Grandma, When I was watching them filming earlier,

451
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:50,691
I found it so fun, and my heart was racing.

452
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:53,241
Grandma, I want to do something cool like that.

453
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:55,281
How can I get a cool job like that?

454
00:30:55,281 --> 00:31:00,911
That's why you should've listened to me and studied hard.

455
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:04,691
All you did was chase after boys.

456
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:08,791
I didn't study and chased after boys all the time?

457
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,361
Yes.

458
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,721
Why did you just leave me be, then? Why?

459
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,291
You should've told me to stop chasing them

460
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,881
and told me to study even if it took beating me up.

461
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:21,471
They say the guilty ones are the loudest.

462
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:24,101
Are you blaming me right now?

463
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:27,221
Well, it's not that, but...

464
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:30,771
I would've studied hard if only I knew.

465
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:34,661
I'm angry at myself. That's why.

466
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:38,401
I'm kneading batter in the countryside.

467
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:41,231
But someone's working a cool job like that.

468
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:45,061
Why is life so unfair?

469
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,741
Okay.

470
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:58,661
Aigoo... M-Ma'am...

471
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,371
You're working so hard.

472
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:04,961
Yes, what brings you here at this hour, Ma'am?

473
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:08,791
Well, the thing is...

474
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:13,831
I have a granddaughter named Kim Ji Yeong.

475
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:19,391
She says she wants to work here like you.

476
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,801
Pardon?

477
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:25,121
So I came here to ask you a favor.

478
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:29,721
Would you be able to hire Ji Yeong, by chance?

479
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:35,601
If it's necessary she could clean

480
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:38,131
and she could run errands. It doesn't matter.

481
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:41,651
My Ji Yeong is smart and attentive.

482
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:44,881
She'd be good at anything.

483
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:48,851
Ma'am, I know your granddaughter, Ji Yeong, too.

484
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:52,621
She was so helpful with the puppy earlier today.

485
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:55,311
Oh, is that so?

486
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:59,701
Yes. But there are no openings...

487
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:01,711
I'm so sorry.

488
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:07,361
Well, it's okay. It's okay. Of course.

489
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:11,081
How could there be an empty position for a good job like this?

490
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:14,861
I thought I might as well ask.

491
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:18,261
Well, okay.

492
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:20,801
- I'm sorry. 
 - Not at all.

493
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:24,521
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

494
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,821
Being by the ocean...

495
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:33,321
reminds me of Park Do Ra.

496
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:38,561
It's already been two years since she passed.

497
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:45,461
Director Go, when we made "Straightforward Romance,"

498
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:49,051
we used to shoot in the mountains and the ocean.

499
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,261
Things were so tumultuous, you know.

500
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:58,781
I would've treated her better if I knew she'd leave like that.

501
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:05,711
Oppa, why talk about someone who passed?

502
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,191
Is it because we're on the oceanside? The beer is so refreshing and nice.

503
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:10,831
The air is so nice, too.

504
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:16,671
But... I still can't believe she's dead.

505
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:19,351
It feels like she's alive somewhere.

506
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:27,011
Pil Sung.

507
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:34,441
You probably don't know what the life of a celebrity is like.

508
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:38,251
If you do one thing wrong,

509
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:42,511
they go after you like you're a pest.

510
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:47,281
And if you get caught with something, they attack you like hyenas.

511
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:50,061
They're so eager to bring you down.

512
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:52,881
That happened to Do Ra, too.

513
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:57,431
Everyone criticized her so much then.

514
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:03,311
She... was killed by the world.

515
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:08,601
The people pushed her off the cliff.

516
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,961
Seriously.

517
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,721
Whenever I think of Do Ra...

518
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:20,731
She must've been so lonely before she died.

519
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:27,831
Seriously, I miss her so much tonight. Park Do Ra!

520
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:35,001
Why don't you die, too, if you miss her so much?

521
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:40,651
Hey, hey, Bi Bi! Bi Bi! Bi Bi!

522
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:56,681
 Where have you been? 

523
00:35:56,681 --> 00:36:00,021
 Where did you go? 

524
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:03,721
 The bathroom. I went to the bathroom, too. 

525
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:10,951
 I thought you went somewhere, leaving me alone in the haunted house. 

526
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:16,331
 Don't go to the bathroom without me from now on. 

527
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,091
Do Ra...

528
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:27,161
used to be scared of a dark place like this.

529
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:33,901
Do Ra...

530
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:37,381
are you okay?

531
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,701
You're doing well, right?

532
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:52,041
What are you doing there?

533
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:01,021
Gosh, aren't you the director from earlier?

534
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:04,731
Aigoo, you can't be here, Director.

535
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:08,311
The famous water ghost lives here. haven't you heard?

536
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:14,731
Wait... w-what are you doing where the water ghost is, then?

537
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:17,561
What do you mean? I was catching octopuses.

538
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,891
I need to sell them tomorrow.

539
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:25,261
Why are you so surprised?

540
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,661
Haven't you seen an octopus before?

541
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,851
Anyway, you'd better leave now.

542
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:32,861
The water ghost died as a virgin.

543
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:36,251
She'd take a man if he's alone.

544
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:41,361
There's no water ghost in this day and age.

545
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,281
Oh, yeah?

546
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:48,331
Why don't you stay there and

547
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:51,551
play a clapping game with the ghost, then?

548
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,461
Sounds fun.

549
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,211
Wait... h—

550
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:00,641
H-Hey.

551
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:02,781
Why is she so fast?

552
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:49,771
Gosh, Jin Dan. What's wrong?

553
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,801
Did you have a nightmare again?

554
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:56,731
Gosh, hold on. Look at all this sweat.

555
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:02,461
Why are you like this since Park Do Ra died?

556
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:06,871
- Is it the same dream? Did she show up again? 
 - Yes.

557
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,861
Why does she always show up in front of you?

558
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:11,611
You didn't even kill her.

559
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:16,481
Looks like she became an unwed ghost and she's haunting you.

560
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,451
Come on. What are you talking about?

561
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:21,471
Why would you keep having dreams like that, then?

562
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:25,871
Gosh, shouldn't we perform an exorcism and get rid of her?

563
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:28,871
Exorcism?

564
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,721
   

565
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,041
Get away right now!

566
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,901
How dare you attach yourself to him?

567
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:47,701
You should've gotten over your regrets!

568
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,611
What more do you have to regret?

569
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:58,121
She says she can't leave because of the grudge!

570
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:01,661
What are you so upset about?

571
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:12,321
Yes, I understand you well.

572
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:14,661
You must've felt tortured.

573
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:17,371
You left this world for a reason.

574
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:23,331
But there's no room for you in this world, no matter how upset you are.

575
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:27,921
So leave him and go to the netherworld freely.

576
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:32,616
I'll free you from all the resentments today.

577
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,381
Come out and play with me!

578
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,931
I'm Do Ra.

579
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,551
Park Do Ra.

580
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:57,581
Think about why I attached myself to you

581
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:00,431
and why I'm like this.

582
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:06,901
Put your hand on your heart and think about it.

583
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:17,681
You left because you didn't want me.

584
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,231
Why are you doing this after leaving me?

585
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:22,911
Why are you torturing me? Why?

586
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:24,861
Did I tell you to die?

587
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:27,021
I told you to come to me.

588
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:33,581
Do you know how heartbroken I was because of you?

589
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:36,181
You could've come to me! You could've!

590
00:41:36,181 --> 00:41:38,591
I would've accepted you, then.

591
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:40,751
Did you hate me enough to die?

592
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,571
Tell me. Did you hate me that much?

593
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,451
Do Ra.

594
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,111
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:55,291
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't know you'd die like that.

596
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,341
I wouldn't have done that if I knew you'd die like that.

597
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,851
I thought you'd come to me.

598
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,991
How could you not understand my feelings at all?

599
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:07,011
I loved you sincerely.

600
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:09,661
How could you rip off my heart like that?

601
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:12,271
How could you?

602
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:24,071
I'm sorry, Do Ra. I'm sorry.

603
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:31,291
Gosh, I was so humiliated in front of the shaman.

604
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:36,071
You cried like a baby because a girl dumped you.

605
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:39,141
She's haunting you since you can't get over her.

606
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,031
You're still obsessed with someone dead.

607
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:43,781
When will you get it together?

608
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:47,031
And what did you mean earlier?

609
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,561
You wouldn't have done that if you knew she'd die?

610
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:52,201
Did something happen between you two before she died?

611
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:54,241
You mean you killed her or something?

612
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,521
What did I say, exactly?

613
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:59,031
I don't remember what I said at all.

614
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:02,141
What's going on, anyway?

615
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:04,931
Do Ra's ghost isn't haunting him.

616
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,321
I think he's gone crazy. He did.

617
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:10,691
Gosh, you're killing me right now.

618
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:14,541
Gil Dong ran away? What do you mean?

619
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:19,311
His girlfriend got into an accident and he left to Seoul to care for her.

620
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:23,061
He said he ran away since he felt too bad to tell you in person.

621
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:26,771
He's a crazy bastard. What is he, a romantic?

622
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,451
He said love is more important than work.

623
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:34,781
We really need a junior assistant since there's tons of work today. What do we do?

624
00:43:38,231 --> 00:43:41,331
What did you tell me just now?

625
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:45,331
Are you asking me to help film the drama?

626
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:50,011
Yes. Your grandmother said you wanted to join us.

627
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:52,851
You told me that.

628
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:57,861
That you're dying to do what they're doing.

629
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:00,421
Well, yes, I did.

630
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:02,031
I really want to do it.

631
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:04,051
Do you want to try working with us today, then?

632
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:05,621
Today?

633
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:08,741
Gosh, are you serious?

634
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:10,861
Do you really mean that?

635
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:14,261
Yes, we suddenly have a position to fill.

636
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:20,351
Well, can I really do something so cool?

637
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,721
I received no training at all.

638
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:24,601
Nothing would be that difficult.

639
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:28,561
You'd mostly run errands or do physical work as a junior assistant.

640
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:32,751
But you want to move heavy props and it's very physical.

641
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:35,941
You'd strain your body a bit. Would that still be okay?

642
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,491
Physical labor?

643
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:41,651
Aigoo, I like it, then.

644
00:44:41,651 --> 00:44:43,731
What a relief.

645
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:48,701
I don't know about other things, but no one's better than me at physical labor.

646
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:51,821
- Don't you agree, Grandma?
- Of course.

647
00:44:51,821 --> 00:44:58,791
Yes, I can guarantee that Ji Yeong will be good at physical labor.

648
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,071
Cut! Okay!

649
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:12,711
Nice!

650
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,971
Let's move to the next location!

651
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:24,311
What? The ice is all melted.

652
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:34,831
Look at the camera here.

653
00:45:35,981 --> 00:45:38,011
Shake his hand off and...

654
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:02,051
Cut! Okay!

655
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:06,791
Director, drink this cool water.

656
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:12,391
You, too, Assistant Director.

657
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,471
Enjoy.

658
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:24,041
Okay, drink some cool beverages.

659
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:26,101
- Here you go
- Thank you.

660
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:28,661
- Here.
- Wow, thank you.

661
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,541
The granddaughter's good. She's attentive, too.

662
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,671
Her name is Kim Ji Yeong.

663
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:36,591
Right. Kim Ji Yeong, huh?

664
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:37,971
I want an extra one, too.

665
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:39,771
Oh, okay.

666
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:42,801
She moves and thinks quickly.

667
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,641
I think she's quicker than Gil Dong.

668
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:47,511
- Here's Coke. 
 - Thank you.

669
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:56,261
Drink slowly. Be careful.

670
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:00,721
I ran here because I finished work late.

671
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:06,271
By the way, why did you want to see me?

672
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,451
Do Jun, let me just be direct with you.

673
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:15,941
Do you know how to drive, by chance?

674
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:19,841
Yes, I do. I work as a driver at night, too.

675
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:22,621
You work as a driver?

676
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:25,491
You must be a good driver.

677
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:32,011
If so, Do Jun, instead of working many part-time jobs,

678
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:35,561
how about you work for us?

679
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,971
Pardon?

680
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:44,171
You must know that Ma Ri needs a bodyguard who's also a driver.

681
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:49,951
But the person who used to do that had to quit for personal reasons.

682
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:58,531
So, would you be able to do that for my family?

683
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:00,691
- Me? 
 - Yes.

684
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:05,001
Most importantly, Ma Ri thinks of you as her little brother,

685
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:07,761
and she's comfortable with you.

686
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:11,171
Do Jun, I'm sure the pay will be

687
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:15,981
a lot better than working multiple part-time jobs.

688
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:23,661
And as long as you don't mind, we'll provide lodging and food, too.

689
00:48:23,661 --> 00:48:25,841
Lodging and food?

690
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,271
Do Jun!

691
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,261
Welcome, Do Jun. You really came.

692
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:35,031
Yes, good to see you.

693
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:36,501
Welcome, Do Jun.

694
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:38,401
- Hello. 
 - Yes.

695
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:41,311
Welcome. Did you wrap up the job well?

696
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:42,741
Yes.

697
00:48:42,741 --> 00:48:44,651
Can't believe we'd be living in the same house.

698
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:47,421
We'd be seeing each other every day now, then.

699
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:50,201
Am I dreaming, by chance?

700
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,891
I'm not dreaming.

701
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:57,341
I'm so grateful that you came, Do Jun.

702
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,461
Not at all. I'm grateful.

703
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:05,381
Is he the new driver who's replacing Mr. Kang?

704
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:09,161
Yes, this is Ma Ri's great-aunt.

705
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:11,701
Hello, I'm Park Do Jun.

706
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:14,701
I'll take him to the annex he'd be living in.

707
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,111
- Let's go, Do Jun. 
 - Okay.

708
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:19,481
Go ahead.

709
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:22,391
Me, too. Me, too. I'll come with you.

710
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:26,281
Is he the man who saved Ma Ri once?

711
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:28,471
Isn't he too young?

712
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:30,021
I know.

713
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:33,201
He's too young. Can he take care of Ma Ri?

714
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:37,701
He might be young, but he's proper and mature. He'd be good.

715
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:41,541
I suppose it's better than someone mysterious and weird.

716
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:44,551
He looks clean-cut and nice.

717
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,491
Come on in.

718
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:52,981
Wow, this is so nice.

719
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:54,781
Really? Do you like it, Do Jun?

720
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:56,881
Yes, I love it.

721
00:49:56,881 --> 00:50:00,901
It feels like a stadium since I've been living in a tiny student apartment.

722
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:05,181
The washer is in the utility room. Do your laundry there.

723
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:08,301
Yeojudaek will prepare your meals.

724
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:11,061
And ask her anytime if you need anything.

725
00:50:11,061 --> 00:50:14,151
I will. Thank you.

726
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:18,531
Ma Ri, should we leave so Do Jun can rest?

727
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:19,851
Okay, Mom.

728
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:23,121
Unpack and rest, Do Jun. I'll be in touch.

729
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:25,001
Okay.

730
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:27,851
- Let's go. 
 - Thank you.

731
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:50,301
Noona, I'm keeping a high spirit.

732
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:55,831
I'll work hard, return to school, and finish my studies.

733
00:50:55,831 --> 00:50:58,351
So don't worry about me.

734
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:01,231
Forget about this place and rest easy.

735
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:15,481
Are you okay?

736
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:17,791
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo!

737
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,601
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

738
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:21,161
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay. I'm okay.

739
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,661
Gosh, I made a serious mistake

740
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:26,631
because I couldn't control my strength.

741
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:34,351
Ji Yeong, can't believe you made his nose bleed.

742
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:36,071
I'm sorry.

743
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:40,071
It's okay. It's okay. You didn't mean to.

744
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:43,181
Director! The dress arrived!

745
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:44,731
Let's prepare to shoot!

746
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:46,201
Okay!

747
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:49,471
Ji Yeong, I'm okay. Don't worry, and get to work.

748
00:51:49,471 --> 00:51:51,831
I'm sorry.

749
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,601
Let's go!

750
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:58,391
Geez, you stupid fool.

751
00:51:58,391 --> 00:52:01,201
Will you become a dodgeball player?

752
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,811
Why did you throw the ball so hard?

753
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:09,481
Everyone must think I'm rough around the edges.

754
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:13,301
You were right, Oppa.

755
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:16,021
To be honest, I...

756
00:52:16,661 --> 00:52:19,451
lied about everything.

757
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:25,741
No. No!

758
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,031
Cut! Okay!

759
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,651
Nice!

760
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:32,371
We're done shooting on the beach now.

761
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:33,971
Let's wrap things up and go back to Seoul.

762
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:38,521
- Okay. 
  - Thank you. 

763
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:44,491
Well, the filming...

764
00:52:44,491 --> 00:52:47,421
Is today the last day of it?

765
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:52,151
We're done a day ahead than planned since the script changed.

766
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:56,501
If so, are you all leaving for Seoul?

767
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:57,891
Yes.

768
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:00,531
I'll count on you to wrap things up till the end.

769
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:02,161
Okay.

770
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:12,591
What's this, then?

771
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:15,721
Can I not work this job anymore?

772
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:32,941
Ji Yeong, why the long face?

773
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:35,801
Did you get scolded by the director?

774
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:39,181
What did you do, exactly?

775
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:47,011
No, it's not like that.

776
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:53,991
They're done shooting on the beach now.

777
00:53:53,991 --> 00:53:57,161
They are going back to Seoul.

778
00:53:57,891 --> 00:53:59,601
What?

779
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:04,001
Why did they finish shooting so soon?

780
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:07,281
Grandma, I shouldn't have done this.

781
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:11,231
Thinking I can't be on set anymore

782
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:14,261
makes me feel gutted and...

783
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:17,841
it feels like someone broke my heart.

784
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:21,131
What do I do now?

785
00:54:22,311 --> 00:54:24,811
What do we do?

786
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,841
Ms. Kim, there you were.

787
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:40,261
I came back because I heard you were all going back to Seoul.

788
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,301
Ji Yeong, thank you for everything.

789
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:45,251
You'll receive the payment in your account.

790
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:48,721
Oh, the crew is leaving now.

791
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:51,331
Are you interested in continuing to work with us?

792
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:54,451
We'd like you to join us.

793
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,321
Really?

794
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:03,161
Aigoo, yes...

795
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:06,101
Yes, I'll do it!

796
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:10,821
I'll go anywhere and do anything if you ask me to.

797
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,691
Let me know when you can come to Seoul.

798
00:55:13,691 --> 00:55:15,901
I'll get going now, then, Ma'am.

799
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:19,761
- Yes, yes. Take care! 
 - Take care!

800
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:21,181
Aigoo!

801
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:23,691
I can't believe this!

802
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:27,381
This is so great. Gosh.

803
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:32,541
How come I didn't think of you?

804
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,311
No, Grandma.

805
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:41,731
I won't go. I-I won't go to Seoul.

806
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:44,211
I lost my mind for a second.

807
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:46,901
I won't go to Seoul.

808
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:52,431
Thinking now, that industry is so rough.

809
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:57,031
I'll just sell noodles with you here leisurely instead.

810
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:59,261
Seoul doesn't suit me.

811
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:01,441
I should call the director.

812
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,851
What?

813
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:06,051
What are you saying now?

814
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:11,391
You shed tears saying you wanted that job.

815
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:15,451
Don't worry about me and go to Seoul.

816
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:18,171
I have money.

817
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:23,141
I have money to get you a place, okay?

818
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:27,981
So, go. Go and do what you want to do.

819
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:33,791
It's because you'd be alone here.

820
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,841
How could I leave you here alone?

821
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:43,471
You sometimes sing with a flower in your hair.

822
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:49,631
What if you can't return home while roaming around like that?

823
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:53,631
Why would you worry about that?

824
00:56:53,631 --> 00:56:59,441
The whole neighborhood takes care of me.

825
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:02,181
Even the white pup knows me.

826
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:05,791
And there's Auntie Deok Ja next door, too.

827
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,081
So, don't worry.

828
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:10,311
Go and do whatever you want to do.

829
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:13,051
It's my last wish.

830
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:16,371
Grandma.

831
00:57:19,451 --> 00:57:21,731
Aigoo, aigoo.

832
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:27,641
How could I leave you behind?

833
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:34,291
- I'm back. 
 - Jin Dan, I'm glad you're here.

834
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:38,381
I'm dying worrying about you.

835
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:42,241
Jin Dan, let's visit a psychiatrist together.

836
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:44,411
I'll come with you.

837
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:47,441
What psychiatrist? I'm okay.

838
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:49,211
What do you mean, you're okay?

839
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:51,071
I can tell you aren't acting normal.

840
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,471
You have strange dreams every day, too.

841
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:55,651
I said I'm okay.

842
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:59,121
I feel at ease after going there.

843
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:02,211
I feel like I got things off my chest.

844
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:04,871
- Really? 
 - Yes, really.

845
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:08,521
And I'll get my act together now. Don't worry.

846
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:11,291
- You mean it, right? 
 - I'm telling you.

847
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,881
Mom,

848
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,661
here.

849
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:17,351
What's this?

850
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:21,431
I got you a special gift.

851
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:25,161
You get hurt seriously even when you fall slightly because of your age.

852
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:27,171
You should start taking care of yourself.

853
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,251
I noticed a lot of people take this.

854
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:34,731
Mom, take one of these first.

855
00:58:34,731 --> 00:58:36,211
Here.

856
00:58:42,141 --> 00:58:43,701
Thank you, Son.

857
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:45,961
You're all I have.

858
00:58:45,961 --> 00:58:47,801
I know.

859
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:53,371
 I told you. 

860
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:56,321
 That I'll destroy Park Do Ra's career in this field 

861
00:58:56,321 --> 00:58:58,741
 That I'll destroy Park Do Ra's career in this field 

862
00:58:58,741 --> 00:59:01,251
 That I'll make her disappear forever. 

863
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:04,411
 You made a fool out of me! 

864
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:08,571
 You played with me, Gong Jin Dan! 

865
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:14,231
 Weren't you ready to pay for it when you did all that? 

866
00:59:19,715 --> 00:59:22,225
The one who killed my daughter...

867
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:25,135
It's that bastard, Gong Jin Dan.

868
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:30,435
That disgusting article about her prostitution.

869
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:33,675
That was his doing, too.

870
00:59:36,015 --> 00:59:39,745
My life was ruined like this...

871
00:59:40,595 --> 00:59:44,015
because of that asshole Gong Jin Dan.

872
00:59:45,055 --> 00:59:47,455
You're my enemy.

873
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,435
My enemy.

874
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:06,150
   

875
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:19,175
- Mom! 
 - Do Sik!

876
01:00:19,175 --> 01:00:21,255
Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik!

877
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:24,415
Do Sik! Do Sik! Do Sik!

878
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:27,845
Gosh, you went through a lot, Mom.

879
01:00:27,845 --> 01:00:30,725
Eat this first. You eat tofu when you get out of jail, apparently.

880
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:33,415
Tofu? Hold this.

881
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:36,085
You really have to eat tofu?

882
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:39,175
- Seriously... 
 - Gosh.

883
01:00:43,425 --> 01:00:45,565
Hey, Do Jun...

884
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:47,595
Did you find him?

885
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:51,315
I think he changed his phone number. He can't be reached at all.

886
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,865
That bastard. How could he do this to me?

887
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:58,385
- Did you get me a phone? 
 - Yes.

888
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:05,785
I'll tend to a business. Send me the address here.

889
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:07,045
I'll be there later.

890
01:01:07,045 --> 01:01:09,495
Where are you going? What do you have to do as soon as you get out?

891
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:12,555
You don't have to know. Here, take this.

892
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,825
Where are you going?

893
01:01:16,825 --> 01:01:18,535
 Let go! 

894
01:01:18,535 --> 01:01:20,805
 Tell him that Baek Mi Ja is here! 

895
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:22,885
You can't go in...

896
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:28,845
Long time no see, President Gong.

897
01:01:28,845 --> 01:01:30,765
Have you been well?

898
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:34,015
You destroyed my family.

899
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:37,795
But you're looking great.

900
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:42,055
Secretary Jo, how could you let someone like her in?

901
01:01:42,055 --> 01:01:43,405
I'm sorry.

902
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:45,015
Get out. Get out, please—

903
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:49,195
Let go! Kill me! Kill me!

904
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:54,985
I'll leave as a corpse if I have to! I won't leave! Kill me!

905
01:02:01,035 --> 01:02:03,435
Secretary Jo.

906
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:05,175
Wait outside.

907
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:06,885
Yes, Sir.

908
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:17,215
You should reflect on your actions quietly since you got out.

909
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:19,975
How dare you come here and cause a scene?

910
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:28,255
You're the reason my Do Ra died.

911
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:31,885
If you didn't cancel her commercial contracts,

912
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:35,575
she wouldn't have died, and I wouldn't have been in this mess.

913
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:37,765
That ridiculous article about her prostitution.

914
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:39,545
You were behind that, too.

915
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:43,315
You're a murderer.

916
01:02:44,405 --> 01:02:48,465
Look, lady. Watch your mouth.

917
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:51,075
Why is it my fault that your daughter died?

918
01:02:51,075 --> 01:02:54,005
- Do you have evidence? 
 - Evidence?

919
01:02:54,585 --> 01:02:58,375
You're the only one who could've made her do that. What evidence do I need?

920
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:02,305
You gambled and ruined her life.

921
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:04,565
How dare you blabber your mouth at me?

922
01:03:04,565 --> 01:03:10,555
My Do Ra wouldn't have died if it wasn't for that disgusting article.

923
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:14,415
It was you.

924
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:18,785
Compensate me for killing my daughter and ruining my life.

925
01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:20,755
Compensate with money.

926
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:24,725
What? You should be compensating me!

927
01:03:24,725 --> 01:03:27,045
You and your daughter played me.

928
01:03:27,045 --> 01:03:28,965
How dare you demand compensation?

929
01:03:28,965 --> 01:03:31,795
Secretary Jo! Secretary Jo!

930
01:03:31,795 --> 01:03:33,365
Yes, Sir.

931
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:36,885
Get this crazy woman out of here immediately.

932
01:03:36,885 --> 01:03:40,015
Call the security guard and kick her out.

933
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:43,375
If you let this woman in again,

934
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:46,385
you'd be done for, too, Secretary Jo.

935
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:48,265
- Hurry! 
 - Okay.

936
01:03:48,265 --> 01:03:50,315
- Get out, Ahjumma.
 - You!

937
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:52,165
I won't just leave you be.

938
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:55,155
You'll die, and I'll die.

939
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:59,555
Bring my Do Ra back to life!

940
01:03:59,555 --> 01:04:03,160
Bring my Do Ra back!

941
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:10,390


942
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:15,030
   

943
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,030
   

944
01:04:22,795 --> 01:04:27,455
My goodness... so this is the broadcasting station.

945
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:31,415
Can't believe I'd be working somewhere so impressive.

946
01:04:31,415 --> 01:04:34,475
Am I dreaming right now?

947
01:04:35,655 --> 01:04:37,835
No, no.

948
01:04:37,835 --> 01:04:42,475
I need to act elegantly since I'm in Seoul.

949
01:04:42,475 --> 01:04:46,045
The elegant Ms. Kim Ji Yeong.

950
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:49,705
Ms. Kim, did you just get here?

951
01:04:49,705 --> 01:04:53,825
Well, yes. I just got here, Assistant Director.

952
01:04:53,825 --> 01:04:55,715
We're having a meeting now. Join us.

953
01:04:55,715 --> 01:04:58,105
The entire staff is here. This way.

954
01:04:58,105 --> 01:04:59,675
Okay.

955
01:05:01,225 --> 01:05:03,735
Director, Ms. Kim is here.

956
01:05:03,735 --> 01:05:06,435
Oh, welcome.

957
01:05:09,725 --> 01:05:11,875
Hello.

958
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:16,925
I'm Kim Ji Yeong, and I'll be working here starting today.

959
01:05:18,565 --> 01:05:20,865
I'm in your care....

960
01:05:22,105 --> 01:05:23,645
Sir.

961
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:33,555
   

962
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:41,345
♫  Saturday afternoon  ♫

963
01:05:41,345 --> 01:05:51,105
♫  Don't hesitate like that and try dancing with me  ♫

964
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:57,455
♫  I don't want to have a tiring talk today  ♫

965
01:05:57,455 --> 01:06:02,655
♫  Try dancing with me  ♫

966
01:06:05,585 --> 01:06:09,705
 I'm a woman who works for a broadcasting station, Grandma. 

967
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:13,355
 I heard the student who signed the lease for the spare room can't move in. 

968
01:06:13,355 --> 01:06:15,805
 There's no place for me to live in Seoul. 

969
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,945
 There's a place I know. Do you want to check it out? 

970
01:06:17,945 --> 01:06:20,925
 I heard Park Do Ra's body hasn't been found yet. 

971
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:23,415
 Maybe she's living in a recluse somewhere. 

972
01:06:23,415 --> 01:06:26,915
 Did Park Do Ra really die after getting caught prostituting 

973
01:06:26,915 --> 01:06:28,695
 because of her mom's gambling debt? 

974
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:30,705
 How dare you say that when you know nothing? 

975
01:06:30,705 --> 01:06:33,735
 "Straightforward Romance." I don't think I've watched this. 

976
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:38,175
 The title is speaking to my heart somehow.
